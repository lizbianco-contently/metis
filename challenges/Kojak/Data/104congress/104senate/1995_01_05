The rule \nregarding the right to extended debate can be a two-edge sword at \ntimes, and I do not believe it should be changed.\n  But, in my judgment, the Senate is a deliberative body and the Senate \nought not just be a smaller House of Representatives. I think that the \npresent rules are operating effectively. I add my voice to those that \nare advocating that we continue with the present rule that we have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S430-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S430-S439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AMENDING PARAGRAPH 2 OF RULE XXV\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour of \n10:15 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nSenate Resolution 14, which the clerk will report\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 14) amending paragraph 2 of rule XXV.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n\n       Pending: Harkin amendment No. 1, to amend the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate to permit cloture to be invoked by a \n     decreasing majority vote of Senators down to a majority of \n     all Senators duly chosen and sworn.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 1\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I understand we are \nunder a time limit. Could the Chair inform the Senator what the time \nelements are right now that we are under?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time on the Harkin amendment shall be \ndivided, with 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd] and 45 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom Iowa [Mr. Harkin].\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, continuing the debate we had last night and to inform \nSenators who may not have been here and who were attending receptions \nfor newly elected Senators, et cetera, I understand that, but let me \nbring Senators and their staffs up to date as to where we are.\n  At 11:30 today, if I am not mistaken, we will have a vote, I \nunderstand a tabling motion, made by the majority leader to table the \namendment that Senator Lieberman, Senator Robb, Senator Pell, and I \noffered yesterday to change the cloture rule, rule XXII. Our amendment \nwould change rule XXII to provide for a new procedure for ending \nfilibusters in the U.S. Senate.\n  We did not throw out the filibuster completely, but our amendment \nmakes a very modest approach toward ending the gridlock that has \ngripped this place over the last several years and is increasing in \nintensity in gridlock in this place.\n  But our proposal says--and let me make it very clear what our \nproposal or our amendment says--that on the first cloture vote you need \n60 votes to end debate. Then, if you do not get the 60 votes, you can \nfile another cloture motion. You have to wait 2 more days, you have \nanother vote. Then you need 57 votes to end cloture. If you do not get \nit, you can file another cloture motion--again you need the 16 \nsignatures to do that--wait 2 more days and then you get another vote \nand then you need 54 votes to end debate. If you do not get that, you \ncan file one more cloture motion, wait 2 more days, and then you need \n51 votes to get cloture and move to the merits of a bill.\n  Utilizing the different steps along the way, this would provide that, \nto get to the merits of a bill, a determined minority of the Senate who \nwanted to filibuster could slow it down for 19 days, 19 legislative \ndays, which would be about a month. That is just getting to the bill.\n  There are other hurdles as a bill goes through the Senate. In fact \nthere are six. There is the motion to proceed, there is the bill \nitself, there is the appointment of conferees, insisting on Senate \namendments, disagreeing with the House, and then there is the \nconference report. So there are a minimum of six hurdles. That is not \ncounting amendments.\n  Of course, when a bill comes to the floor someone could offer an \namendment and that amendment can be filibustered. All we are saying is \nthat in that first initial time you need 19 days. If you added up all \nthe hurdles under our proposal you could slow a bill down for a minimum \nof 57 days, 57 legislative days.\n That would translate into about 3 months. So it is a modest proposal. \nWe are not saying get rid of the filibuster, but we are saying at some \npoint in time a majority of the Senate ought to be able to end debate \nand get to the merits of the legislation.\n\n  A distinguished group of American independents, Republicans and \nDemocrats, formed a group called ``Action Not Gridlock.'' Former \nSenator Mac \n[[Page S431]] Mathias, Republican, was on the board. Former Senator \nGoldwater, former Gov. Robert Ray of Iowa among Republicans; there are \ndistinguished Democrats on it; also, independents. They commissioned a \npoll last summer that showed that 80 percent of independents, 74 \npercent of Democrats, and 79 percent of Republicans said that when \nenough time was consumed in debate, that after debate a majority ought \nto be able to get the bill to the floor. That a majority ought to be \nable, at some point, to end the debate.\n  So, the American people want this. They want us to get away from \ngridlock.\n  Let me show again the Senators what I am talking about in terms of \ngridlock what has happened in the last two sessions of Congress. We can \nsee the use of filibuster going back to 1917 and going up here to 1994. \nIn the last session of Congress, we had twice as many filibusters as we \nhad just from 1981 to 1986, the last time Republicans were in charge of \nthe Senate. We had 10 times more filibusters in the last Congress than \nwe did in the entire years from 1789 to 1960. Add up all those years, \nwe had 10 times more filibusters in the last Congress than we did in \nall those years. I am saying 10 times more in the Congress, on an \naverage in Congress, than we did in the years during that period of \ntime.\n  Prof. Bruce Oppenheimer, from the University of Houston, wrote an \narticle in 1985, I believe it was, about Congress reconsidered. He made \nan important point. Let me read from Professor Oppenheimer's treatise. \nHe said,\n\n       Congress in the late 20th century is under more severe time \n     constraints than at any point in its history. Pressures in \n     the political and social environment have periodically forced \n     Congress to deal with problems of time.\n\n  For example, in the early part of the 19th century most Members of \nCongress were not full-time politicians. They could not stay in \nCongress for large stretches of time. Crops needed planting and \nharvesting, small businesses required regular attention. Transportation \nwas slow and arduous. But what has happened now, as Professor \nOppenheimer has pointed out, is that the time pressures on Congress \nhave increased precipitously. And because of the increased workload of \nCongress there is more time pressure and, therefore, the power of one \nSenator to threaten to filibuster is increased. I think Senators ought \nto keep that in mind.\n  So what we have is a situation where in the 103d Congress we had 32 \nfilibusters, twice as many as we had in the entire 19th century. Not so \nmuch because more Senators are using the filibuster. It is because a \nhandful of Senators understand that one Senator, because of the \nincreased time pressures here, one Senator threatening a filibuster can \nhold this place up. And thus we have had gridlock.\n  I think, Mr. President, that it is important or at least noteworthy, \nlet me put it that way, it is noteworthy that the first vote of this \nnew Congress in the Senate will be a vote on whether we slay this \ndinosaur called a filibuster. It will be our first vote. It will take \nplace at 11:30, a little over an hour from now. Will we heed what the \nvoters have said, that they want this place to change? That they want \nus to be more productive. Or is it going to be ``business as usual?'' \nStick with a filibuster.\n  You know the very word ``filibuster'' conjures up images of the past, \nhorses and buggies, outdoor privies, lamplighters. The very word itself \nconjures up the 18th and 19th century. So, the first vote of this \nsession, are we for change? Or are we for the status quo? Did we get \nthe message in the election? Or are we going to give the American \npeople more of the same of what they had over the last several years?\n  Senators hold the key to gridlock. One hundred Senators here at 11:30 \nhold the key to gridlock. Now is a chance to use this key to open the \ndoor to fresh ideas and to a new approach.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this could be one \nof the most productive sessions of the Senate in recent history. I may \nnot agree with everything that Republicans are proposing, but they are \nin the majority and they ought to have the right to have us vote on the \nmerits of what they propose.\n  Now, as a member of the minority I ought to have the right to debate. \nI have the unrestrained right of amendment; Nongermane amendments. You \nwill hear a lot of talk about we do not want this body to become like \nthe House. No, I do not either. You will hear about protections for \nminorities. And for small States and things like that. Those \nprotections are written into the Constitution of the United States and \ncannot be taken away but by constitutional amendment. We have the right \nof unfettered debate in the Senate. We have the right to amend with \nnongermane amendments. We do not have a rules committee that tells us \nwhat we can offer and what we cannot offer. This gives the protections \nto the minority. And, yes, the right to slow things down. I want that \nright as a minority. I want to be able to slow down things if I think \nthey are going too fast or going in the wrong direction. But, I do not \nbelieve that I as a member of the minority ought to have the right to \nabsolutely stop something because I think it is wrong, that that is \nrule by minority.\n  Well, I just say if we do not use this key that we have, this key to \nopen the door to get rid of the filibuster, if we do not, I can assure \nSenators and I can assure the American public that this trend in the \nuse of filibuster is going to continue. This line next time will be \neven higher. I can assure you that will happen unless we get rid of the \nfilibuster. If we maintain the filibuster, the American people will \nlook to the Senate and say ``We elected a bunch of new Senators but \n`business as usual.'''\n  Maybe I might just give a fair warning to my friends on the other \nside of the aisle. I think the American people were fed up with the way \nthis place was operating. If they see it as ``business as usual'' and \nwe continue this filibuster, my fair warning to my friends on the other \nside, 2 years from now it could be the other way around.\n  I know it is a tough vote. It will be a tough vote for Senators to \ncome here and to vote to give up a little bit of their personal power, \ntheir personal privileges that they have here. I mean, I have a lot of \npower. One Senator has a lot of power under the present filibuster \nrules. I think for the good of this institution and for the good of \nthis country we have to give up a little bit of our privilege and a \nlittle bit of our personal power for the good of this country. I do not \nblame Republicans for using the rules as they did last time. They used \nit fairly.\n  They used the rule that exists to stop legislation that they \nconsidered bad. Again, I do not know that that is the proper procedure \nfor us. We have protections for the minority. As the USA Today \neditorial pointed out, the Constitution of the United States divides \npowers, provides for the separation of powers, splitting Congress into \ntwo parts and dividing Government among three branches, guaranteeing \nbasic rights in the Constitution. We have those that protects the \nminority.\n  But I will close with my opening remarks, with this quote:\n\n       It is one thing to provide protection against majoritarian \n     absolutism; it is another thing again to enable a vexatious \n     or unreasoning minority to paralyze the Senate and America's \n     legislative process along with it.\n\n  I could not have said it better, and it was said by Senator Robert \nDole, February 10, 1971.\n  If Senator Dole thought the filibuster was bad in 1971, certainly \nwhen we are down here, the filibuster has increased at least threefold \non an annual basis since then. So it is time to get rid of this \ndinosaur. It is time to move ahead with the people's business in a \nproductive manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I retain the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Iowa is a man \nof whom I am very fond. I admire him greatly. I admire his spunk, his \ncourage, his tenacity, his determination to do what he thinks is the \nright thing. He serves on the Appropriations Committee with me and is a \nfine member of that committee and an excellent chairman of a \nsubcommittee, but he is wrong in this instance.\n  He refers to the matter of unlimited debate as a dinosaur. He refers \nto unlimited debate as a dinosaur. He calls \n[[Page S432]] the filibuster a dinosaur and has introduced a measure \nnow that will kill this dinosaur. Mr. President, what he is doing here \nis, he is bringing a sledge hammer into the Chamber to kill a beetle--a \nbeetle--not a dinosaur.\n  I note the presence on the floor of our colleague who is also a \ncosponsor of the resolution, the Senator from Connecticut. Does he wish \nto speak at this point? I would be happy to yield the floor for now.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia. I would be most happy to listen to him for a while. I \nthank him very much for his courtesy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, freedom of speech is of ancient origin. The \nSenators in the Roman Republic exercised freedom of speech. There were \nno inhibitions on the freedom of speech. The same thing was true with \nrespect to the members of Parliament. Henry IV, who reigned from 1399 \nto 1413, publicly declared that the Commons and the Lords should have \nfreedom of speech. There would be no inhibitions on their right to \nspeak freely or to be questioned concerning their speeches.\n  In 1689, when the Commons designated William III of Orange and Mary \nas joint sovereigns, the Commons first extracted from William and Mary \nassurance that they, William III and Mary, would agree to a Declaration \nof Rights, to which they did agree. And then, in December of 1689, that \nDeclaration of Rights was put in the form of legislation, and it has \nsince been known as the English Bill of Rights.\n  In that English Bill of Rights, freedom to speak in Parliament was \nassured, and no member of Commons or the Lords could have his speech \nquestioned or challenged in any place, I believe the words are, ``out \nof Parliament.'' In that English Bill of Rights, there is that \nguaranteed protection of freedom of speech. It is found in article 9 of \nthe English Bill of Rights, and our forefathers copied that language \nalmost word for word as it appears in section 6 of article I of the \nUnited States Constitution.\n  So there is the evidence from ancient times of the desire of free men \nand the needs of free men to be able to speak freely.\n  There were early examples of extended debate, unlimited debate, the \nso-called filibuster, the ``dinosaur.'' Cato utilized this dinosaur in \nthe year 60 B.C. to prevent Caesar from having his way. Caesar wanted \nto stand as a candidate for consul. He had to be in Rome, the city \nitself, in order to stand as a candidate. But he was not in the city. \nHe also wanted to be awarded a triumph. He had to be outside the city \nand come into the city for a triumph. So Caesar's friends in the Senate \noffered legislation to allow Caesar to stand for consul, the office of \nconsul, while absent from Rome.\n  Cato frustrated the friends of Caesar by filibustering. The Roman \nSenate adjourned at sunset each day, and Cato used the time --this is \nCato II, Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis who committed suicide in the \nyear 46 B.C. after Caesar won the battle of Thapsus.\n  Cato committed suicide because he knew that Caesar was coming to \nUtica. Cato urged the officers and other people in the military to \nflee, and he offered to give them the money so that they might leave \nUtica before Caesar arrived. He advised his own son to go to Caesar and \nto surrender to Caesar, but Cato did not take his own advice. He stayed \nin Utica and committed suicide in 46 B.C.\n  But in 60 B.C., Cato spoke at length in the Roman Senate to spin out \nthe day, and he defeated the designs of Caesar's friends by the use of \na filibuster. So we have a successful filibuster in the Roman Senate \n2,055 years ago. I have not yet read that anybody arose on the Senate \nfloor on that occasion to accuse Cato of resorting to a dinosaurian \naction to frustrate the wishes of Caesar and the designs of his friends \nin the Senate.\n  Unlimited debate--the filibuster--is of ancient origin.\n  Well, the distinguished Senator from Iowa says, ``I cannot find it in \nmy Constitution that we must have unlimited debate in the Senate.'' I \ndo not find it either. But we will find in this Constitution that each \nHouse may determine the rules of its own proceedings.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Might I ask an inquiry on that one point?\n  Mr. BYRD. Why, yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Because it is an important point the Senator raises. It \nraises a question----\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator speak on his own time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will speak on my own time to propound \nthe question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Except for the question. He may ask me a question. If he \nwants to make a statement, I hope he will make it on his own time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wish to propound a question.\n  Under the Constitution then, under the clause that each body can \nestablish its own rules, inquiry: Can the Senate establish a rule that \nis clearly in contradiction to the Constitution of the United States?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senate has not established a rule that is clearly in \ncontradiction to the Constitution of the United States. Senators have \nhad the liberty of unlimited debate in the Senate since 1806. In 1806, \nthe rules were codified. Originally, in the Continental Congress, there \nwas the previous question, and the previous question was provided in \nthe original rules of the Senate up until 1806, at which time the rules \nwere codified, and that provision for the previous question, which was \nto shut off debate, was dropped from the rules, in 1806. So we have had \nunlimited debate in the Senate a long time.\n  Aaron Burr, in 1805, when he left the Senate after presiding over the \nimpeachment trial of Samuel Chase, urged the Senate to ``discard''--I \nbelieve he used the word ``discard''--the previous question.\n  Therefore, for almost 200 years now, the Senate has been without the \nprevious question, which cuts off debate. The Senate is to determine \nits own rules, and in being the judge of its own rules it elected to \ndispose, get rid of, the previous question. The House of \nRepresentatives has the previous question, but the Senate does not. \nThat was the judgment of the Senate. It has a right to make that \njudgment under the Constitution, and the Senate does not have the \nprevious question today. Henry Clay wanted to bring back the previous \nquestion. Stephen A. Douglas wanted to bring back the previous \nquestion, but it was a very unpopular proposal among Senators.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia has \nused 14 minutes of his time and has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder \nof my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa has 28 \nminutes remaining of his time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Iowa and rise to \ncongratulate him for his determination and consistency in tackling the \nthorny problem of reform of the Senate cloture rule.\n  I do so from the vantage point of 34 years in this body, during all \nof which I have supported cloture motions with but two exceptions: One \ninvolving debate on United States policy toward South Africa and the \nother legislative reapportionment.\n  I believe it apparent that rule XXII as it now stands has not served \nthe Nation well, nor does it place this institution in a favorable \nlight in the eyes of our people. Time after time in recent years, and \nwith increasing frequency, two-fifths of the Senate, not a majority, \ndetermined the outcome of many of the issues before us.\n  Now the Senator from Iowa puts before us a proposed rule change which \nis ingenious and accommodating. It allows the advocates of cloture to \nkeep trying to close debate at progressively lower thresholds, starting \nat three-fifths and gradually reducing it through four steps to a \nsimple majority. Debate could continue for up to 13 days until that \nlowest threshold is reached, and even then, of course, the majority \ncould still decline to invoke cloture.\n  It seems to me this is a reasonable proposal and one which would, I \nbelieve, provide ample opportunity to colleagues on this side of the \naisle to \n[[Page S433]] protect our interests in our new-found minority status.\n  So I hope the Senate will give serious and thoughtful consideration \nto the proposal of the Senator from Iowa and not reject it out of hand. \nIt goes to the heart of what people expect of this body and should be \ntreated accordingly. I might add in that connection that if we are \nunable to reach consensus on reform of our own rules to allow the \nmajority to prevail, the larger constitutional issue of majority rule \nmay need to be addressed.\n  For the moment, I trust we give full and fair consideration as we \nconsider Senator Harkin's creative effort to change rule XXII.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa has 25 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIowa, and I thank the Chair.\n  I am very privileged to be a cosponsor with the Senator from Iowa of \nthis amendment, and I congratulate him on his willingness to charge the \nfortress here, to try to remove one of the hurdles to this being a \ntruly representative and productive body.\n  The filibuster may have made some sense at one point; it may have \nbeen a reasonable idea, but it in fact has been badly misused in our \ntime. You can pick your favorite statistic, but the one that I saw a \nwhile ago was that there were more filibusters in the last session of \nthe Senate than in the first 108 years combined. Others will tell you \nthere have been more since 1990 than the preceding 140 years combined.\n  Whatever the years, it is pretty obvious we have come to a point in \nthe history of this Chamber where the filibuster, the ability of one \nMember to stand up and stop the body from functioning effectively and \nto block the will of the majority, is a contributor to gridlock and to \nour inability to produce and, therefore, to public frustration which is \nin the air and we are attempting as best we can to respond to them.\n  The other body in its wisdom took some steps yesterday that I think \nare reflective of that mood and responding to it, and there are many \nthings we can do in this Chamber along with those that were done \nyesterday in the other body. I think one of the most important is to \nalter the current rules of debate so far as they allow a single Senator \nor, in the synthetic filibusters, not the real filibusters that we have \nhad in our time, allow a minority to threaten to debate interminably \nand by that means to block the majority from working its will.\n  I have just enormous respect for the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia and, as I said in the Chamber last night, he is clearly the \nexpert in this Chamber on the rules of the body and not only knows the \nrules of the body but knows from whence they come, their history, so \nwhen I speak in opposition to his position I do so with some humility \nand respect.\n  I would say on the question of the derivation of freedom of speech \nback to earlier times, English precedents or Roman precedents, and \ndeveloping as it has in our time in the speech and debate clause in the \nConstitution, that I would respectfully offer this thought: That the \nConstitution and the great freedoms that it gives our people as they \nhave been interpreted by the Supreme Court over the history of America, \nall have been at one point or another limited. In other words, we are \ngiven individual freedom, which is at the heart of what it means to be \nan American, by the Constitution, by the community. Although, of \ncourse, many of us feel that the ultimate source of our individual \nfreedom goes beyond the community, beyond the Constitution, to our \nCreator, and I believe that the Founders and Framers very much were \nmotivated by that religious impulse and that theological view of human \nnature.\n  But my point is this. Over our history, every right, including the \nsacred and fundamental right of free speech, has occasionally been \nlimited because it was thought that its unlimited exercise threatened \nthe safety and well-being, perhaps even the continuity and the survival \nof the community. Of course, there is the classic and perhaps limited \nexpression, but it is a popular one, that you do not have the right to \nrise in a crowded theater and shout ``fire'' when there is no fire and \ncreate a pandemonium, a bedlam. And the limits go on and on: those that \nrelate to libel and slander; the ways in which the Supreme Court, for \ninstance, has wrestled with questions of obscenity, when is freedom of \nspeech so offensive to the community that it threatens some of the \nfundamental values of the community?\n  This right of unlimited speech for Members of the Senate in the \nparticular context of our rules, it seems to me, requires at this \npoint, based on what we have experienced, limitations. Because the \nability of an individual Senator to stop the process, the capacity of a \nminority to make it impossible for a majority to work its will and \nrepresent the majority of constituents back home, has come to a point \nwhere it has too often threatened the ability of this Chamber to \nfunction, to represent, to lead, to be truly deliberative in the sense \nthat we mean it.\n  In its misuse the filibuster has also, I think, threatened not only \nthe productivity and credibility of the U.S. Senate, but has \ncontradicted some of the basic principles of our Government as \nexpressed by the Framers of the Constitution. And one is this \nfundamental question of majority rule. It seems to me as I read the \nFederalist Papers and look at the Constitution that as concerned as the \nFramers were about individual rights and protection of the minority, \nthey made a clear decision, which was that the Congress--and let me be \nmore specific, that the Senate--was to be a majoritarian body; that the \nmajority would rule; that there were other protections in the system \nfor the minority. One was what we referred to as the republican form of \ngovernment--small ``r''--which is to say the various checks and \nbalances built into the system, the requirement in our system, to adopt \na law, of the support of the Senate, the House, and the signature of \nthe President.\n  Ultimately, if the minority rights were still threatened, an \nindividual could go to court, and over our history it has been clear \nthat the courts interpreting the Constitution have been there to \nprotect the minority. But this was to be a majoritarian body. And this \nfilibuster has turned that, in my opinion, upside down and allowed the \nminority to rule. Some who support the status quo on the filibuster say \nthat it is there to protect the rights of the minority. But what about \nthe rights of the majority? Some say that there is a danger of a \ntyranny of the majority. I say that there is a danger inherent in the \ncurrent procedure of a tyranny of the minority over the majority, \ninconsistent with the intention of the Framers of the Constitution.\n  It is inconsistent in another specific way with the Constitution, and \nI will mention this briefly because it has been mentioned before. The \nConstitution states only five specific cases in which there is a \nrequirement for more than a majority to work the will of this body: \nRatification of a treaty, override of a Presidential veto, impeachment, \nadoption of a constitutional amendment, and expulsion of a Member of \nCongress. In fact, the Framers of the Constitution considered other \ncases in which a supermajority might have been required and rejected \nthem. And we by our rules have effectively amended the Constitution--\nwhich I believe, respectfully, is not right--and added the opportunity \nof any Member or a minority of Members to require 60 votes to pass \nalmost any controversial bill in this Chamber.\n  It is wrong. It has also made this a less accountable body. And I \nthink accountability of elected officials is at the heart of democracy \nand all we stand for. It is less accountable in two ways. One, when we \nare allowed to defeat a measure on a procedural vote such as a \nfilibuster, it cloaks us from having to stand up and vote on the \nmerits, on the bill itself, and therefore, to some extent, it muddles \nour accountability and the record that we take back to our \nconstituents.\n  Second, in another sense it makes it hard on the majority and those \nof us on this side of the aisle--and the majority \n[[Page S434]] I am speaking of here is in a more partisan sense--those \nof us on the Democratic side experienced this over the last couple of \nyears. Clearly not all the filibusters have been partisan. The \nopposition to the procedure is bipartisan and so is the support. But in \na strict political partisan sense, it is hard for a majority to be held \naccountable fairly to the public if a minority, a party, for instance, \ncan block the majority from attempting to work its will, from \nattempting to pass its program, and then, unfairly in some cases, the \nmajority may be held accountable for that failure even though it was \nthe minority who blocked action by filibustering that resulted in the \nfailure to produce.\n  A lot of Democrats may have been held accountable for that on \nelection day, November 8, 1994. But the wheel of history has turned and \nthe majority is now on the other side of the aisle. Though it might \nseem inviting for Democrats to use the filibuster to confuse and \nfrustrate the will of the majority here, it is not fair. The majority \nought to have the opportunity to try to pass its program or be held \naccountable for it. And this filibuster frustrates that opportunity.\n  So, Mr. President, I understand, and the Senator from Iowa \nunderstands, that we are fighting upstream in this effort. But it is an \neffort that I think is at the heart of congressional reform, at the \ncenter of responding to the public frustration and the drop in respect \nfor this Congress of ours which is so central to the relationship that \nthose who govern have with those who are governed. When that trust is \ngone our democracy is in trouble. I think this is the time to begin to \nchallenge this procedure. History shows us that on the other occasions \nwhen the filibuster rule has been changed, it generally was not changed \non the first try. The Senator from Iowa and I would be pleasantly \nsurprised if that were not the case today, but it probably will be the \ncase. But I know he feels strongly, as I do, that we should continue \nthis effort to work with our colleagues to see if we cannot find ways \nthat will achieve adequate support to bring about a change in the \nexisting filibuster procedure.\n  Again, I express my great admiration for the Senator from Iowa for \ntaking this on. It is not an easy battle. It is not a popular battle. \nBut it is the right fight to make and it is my privilege to be marching \narm and arm with him on this one. I hope that when the vote is taken, \nwe will be surprised, and I hope particularly that the support for our \namendment is across party lines. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership, for yielding his time to me, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  I repeat what I said last night, that we are delighted to have him \nback for another 6 years. There is one thing that marked the first 6 \nyears here of the Senator from Connecticut, and that was his unending \neffort to make this place operate better, more openly, and to really \nmake the Senate reflect the true will of the people. He has continued \nthat effort today. I am proud to have him beside me in this battle. I \nthank him.\n  Mr. President, I came across this article called ``Renewing \nCongress.'' I thought it would be appropriate for me to bring it to the \nSenate's attention. Some people may view this as a liberal-conservative \nissue. I do not believe it is, in any way. But I wanted to point out \nthat Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, which I \nthink I can rightfully say is the more conservative think tank here in \nWashington, along with Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution, which \nis more of a liberal organization, I guess you might say, put out this \nbook earlier this year called ``Renewing Congress.'' I thought I would \njust read the part in it that they had regarding the filibuster:\n\n       We believe much tougher steps are needed to prevent the \n     abuse of holds and filibusters. The recent emergence of a \n     partisan filibuster unprecedented in Senate history has made \n     a bad situation even worse. We recommend two steps to deal \n     with this problem. First, the Senate should return the \n     filibuster to its classic model, with individual Senators \n     required to engage in continuous debate day and night while \n     all other business is put on hold. Second, the Senate should \n     look hard at adopting a sliding scale for cloture votes, 60 \n     votes required to cut off debate initially, 55 votes after a \n     week of debate, and a simple majority 2 weeks after the \n     initial cloture vote. This sliding scale could be applied to \n     all filibusters.\n\n  Again, I just want to point out to Senators this is the view of \nNorman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my friends and others have stated that there \nare only five instances, in the Constitution, of reference to a \nsupermajority. I call their attention to amendment 12 of the \nConstitution, which provides that in the election of a President by the \nHouse of Representatives, a quorum of Members must consist of two-\nthirds of the States; Members from two-thirds of the States. Also, in \nthe election of a Vice President by the Senate, under amendment 12 to \nthe United States Constitution, there must be two-thirds of the States \nrepresented to constitute a quorum in the Senate for that purpose.\n  So there are more instances of required supermajorities than five.\n  My time is limited. Let me yield 5 minutes to Mr. Reid, who wishes to \nspeak, and then I will use the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the chairman very much\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I represent a State that is very large in \narea but small in numbers of people. The State of Nevada until recent \nyears was a State that had very, very few people. We have had rapid \ngrowth in southern Nevada in recent years, and now we have many more \npeople residing in the State of Nevada. But it is still a very small \nState in the numbers of people. During the last century, the State of \nNevada had so few people in it that there was talk in this Chamber \nabout doing away with the State of Nevada, there were so few people in \nit.\n  Mr. President, during those years a Senator from the State of Nevada \nhad the same power as a Senator from the very populus State of New \nYork. The Founding Fathers in their wisdom set up this Government so \nthat a State like Nevada, a State like Alaska, a State like Vermont, \nhaving few people, would still have the ability to represent the people \nin that State on the same basis as those States that had large numbers \nof people.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Founding Fathers were right. The \npower of the filibuster, even though it, in my opinion, has been abused \nin recent years, allows Senators representing lightly populated States \nto enjoy the same voting strength as other States. I have done it on \none occasion in this Chamber. I was in my first year in the Senate and \nthere was an issue that came up that was important to the State of \nNevada, and I spoke on this floor for a long time. I was told that I \nhold the record for speaking longer on a filibuster than any first-year \nSenator. I am proud of the fact I did that, because it was an issue \nthat mattered greatly to the people of Nevada.\n  So I approach this issue not on numbers of how many times there has \nbeen a filibuster; I approach it on the basis of the effort made by my \ngood friends, Senator Lieberman and Senator Harkin. You can say \nanything you want to about it, but it is the end of the filibuster \nbecause any leader knows that he could schedule four votes, and on the \nfourth vote the filibuster would be over.\n  Mr. President, I speak as a Senator from the State of Nevada. I \nbelieve that the Founding Fathers were right in setting up the \nConstitution in the manner in which they did. I believe that if we are \ngoing to have the legislative form of Government that they set up, we \ndo need to protect the integrity of States that are small in population \nlike the State of Nevada.\n  So I want Members of this body to know that I will exercise my right \nas a Senator from the State of Nevada to speak as long as I can if, in \nfact, the \n[[Page S435]] motion to table does not prevail because any State that \nis small in numbers should be on this floor protecting their individual \nStates.\n  Changes in the Senate rules that allows this institution to operate \nmore efficiently are welcome; however, the full-scale elimination of \none of the most sacred rules of the Senate--the fulibuster--will not \nresult in a more efficient Senate. In fact, it has the potential to \nresult in the tyranny of the majority.\n  I do not support the patently abusive use of the filibuster that we \nsaw last session. There were many instances of overwhelmingly supported \nlegislation being killed because of partisan use of the filibuster. \nThere is no doubt that this contributed to much of the gridlock we \nwitnessed in the 103d Congress.\n  Few would argue that we saw the death of legislation that would have \nsignificantly improved the credibility of this body. The elimination of \nlobbyist gift giving and campaign finance reform are just a couple of \nexamples of legislation that perished because of spurious use of the \nfilibuster.\n  Those who chose to invoke the filibuster for partisan dilatory \npurposes were responsible for grinding Senate business to a halt. The \nnumbers cited earlier by the Senator from Iowa--32 filibusters in the \n103d Congress compared to a total of 16 in the entire 19th century--\nevidences its abuse by an obstinate partisan minority.\n  Having said all that, however, I do not support the elimination of \nthe privilege. I say privilege because that is what I believe the \nfilibuster to be. A unique privilege--to be used sparingly and only in \nthose instances when a Member believes the legislation involves the \ngravest concerns to his or her constituents.\n  It is a unique privilege which distinguishes the intentionally \ndeliberative operations of the Senate from the often passionate, \nbullish operation of the House. It is a unique privilege that serves to \naid small States from being trampled by the desires of larger States. \nIndeed, I view the use of the filibuster as a shield, rather than a \nsword. Invoked to protect rights, not to suppress them.\n  In the House, the State of California has 52 Members in its \ndelegation. My State, Nevada, has two Members. If California wants to \nroll Nevada in the House on a particular piece of legislation, that is \ntheir prerogative. But when that legislation makes it way to the \nSenate, one State will not be able to roll another simply by virtue of \nits size. In the Senate, we are all equal, regardless of which State we \nrepresent.\n  The people of Nevada know that in the Senate, Nevada stands on equal \nfooting with the State of California and the State of Texas. They know \nthat as long as I am here in the Senate, I will fight to protect their \ninterests. And, because of the filibuster, they know I will be fighting \non a level playing field\n  They know that when legislation that would result in a deleterious \nimpact on the State of Nevada is steamrolled out of the House, I will \ndo what is necessary to shield them from the enactment of this \nlegislation. And, if this means invoking my rights as a Senator to \nengage in a protracted debate, I will--after careful deliberation--do \nso.\n  I would never allow the interests of Nevadans to be trampled simply \nbecause of the size of our State.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to respond to my friend from Nevada \nin two ways.\n  First of all, when he talks about our Founding Fathers, the Senator \nfrom Iowa is referring to James Madison.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this time will be charged against Mr. \nHarkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I was recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. James Madison, in Federalist No. 58--I just want to read \nit. I will give the Senator a copy.\n\n       If more than a majority were required for a decision, the \n     fundamental principle of free government would be reversed. \n     It would be no longer the majority that would rule. The power \n     would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  The Senator from Nevada talks about small States. I represent a \npretty small State. The Senator from Rhode Island, who spoke earlier, \nwho is a cosponsor of this amendment, represents a State with two \nCongressmen per State, like other States. As he pointed out, in his 34 \nyears here, he has never voted to sustain a filibuster. He has voted \nconsistently for cloture to end debate.\n  Yet, I believe that the Senator has represented his State well. I \nbelieve that Rhode Island has not been the worse for that. Quite \nfrankly, I think they have prospered because of the representation of \nSenator Pell.\n  The Constitution of the United States set up mechanisms to protect \nour small States--divided Government, checks and balances, vetoes, and \nyes, we have the right in the Senate to amend, to offer amendments.\n  The Senator from West Virginia has more than once mentioned the \nBritish Bill of Rights and about how no Member of Parliament is to be \nquestioned in any other forum or speech or debate held on the floor of \nParliament or in the House floors. That was adopted in our \nConstitution, article I, section 6. It is called the speech and debate \nclause.\n  I think maybe the Senator from West Virginia is confusing the speech \nand debate clause with unlimited debate. No one is challenging the \nspeech and debate clause. No one is challenging the right of Senators \nto speak freely under article I, section 6.\n  So nowhere in the Constitution does it say they can speak forever. I \nalso point out that even under the British Bill of Rights of 1689, \nthere was still the previous question that the British have to end \ndebate and move to the merits of legislation. I do not think we ought \nto confuse article I, section 6 with a Senate rule adopted in 1917 \nregarding cloture.\n  So I want to respond to the Senator from Nevada that I understand he \nwants to protect his State, and he should, and he has done a darn good \njob of it, I might add. But there are other protections--to protect our \nStates and to make sure the big States do not run roughshod over us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute of the 5 that were \nyielded to him. The Senator from Nevada has 1 minute left.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say respectfully to my friend from the \nState of Iowa that checks and balances and vetoes would not help the \nState of Nevada or the State of Alaska if the 52 Members of the \ncongressional delegation of California decide they want to do something \nthat would affect the State of Nevada. The only thing I can do to take \non one of those big States is to exercise my ability to talk on this \nfloor and explain my position in detail. Checks and balances has \nnothing to do with protecting a small State. Vetoes have nothing to do \nwith it, unless you have the ear of the Chief Executive of this \ncountry. The filibuster is uniquely situated to protect a small State \nin population like Nevada.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the proponents of the amendment have pointed \nout a number of times that most of the so-called filibusters have \noccurred in the last year, or last 2 or 3 years, and according to the \nchart, that is correct. What they are talking about, Mr. President, and \nwhat has gone around over this land is the idea that the failure to \ngive unanimous consent to take up a matter constitutes a filibuster.\n  Mr. President, let us read the rules. We do not need the Harkin \namendment to stop so-called filibusters on motions to proceed. We do \nnot need that. Let us read the present rules. I urge Senators to read \nthe rules of the Senate. Read the rules of the body to which they \nbelong before they start proposing that the rules be changed.\n  Here is paragraph 2 of standing rule VIII:\n\n       All motions made during the first 2 hours of a new \n     legislative day to proceed to the consideration of any matter \n     shall be determined without debate, except motions to proceed \n     to the consideration of any motion, resolution, or proposal \n     to change any of the Standing Rules of the Senate shall be \n     debatable.\n\n  In that case it will be debated.\n  Here we have paragraph 2 in Rule VIII of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate which says, in plain English words, that any motion made during \nthe first 2 hours on a new legislative day to take up a matter is \nnondebatable.\n  [[Page S436]] What more do we need? Mr. President, I have been \nmajority leader of this Senate twice. I have been leader of the \nminority once, for a period of 6 years. And there is no other Member of \nthis body who has been majority leader other than I, except Mr. Dole. I \nknow what the powers of the majority leader are. One of the greatest \narrows in his arsenal is the right of first recognition. So any \nmajority leader can walk on this floor and certainly find a way to be \nrecognized during the first 2 hours of a legislative day. Who \ndetermines whether it will be a new legislative day or not? That, too, \nis within the right and the powers of the majority leader. The majority \nleader can recess over until the next day, or he can move to adjourn, \nin which case the next meeting of the Senate will be considered as a \nnew legislative day. During the first 2 hours of that new legislative \nday, any motion to take up a matter is nondebatable. With all these \npowers that a majority leader has, why can he not use paragraph 2 of \nrule VIII of the Standing Rules of the Senate to get around so-called \nfilibusters on motions to proceed?\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state the inquiry.\n  Mr. BYRD. Has rule VII, has rule VIII, either of the two rules, been \nused once in the past Congress?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is informed that they have not been \nused.\n  Mr. BYRD. There you are. Why do we not use the rules we now have? No, \nwe do not do that. We ask unanimous consent to take up a matter and \nsomebody objects over here. That is called a filibuster, and \nimmediately a cloture motion is put in. Well, some would say that is a \nwaste of time. You have to wait 2 days. The majority leader does not \nhave to wait 2 days. He can go on to something else once the Chair \nreads the 16 names who are signatories of the cloture motion. He can go \nto something else. And 2 days later, the following day plus one, the \ncloture motion will ripen, and there will be a vote. So that is called \na filibuster.\n  I daresay if you count those so-called filibusters in that red bar on \nthe chart there, you will find most of them are cloture motions that \nwere entered on requests to proceed that were objected to and \nimmediately a cloture motion was filed. That is no filibuster. We go on \nto something else. We do not spend 2 days debating that matter. We go \non to something else. That is no filibuster. But in order to enhance \ntheir arguments that we need to do away with the so-called filibuster \nrule, they spread it all over the country that the Senate is plagued \nwith filibuster after filibuster after filibuster. There is no question \nbut that our friends on the other side of the aisle, in my opinion, \nhave recently abused the rule. But as I say, the rule is there. The \nmajority leader has the power and he can move to proceed, and that is \nnondebatable under rule VIII.\n  Let me hasten to say that after that first 2 hours in a new \nlegislative day, of course, any motion to proceed is debatable. I am \nwilling to cure that. Let us change the rule and allow for a debatable \nmotion with a limit thereon of, say, 2 hours on any motion to proceed \nto take up any measure or matter, with the exception of a measure \naffecting a rule change. I am for that. So there can be no excuse about \nholds on bills, and any majority leader worth his salt is not going to \nhonor a ``hold'' except for a few days. When he gets ready to move, he \nwill send word to the Senator who has a hold on a bill, as I did on a \nnumber of occasions to Senator Dole. I said: Please tell the Senator I \nam going to move next week to take up thus and so, on which he has a \nhold. And the hold generally goes away. If it does not, there is no one \nman in the Senate that can tie up the Senate long. I can tie it up for \nas long as I can stand on my feet. That is not long.\n  It takes a very sizable minority in this Senate to hold up the \nSenate. It takes 41 Members of the Senate, a minority of 41 Members to \nreally stop the process. And they say, well, I am for delay. We ought \nto have time to delay, to debate, but let us not give the minority the \nright to stop.\n  The minority sometimes is right, and a minority in the Senate often \nrepresents a majority out there beyond the beltway. Moreover, an \nextended discussion here may convince what is today a minority of the \npeople out there as to what is really right, and it may change to a \nmajority from a minority out there. So the minority can be right, and I \nsay the minority should retain the right that it has had since 1806 in \nthis Senate to stop a measure. If a measure is bad, it ought to be \nstopped.\n  Perhaps it can be amended and improved. But let us not do away with a \nrule here that gives this Senator, that Senator from Connecticut, that \nSenator from Iowa, that Senator from Nevada, that Senator from \nMississippi, gives him the right to stand on his feet as long as his \nlungs will carry breath and his voice can be heard to stand up for the \nrights of his State.\n  This is a forum of the States. There is no other forum of the States \nin this Government. This is the forum of the States.\n  And a minority can be right. The States are equal in this body. But \nout there, for example, in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, \nCalifornia, Texas, and Florida, there is a minority of the States but a \nmajority of the population. You take away this right of unlimited \ndebate, you may take away the right of a whole region of this country. \nThe people of that region may be right. They may be in the majority as \nto population, but in the Senate, they may be in the minority.\n  So, Mr. President, let us not take away this right. As long as the \nU.S. Senate provides the right of unlimited debate, then the people's \nliberties will be assured.\n  An urge to be efficient is commendable, but not at the expense of \nthorough debate which educates the public and educates the Members. And \nthere is a need in this body for more debate and not less.\n  Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Founding Fathers were wise. The current \nrules are the result of experience and trial and testing over the \nperiod going back to the beginning of this republic. The previous \nquestion was done away with, as I have already stated, almost 200 years \nago. Let us retain the right to debate. The majority, if it has the \nmajority, can presently cut off debate and avoid many of the so-called \nfilibusters by using the rules we have already. But most of the so-\ncalled filibusters, most of the so-called filibusters, have not been \nfilibusters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n   Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n   I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] for \nyielding.\n   When the Senator concludes his remarks at 11:30, I will move to \ntable his amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n   I am opposed to this amendment, and I urge the Senate to vote for \nthe motion to table it.\n   It has been my experience to observe the importance of the current \ncloture rules on several occasions in protecting legitimate minority \ninterests here in the Senate. On at least one occasion it was a \nregional minority interest at stake--the ports that are located on the \nGulf of Mexico.\n   It is obvious that the States on the gulf coast comprise a minority \nof the whole membership here, but when we banded together to debate at \nlength a proposal to write into law a preference for Great Lakes ports \nover gulf coast ports under the Public Law 480 program, we were \nsuccessful in assuring a decision that treated all port ranges fairly.\n  To assume that all uses of the right of unlimited debate are evil or \nought to be restrained under a new cloture rule ignores the legitimate \nand important protection the rule now provides to all Senators, all \nminorities, and all regions of the country.\n  The one example I have cited related to a regional interest that \nwould have been trampled under foot by a majority vote but for the \nleverage our region had the right to use, and did use to full \nadvantage, under the unique Senate rule of unlimited debate.\n  I hope the Senate will act today to protect this rule from the injury \nthat \n[[Page S437]] would be done by the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has focused most of his attention and remarks on the motion to \nproceed, because that is where most of the problem lies. I admitted to \nthat same thing myself last night.\n  But, to do away with the motion to proceed or to do away with the \npossibilities of a filibuster of a motion to proceed, only takes away \none hurdle of six.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is right. You can file a motion to \nproceed, you can move on to other bills and get the cloture motion \nfiled. But if you get to a bill and you filibuster the bill, it takes \nunanimous consent then to move off of that and pick up some other \nlegislation.\n  Now, I submit that the reason most of the time that we have had \nobjections to motions to proceed was because there was the implied \nthreat that, if you did move ahead, there would be a filibuster on the \nbill. That threat was always there.\n  There are six hurdles: motion to proceed, cloture, disagreement with \nthe House, insisting on amendments, appointing conferees, and a \nconference report. Any one of those can be filibustered. Any one of \nthose can be filibustered.\n  If you take away the motion to proceed, you have only taken away one \nhurdle. In fact, I submit you would make the situation even worse, \nbecause at least under the motion to proceed you can move to other \nbusiness.\n  Now, in 1975, the rules were changed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield just for a correction?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want to verify that this is correct with the \nParliamentarian.\n  The Senator from Iowa says that if a measure is before the Senate it \ntakes unanimous consent to go to another measure. That is not the case. \nThat is not the case. I have been majority leader and minority leader \nand I know what I am talking about, but I wanted to verify it.\n  The leader can go to another measure by motion. It does not require \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, that motion is then debatable. That motion is then \ndebatable and that motion can be filibustered. I believe the Senator is \nright.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wanted to correct the Senator on that point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do stand corrected on that.\n  But then there are other avenues. As I pointed out, there are other \nhurdles on the filibuster. You can get rid of the motion to proceed, \nbut you still have all these other hurdles, and you can filibuster any \none of them.\n  I might also add that I find it a curious argument of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia that, if the minority feels the legislation is bad, \nthey ought to have a right to stop it.\n  Let me quote again from James Madison.\n\n       If more than a majority [were required] for a decision . . \n     ., the fundamental principle of free government would be \n     reversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule; \n     the power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  Maybe we have a fundamental disagreement here. I do not believe that \nthe minority ought to be able to stop legislation they consider as bad. \nThey ought to be able to amend it, slow it down, debate it, change \npublic attitudes and opinions, go to their colleagues to get their \nopinions changed. But I find it curious that the Senator from West \nVirginia would say that a minority ought to have a right to stop \nlegislation they consider bad. That is rule by the minority.\n  The Senator from West Virginia says a Senator ought to have a right \nto stand and speak until his breath runs out. But that is not the \nsituation we have. Under the present rule XXII, you can start a \nfilibuster and go home. It takes 60 Senators, three-fifths of those \nduly chosen and sworn, to break a filibuster. And you do not have 60 \nSenators. You do not have to stand here and talk at all. You can go \nhome. We have seen that happen. We have seen that happen last year. So \nwe do not have that situation.\n  Forget about Mr. Smith goes to Washington. That is not the situation \nwe have today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. His proposal does not correct that fact. Why does the \nSenator not offer a proposition that will provide cloture only by two-\nthirds of those present and voting or by three-fifths of those present \nand voting?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, if the Senator wants to propose that.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, I say, why does the Senator not do that? His proposal \ndoes not cure that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Because, under my proposal, a Senator could stand here \nand talk until his breath runs out. Fifty-seven days we allow. I do not \nthink any Senator here can speak for 57 days. So it is not as though we \nare taking away the right of a Senator to stand here and speak until \nhis breath runs out.\n  Our amendment will allow 19 days, 19 legislative days, just to bring \nthe bill up. Then, on the other hurdles, there is more. It is a total \nof 57 days that a determined Senator can filibuster a bill. And I have \nnot even mentioned the amendments to the bill.\n  The Senator says we need time for more debate and not less. I agree \nwith the Senator. I wish we could have more debates like this. I think \nthey are good debates.\n Threaten to filibuster, the people go home.\n\n  I would close my remarks, Mr. President, by saying this is the first \nvote of this Congress in the Senate. I believe it is the most important \nvote of all the so-called reforms that we with will be voting on. We \nwill reform the way we do business here, and we will apply the laws \nthat apply to businesses to Congress, and we will have gift bans and \nall that. Fine.\n  This is the single most important reform. The people of this country \nwant this body to operate more effectively. They do not want gridlock. \nYes, we want the rights of the minority protected. We want the minority \nto be able to debate, to amend, to speak freely. To slow things down. \nAs Washington said to Jefferson, ``to cool down the legislation.'' But \nto enable one or two or three Senators to stop everything? No. It is \ntime to change. This is the single most important vote and I ask \nSenators to heed what the public said in November. They want change in \nthis place. Not the status quo.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, during yesterday's debate, my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, incorrectly compared his current \nfilibuster proposal with a proposal that I endorsed in 1971.\n  I would like to take a few moments now to set the record straight.\n  In 1971, rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate required the \naffirmative vote of two-thirds of those Senators present in order for \ncloture to be invoked. As my colleagues know, the current rule XXII \nrequires the affirmative vote of just three-fifths of the Members duly \nchosen and sworn in order to invoke cloture.\n  With this in mind, the rules change that I endorsed in 1971 is far \ndifferent from the rules change proposed today by my colleague from \nIowa. My proposal in 1971 would have reduced by one the number of votes \nrequired to limit debate each time a cloture petition was voted upon. \nOn the first vote, an affirmative two-thirds of the Senators present \nand voting would have been required to invoke cloture; on the second \nvote, two-thirds less one of the Senators present and voting would have \nbeen required; on the third vote, two-thirds less two, and so on until \nthe point of three-fifths of those present and voting was reached.\n  In other words, under the terms of my 1971 proposal, at no time would \nthe number of votes needed, to invoke cloture have fallen below three-\nfifths of those Senators present and voting. The amendment offered by \nmy colleague from Iowa, on the other hand, contemplates that the number \nof votes needed to invoke cloture would decline to 51, a simple \nmajority, after a series of attempts to invoke cloture have failed.\n  So, Mr. President, there should be no misconceptions about where I \nstand. I oppose the amendment, offered by my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa. And \n[[Page S438]] I have never endorsed his proposal, even in principle. \nThank you for giving me the opportunity to make this clarification.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I share the concern of the proponents of \nthis proposal to modify Senate rule XXII that the right to filibuster \nhas been abused in the Senate in recent years.\n  In the entire 19th century only 16 filibusters occurred. In the 26 \nCongresses from 1919 to 1970, there were a total of 50 votes on cloture \nmotions, an average of less than 2 cloture motions per Congress.\n  However, in the 103d Congress, the Senate's majority leader was \nforced to file a cloture petition to cut off a filibuster 72 times. The \ntactic was used repeatedly to stop legislation. Filibuster was piled \nupon filibuster until, at one point five were pending at the same time.\n  While minorities in Congress have, in the past, used the filibuster \non matters of fundamental principle, to force compromise, it has \nrecently been used to reject, frustrate, and prevent compromise. In the \ncase of the campaign finance reform bill in the last Congress, a \nfilibuster was used to prevent a conference committee from even being \nformed to discuss and work out the differences between the House and \nSenate legislation. A filibuster for that purpose had not been seen in \nthe more than 200 years of Senate history.\n  However, we must be very careful not to discard the baby with the \nbathwater. The rules of the Senate protect the rights of the minority. \nThroughout American history the Senate has been the more deliberative \nbody--sometimes for the good, other times not--but always assuring that \nmatters of great consequence cannot be rammed through by a majority \neven if backed by the currents of sometimes changeable public passion.\n  I believe the cloture procedure should be reformed by reducing the \nnumber of opportunities for its use on the same matter. Currently, \nthere are six opportunities, including the motion to proceed to its \nconsideration and three motions necessary to send a measure to a \nconference committee with the House. In my view, the opportunity to \nextend debate through the use of what we have come to call filibuster \nshould be preserved only on the consideration of a matter itself and on \nthe conference report when it returns to the Senate.\n  The Senate is unique. We should not take for granted the tone of \nbipartisanship and civility which normally characterize this body. \nWhile we have our moments of heated debate and partisan rigidity, \nvirtually everyone familiar with the Congress recognizes that the \nSenate, in contrast to the other body perhaps, is the arena in which \nthe parties are more likely to join together in a spirit of \nbipartisanship or at least work together seeking areas of compromise. \nDuring my 16 years in the Senate, I've found that the best policies \ncome from reaching across the aisle that divides the two parties.\n  This environment of compromise and comity grows in part from the \nexistence of the rights of the minority in the Senate rules. All of us \nin the Senate know that the majority party can do little here without \nthe cooperation and the votes of at least some Members of the minority. \nThis improves the tone of our debate, the manner in which the \nleadership of each party proceeds, and, indeed, virtually everything of \nimportance we do in the Senate. In a legislative body which operates \nsolely on majority rule it is necessary only to possess the keys to the \nbulldozer.\n  Any party which gains the majority can prevail without the \ncooperation or support of any part of the minority. The majority knows \nthat although it can be delayed, the final outcome is known. In the \nwords of House Majority Leader Richard Armey, referring to the \nmajority's plans for the marathon first day session of the House and \nurging the minority Democrats not to delay matters, ``The pain may be \ninevitable, but the suffering is optional.'' He meant that the majority \nknew what the outcome of all of the first day votes in the House of \nRepresentatives would be; the majority would prevail. The minority \ncould delay, the minority could raise procedural roadblocks, but the \nfinal result was assured.\n  I am also concerned that although the proposal before us attempts to \nstrengthen the hand of a majority frustrated in its efforts to \naccomplish its will by the minority, the procedure contemplated does \nnot even assure that a majority is involved throughout. Since a cloture \npetition requires the support of only 16 Senators, a minority could \nforce the series of cloture votes proposed without demonstrating \nmajority support until the threshold is lowered to 51 votes. At that \npoint, the measure might be sweetened by proponents in order to gain \nthe necessary additional votes to then reach a majority and invoke \ncloture. This might be used as a means to limit debate on the final \nbill, the real bill.\n  Mr. President, while I believe that rule XXII should be modified, \nwhile I hope that our colleagues, as we begin the 104th Congress, will \nresist the temptation to abuse and trivialize the right to unlimited \ndebate in the Senate, and while I greatly respect the creative effort \nof the Senator from Iowa to craft a reform of rule XXII, I will vote to \ntable the amendment because I think it goes too far in weakening \nfundamental minority rights. However, I hope the search for ways to \nreform rule XXII will not stop here. I encourage the leadership of the \nSenate and the Rules Committee to examine ways to reduce abuse of the \nfilibuster, including providing for limitation of debate on motions to \nproceed and on motions to send a measure to conference with the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator's time \nhas expired. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to table the Harkin amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will Senators please take their chairs.\n  The Senator seeks to address the Senate for 5 minutes. The Chair asks \nthat Senators please clear the aisles.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to correct something I said last \nnight I see in the Record.\n  I said last night that Brutus married the sister of Cato. Actually, \nBrutus was the son of Servilia, who was the sister of Cato--just to \nmake that little correction for the record.\n  Mr. President, the Senate by a decisive vote has moved to table the \nmatter presented to the Senate by Mr. Harkin. This will not be the last \ntime the effort will be made to amend rule XXII. That is why I impose \non the Senate for these few minutes while there is something of a \nlarger audience than there was last night and this morning. And I want \nto compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut. I thought we had some good exchanges in this \ndebate.\n  But while there are Senators who are listening, let me point out to \nthem, as I have pointed out in this debate, paragraph 2 of Rule VIII of \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, most of the so-called filibusters have occurred on \nmotions to proceed. Once that motion to proceed is approved, once the \nmatter itself is taken up, generally the filibusters have gone away. It \nhas too often been the practice here of late that when the leader asks \nunanimous consent to take up a matter, there is an objection heard from \nthe other side of the aisle, and that is then called a filibuster. The \nleader immediately puts in a cloture motion. That is all the debate \nthere is on that matter for the next few days. That is called a \nfilibuster. And it goes out over the land what a horrendous thing this \nfilibuster is, and Senators stand up here with these charts and point \nout how many times--10 times--as many filibusters in the last year as \nthere were in the last 100 years, or something to that effect. Well, \nthese are really not filibusters.\n  I think the rule has been abused. But I do not think we ought to take \na sledgehammer to kill a beetle.\n  We have the standing rules here. Let me read paragraph 2, rule VIII. \nSenators should know what is in the current rules before they start so-\ncalled reforms of the Senate and of the rules.\n  Rule VIII, paragraph 2:\n\n       All motions made during the first two hours of a new \n     legislative day to proceed to the consideration of any matter \n     shall be determined without debate, except motions to proceed \n     to the consideration of any motion, resolution, or proposal \n     to change any of the Standing Rules of the Senate shall be \n     debatable.\n\n  As I ascertained through a parliamentary inquiry earlier today, that \nrule was never used in the last session.\n  So, Mr. President, the rules are here. The type of filibuster, the \ntype of so-called filibuster that we have seen recently, which is \nfilibuster by delay, with no debate on it, is not good. But most \nproblems with this filibuster can be addressed within the existing \nrules, and I have just read the rule which has not been used. It was \nnot used in the last session. It was not used in the session before \nthat. And yet we complain about there being so many filibusters.\n  Mr. President, we can handle most of the minifilibusters around here. \nIf there is a sizable minority, one that consists of 41 Members, that \nis a large minority. That minority may represent a majority of the \npeople outside the beltway. Who knows?\n  I maintain that, as long as the United States Senate retains the \nright of unlimited debate, then the American people's liberties will \nnot be endangered.\n  They do not have unlimited debate on the other side of the Capitol, \nand there are those over there who want the Senate to do away with the \nfilibuster. But under the Constitution, each House shall determine its \nown rules. It is not my place to attempt to tell the other body what \nthey should do with their rule. But this rule has been in effect since \n1806 when the Senate did away with the previous question, when it \nrecodified the rules in 1806. And it did so upon the recommendation of \nAaron Burr, the Vice President, who, when he left the Senate in 1805, \nrecommended that the previous question be done away with. It had not \nbeen used but very little during the previous years since 1789. So that \nrule on the previous question, which is to shut off debate, was \neliminated from the Standing Rules of the Senate and it has been out of \nthere ever since.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend Senators for voting to table the Harkin \namendment. I also commend those who differ with me. I commend those who \noffered the amendment to change the rule. I think the Senate has acted \nwisely in retaining the rule that has governed our proceedings since \n1806. I hope that Senators will read the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  I thank all Senators for their patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The question now is on the \nadoption of the resolution.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 14) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 14\n\n       Resolved, That paragraph 2. of Rule XXV of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate is amended for the 104th Congress as \n     follows:\n       Strike ``18'' after ``Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``17''.\n       Strike ``29'' after ``Appropriations'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``28''.\n       Strike ``20'' after ``Armed Services'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``21''.\n       Strike ``21'' after ``Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``16''.\n       Strike ``20'' after ``Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation'' and insert in lieu thereof ``19''.\n       Strike ``20'' after ``Energy and Natural Resources'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``18'';\n       Strike ``17'' after ``Environment and Public Works'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``16''.\n       Strike ``19'' after ``Foreign Relations'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``18''.\n       Strike ``13'' after ``Governmental Affairs'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``15''.\n       Strike ``14'' after ``Judiciary'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``18''.\n       Strike ``17'' after ``Labor and Human Resources'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``16''.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are now on the bill to extend coverage \nto the Congress? Is that the bill before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there has been some comment concerning my \nactivities regarding this bill at the end of last session. I want to \nstate for the Record what happened.\n  Right toward the end of the session, there was an attempt to call up \nthe bill. I had an appointment with a physician to check a basic \nproblem--we thought it was a sheared hamstring muscle--and I asked my \nfriend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, if he would object to bringing \nthe bill up until I had a chance to see it. The Rules Committee had one \nversion of the bill and I believe Governmental Affairs had another. I \nwanted a chance to examine that bill. To my dismay at the time, the \nproblem I perceived I had was not the problem and 14 hours later I \nunderwent a very serious, major operation on my spine. I never returned \nto the Senate.\n  I did not intend to block the bill. I did have a request that I be \nable to see the bill, but since I never got back to the Senate, to my \nknowledge no attempt was made after that time to raise the bill. But I \nhave heard comment again this morning, in the press, that I had \nfilibustered the bill. That is not true and I think the Record should \nshow my request was a request to examine the bill. I never had the \nopportunity to do that since I never got back to the Senate during that \npart, the last part of the Senate, due to that operation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bumpers and Mr. Leahy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 151, S. 152, S. 153, S. 154, S. 155, S. 156, and S. \n157 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the first bill \nthat the 104th Senate will consider is the Congressional Accountability \nAct. This bill presents the opportunity to show the country that the \nSenate has listened to the American people. We will demonstrate that \nthe new Senate knows that the American people want us to end business \nas usual.\n  I appreciate the leadership that Senator Lieberman has provided on \nthis legislation over the years. He is equally committed to reforming \nCongress. Our views on this legislation are identical. And I am pleased \nthat the task of congressional coverage has benefited from a bipartisan \napproach.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Dole for bringing up this legislation. \nHis commitment to this legislation is outstanding. He is a true \nreformer in the best sense of the word. And he is committed to ending \nthe injustices that have existed for congressional employees for so \nmany years. The majority leader established a number of working groups \nto advise him on measures that should be taken in the 104th Senate. \nSenator Fred Thompson and I cochaired the Working Group on \nCongressional Coverage. I know that Senator Thompson has worked hard on \nthis legislation, and I appreciate his assistance in this effort. It is \nan auspicious beginning to his career as a Senator. Other members of \nthe working group included Senators Nickles, Gorton, Smith, Stevens, \nAbraham, Coats, and Hutchison.\n  Moreover, our efforts to ensure congressional compliance with the \nlaws it passes benefited from Senator Roth's willingness to let this \nlegislation be brought to the floor immediately. Additionally, Senator \nGlenn worked on the issue over quite a few years when he chaired the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. I am also delighted that this bill has \ndozens of cosponsors, from both parties, all parts of the country, and \nall across the ideological spectrum.\n  This bill represents the culmination of an effort that I began \nseveral years ago, when I first attempted to offer an amendment to a \ncivil rights bill that would have brought Congress under labor and \nemployment laws. That attempt failed, as did my attempt to amend the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act in 1989.\n My amendment was accepted by the then-Senate leadership but was \nrendered ineffective in conference. And I was not even allowed to offer \nmy amendment to the family leave bill when the Senate debated it in \n1991.\n\n  Congress can no longer refuse to live by the laws it passes. The time \nis long overdue for Congress to correct this practice, and that is what \nthis bill does. It completes the process begun in 1991 when the Senate \npassed the Grassley-Mitchell amendment applying the substantive \nprovisions of the civil rights laws to the Senate. As I said back then, \nit was a good beginning--but only a beginning. So it is with some \nmeasure of satisfaction that I find myself speaking in favor of a bill \nthat would finally require Congress to comply with a host of employment \nlaws it has enacted for the private sector.\n  Mr. President, since the 1930's Congress has passed laws that flowed \nfrom the assumption that Washington knew best. Congress set up \nburdensome statutory requirements on the operation of small businesses \nin this country. The burdens were increased through regulations issued \nby executive branch agencies pursuant to the statute.\n  At the same time, Congress repeatedly exempted itself from the \neffects of those laws. Laws governed America, but not Congress. Workers \nwere granted rights, but congressional workers were not. Those who made \nthe laws did not live by them. Congress was immune from the excesses of \nthe regulatory state. Congress became removed from the way its work \naffected everyone else.\n  In this country, no one is above the law. But just as the Presidency \nsuffered a tremendous loss of public confidence when an individual \nthought he was above the law, Congress suffered as Members thought they \nwere above the law. Indeed, to me, this was one of the major reasons \nwhy Congress lost touch with the people. And it was one of the ways by \nwhich Congress displayed arrogance. Millions of Americans complained \nabout the overreach of the Federal Government, but Congress, through \nits exemption from the law, could not know the depth of feeling from \nthe grassroots. In November, the American people demanded that Congress \nbe affected by the laws it passes. A number of Members who thought \nCongress should be above the law are no longer Members and no longer \nabove the law.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of someone who lost an earlier election, \nformer Senator George McGovern.\n Senator McGovern believes that Congress has enacted unnecessary \nregulatory burdens that are strangling small business. Senator McGovern \nadmits that he did not feel that way when he was a Member of this body, \nbut he learned the reality of the operation of that legislation when he \nran a small business after leaving office. I appreciate that Senator \nMcGovern now says that he would have legislated differently had he \nknown what the actual effects would have been.\n\n  But Members of Congress learning of the effects of their votes only \nafter leaving office will not solve the problem. Then, it is too late. \nOnly if Members of Congress live with the consequences of their votes \nwill the problem that Senator McGovern identified be corrected.\n  I think that President Clinton has this issue exactly right as well. \nWhen we send this bill to him, he will sign it. As he stated in a July \n1992 interview, ``It's wrong for Congress to be able to put new \nrequirements on American business as employers and then not follow that \nrule as employers themselves. They exempt themselves, historically, \nfrom all kinds of rules that private employers have to follow. And I \nthink that one of the things that happens to people in government is \nthey forget what it's like to be governed. They don't have any idea \nwhat it's like to be on the receiving end of a lot of these rules and \nregulations.''\n  Of course, the Founding Fathers would be astonished to know that \nCongress had exempted itself from so many laws that it passed for the \nprivate sector. James Madison in Federalist 57 wrote that one of the \nprimary guarantees of the people's liberty came from Congress living by \nwhatever laws it passed. Madison wrote that Congress ``Can pass no law \nwhich will not have its full operation on themselves and \n[[Page S441]] their friends, as well as on the great mass of society. \nThis has always been deemed one of the strongest bonds by which human \npolicy can connect the rulers and the people together. It creates \nbetween them the communion of interest * * * of which few governments \nhave furnished examples, but without which every government degenerates \ninto tyranny * * * if this spirit ever be so far debased as to tolerate \na law not obligatory on the legislature as well as on the people, the \npeople will be prepared to tolerate anything but liberty.''\n  Mr. President, Madison was right. Of course, the low esteem in which \nCongress is currently held reflects the fact that there is no longer \ncongruence of interests between the governors and the governed. The \nAmerican people will no longer tolerate a law not obligatory on the \nlegislature as well as the people.\n  Under Madison's principle, because Members of Congress would be \ncareful before they infringed their own liberties, the people's \nliberties would be zealously protected.\n  Unfortunately, the corollary to the principle was equally true. \nMembers of Congress who could protect their own liberties while \ninfringing on the liberties of others were much more likely to fail to \nprotect others' liberties. Congress enjoyed privilege through \nexemption. The time has come to end congressional royalism. The time \nhas come to end the exemptions. Now, Congress must finally live under \nthe same laws it passes for everyone else, to fulfill Madison's promise \nof the Constitution. And, now, employees of Congress must finally gain \nthe same rights that their counterparts in the private sector enjoy.\n  Like my colleagues, I take the notion of representative government \nvery seriously. We are not Senators for ourselves. We do not hold this \njob as a matter of personal privilege. We are here to represent the \ninterests of our constituents, our States and our country, and for no \nother reason. I think that exemptions from the operation of law \ninterfere with representative government. I wonder how we truly can \nrepresent people who live by one set of laws when we live under \ndifferent laws. Under the current system, our votes on various \nregulatory issues reflect our interests and not our constituents'. This \nmust change if representative government is truly to function.\n  When we pass this bill, we begin to restore the American people's \nfaith in Congress. We will do so in five respects. First, we ensure \nthat Members of Congress will know firsthand the burdens that the \nprivate sector lives with. By knowing those burdens, Congress may \ndecide that the laws indeed are burdensome. That realization may lead \nto necessary reform of the underlying legislation. It is true that \nthere will be additional costs imposed on Congress if this legislation \npasses. However, these are costs that the private sector has had to \nlive with for years. And the Congressional Budget Office has estimated \nthat costs of compliance will be only about $3-to-$4 million.\n While that is a considerable sum, it represents, for instance, only a \nfraction of the amount that Congress recently voted for a subway system \nto connect the Senate office buildings with the Capitol.\n\n  The second benefit of requiring that Congress live under the laws it \npasses for others concerns future social legislation. If Congress knows \nthat it will be bound by what it passes, Congress will be more careful \nin the future to respect the liberties of others.\n  Third, passage of the bill will mean that congressional employees \nwill have the civil rights and social legislation that has ensured fair \ntreatment of workers in the private sector. Congress is the last \nplantation. It is time for the plantation workers to be liberated. \nMaybe it is more accurate to say that Congress and the judiciary are \nthe last two plantations. Curiously, the only people who do not have to \ncomply with the law are those who make the law and those who decide the \ncases under those laws. The judiciary has often interpreted legislation \nto be burdensome, perhaps in some instances, to be more burdensome than \neven the exempt Congress intended. Of course, an exempt judiciary has \nno reason to interpret the statute in a way to protect freedom. Under \nthis bill, the judiciary will have to come up with a plan to provide \ncoverage for its employees as well. I look forward to that proposal, \nand to enactment of legislation to cover the judiciary.\n  The fourth general result of this legislation will be a public \nrecognition that Congress has again discovered that it is subject to \nthe will of the people, not the other way around. Congress will no \nlonger be above the law. Members of Congress will no longer be first \nclass citizens with unjustifiable special privileges.\n  And fifth, Members of Congress will learn themselves of the \nlitigation explosion that is choking small business in the country. \nWhen they see directly the litigation produced by the laws they pass, \nCongress will be very careful about creating additional liabilities for \nthe private sector and additional work for the Federal courts. When \nthey see how alternative dispute resolution operates, Members of \nCongress may appreciate the wisdom of encouraging additional \nalternative dispute resolution for all sorts of claims brought in the \nFederal courts.\n  Every indication from polls, election returns, and the mail that we \nhave received from constituents shows that nothing makes Americans \nmadder than knowing that they have to live by laws that their \nRepresentatives in Congress do not. They are well justified in their \nanger. When we pass this bill, we will show them that we recognize the \nunfairness of the existing exemptions and the legitimacy of their \nconcerns.\n  S. 2 is the pending business under unusual circumstances. It has not \nbeen considered by any committee in this Congress. Nonetheless, it \nbears a close resemblance to S. 2071 from the 103d Congress.\n  That bill was the subject of hearings in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, and it was approved by the committee for floor \nconsideration.\n  Unfortunately, the bill was not able to be considered before the \nCongress adjourned, despite the fact that the other body had passed \nsimilar legislation.\n  Although the Governmental Affairs Committee did issue a report to \naccompany S. 2071, this particular bill does not have a committee \nreport. Although S. 2 is quite similar to S. 2071, there have been \nchanges made in consultation with leaders from the other body.\n  Accordingly, it will be necessary, in lieu of a committee report, for \nme to first describe the bill generally, and then to detail each aspect \nof the bill.\n  S. 2 begins with the basic premise that the laws that govern the \nprivate sector should govern Congress unless it can be shown that \nimportant differences between Congress and the private sector justify \nsome amount of change. The provisions of S. 2 also flow from a belief \nthat judicial enforcement of the laws against the Congress is vital if \nthose laws are to meaningfully apply.\n  I strongly disagree with the implications of today's Washington Post \narticle on the congressional coverage bill. That article implies that \nCongress is already covered under many of these laws and already lives \nunder them, and that all that is changing is the remedies. That \nanalysis misses the point. Let me provide an analogy.\n  The Soviet Union's Constitution guaranteed the rights to freedom of \nspeech, freedom of assembly, fair trial, and other rights that are \nsimilar to the American Constitution. They existed on paper. Any Soviet \ncitizen could pull out that document and see that those rights existed. \nBut of course, the rights guaranteed by the American Constitution are a \nreality and the rights guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution were an \nillusion. The reason for the difference: The American Constitution is \nenforced by an independent judiciary and the Soviet Constitution was \nnot. The Soviet rights were nothing because there was no remedy.\n  Similar to the Soviet Constitution, it is true that some of the laws \nthis bill will apply to Congress already can be found in the United \nStates Code as applying to Congress. But the remedies to make those \nrights exist in more than name only do not.\n  ``The history of liberty is the history of procedures for protecting \nliberty,'' Justice Frankfurter once wrote, and until this bill is \npassed, congressional employees lack the remedies necessary to protect \nliberty.\n  S. 2 will apply 11 laws to Congress that are either completely or \npartially \n[[Page S442]] inapplicable now. Those 11 laws are the Federal Labor \nStandards Act of 1964, title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Federal Service Labor \nManagement Relations Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of \n1988, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Veterans Reemployment Act.\n  The bill provides different mechanisms for enforcement of these laws \nthat correspond to their application to the private sector.\n  If the underlying law provides for a private right of action in \ncourt, one model is followed. If the law would be administratively \nenforced in the private sector, then it is to be administratively \nenforced against Congress.\n  For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title I of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family and Medical Leave \nAct, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection \nAct, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and the \nVeterans Reemployment Act provide for enforcement through a private \nright of action in court. Under S. 2, any employee who alleges a \nviolation of these statutes may also bring a private action in Federal \ndistrict court. This represents the first time that this relief has \never been available to congressional employees. Before the employee may \nsue in court, however, the employee must exhaust administrative \nremedies available to him or her. These administrative remedies are the \ncounseling and mediation provisions that now govern Senate employees \nunder the Government Employee Rights Act from 1991 that Senator \nMitchell and I drafted.\n  I would now like to generally describe the operation of the \nlegislation, and then detail its individual provisions.\n  The purpose of S. 2 is to fully apply antidiscrimination and employee \nprotection laws to Congress.\n  The bill has eight key elements:\n  First, rights and protections under key antidiscrimination and \nemployment statutes would fully apply to the House of Representatives, \nthe Senate, the Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and the Office of Technology Assessment.\n  Second, a new Office of Compliance would be established to handle \nclaims and issue rules. The office would be headed by an independent \nboard of directors, removable only for cause.\n  Third, for statutes providing a private right of action, an employee \nwho believes there has been a violation could receive counseling and \nmediation services from the new office.\n  Fourth, if such an employee's claim is not resolved by counseling or \nmediation, the employee may file a complaint with the office and \nreceive a trial and decision from an independent hearing officer. This \ndecision may be appealed to the board and to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  Fifth, instead of filing a complaint with the office after counseling \nand mediation, the employee may choose to file an action in U.S. \nDistrict court where a private sector employee could also bring a \nlawsuit in court. A jury trial may be requested under applicable law.\n  Sixth, for underlying statutes providing for administrative \nenforcement exclusively, the office will enforce the statutes \nadministratively. The employee could obtain Court review for actions \nthe office brought that were resolved adversely to the employee.\n  Seventh, since the General Accounting Office, the Government Printing \nOffice, and the Library of Congress are already covered by \nantidiscrimination and employee protections laws, coverage would be \nexpanded and clarified in certain regards.\n  Additionally, the Administrative Conference will undertake a study of \nthe application of these laws to the three instrumentalities, and will \nrecommend any improvements in regulations and procedures and for any \nlegislation.\n  Eighth, to ensure compliance with these laws by the judicial branch, \nthe Judicial Conference will undertake a study to determine how \nemployees of the judiciary will obtain the rights and remedies \nconferred by these laws.\n\n\n                  background and need for legislation\n\n  Current law creates a patchwork of rights and protections for \nemployees of the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the \ncongressional instrumentalities.\n  Although Congress has made significant progress in extending \nemployment laws to congressional employees, important gaps remain. The \nremaining exemptions, and significant differences in the manner and \nextent to which rights under these laws can be enforced, perpetuate the \nperception, and in at least some cases, the reality--of a double \nstandard of special privilege for the legislative branch. This feeds \nthe growing public cynicism about Congress.\n\n\n       coverage and gaps in coverage of the senate, the house of \n       representatives, and the congressional instrumentalities.\n\n  First, the Senate.--A number of major antidiscrimination and \nemployment laws enacted in this century did not cover one or both \nHouses of Congress. Several laws, including Fair Labor Standards Act, \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Civil Rights Act \nAmendments of 1972, were originally enacted without coverage for \ncongressional employees, even while executive branch employees were \nexpressly covered. The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations \nStatute and section 19 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act \nestablished special programs for the executive branch, different from \nthe corresponding programs for the private sector, but, again, Congress \ndid not cover itself.\n  The Employee Polygraph Protection Act and the Worker Adjustment and \nRetraining Notification Act did not apply to the Federal Government at \nall. Veterans reemployment provisions gave employees of Congress a \nRamspeck remedy, but did not provide the private right of action and \ncourt access that private sector veterans enjoy.\n  Over the past 15 years or so, and accelerating in the 1990's, \nCongress has taken considerable steps to apply these laws to itself. As \nfar back as the 94th Congress, 1975-76, the Senate adopted Senate \nResolution 534, which prohibited employment discrimination in the \nSenate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or \nhandicap, and which encouraged the hiring of women and members of \nminority groups.\n  With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, \nrights as established in the antidiscrimination laws were accorded to \nSenate employees.\n  Enforcement, however, was through internal procedures before the \nSelect Committee on Ethics, rather than through executive branch \nagencies or the courts. This act also obligated the Senate not to \ndiscriminate against members of the public on the basis of disability.\n  Title III of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, also known as the \nGovernment Employee Rights Act, reaffirmed the prohibition against all \nkinds of employment discrimination in the Senate.\n  The 1991 act also established an Office of Senate Fair Employment \nPractices [OSFEP] and proved an internal Senate enforcement procedure \nconsisting of: First, counseling, second, mediation, third, formal \ncomplaint and hearing before a board of three independent hearing \nofficers, and fourth, review of the decision by the Senate Select \nCommittee on Ethics.\n  Finally, an appeal may be taken from the Ethics Committee decision to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  Rights and protections under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 \nhave also been extended to Senate employees. These rights are \nenforceable through the procedures established in the Civil Rights Act \nof 1991.\n  Thus, Senate employees enjoy the rights and protections of all of the \nantidiscrimination laws, as well as the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nalbeit with a different enforcement mechanism than is provided in the \nprivate sector or the executive branch. However, the Fair Labor \nStandards Act and the Equal Pay Act do not apply to the Senate.\n  [[Page S443]] Also, Senate employees do not have a right to trial in \nU.S. District Court, but they do have a right to trial before a panel \nof independent hearing examiners, and judicial review by a U.S. Court \nof Appeals.\n  Second, the House of Representatives.--In 1988, the House of \nRepresentatives adopted the Fair Employment Practices Resolution, House \nResolution 558, 100th Congress, which has been renewed and codified in \nHouse rule 51. This rule specifics that personnel actions shall be free \nfrom discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, \nsex, disability, or age.\n  In adoption, the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the \nEqual Pay Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act have been made \napplicable to the House.\n  The House established an Office of Fair Employment Practices that has \na 3-step process to be used by employees alleging discrimination: \nFirst, counseling and mediation, second, formal complaint, hearing by a \nhearing officer, and decision by the office, and third, final review of \nthe decision of the office by an eight-member panel composed of four \nmembers of the Committee on House Administration and four officers and \nemployees of the House.\n  Thus, House employees enjoy rights and protections against \ndiscrimination, as well as rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act, \nthe Equal Pay Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act.\n  However, the House process of enforcing and redressing these rights \nand protections is somewhat less independent than that in the Senate, \nand it affords no judicial review.\n  Third, the instrumentalities--The various congressional \ninstrumentalities have been made subject to some of these \nantidiscrimination and employee protection laws, but not to others. \nCoverage is uneven.\n  The three largest instrumentalities--the General Accounting Office \n[GAO], the Government Printing Office [GPO], and the Library of \nCongress [LOC] are subject to these laws to much the same extent as \nexecutive branch agencies, although enforcement mechanisms frequently \ndiffer. Thus, the employees of these instrumentalities enjoy most of \nthe rights and protections of the antidiscrimination laws, including \nthe right to bring actions in U.S. District Court.\n  These employees also have the rights and protections of the Family \nand Medical Leave Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and the Federal \nService Labor-Management Relations statute.\n  These three instrumentalities, as Federal agencies, are also subject \nto the requirements of section 18 of the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, and related provisions of section 7902 of title 5, United States \nCode, and they each have implemented compliance programs.\n  However, under statute and established practice, certain of these \ninstrumentalities have internal enforcement or grievance mechanisms \nwhere executive branch agencies would be subject to external regulation \nby other agencies.\n  The Architect of the Capitol, the Congressional Budget Office, and \nthe Office of Technology Assessment have substantially more limited \ncoverage. Employees of the Architect of the Capitol enjoy rights and \nprotections under the antidiscrimination laws, and were recently \nauthorized to bring claims to the GAO Personnel Appeals Board.\n  However, these employees have rights under the Fair Labor Standards \nAct and the Family and Medical Leave Act that are not subject to \nexternal enforcement, and they are not covered under any labor-\nmanagement law. Employees of the CBO have the same rights and \nprotections as House employees, and can bring claims to the House OFEP \nunder House rule 51.\n  Employees of OTA enjoy the rights and protections of \nantidiscrimination statutes and the Family and Medical Leave Act, but \nnot the Fair Labor Standards Act. OTA has established its own internal \ngrievance procedure.\n  Last Congress, significant efforts were undertaken to remove the \nexemptions Congress has granted itself.\n  Compliance with Federal laws for the legislative branch was also a \nmajor issue for the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, \nwhich was charged in 1993 with presenting a legislative reorganization \nplan.\n  There was a near consensus among the Senators and members of the \nHouse of Representatives who testified before the joint committee that \ncongressional exemptions should end.\n  At hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee on June 29, \n1994, Dr. Norman Ornstein, resident scholar at the American Enterprise \nInstitute, stated:\n\n       There is no subject now that inflames the public more, when \n     it comes to Congress, than this one [congressional coverage].\n\n  He therefore urged that Congress get ``caught up with the curve of \npublic opinion,'' or else Congress ``may be forced to take action that \nis far more destructive of the prerogatives of the institution, and of \nthe taxpayers' purse,'' than the proposals now being considered for \nenactment.\n  Members who testified or spoke at the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's hearing in June and at its meeting to mark up S. 2071 in \nSeptember, were also nearly unanimous in supporting extension of \ncoverage. Concern was expressed about reported and perceived \ninadequacies in existing employee rights and protections in the \nlegislative branch.\n  For example, there was concern about the high rate of workers' \ncompensation claims by employees of the Architect of the Capitol, and \nabout a GAO report documenting apparent inequities in the employment \nand hiring policies of the Architect.\n  Also, studies were cited showing that the grievance process provided \nby the Office of the Architect was underutilized, presumably because of \na lack of trust in the process, and that a sizable percentage of House \nand Senate employees expressed reluctance to use their respective \ngrievance procedures because of a lack of trust.\n  Additionally, the final report of the Joint Committee on the \nOrganization of Congress stated: ``Witnesses were uniformly \ndissatisfied with the performance of the House Office of Fair \nEmployment Practices [OFEP], which was established in 1989.'' H. Rep. \nNo 103-413, vol. II, at page 147 (December 1993).\n  They also expressed concern that an underutilization was caused by \nlack of employee trust in the process.\n\n\n                          summary of proposal\n\n                       A. What laws should apply?\n\n  The guiding principle expressed by more than one member of the \ncommittee in considering this legislation is that Congress should be \nsubject to the same laws as apply to a business back in a home State. \nThe only exception should be where different rules are necessary to \nenable Congress to fulfill its constitutional and legislative \nresponsibilities.\n  This bill would apply 11 key anti-discrimination and employee-\nprotection laws to the Congress. These laws are:\n  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\n  The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,\n  The Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n  The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,\n  The Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988,\n  The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act,\n  The Veterans Reemployment Act,\n  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and\n  The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute.\n\n\n                         B. Bicameral structure\n\n  Some Senators believe that to authorize executive branch agencies to \nenforce antidiscrimination and employment laws against Congress would \ncreate a dangerous entanglement between these two branches of \nGovernment.\n  They think the legislative branch must be free from executive branch \nintimidation, real or perceived, and the enforcing agency must likewise \nbe free of real or imagined intimidation by the legislative branch.\n  The view has also been expressed that the Constitution requires each \nHouse to govern itself, independently of the other House. However, S. 2 \ncreates a Bicameral Office of Compliance. Self-government is an \nessential constitutional obligation of each House, but establishment of \na single office to \n[[Page S444]] implement these laws jointly for the Senate and House \nwould not infringe on any essential Senate or House prerogative.\n  Indeed, laws cannot be enforced in a fair and uniform manner--and \nemployees and the public cannot be convinced that the laws are being \nenforced in a fair and uniform manner--unless Congress establishes a \nsingle enforcement mechanism that is independent of each House of \nCongress.\n  S. 2 would create a new independent enforcement office within the \nlegislative branch. An independent board of directors would be \nappointed by the majority and minority leadership of each House, \nremovable only for cause. However, the deputy directors of the office, \none for each House, will develop the regulations that govern each \nHouse, and forward them to the board for notice and comment procedures. \nThe board would then issue regulations, and the accompanying \ndocumentation would detail any departures from the recommendations of \nthe deputy directors.\n  Ultimately, each body would adopt its own regulations, which, so long \nas they comported with the terms of this act, could take into account \ndifferences between the two bodies. Specifically, the board would be \nresponsible for developing rules to apply the antidiscrimination and \nemployment laws to Congress, and Congress would retain the power to \napprove these rules.\n  Regulations would become effective by a vote of the respective body, \nor by both bodies in the event that the regulations in question covered \njoint employees.\n  The regulations would have to be consistent with the rules developed \nby executive branch agencies, unless the board determined for good \ncause that a different approach would be more effective for the \nimplementation of the rights and protections conferred by the \nunderlying statutes.\n  The ultimate responsibility for developing, issuing, and approving \nthe rules would remain within the legislative branch. Regulations could \ngain the force of law if both Houses approved them and presented them \nto the President for signature.\n  Although the validity of the regulations could not be challenged upon \ntheir promulgation, they could be challenged collaterally by aggrieved \nemployees during enforcement actions. Regulations adopted with the \nforce of law could be challenged only on the basis of their \nconstitutionality, and also only collaterally.\n  The bicameral and legislative enforcement approach contained in S. 2 \nis an effort to accommodate the views of those who adamantly oppose \nexecutive branch enforcement of these statutes. Some who oppose the \ninterference of the executive branch claim that the Constitution \nprohibits the executive branch involvement that the private sector \nlives with under these laws.\n  Indeed, some of my colleagues maintain that judicial enforcement of \nthese laws to Congress violates the separation of powers.\n  I am aware of no case law that establishes that subjecting Congress \nto the same executive and judicial branch enforcement mechanism that \nthe private sector faces violates the Constitution.\n  And if it were entirely up to me, I suppose that I would have \nintroduced as S. 2 a one-page bill that simply ended the exemptions and \nrequired Congress to live under the same laws that it passes for \neveryone else. I would have provided the same remedies for enforcement \nthat apply outside Congress.\n  I would have executive branch enforcement of the laws, such as EEOC \nenforcement of the civil rights laws and Labor Department enforcement \nof the minimum wage laws.\n  However, S. 2 recognizes the strong feelings of the Members who \ndisagree with me.\n  So long as the legislative branch agency enforcing the laws is not a \ntool of the Members, and so long as the underlying statutes are \nexpressly incorporated through legislation to apply to Congress, the \nregulations must conform to the regulations, and the regulations can be \nchallenged in court if they subvert the statutes that must apply to \nCongress, I am willing to accept legislative enforcement.\n  But that does not mean that I agree that there would be any \nconstitutional impediment to executive branch enforcement. Indeed, I \nhave always been puzzled by the separation of powers argument in the \ncontext of congressional coverage.\n  The Justice Department enforces the criminal laws against Members of \nCongress, and the courts hear such claims and render judgment. Surely \nimprisonment is a much greater intrusion against a Member than is a \ncitation for an OSHA violation.\n  Nonetheless, in recognition of the strong feelings of some of my \ncolleagues, S. 2 provides for administrative enforcement of these laws \nby an agency within the legislative branch. That requires that S. 2 be \na lengthier bill. An administrative mechanism for enforcing 11 laws and \npermitting judicial review of the decision cannot be written on 1 piece \nof paper.\n\n\n                C. Claims procedures and judicial review\n\n  The new office would be responsible for handling and adjudicating \nemployee claims where the underlying statute provides for a private \nright of action. An employee would first receive counseling and \nmediation services.\n  If the claim cannot be resolved at this stage, the employee could \nrequest that a hearing officer be assigned to conduct a formal \nadministrative hearing on the employee's claim. After the hearing, \neither party could appeal to the board of directors. If necessary, they \ncould than appeal the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal circuit.\n  In lieu of a hearing, the employee may bring an action in Federal \ndistrict court. Allowing access to district courts makes the available \nremedies more like those available to both private-sector and \nexecutive-branch employees. Courts and judges do not have the complex \ninteractions with Congress that executive agencies have, so the risk of \nintimidation would not arise.\n  Furthermore, politically motivated claims can be made in other \nforums, regardless of whether access to district court is allowed.\n  For claims arising under statutes that do not provide for a private \nright of action, the employee would proceed to the office to obtain \ncounseling and mediation, as described above.\n  However, in lieu of the private right of action or executive branch \nadministrative enforcement, the office, if the General Counsel so \ndetermined, would pursue the claim itself. The aggrieved party at the \nend of the administrative process could obtain court review of the \ndecision with the court of appeals for the Federal circuit.\n\n\n                     D. Labor-management relations\n\n  In the context of the labor-management relations area, I am concerned \nthat congressional coverage does not create any conflicts of interest. \nFor example, there might be concern if legislative staff belonged to a \nunion, that union might be able to exert undue influence over \nlegislative activities or decisions.\n  Even if such a conflict of interest between employees' official \nduties and union membership did not actually occur, the mere appearance \nof undue influence or access might be very troubling. Furthermore, \nthere is concern that labor actions could delay or disrupt vital \nlegislative activities.\n  The bill would apply the Federal service labor management relations \nstatute, rather than the private-sector National Labor Relations Act. \nThe Federal service law includes provisions and precedents that address \nproblems of conflict of interest in the governmental context and that \nprohibit strikes and slowdowns.\n  Furthermore, as an extra measure of precaution, the reported bill \nwould not apply labor-management law to Members' personal or committee \noffices or other political offices until the board has conducted a \nspecial rulemaking to consider such problems as conflict of interest.\n  Those rules would also not go into effect until considered and \nenacted by Congress.\n\n\n                         E. Cost considerations\n\n  Some Members expressed concern that application of laws to the \nlegislative branch would impose large and unpredictable costs on the \ntaxpayer.\n  The Congressional Budget Office disagrees. The CBO cost estimate \npredicts costs of about $1 million in the first two fiscal years, and \n$4 to $5 million in subsequent years. However, unlike S. \n[[Page S445]] 2071, S. 2 does not permit covered employees to be \noffered compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. That is the rule \nthat applies to the private sector.\n  There might be some additional cost of complying with this provision. \nBut with respect to employees whose work schedule is highly irregular \nbecause of the irregular Senate and House schedule, the board would \ndevelop comparable regulations to those governing private sector \nworkers with irregular work hours.\n  Since the new leadership has committed itself to a more family \nhospitable work schedule, the amount of overtime is likely to be less \nin any event.\n  There will also be costs that CBO did not take into account because \nS. 2, unlike S. 2071, requires OSHA inspections.\n  However, the additional costs are likely to be small in relation to \nthe normal sums Congress spends.\n                  F. Application to instrumentalities\n\n  In an attempt to bring order to the chaos of the way in which the \nrelevant laws apply to congressional instrumentalities, S. 2 divides \nthe instrumentalities into two groups.\n  The three largest instrumentalities, the General Accounting Office, \nLibrary of Congress, and Government Printing Office, already have \ncoverage and enforcement systems that are identical or closely \nanalogous to the executive branch agencies.\n  Notably, employees in each of these agencies already have the right \nto seek relief in the Federal courts for violations of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, and they are covered under the same provisions of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act as executive branch employees.\n  Employees in each of these instrumentalities also already are assured \nof the right to bargain collectively, with a credible enforcement \nmechanism to protect that right. For these three instrumentalities, S. \n2 clarifies existing coverage in certain respects, and expands coverage \nunder the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  It makes few changes with respect to the Government Printing Office \nbecause of separation of powers concerns raised by the Department of \nJustice that GPO is an executive branch agency that should not be under \nthe supervision of a congressional office of compliance.\n  Additionally, S. 2 directs the administrative conference to study the \napplication of each of these laws to these entities, and to make \nrecommendations for any improvements in such regulations or procedures \nto ensure they are at least comparable to those required by this act. \nThe board is directed to complete this study within 2 years after \npassage of this act.\n  The remaining instrumentalities, including the Architect of the \nCapitol, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Office of Technology \nAssessment, are brought within the same new rules, procedures, and \nremedies as this bill would apply for House of Representatives and \nSenate employers and employees.\n  This will allow for a consolidated application and administration of \nthese laws. It will also extend to these employees, for the first time, \nthe right to bargain collectively, and it will provide a means of \nenforcing compliance with these laws that is independent from the \nmanagement of these instrumentalities.\n  For employers of these instrumentalities, by strengthening the \nenforcement mechanisms, this bill attempts to transform the patchwork \nof hortatory promises of coverage into a truly enforceable application \nof these laws.\n  Dividing the instrumentalities in this manner will reduce the \nadjudicatory burden on the new office of compliance by excluding from \nits jurisdiction the approximately 15,000 employees of GAO, GPO, and \nthe Library of Congress.\n  It also has the advantage of using the apparatus that will already be \nnecessary to apply these laws to the 20,000 employees of the House and \nSenate to the remaining approximately 3,000 employees of the Architect, \nBotanic Gardens, CBO, and OTA.\n  So, Mr. President, the time to act is now, and I urge my colleagues \nto vote for this bill without any undue delay.\n  Senator Glenn will probably tell us that years before I came to the \nSenate, through resolutions he tried to bring and did successfully try \nto bring attention to this matter on the floor of this body. When I \nfirst made that attempt several years ago, it failed, as did my attempt \nlater on in 1989 to end this situation by amending the Americans With \nDisabilities Act. My amendment at that time was accepted by the then \nSenate leadership. But in a sense I think they did it because they knew \nthat they would render it ineffective in conference, and it was \nrendered ineffective in Congress. At a later time I tried to correct \nthis inequity, and I was not even allowed to offer my amendment to the \nfamily leave bill when it was first debated in the Senate in 1991.\n  Congress can no longer refuse to live by the laws that it passes. \nThis bill ends that refusal. The time then is long overdue for Congress \nto correct that practice of congressional exemption, and this bill does \nthat. It completes the process begun in 1991 when the Senate passed the \nGrassley-Mitchell amendment applying the substantive provisions of the \ncivil rights law to the Senate. As I said back then, it was a good \nbeginning, but it was only a beginning. So we are back today.\n  So it is with some measure of satisfaction that I find myself \nspeaking in favor of a bill that would finally require Congress to \ncomply with a host of employment laws that we have exempted ourselves \nfrom over four or five decades and that, during that period of time, \nhave been applied to the entire private sector.\n  Mr. President, since the 1930's, Congress has passed laws that flowed \nfrom the assumption that Washington knows best. Congress set up \nburdensome statutory requirements on the operation of small business in \nthis country. The burdens were increased through regulation issued by \nexecutive branch agencies albeit pursuant to the statute. At the same \ntime Congress repeatedly exempted itself from the effects of those \nlaws. Laws govern America but somehow do not apply the same way to \nemployment practices on the Hill. Workers were granted rights but \ncongressional workers were not. Those who made the laws did not have to \nlive by them. Congress was immune from the excesses of the regulatory \nstate. Congress was removed from the way its work affected everyone \nelse. In other words, we, because those laws did not apply to us, did \nnot really know how egregious they were upon the private sector \nemployers of this country.\n  In this country no one is above the law. But just as the Presidency \nsuffered a tremendous loss of public confidence when an individual \nthought he was above the law 20 years ago, Congress suffered as Members \nthought we were above the law by letting these exemptions or lack of \napplicability apply to us. Indeed, to me this was one of the major \nreasons why Congress has lost touch with the American people and people \nare cynical about the process of government, cynical about public \nservants doing well and intending well and understanding what needs to \nbe done.\n  Of course, this exemption was one of the ways by which Congress has \ndisplayed arrogance. Millions of Americans complained about the \noverreach of the Federal Government. But Congress, through its \nexemption from the law, could not know the depth of feeling from the \ngrassroots of America. So in November of every other year, the people \nhave an opportunity to express their view. The American people in \nNovember 1994 demanded that Congress be affected by the laws it passed. \nA number of Members who thought Congress should be above the law are no \nlonger Members, and, of course, no longer above the law.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of someone who lost an earlier election, \nformer Senator George McGovern, because he has a very good lesson to \nteach us in regard to the exemption of ourselves from laws that apply \nto the private sector. Senator McGovern believes that Congress has \nenacted unnecessary regulatory burdens that are strangling small \nbusiness. Senator McGovern admits that he did not feel that way when he \nwas a Member of this body, but he learned the reality of the operation \nof that legislation when he ran a small business after he left public \nlife. I appreciate that Senator McGovern now says that he would have \nlegislated differently had he known what the actual effects would have \nbeen as \n[[Page S446]] he found them to be applicable to his small business.\n  But Members of Congress' learning of the effects of their votes only \nafter leaving office will not solve our problem because after you leave \noffice it is too late for you as an individual to do anything about it. \nThose of us who are here today can do something to end this unfair \nsituation because only as Members of Congress live with the \nconsequences of their votes will the problem that Senator McGovern \nidentified be corrected. And I believe that S. 2 corrects that \nsituation.\n  I think that President Clinton as well has this issue exactly right. \nWhen we send this bill to him I believe, based on what he has said in \nthe past, he will sign it because he did state in a July 1992 \ninterview:\n\n       It is wrong for Congress to be able to put new requirements \n     on American businesses, employers, and then not follow that \n     rule as employers themselves. They exempt themselves \n     historically from all kinds of rules that private employers \n     have to follow. And I think that one of the things that \n     happens to people in government is they forget what it is \n     like to be governed. They do not have any idea what it is \n     like to be on the receiving end of a lot of rules and \n     regulations.\n\n  That is President Clinton as Candidate Clinton. He could not have \nsaid it any better than any of us who believe this situation is wrong \nand why it ought to be ended. And I think that is a clear-cut statement \nthat President Clinton would support our efforts today, and supporting \nthose efforts then would sign the legislation that, hopefully, we will \npass.\n  Of course, the Founding Fathers would have been astonished to know \nthat Congress had exempted itself from so many laws that it passed \napplying to the private sector. James Madison in Federalist Paper 57 \nwrote about this issue. He wrote that one of the primary guarantees of \npeople's liberty came from Congress having to live under the laws that \nwe apply to the entire Nation. Madison wrote that:\n\n       Congress can pass no law which will not have its full \n     operation on themselves and their friends as well as on the \n     great mass of society. This has always been deemed one of the \n     strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers \n     and the people together. It creates between them the \n     communion of interest of which few governments have furnished \n     examples but without which every government degenerates into \n     tyranny.\n      If this spirit ever were so debased as to tolerate a law not \n     obligatory on the legislature as well as on the people, \n     the people will be prepared to tolerate anything but \n     liberty.\n\n  That is Federalist Paper 57.\n  Mr. President, Madison was right. Of course, the low esteem in which \nCongress is currently held reflects the fact that there is no longer \ncongruence of interest between the governors and the governed. The \nAmerican people will no longer tolerate a law not obligatory on the \nlegislature as well as the people. Under Madison's principle, because \nMembers of Congress would be careful before they infringe their own \nliberties, the people's liberties would then be zealously protected.\n  Unfortunately, the corollary to that principle was equally true. \nMembers of Congress who could protect their own liberties while \ninfringing on the liberties of the mass of society were much more \nlikely, then, to fail to protect everyone else's liberties. Congress \nenjoyed privilege through exemption. The time has come to end \ncongressional royalism. The time has come then to simply say that there \nwill no longer be an environment of two sets of laws in America--one \nfor Pennsylvania Avenue and the other for the rest of the country, in \nMain Street America. No longer will there be two sets of laws, one for \nthis town and this Hill and one for the rest of the country. One set of \nAmerican people, one set of laws.\n  So now Congress must finally live under the same laws that pass for \neveryone else. We do this to fulfill Madison's promise of what was \nmeant in the Constitution. And, thus, employees of Congress will \nfinally gain the same rights that their counterparts in the private \nsector enjoy.\n  Like my colleagues, I take the notion of representative government \nvery seriously. We are not Senators for ourselves. We do not hold this \njob as a matter of personal privilege. We are here to represent the \ninterests of our constituents in our States and in our country. And we \nare here for no other reason. I think that exemptions from the \noperation of the law thus interfere with representative government. I \nwonder how we truly can represent people who live under one set of laws \nwhen we live under another set of laws. Under the current system, our \nvotes on various regulatory issues reflect our interests and not those \nof our constituents. This must change if representative government is \nto truly function as intended by Madison.\n  When we pass this bill, we begin to restore the American people's \nfaith in Congress. We will do so in five respects.\n  First, we will ensure that Members of Congress know firsthand the \nburdens that the private sector lives with. By knowing those burdens, \nCongress may decide that the laws indeed are burdensome. That \nrealization may lead to necessary reform of the underlying legislation. \nIt is true that there will be additional costs imposed on Congress if \nthis legislation passes. However, these are costs that we must realize. \nWe have to be cognizant of the fact that the private sector has to live \nwith these costs and has had to do it in some instances for the last \nsix or seven decades. And as far as the cost of this bill to Congress, \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimated that cost of compliance will \nbe about $3.4 billion. Now, while this is a considerable sum, Mr. \nPresident, it represents, for instance, only a fraction of the amount \nCongress recently voted in for a subway system to connect the Senate \noffice buildings with the Capitol.\n  The second benefit of requiring that Congress live under the laws it \npasses for others concerns future social legislation. If Congress knows \nthat it will be bound by what it passes, Congress will be very careful \nin the future to respect the liberties and rights of others.\n  Third, passage of the bill will mean that congressional employees \nwill have the civil rights and social legislation that has ensured fair \ntreatment to workers of the private sector. So then Congress thus \nbecomes the last plantation for our workers. It is time for the \nplantation worker to be liberated. Maybe it is more accurate to say \nthat Congress and the judiciary are the last two plantations. Senator \nGlenn stated that plantation point of view 20 years ago, so I give him \ncredit for that.\n  Curiously, the only people who do not have to comply with the laws \nare those who make the laws and those who decide the cases under the \nlaws, meaning the members of the judiciary. The judiciary has often \ninterpreted legislation to be burdensome, and perhaps in some instances \nto be more burdensome than even the exempt Congress intended. Of \ncourse, an exempt judiciary has no reason to interpret the statute in a \nway to protect freedom. They will have to come up with a plan to \nprovide coverage for their employees as well. I look forward to that \nproposal and to the legislation to cover the judiciary, which might \nthen really be the last plantation.\n  The fourth general result of the legislation will be public \nrecognition that Congress has again discovered that it is subject to \nthe will of the people and not the other way around. Congress will no \nlonger be above the law. Members of Congress will no longer be first-\nclass citizens with unjustifiable special privileges.\n  Fifth, Members of Congress will learn themselves of the litigation \nexplosion that is choking small business in this country. When Congress \nsees directly the litigation produced by the laws we pass, Congress \nwill be very careful about creating additional liabilities for the \nprivate sector and additional work for the Federal courts. When \nCongress sees how alternative dispute resolutions operate, maybe \nMembers of Congress will appreciate the wisdom then of encouraging \nadditional alternative dispute resolution for all sorts of claims \nbrought in the Federal courts, to reduce the burden of the Federal \ncourt, to have a way of settling disputes in a less adversarial \nenvironment and a les costly environment.\n  Every indication from polls, from election returns, and from our mail \nis that all of these show that nothing makes Americans more mad than \nknowing that they have to live by laws that their representatives in \nCongress do not have to follow. Of course, we believe they are well \njustified in their anger. When we pass this bill, we will show them \nthat we recognize the unfairness of the existing exemptions and the \nlegitimacy of their concerns.\n  [[Page S447]] Mr. President, S. 2, as we know, is the pending \nbusiness, and it is the pending business under somewhat unusual \ncircumstances, because it has not been considered by any committee in \nthis Congress. Nonetheless, I want to say that it bears a very close \nresemblance to S. 2071 from the last Congress. That bill was the \nsubject of hearings in the Governmental Affairs Committee, and it was \napproved by the committee before consideration. Unfortunately, it was \nnot possible to consider the bill before Congress adjourned, despite \nthe fact that the other body had overwhelmingly passed a similar piece \nof legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, in conclusion of my opening statement, the time is \nto act now. I hope that my colleagues will vote for this bill without \nany undue delay or any particular destructive amendments.\n  Senator Glenn is going to seek the floor in just a moment. As I \nindicated once before in this debate, when Senator Glenn was a freshman \nMember of this body he was aware of this inequitable situation. He has \nworked hard with lots of us and he worked hard before a lot of us came \nhere to bring attention to this inequitable situation, unfair \nsituation. Inequitable in the sense that we as employers do not have \nthe same laws apply to us as private sector employers do, unfair in the \nsense that congressional employees and Hill employees do not have the \nsame rights as private sector employees have under the employment and \ndiscrimination laws and safety laws that affect private--and that \nassures safety and employment fairness--sector employees.\n  Senator Glenn studied this issue hard, and I suppose in his early \ndays even had more trouble than I did in trying to get the people to \nappreciate that this dual standard of law was wrong. But he had some \nresolutions passed very early. I want to commend him for using that \nmethod to try to rectify this situation for employees on the Hill. But \nmost importantly, in the time that I have been in the Senate, I want to \nsay that I have found Senator Glenn very cooperative with my efforts to \nextend these laws. I appreciate very much his efforts to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I thank you.\n\n\n                            Floor Privileges\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jill \nSchneiderman of Senator Daschle's staff be granted floor privileges for \nthe duration of the Senate's consideration of S. 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have listened very closely to Senator \nGrassley's presentation here this afternoon. It certainly has been \nexcellent. It certainly covered the legislation in great detail. That \nwas to be expected because he has worked on this for a long time and \nhas been involved with it basically--not for press purposes--because he \nbelieves in it and because he believes in what is right for the rest of \nthe country is right for Capitol Hill. I agree with that.\n  The late great Senator Sam Ervin, who was also a great constitutional \nscholar, once said that Congress is ``like a doctor prescribing \nmedicine for a patient that he himself would not take.'' I agree with \nthat statement by Sam Ervin because by enacting laws for others and \nthen exempting ourselves we have done great damage to the public \nperception of Congress.\n  I do not find any more of a hot button item wherever I travel in Ohio \nand other parts of the country than this particular item because I find \nthat people are especially irritated that we do not have to follow the \nrules like everybody else. There were some reasons why the rules were \nexempted earlier. I will address that in just a moment. It was not done \njust to make life easier for us here. There were some genuine concerns \nabout how they would be administered. But businessmen and others--but \nespecially businessmen--tell me that we in Congress cannot understand \nthe real impact of our laws because we do not have to follow them back \nhere on Capitol Hill.\n  There is an even more important principle at stake it seems to me; \nand, that is, to continue to deprive our employees of the full \nprotection of the law is flat wrong. We passed laws for the rest of the \ncountry that said that employers should treat their employees in a \ncertain way, that OSHA laws should be at administered against \nbusinesses, institutions, colleges or public buildings or whatever, \nthat EPA would take certain actions and so on out there. But then we \nsay but we will not let those things apply here on Capitol Hill.\n  Let me be clear. I am not just talking about our legislative and our \nadministrative personnel that many people think of when you think of \nCapitol Hill staffers. We think of our administrative personnel. But we \nmust remember there are also the cleaning crews, the police, the \nrestaurant workers, the parking lot attendants, the plumbers, the \nwindow washers, and so on, all of the workers who do not enjoy the same \nrights as every other American not employed by Congress. That is what \nit comes down to. Is it right that we do this for our own people \nemployed here on Capitol Hill? Is it right that they have the same \nprotections as everyone else? I cannot come to any conclusion but that \ncertainly it is right that we pass this kind of legislation.\n  So I am very pleased that in these opening days of the 104th Congress \nwe can finally do what is right for these people and eliminate this \ncongressional double standard under which we have enacted laws that \napply to everyone but ourselves.\n  This reform is long overdue. Our efforts to apply the law on Capitol \nHill go back many years. My own personal efforts, which Senator \nGrassley referred to a little while ago, go clear back to 1978. I had \nnot been here too long. In 1978 I had been here I guess at that time \nabout 3 years. I was sworn in early 1975. I proposed a resolution to \nassure that all Senate employees would be protected against employment \ndiscrimination just as other people were all over the country, and \nexplained why we needed this resolution. I said that I viewed Congress \nas ``the last plantation.'' That got the ire of some of my colleagues. \nThey were not happy with me for making that kind of a statement. But \nthe employees knew what I said was true because we were treating \nourselves here, we were treating Capitol Hill, as the last plantation \nthat was a law only unto itself. The resolution did not pass in 1978. \nIt is only in the last few years that we have finally enacted \nsubstantial legal protection for Senate employees. Our Senate employees \nare now covered under the civil rights laws and certain other \nemployment laws. But they can take their cases to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals.\n  Despite this progress we still have an unacceptable patchwork quilt \nof coverage and exemption here on Capitol Hill. It has not been easy to \nsolve this problem. My guiding principle has been that we in Congress \nshould be subject to the same laws as applied to a business back in our \nhome State.\n  I recognize the unique nature of life on Capitol Hill, the unique \nnature of the Congress and how it does business here. So every single \nlaw cannot apply in exactly the same way as they are administered back \nhome. But most of them can. Many Members also believe that the \nConstitution requires us to preserve substantial independence of the \nSenate and of the House of Representatives--in other words, the \nseparation of powers under the Constitution. One branch does not have a \nsuperior position over another branch of Government. It is the checks \nand balances of our Government that we do not wish to throw away. The \nconcern of a lot of people about this separation of powers is not \nsimply a matter of personal prerogative or ego. For the private sector, \nthese laws are normally implemented by the executive branch and the \njudicial branch. But many Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, \nhave expressed genuine concern about politically motivated prosecutions \nthat might result if we ignore the principle of separation of powers as \nwe apply these laws to Congress.\n  Last year, the majority leader, Senator Mitchell, asked me as \nchairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee to try and find a \nbipartisan solution. I started with the excellent bill introduced last \nyear by Senators Lieberman and Grassley, and then together with them, \nwith Senators \n[[Page S448]] Lieberman, Grassley and other Senators from both sides, \nwe worked hard to reach a solution, and I think we succeeded. We \nincluded even a stronger application of the laws to Congress, and we \nalso included stronger protection of the constitutional independence of \nthe House and Senate. Our legislation won broad, bipartisan support, \nbut it was unfortunately blocked on the Senate floor in the closing \ndays of the 103d Congress.\n  I am very gratified that our solution to congressional coverage now \nstands, I believe, an excellent chance of being enacted by the new \nCongress. There have been two different bills introduced. One is the \nbill we have before us today, and the other was introduced on \ncongressional accountability yesterday by Senator Daschle, our new \nDemocratic leader, as part of a comprehensive congressional reform \nproposal. Senator Daschle's proposal includes a number of reforms of \nthe way Congress does business, including not only congressional \ncoverage, but also including measures on lobbying disclosure and gifts \nto Members.\n  These essential measures, which I support, were also blocked along \nwith congressional coverage at the end of the last Congress. That bill \nis not the one that is before us now. The bill before us now is the one \njust on congressional coverage that Senators Grassley, Dole, and \nLieberman have submitted.\n  Senator Dole has made this a top-priority legislative proposal, and I \nam very happy with that. With this strong bipartisan support that we \nhave for this legislation, I am very optimistic that congressional \ncoverage legislation can be promptly enacted--and I hope very promptly.\n  Legislation can be briefly summarized in five key elements. First, \nall of the rights and protections under the civil rights laws and other \nemployment statutes, and the public access requirements of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, would apply to the legislative branch. \nThis includes the Senate, the House of Representatives, and our support \nagencies. Second, a new compliance office would be established within \nthe legislative branch to handle claims and issue rules. This \ncompliance office would be headed by an independent five-person board \nof directors, removable only for cause and appointed by the leadership.\n  This board is a new proposal here, in that this takes away most of \nthe concerns of those people who were primarily concerned about the \nseparation of powers and what would happen if we had an overzealous \nexecutive branch of Government trying to enforce a Clean Air Act or an \nOSHA law on Capitol Hill and pushing too hard for it, wanting to exact \na pound of flesh in some other area in response. That has been a \nconcern that people have expressed throughout the years. So this board \ngoes a long way toward declaring our independence and our capability in \nmaking sure that all of the laws are adhered to here on Capitol Hill \nand making that administration of those laws the purview of this five-\nperson board of directors.\n  I think it is unfortunate that we have to create a new enforcement \nbureaucracy at a time when we are more concerned about streamlining \nGovernment. But many Members, as I say, still believe it would violate \nthe constitutional separation of powers to have the executive branch \nenforce these laws against Congress.\n  A third point. Any employee who believes there has been a violation \ncould receive counseling and mediation services from the new office. I \nwould anticipate that most of the problems could be resolved at that \ncounseling and mediation level. But if the employee's claim is not \nresolved by counseling or mediation, then the employee can carry this \nfurther. They can file a complaint with the compliance office and \nreceive a hearing and decision from a hearing officer. This decision \nmay be appealed. Then, in turn, if they are not happy with what comes \nout of the first two steps, it may be appealed to the board for the \nboard's direct action, or after that, even to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals. That is a lengthy process, but it is one that certainly gives \nthe employees all kinds of access to make sure that their complaint is \nadequately dealt with.\n  Fourth, instead of filing a complaint with the compliance office \nafter counseling and mediation, another track that can be followed is \nthat the employee may elect to go directly and sue in the U.S. district \ncourt, just as any businessman across this country can do, or any \nindividual across the country can do if they have a problem with their \nemployer, or whatever. Further, a jury trial may be requested under \nnormal applicable law.\n  Fifth, the board will appoint a general counsel who will enforce \nOSHA, collective bargaining requirements, and other laws.\n  So I am very pleased that there now appears to be bipartisan support \nfor the Congressional Accountability Act. I will certainly be as \npleased as anyone when it is finally adopted. This is not all brand \nnew, make no mistake about it. The congressional coverage legislation \nis not completely new in that congressional coverage legislation was \nadopted by the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives last \nyear. Congressional coverage legislation was sent to the Senate floor \nfrom our Governmental Affairs Committee last year. Unfortunately, it \ndied in the final days of the Senate last year in that scorched Earth \natmosphere which we all deplore, when we saw Members opposing just for \nthe sake of opposing and sometimes killing legislation they themselves \neven supported.\n  But that is behind us now and we are on to a new day here. I \ncertainly want to let everyone know that while we went through some \ntrials and tribulations last year, we are ready to move on.\n  I think the American people are ready to move on and see this kind of \nlegislation in particular get passed. That is easier said than done \nsometimes, but I think it is high time that we started to put the \nnational interests first and to calculate our actions based not on \nnarrow political calculations of today, or on who may gain more \npolitical advantage by supporting or opposing this particular piece of \nlegislation. We should be doing this on what is best tomorrow for the \nUnited States of America, for the whole country.\n  If Republicans and Democrats alike can just remember that, I think we \nare going to have a great session through this coming year. I think the \nCongressional Accountability Act is a good place to start.\n  I talked about the last plantation a little while ago. The last \nplantation, I think, we now can eliminate and bring into the 20th \ncentury with this particular piece of legislation. So I am very happy \nto be supporting it.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the remarks by my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa, he mentioned the costs and other impacts of the \nCongressional Accountability Act. I have a one-page summary of where \nthose expenses are anticipated to occur, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat this be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GLENN. Briefly summarizing, one new compliance office is \nestimated to cost about $1 million a year for 2 years during startup. \nIt will be $2 to $3 million a year thereafter, including enforcement \nprocedures and OSHA inspections.\n  Settlements and awards to employees can run from a half million to a \nmillion dollars a year.\n  Federal labor-management relations, possibly a million dollars a \nyear. We do not know on that. There is no good way to estimate that.\n  OSHA concerns are a little uncertain also, but those mainly have been \ntaken care of around Capitol Hill, so there should not be much \nexpenditure on that.\n  Applying fair labor standards to the Capitol police force will cost \nprobably around $800,000 a year or so. On other employees it was \ndifficult to estimate on that as to what the fair labor standards \napplication could bring in the way of costs.\n  Antidiscrimination laws, polygraph protection, plant closing, and \nveterans rehiring are things for which we do not anticipate there would \nbe any major expense.\n  The bottom line then is that the total estimated cost CBO has run \nout--and this was included in our Governmental Affairs report last year \nin a CBO letter at pages 44 and 49 of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee report, if anybody wants to refer to it-- \n[[Page S449]] described these costs that I just enumerated here \nbriefly, and came to the bottom line that a total estimate would be \nabout $1 million per year for the first 2 years and a $4 to $5 million \ntotal thereafter. But it is a very, very uncertain amount. So compared \nto the problem we are solving, I think that is a fairly modest \nexpenditure.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Accountability Act would apply a \nnumber of Federal workplace safety and labor laws to the operations of \nCongress. But one of the main things it also provides is the new \nadministrative process I outlined for handling complaints and \nviolations of these laws. And that is new.\n  While it is true that some of these laws have applied to Capitol Hill \nin the past, there has not been an enforcement mechanism. There has not \nbeen a way for an aggrieved employee to exercise their rights and have \njustice prevail.\n  One of the major provisions is the administrative process for \nhandling complaints that I just described a few moments ago. Let me go \nthrough once again some of the major provisions of this act.\n  First, it will have the application of workplace protection and \nantidiscrimination laws. S. 2 would apply several Federal laws \nregarding employment to the operation of legislative branch offices and \nprovide an administrative process for handling complaints and \nviolations.\n  The following laws would be applied to legislative branch employees: \nUnder the general title of antidiscrimination laws, we have title VII \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964; we have the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967; we have title I of the Americans With \nDisabilities Act of 1990; and we have the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \nThose are all under the antidiscrimination laws.\n  Next, under the general heading of public services and \naccommodations, under ADA, the Americans With Disabilities Act, under \ntitle II, the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, which prohibits \ndiscrimination in Government services provided to the public. Another \nprovision under title III, Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, \napplies to the rest of those provisions.\n  Under the general heading of workplace protection laws, the Fair \nLabor Standards Act of 1938, which concerns minimum wage, equal pay, \nmaximum hours, regulations, and protection against retaliation would \nnow apply. These regulations will be promulgated by the board that \ntracks executive branch regulations. These regulations will take into \naccount those employees whose irregular work schedules depend directly \non the Senate. There has been some concern expressed by Senators about \nhow that would work.\n  Others, under workplace protection laws, are the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act of 1970, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, the \nEmployee Polygraph Protection Act; the Worker Adjustment and Retraining \nAct, which requires a 60-day notice of office closing or mass layoffs, \nwhich would not normally apply on Capitol Hill, until you think of the \nfact that we have the Government Printing Office and the Library of \nCongress and others where such layoffs might possibly occur.\n  Another portion under the workplace protection laws is the Veterans \nReemployment Act. It grants veterans the right to return to their \nprevious employment, with certain qualifications, if reactivated or \ndrafted.\n  Further, under the general heading of labor-management relations, the \nFederal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute of 1978 would apply, \nand the application to personal or committee staff or other political \noffices would be deferred until rules are issued by the new Office of \nCompliance.\n  Under covered employees, the compliance provisions for the preceding \nlaws would apply to staff and employees of the House, the Senate, the \nArchitect of the Capitol, Congressional Budget Office, Office of \nTechnology Assessment and, of course, the newly recreated Office of \nCompliance.\n  Employees of congressional instrumentalities such as the General \nAccounting Office, Library of Congress, and Government Printing Office \nwill be covered under some of these laws but a study will be ordered to \ndiscern current application of these laws to the instrumentalities and \nto recommend ways to improve procedures. Some of these entities or \ninstrumentalities already have their own internal rules and regulations \nthat they have applied that we want to bring into harmony with this new \nlegislation, and that will be done over a little period of time.\n  Let us go through protections and procedures for remedy. The bill \nprovides the following five-step process similar to current Senate \nprocedure for employees with claims of violations of civil rights or \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. For employment discrimination laws, \nviolation of family and medical leave protection, violation of fair \nlabor standards, and violations of laws regarding polygraph protection, \nplant closings, and veterans reemployment violations, the procedure \nwould be as follows:\n  Step 1 would be a counseling service, which can last for 30 days and \nmust be requested within a 6-month statute of limitations.\n  Step 2, mediation services, which last for 30 days and must be \npursued within 15 days.\n  Step 3, if the claim cannot be resolved, then a formal complaint and \ntrial before an administrative hearing officer may ensue.\n  Step 4, after the hearing, if the party feels that they still have \nnot received proper treatment, any aggrieved party may appeal to the \nOffice of Compliance's board of directors, to the board itself. And \nthat does not even end it.\n  Step 5, if necessary, any aggrieved party may then appeal to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for normal judicial review.\n  The bill would also allow employees to bring suit in Federal district \ncourt after the mediation step, without going up to all the rest of \nthat ladder, rather than proceeding, if they choose to do that, rather \nthan proceeding to the administrative hearing and all those five steps \nI just mentioned. And if they went to district court, the remedy could \ninclude the right to a jury trial. The option to seek district court \nredress could occur only after an employee went through the counseling \nand mediation process. So that is required whatever happens and \nwhichever track the person might choose to go.\n  With respect to discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, \nor national origin, remedies would include reinstatement, back pay, \nattorneys fees, and other compensatory damages.\n  For claims under the ADA title II and title III relating to \ndiscrimination in Government services, the bill provides the following \nsteps:\n  Step 1 would be for a member of the public to submit a charge to the \ngeneral counsel of the Office of Compliance. No. 2, the general counsel \nmay call for mediation. Step 3, the general counsel may file a \ncomplaint which would go before a hearing officer for decision. Step 4 \nwould be an appeal to the board. And step 5 would be an appeal to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals.\n  For violation of OSHA, the bill provides the following procedures:\n  Step 1, employees may make a written request to the general counsel \nto conduct an inspection.\n  General counsel will also inspect all facilities at least once each \nCongress, most likely using some detailees from the Labor Department to \nhelp since they are experienced in that area. But the authority would \nrest with the general counsel to do that. Step 2, citations may be \nissued by the general counsel. Step 3, disputes regarding citations \nwill be referred to a hearing officer. Step 4, appeal of hearing \nofficer decisions go to the board. Step 5, the board may also approve \nrequests for temporary variances. Step 6, appellate court review of \ndecisions of the board, if it gets that far.\n  Now, in this area, there would be a 2-year phase-in period for the \nOSHA procedures to allow inspection and corrective action. The survey \nalso would be conducted to identify problems and to prepare for \nunforeseen budget impact. Penalties would not apply under the OSHA \nprovisions because this would result only in shifting accounts in the \nTreasury; in other words, the Government finding itself in one area and \nputting the Treasury over in the other area.\n  The following process applies to violations of collective bargaining \nlaw: \n[[Page S450]] Step 1, petitions will be considered by the board and \ncould be referred by the board to a hearing officer; step 2, charges of \nviolation would be submitted to the general counsel, who will \ninvestigate and may file a complaint. The complaint would be referred \nto a hearing officer for a decision subject to appeal to the board \nagain. Step 3, negotiation impasses would be submitted to mediators. \nStep 4, court of appeals review of board decisions will be available \nexcept where appellate review is not allowed under the Federal Service \nLabor-Management Relations Statute.\n  Now, employees who are employed in a bona fide executive, \nadministrative, or professional capacity--in other words, those \ncommittee staff or personal staff who are not covered by the minimum \nwage and maximum hour provisions--and interns, are also exempted. \nOtherwise, remedies for violations of rights of all other employees \nunder the FLSA will also include unpaid minimum or overtime wages, \nliquidated damages, and attorneys fees or costs. I note the exemption \nthere, that professional employees would not be covered in that same \nway. These remedies would apply to the nonprofessional employees only.\n  Now, let me address briefly the Office of Compliance. S. 2 will \nestablish an independent nonpartisan Office of Compliance to implement \nand oversee application of antidiscrimination worker protection laws. \nUnder rulemaking, the office will promulgate rules to implement the \nstatutes. Congress may approve and change by joint resolution rules \nissued by the office. Rules would be issued in three separate sets of \nregulations. One, the House; two, the Senate; three, joint offices and \ninstrumentalities. Rules for each Chamber would be subject to approval \nby that body, or to grant the force and effective law by joint \nresolution. Rules for joint offices and instrumentalities would be \nsubject to approval by concurrent resolution.\n  Membership. The office will be headed by a five-member board which \nwill be appointed to fixed, staggered terms of office. The board will \nbe appointed jointly by the Senate majority leader, the Senate minority \nleader, the Speaker of the House, and the House minority leader. \nMembership may not include lobbyists, Members, or staff except for \nCompliance Office employees. The Chair will be chosen by the four \nappointing authorities from within the membership of the board.\n  Settlement award reserves, payment of rewards for House and Senate \nemployees, will be made from a new single contingent appropriations \naccount. All settlements and judgments must be paid from funds \nappropriated to the legislative branch and not from a Governmentwide \njudgment account. There will be no personal liability on the part of \nMembers.\n  Mr. President, I think that is a rather complete rundown of this. I \nthink it is only fair we apply the laws to our employees here on \nCapitol Hill that are applied to the rest of the country. I hope we can \nhave this legislation approved very shortly. I hope we can keep \namendments to a minimum. I do not know whether there are any amendments \nproposed to be brought up this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Summary of Costs and Other Impacts of Congressional Accountability Act\n\n       The CBO letter, at pages 44-49 of the GAC Report (and the \n     CBO letter for the House bill) describes the following costs:\n       1. New compliance office: $1 million/year for 2 years, \n     during start-up.\n       $2-3 million/year thereafter, including enforcement \n     procedures and OSHA inspections.\n       2. Settlements and awards to employees: $0.5-1 million/\n     year.\n       3. Federal labor-management relations: $1 million/year for \n     lawyers and personnel officers.\n       4. OSHA: Existing standards--will require change in \n     practices rather than significant additional space or cost.\n       Possible future standards--e.g., ergonomic equipment; air \n     quality--without specific standards, cost cannot be \n     predicted.\n       5. Fair Labor Standards: Capitol police--$0.8 million/year.\n       Other employees--CBO could not estimate.--CBO assumed the \n     compliance office would have wide discretion in establishing \n     rules and in allowing compensatory time in-stead of overtime. \n     This is incorrect: bill requires private-sector rules.\n       6. Anti-discrimination laws--no additional cost, because \n     these requirements already apply under statutes or rules.\n       7. Polygraph protection--no effect; polygraphs are not \n     used.\n       8. Plant closing--no effect; no mass layoffs are \n     anticipated.\n       9. Veterans rehiring--not scored by CBO; added to the \n     legislation this year.\n       Total Estimate: $1 million/year for the 2 years, $4-5 \n     million/year thereafter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I rise in support \nof the bill.\n  Mr. President, it has been my privilege to have been cochairman of a \nworking group with Senator Grassley to try to pull together various \nparts of this legislation and help get it to the floor.\n  I am fully cognizant of the fact that those of us who are newcomers \nto this legislative process, indeed, stand on the shoulders of giants. \nThere have been so many who have done so much in this area: Senator \nGrassley, Senator Lieberman, Senator Glenn and others. I am delighted \nto be a part of that, and to be part of this strong bipartisan effort \nhere in my first opportunity to address this body.\n  Mr. President, Senators Grassley and Glenn have very aptly gone over \nthe details of this legislation. It is indeed complex. It involves \nseveral pieces of complex litigation and applicability to those already \nexisting laws. They have gone over this in detail. I will not.\n  I would like to make some basic observations, however, starting with \nthe proposition that the people spoke in a very loud voice in this last \nelection. We can disagree as to what the people were saying in many \nrespects, and we do. We have spent a lot of time trying to interpret \nthe voice of the people in these last few weeks. However, I think there \nis one thing we cannot or should not disagree on. That is, in large \npart, they were saying that they want a change of the way we have done \nbusiness in Washington, DC, Mr. President, specifically in the Congress \nof the United States.\n  I cannot think of a better example of the way that we have been doing \nbusiness in times past than this whole business of exempting Congress \nfrom the laws that other people have to live under. So today, I think \nthat what this bill does is take a step in the right direction. It \ntakes a step away from that and toward accountability. It stands for \nthe basic proposition that those who make the laws in this country have \nto live under the laws that they make, as other citizens do.\n  Those of us who have just come off the campaign trail, perhaps, have \nan additional insight into this matter. Those here with us today have \nspoken many times and labored in the vineyard for many years on this \nbill. Those of us on the other end of the spectrum have just come from \nbeing a part of campaigns where the people's voice was most recently \nheard.\n  Mr. President, not only are the people in America for this \nlegislation, the people in America demand this legislation. I would \nsuggest that the people in my State of Tennessee, and I would guess the \npeople across this Nation, wonder why it took so long to pass a \nproposition that seems to be so imbued in basic common sense. So \nperhaps that day has changed. I hope we are winning it now, as I speak.\n  Mr. President, in the first place, it is the fair thing to do. That \nhas been so aptly discussed and described by earlier speakers today. \nSecond, Mr. President, I would like to bring up an additional point, \nand that is, in my observation, the people of this country, in many \nrespects, are unfortunately losing confidence in our country's \ninstitutions. People more and more, I believe, Mr. President, are \nfeeling alienated from their Government in this country. I think that \nthat certainly has to do with the Congress of the United States. I \nbelieve that people more and more feel that the Congress has lost touch \nwith people who work hard, pay their taxes, obey the laws and \nregulations, and are seldom heard from except when additional revenues \nare needed.\n  So, I believe that this legislation is the first of many reforms that \nwe will be discussing here in the next several days that will help \nrestore the confidence that the people must have in the people's branch \nof Government, the Congress of the United States. We cannot stop this \ncynicism and this feeling of alienation, Mr. President, by ourselves. \nBut the Congress of the United States can stop contributing to it.\n  [[Page S451]] Mr. President, I believe in the years to come that this \nbody will be a messenger of bad news to the American people if we do \nour job, if we are responsible. When we look at the economic picture \ndown the road, when we look at the budgetary problems we will be facing \nin this country, we will not always have good news to bring to the \nAmerican people.\n  I believe the American people are up to it. However, I believe when \nwe deliver that message, the American people must be able to trust the \nmessenger, and I think, again, that is what we are about here today, \nthe first step in that process.\n  In addition to those reasons, I think that another pretty commonsense \nproposition applies, and that is that, if the Congress of the United \nStates had to live under the laws they passed for everybody else, maybe \nwe would not have so many laws and, thereby, maybe we would not have so \nmany regulations.\n  I think it has become entirely too easy in this country, in this \nCongress, to spend other people's money and regulate other people's \nlives. That is what I believe Congress has spent too much time on for \ntoo many years.\n  I think for the first time under this legislation, Members of \nCongress, who understandably are concerned with cost, understandably \nare concerned with inconvenience and all of these other things, for the \nfirst time will start to realize the problems that people out in the \ncountry who have to live under these laws have experienced. And maybe, \njust maybe, we might want to, in the future, reconsider some of the \nlaws that have already been passed and some of the regulations that \nhave been promulgated pursuant to those laws.\n  I think, in looking at this legislation, legislation of much detail, \nmuch work, that there are a couple basic criteria that I look for:\n  No. 1, that it be comprehensive, and when I study this legislation, I \nsee that every comparable law here is, indeed, applied to Congress.\n  Second, there must be access to the court system. I examined this \nlegislation and, indeed, we do have access to the court system. Those \nbringing actions against the officers and Members of Congress of the \nUnited States, indeed, have court access. It is not just the laws under \nthis legislation that will apply to Congress but the regulations will \nalso.\n  Also, Congress under this legislation does not exempt itself from the \nnumerical limitations that are afforded to small businesses which would \nexempt Congress from coverage under many of these laws. So I think we \nare moving in the right direction.\n  Is the legislation perfect? I would say not. Could it go further? \nIndeed, I would like to see it go a bit further, but I think that we \ncan revisit this at times in the future. I think the question of \nultimate liability is something that perhaps needs to be revisited. \nSurely we can come up with a solution whereby Congressmen and \nCongresswomen and Members of the Senate are not faced with imminent \nbankruptcy constantly, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the \ntaxpayers are not left with a bill that we might run up on them.\n  I would think that, with the use of insurance and other measures, we \ncould do better perhaps than that. But I think this is a strong--very \nstrong--first step in the right direction. I wholeheartedly support it, \nnot only because it is the right thing to do, but it will be to the \nbenefit of the American people and, I believe, to the ultimate benefit \nprimarily of the Congress of the United States. Thank you.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to rise in support of this measure and \nam delighted not only to join the real pioneers in this effort--Senator \nGlenn and Senator Grassley--but to speak after our new colleague, the \nSenator from Tennessee, who has spoken eloquently. I am privileged to \nwork with him on a bipartisan basis on behalf of this bill.\n  He made reference to the elections that just occurred and the message \nthat was sent to us. I was thinking after this election, there is an \nold story about a politician who lost an election by a lot, he got \nclobbered. In the traditional election night speech, he got up and \nsaid, ``The people have spoken, but did they have to speak so loudly?''\n  I think the answer in this case is, obviously, the people did feel \nthey had to speak loudly, and what they were speaking for was change, \nchange in the status quo and, I think, demanding a Government that \nresponds to their problems, that deals efficiently with those responses \nand that, most of all, gets its own house in order.\n  I do not know what my colleagues may have found as they were out \nthere this year. I was out there myself, grateful for the support of \nthe people of Connecticut to send me back here. But I found an \nincreasing number of people--and I would say it is a majority out \nthere--who really do not care whether you are Republican or Democrat. \nWhat they care about is what you are doing and what have you done. They \nare not going to judge by labels, as so often happens. They are going \nto judge by the record of accomplishment or lack of accomplishment.\n  All of that brings me to this measure, which I think is at the heart \nof responding to the demand for a change in the status quo, for a \ndemand to a leaner, more responsive Congress, to a demand for \nlegislation that reflects the real world, that reflects the thinking of \nMembers of Congress who understand what is happening out there and who \nplay by the same rules that everybody else plays by, who are forced to \nlive by the same rules that everybody else lives by, and that will act \non a bipartisan basis in the interest of America. I think all of that \ncomes together in this piece of legislation.\n  The measure we are considering today, S. 2, is an improved version of \nthe successive congressional compliance measures which Senator Grassley \nand I authored last year, beginning with S. 2071. This latest bill, if \nenacted, will, as those who have spoken before me said, apply to \nCongress and its support offices all of the laws regarding civil \nrights, fair labor practices, disability, family medical leave, \nveterans, reemployment, health and safety that Congress has applied \nover the years to the executive branch of the Government and to the \nprivate sector as well.\n  Every public opinion poll that I have seen--to tell you the truth you \ndo not need a public opinion poll, it is kind of common sense--\nindicates that the people of America are ardent, enthusiastic, just \nabout unanimous in their support of this legislation.\n  I am greatly encouraged that the leaders of this new Congress have \nplaced this bill at the forefront of our business for the opening days \nof this session. This is a measure that passed the House overwhelmingly \non a bipartisan basis last year and was stopped from coming up here at \nthe closing day of the 103d Congress on a procedural objection, an \nunusually and rarely used procedural objection.\n  But the mood is different this year. I think passing this bill will \nshow that we have collectively realized that Congress simply cannot \ncontinue to do its business as usual and we can no longer live above \nthe law. It is not just that the public will not stand for it, they \nshould not stand for it, and we should not stand for this kind of \ndouble standard. It undercuts the basic trust that is a precondition of \nour democracy, the trust that has to exist between those who are \nprivileged to serve and govern and those who are governed, those who \nsend us here to represent them.\n  Mr. President, we must pass this bill with strong enforcement, \nincluding the right for claims to be heard in court, not just because \nit has symbolic value but because it is right. By passing this bill, we \ndemonstrate a commitment to the principles that are in all the laws \nthat we have applied to the private sector.\n  At the end of June 1994, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwhich I am privileged to serve on, held a hearing on this subject and \ntook a close look at all the issues involved. The committee realized \nthat there is a complex problem that requires well-considered \nsolutions, particularly to the general problem of uneven coverage.\n  So we went ahead, Senator Grassley and I, Senator Glenn and other \nmembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee, and worked on some ways \nto solve these problems. Since then, this group, and others, has done \neverything \n[[Page S452]] possible to address the tough legal and constitutional \nissues in a way that is fair to our employees. It forces us to live in \nthe real world according to the real law but also has some respect for \nthe special constitutional status of the legislative branch.\n  The bill that we are considering today builds upon that committee \nsubstitute to H.R. 4822, which was reported out by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee last September. I think this bill remains true to \nvirtually all the defining principles and provisions found in H.R. \n4822. Like that bill, this measure we are considering establishes an \nindependent office to function as a legislative branch equivalent of \nthe executive enforcement agencies.\n  Substituting this independent agency for the executive agencies, I \nthink, responds to a genuine argument, which is separation of powers \nand, in another sense, ends Congress' ability to sit or hide behind the \nseparation of powers argument as an excuse for inaction.\n  We have dealt with that argument. We have solved that problem. There \nis no longer that constitutional excuse or argument for inaction.\n  Some of the strongest arguments that were made against this measure \ncan also I think be put to bed now. At times opponents claimed it would \ncost billions to implement and even require the construction of new \noffice buildings by Congress. But the testimony that the committee \nreceived in June as well as CBO's analysis of the committee-reported \nbill showed that such fears are not well founded. There is no new OSHA \nspace requirement for offices, projecting the impact of the provisions \nof this bill. Indeed, the Architect of the Capitol and the \nCongressional Budget Office have anticipated little, if any, additional \nexpense for OSHA compliance.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation will really go a long way, \nor at least, let me put it this way, at the outset of the 104th \nCongress take the large first step in the direction of restoring the \npublic's trust in this institution.\n  The history of this and companion legislation is interesting. As I \nlooked back at the record, 1938 was the first time that Congress \nexempted itself from coverage under a relevant Federal employment law \nwhen it passed the Fair Labor Standards Act. Congressional staff were \nnot covered by the wage and hour provisions contained in that act. And \nthat precedent, unfortunately, became a tradition of congressional \nself-exemption from Federal employment laws over the course of the \nsucceeding 56 years since 1938. Right now, Congress is wholly or \npartially exempt from the relevant provisions of the 11 major Federal \nemployment laws with which this bill deals.\n  Senator Glenn, as I have indicated earlier, in 1978 really was the \npioneer here in authoring a bill that sought to correct this problem. \nIn 1991, Senator Grassley and then Senate Majority Leader Mitchell \ncoauthored the Government Employees Rights Act, also known as GERA, \nwhich gave employees of the Senate partial coverage under the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967, \nand the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. GERA created this \nOffice of Senate Fair Employment Practices, and an administrative \ncomplaint process administered by the office designed to fill the role \nof the Federal district courts as set forth in the statutes in \nquestion. It also provided Senate employees with a review of their \ndecisions in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. President, Members of Congress are still faced with the fact that \nthere is more to do, and that is what the legislation before us intends \nto do. Private sector employers are particularly and understandably \nangry and aggrieved by the knowledge that Congress does not subject \nitself to the most demanding legal and regulatory burdens that Congress \nimposes on them, particularly the small business community.\n  Congressional exemption from Federal employment laws I think has also \nhad an adverse effect on the legislative branch work force and its \nright to equal protection under the law. This is not just a matter of \nsymbolism. It is not even just a matter of equity, though it is a \nmatter of equity. This is kind of a reverse of the golden rule here in \nthis case. This bill is saying let us do unto ourselves as we have done \nunto others. But beyond those principles, there is a real problem out \nthere and that is the rights of those who work for us, for the \nCongress.\n  The Architect of the Capitol, for instance, which has no independent \nenforcement of its OSHA program, is plagued by one of the highest \nworker compensation claim rates of all the Federal agencies. Employees \nof the Senate exempted from the Fair Labor Standards Act have no \nguaranteed means of securing financial or other compensation for \novertime. No employee of the House of Representatives or the Senate may \nbring a civil action in Federal district court to remedy violations of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other Federal antidiscrimination \nstatutes, all of which provide employees in the private sector with \nexactly that right to pursue their grievances in Federal court.\n  So there is a real problem out there. This is not symbolism. It is \nnot just principle, though both of those are important. There is a real \nproblem of our workers. The vast majority of legal inequities that may \nbe endured by employees of the House and Senate can be remedied at \nminimal cost to the Congress by adoption of this measure.\n  Mr. President, I would briefly like to focus on some of the \nconstitutional concerns that have been raised. Most frequently, again, \nwe have heard about the separation of powers argument, but using this \nbroad-based argument I think distorts the historical intent of the \nseparation of powers doctrine. The basic idea is to limit each branch \nto a certain set of powers subject to checks by the other two branches \nso that no one branch can accumulate a level of power that becomes \ntyrannical in its effect on the public or the private citizen.\n  In Buckley versus Valeo, a 1975 case, the Supreme Court, citing the \nhistory of the separation of powers principle, wrote:\n\n       James Madison, writing in the Federalist Paper No. 47, \n     defended the work of the Framers against the charge that \n     these three governmental powers were not entirely separate \n     from one another in the proposed Constitution. He asserted \n     that while there was some admixture, the Constitution was \n     nonetheless true to Montesquieu's well-known maxim that the \n     legislative, executive and judicial departments ought to be \n     separate and distinct.\n\n  And they went on to say that it was a demonstration of Montesquieu's \nmeaning when he wrote:\n\n       When the legislative and executive powers are united in the \n     same person or body, there can be no liberty, because \n     apprehensions may arise lest the same monarch or senate \n     should enact tyrannical laws to execute them in a tyrannical \n     manner.\n\n  In other words, the separation of powers principle was to preclude \nany one branch of the Federal Government from seizing a degree of power \nthat could be used against another branch of the Government or the \ncitizenry in a tyrannical fashion without check from the other branch.\n  But this was affected by another view of Madison which goes right to \nthe point of this legislation, writing in Federalist 47 that the \nseparation of powers principle was not designed to insulate one branch \nof the Government or its servants from the rule of law. In other words, \neach branch was to be strong and independent, to resist a \ncentralization of power.\n But that did not mean that anyone branch of the Government or its \nservants should be above the law or exempted from the law. And in \nFederalist 57, Madison wrote the Congress can make no law which will \nnot have its full operation on themselves and their friends as well as \non the great mass of the society. ``This has always been deemed''--and \nI am continuing with Madison's words--``one of the strongest bonds by \nwhich human policy can connect the rulers and the people together. It \ncreates between them the communion of interest and sympathy of \nsentiments, of which few governments have furnished examples but \nwithout which every government denigrates into tyranny. If it be asked \nwhat is to restrain the Congress from making legal discriminations in \nfavor of themselves and a particular class of society, I answer,'' \nMadison said, ``the genius of the whole system. The nature much just \nand constitutional laws. And above all the vigilant and manly spirit \nwhich actuates the \n[[Page S453]] people of America, a spirit which nourishes freedom and \nin return is nourished by it. If this spirit is ever so far debased as \nto tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature as well as on the \npeople,'' Madison wrote, ``the people will be prepared to tolerate \nanything but liberty.''\n  Powerful words from one of the great founders and framers of our \ncountry. I think they speak to us today because history has taken us in \na direction that he feared but did not believe would occur. And it is \nthat drift that brings us to introduce this legislation so that Members \nof Congress and the institution will not be above and separate from the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, a final point, if I may, on the question of cost. \nBecause this new bill was just introduced yesterday, there clearly has \nnot been time to receive a cost estimate from the Congressional Budget \nOffice. Yet I would suggest to my colleagues that it is fair and \nreasonable to draw some pretty firm conclusions from the CBO estimate \nof the bill reported by the Governmental Affairs Committee last \nSeptember because this measure is so similar to that measure. We also \nreceived a cost estimate from CBO on last year's House-passed bill and \nthe estimates CBO arrived at in both cases were far, far lower--not \nonly than the opponents of the measure feared--but, frankly, than most \nof the supporters of legislation expected or thought possible.\n  CBO estimated that both versions, the House-passed version last year \nand the one reported out of Governmental Affairs, would cost about $1 \nmillion for the first 2 years of effect, as the new independent office \ngears up, and $4 to $5 million in the third, fourth and fifth years. \nMuch of the cost expected in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 is the cost of \nworking out collective bargaining agreements. So once the cost of that \nis taken care of, the overall price tag should actually dip back down \nby the beginning of the second 5-year budget cycle of effect.\n  When you look at the total cost figures projected, I think we also \nhave to realize that the Senate and House offices of fair employment \npractices will already cost us almost $1.2 million in this fiscal year. \nSo the marginal cost of the bill we are considering would be even less \nthan the CBO estimate.\n  Mr. President, in the bill's most expensive year as projected by CBO, \nfiscal year 1998--which would have been, under last year's estimate the \n4th year of effect, projected legislative branch spending would be in \nthe neighborhood of $2.5 billion. Therefore, as a percentage of our \ntotal operating budget for that year, the bill reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee--according to the CBO estimate--would \nonly have amounted to 1/5 of 1 percent of the total operating budget of \nthe Congress. I think that figure is worth repeating. The cost of the \nbill would be 1/5 of 1 percent in the year when the bill would have \nbeen most expensive. Allocating that tiny fraction of our annual budget \nwould enable Congress to comply with the same laws that we force \neveryone else to live with, to repair the ruptured relationship between \nthis institution and the people who control it, for whom we work, and \nto do what is right.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text--noting the \npresence of my friend and colleague from Alaska here--the full text of \nmy speech be printed in the Record as read.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to support this bill because I \nsupport a continuation of our efforts to bring Congress under the same \nlaws that apply to the private sector. But I have some serious \nreservations about this proposal. Contrary to what my friend from \nConnecticut has just said, I think that the estimates for the cost of \nthis proposal are absurd.\n  Next week we are going to consider a bill to ban unfunded mandates on \nStates and local governments. Today, we are considering a bill to \ncreate an unfunded mandate for Congress to be paid for by the taxpayer.\n  The Rules Committee is already in the process of cutting 15 percent \nfrom the budgets of every committee in the Senate. We have been asked \nto cut $200 million from the congressional budget over the next 2 \nyears. But I have not heard anyone suggest where we are going to get \nthe money we need to pay for this bill, in light of these cuts that we \nalready face. And, contrary to what you have just heard and what many \npeople believe, I believe complying with the laws contained in this \nbill is going to cost the taxpayers a lot of money. If it will not, why \nare all of the business people of this country complaining about the \napplication of these laws to them now?\n  We have just heard that it is going to cost us $1 million a year. I \nam making the Senate a commitment as the new Senate Rules Committee \nchairman, we will keep track of the costs of this bill year by year, \nand report them to the Senate.\n  In 1991, with my support, we brought the Senate under the following \nlaws that are contained in this bill: The Civil Rights Act, the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination Act, and the \nRehabilitation Act. Congress included itself in the Family and Medical \nLeave Act when it passed that law. We still do not know what those will \ncost the Congress.\n  In the last Congress I joined then-chairman of the Rules Committee, \nmy good friend from Kentucky, Chairman Ford at that time, directing the \nArchitect of the Capitol to bring the Senate wing of the Capitol into \ncompliance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act.\n  The Architect is now at work on that with the Department of Labor to \nbring us into compliance. We do not know what the cost will be. The 5-\nyear cost of our current compliance efforts under one--one thing alone, \nemployment discrimination laws, will be about $5 million. And I think \nthese are just a fraction of the spending that will be needed to bring \nabout compliance with this bill.\n  I am not against the concept. I think we should face the same laws we \nimpose on the private sector. But we should not stand here and say that \nthis estimate of $1 million a year is a reliable estimate. We should \nkeep in mind the congressional bureaucracy alone created by this bill \nwill cost at least $15 million over the 5 five years. And it does not \ninclude the cost of damage awards and attorneys' fees. But don't \nforget, the taxpayers must pay these costs.\n  We are trying to apply the same laws to Congress that apply to the \nprivate sector. But again I say to the Senate, if it will cost so \nlittle to apply them to the Congress, why is the American public in the \nprivate sector complaining so loudly? The estimates we are getting are \nlike a lot of other estimates we get from the Congressional Budget \nOffice, in my opinion. And we are going to keep track of them for the \nSenate. That is why I am here now. I want to make the commitment to the \nSenate. We are going to watch the costs under this bill. We are going \nto report them every year. And I am going to ask the Senate to take \naction to modify some of these laws for both the private sector and the \nCongress when I show what it really costs the Congress to comply with \nthese laws.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the \nCongressional Accountability Act. I really cannot believe that we are \ndebating this issue as if it is something we might or might not do in \nlight of what happened on November 8. It is this kind of reform which \nwill help restore Congress as the truly representative body it was \nintended to be.\n  The fact that Congress has routinely exempted itself from laws and \nregulations which affect virtually every other person, business, and \norganization in the land says volumes about the arrogance of power, \nabout the insulation of Washington from the real world, about the gulf \nwhich has come to exist between the people and those who are elected to \nrepresent them.\n  [[Page S454]] The Congressional Accountability Act is closely related \nto several of the other things that were discussed in the Contract With \nAmerica, such things as overburdened regulations, such things as term \nlimitations.\n  You know, many of us in Congress have our own stories that we can \ntell from back in the real world. I was, among other things, a \ndeveloper. I can remember one time, in order to get, down on the coast \nfor a six-story development, a dock permit, I had to check with 26 \nFederal and State agencies in order to get that permit. It could have \njust as well been done with one.\n  And I think therein lies one of the better arguments for term limits. \nThe fact if you have people who are out in the real world and know what \nthe tough regulations are and what they do to your competitiveness, \nthen they would not behave the way they do.\n  I understand that earlier today our colleague from Iowa told the \nstory about George McGovern. And I remember that so well, because I was \nthere when the statement was made that after a lifetime in public \nservice he had this burning desire to fulfill a lifetime dream and \nbuild that hotel. I guess it was in Connecticut. And he built it. And \nthen, before he knew it, the health department started beating him up, \nthe IRS started beating him up, and the EPA started beating him up, and \nhe went into, I believe, Chapter 11. I would have to paraphrase him. \nBut the exact quote was given by the Senator from Iowa this morning, \nthe thrust of which is, If I had known how tough it was in the real \nworld, I would have voted differently when I was in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, to take another example. We ought to recall the very \nillustrative experience that one of my colleagues from the other body, \nRepresentative John Boehner, experienced, where he invited an inspector \nfrom OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, to come \nin and look at his three-room office that he had there in the, I \nbelieve it was, Cannon Office Building. When they did, they found six \nsafety violations, including a lack of an evacuation plan.\n  I might suggest to my colleagues that if we do not pass this bill, we \nmight all want to install an evacuation plan in our offices.\n  They went on to look at some of the other areas of Government right \nhere in the Capitol, I believe, in the Architect's Office. They said \nthat in the event that we had to comply with the OSHA requirements, \nthat it would cost over $1 million to come up to compliance.\n  And there is a historic precedence for this. James Madison, in his \nwriting in 1788 in the Federalist Papers, said:\n\n       Congress can make no law which would not have its full \n     operation on themselves and their friends as well as on the \n     great mass of society. This has always been deemed one of the \n     strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers \n     and the people together. Without this communion of interests, \n     every government degenerates into tyranny.\n\n  Those like Madison who wrote our Constitution intended that Members \nof Congress would not be part of some elitist aristocracy, out of touch \nwith the people, insulated from the real world. Rather, they intended \nMembers of Congress to be themselves the same farmers and shopkeepers \nand business men and business women and merchants who expected to \ndeserve the Government that we finally got--``of the people, by the \npeople, and for the people.''\n  With this reform, this Congressional Accountability Act, we will take \none small step following so many others in our history to help ensure \nthat such a Government shall not perish from the Earth.\n  This reform, like our reform of the discharge petition process--Mr. \nPresident, you remember that well from the other body--will serve as a \npredicate for many other reforms that we surely will be considering and \nare really adamantly demanded by the people as a result of the \nrevolution of November 8.\n  I cannot imagine there is one Member of this body who would go back \nto his State and look a constituent in the eye and say, ``We will take \ncare of you. We know what is best for you. You just do what we say. And \nyet, that is not going to apply to us. You know, we live in an ivory \ntower with impenetrable walls, so we are insulated from many things \nthat you folks are not insulated from.''\n  This eliteness was shot down in the revolution of November 8.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleagues, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Glenn, Senator Lieberman, and others, for their fine \nwork on this piece of legislation.\n  I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I \nassume that includes you, Mr. President, are going to be caucusing at \n3:15. And I certainly will not take more than 10 minutes, if that.\n  Mr. President, a little later on, it would be my honor to be on the \nfloor with an amendment with Senator Levin, and, I am sure, Senator \nFeingold, Senator Lautenberg, I know the minority leader also feels \nvery strongly about this. I think it will be a very important amendment \nwhen we do have the debate on this amendment before the Senate.\n  This amendment deals with lobbying disclosure, but with a special \nfocus on the gift ban. This is a piece of legislation that probably \nSenator Levin and Senator Cohen, among others, have exerted tremendous \nleadership on.\n  My strong interest in this, Mr. President, has been on the gift ban \npart. I have heard my colleagues for the last several hours speak with \na considerable amount of eloquence about the mood in the country. I \nthink probably Senator Glenn from Ohio did this as well as any would \nwhen he talked about how strongly he feels about this piece of \nlegislation and the fact that it is above and beyond the politics of it \nall; that is to say, it certainly does not look very good when we try \nto live by other workplace rules than the people that we represent.\n  Well, I think from the point of view of the right thing to do, and \nthat is what Senator Glenn has focused on, this piece of legislation is \nextremely important. But, Mr. President, if we are going to talk about \ncongressional accountability, I think that we can do much better.\n  I believe that this amendment, which will later on be on the floor of \nthe Senate at least before this bill is finally voted up or down that \ndeals especially with the gift ban, is extremely important.\n  Mr. President, when my colleagues talked about what they have heard \nback home from the people they represent in our different States, I can \njust tell you that in the cafes in Minnesota, there just is not even \nany debate about the following proposition. And the following \nproposition is as follows: It is just simply wrong for Senators to be \nreceiving gifts in the form of paid trips for recreation or meals or \ntickets to athletic games, or whatever the case, from lobbyists and \nothers.\n  I mean, Mr. President, to the 99.99 percent of people in the country, \nit is wrong because this, to them, represents a process where people \nattempt to buy access, to buy influence. Though I am not talking about \nthe individual wrongdoing of any Senator, because I do not think that \nthat is the issue and I would certainly hope that there is very little \nof that, or maybe in the best of all worlds none of that, the fact of \nthe matter is that this amendment which, in part, deals with ending \nthese gifts, the giving of these gifts and the taking of these gifts, \nis an amendment that has everything in the world to do with \naccountability.\n  Mr. President, we can do a lot of things to change the political \nculture here in Washington. We can do a lot of things to make this \npolitical process more open and more honest and more accountable. We \ncan do a lot of things to rebuild the trust of people in this political \nprocess. But, Mr. President, I just will tell you, and I would say this \nto my colleagues as well, that cutting committees or cutting some staff \nmay be fine. It may be the appropriate thing to do. Certainly, the \nfocus on living by the same workplace rules is a huge step in the right \ndirection. But if we are serious about making this process more \naccountable and more open and more \n[[Page S455]] honest and a process that the people can more believe in, \nthen there is not one reason in the world why Senators, on this bill, \nwould not want to make us accountable. It is called the Congressional \nAccountability Act.\n  One of the ways we can be accountable to the people we represent is \nto say to them in no uncertain terms that we are not going to be at the \nreceiving end of these gifts. We are not going to take them, not \nbecause necessarily taking these gifts that are sometimes lavished upon \nus has anything to do with any kind of corruption, but rather because \nwe know it does not look good, we know Senators do not need it, and we \nknow people want to have trust in this process. We will simply say to \nthem by passing this amendment that, indeed, we agree with the people \nwe represent on this question.\n  Mr. President, one of the interesting things about this amendment, of \ncourse, is that toward the very end of the very end, indeed, the very \nend of the last Congress, the 103d Congress, while there was some \ndisagreement about some features of the lobby disclosure gift ban \nbill--and I want to focus just on the gift ban part, because that is \nwhat I have been working on for several years--as a matter of fact, \ntoward the very end of the session, I believe that the majority leader, \nalong with 36 or 37 of his colleagues, came out on the floor, \nsupporting the gift ban provision. So there is strong bipartisan \nsupport. I have somewhere in my documents the names of every Senator \nwho supports that gift ban, Democrats and also Republicans.\n  So from my point of view, it is the beginning of the session. I do \nnot think it is just my point of view, but I think it will be the point \nof view of colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I think it has to \nbe the point of view of colleagues on both sides of the aisle because \nit is the collective point of view of people within our country that if \nwe are going to get off to the right start--and we will talk about \nreform, and we will say we want to make this process more open and \naccountable, and we will talk about congressional accountability--then \nthere is not one reason for any further delay in getting serious about \naccountabilities. I do look forward, later on, with Senator Levin and \nthe minority leader, and Senators Feingold and Lautenberg, and I am \nsure other Senators as well on both sides of the aisle, to having this \ndiscussion.\n  I certainly hope that my colleagues will vote for this very important \namendment. Mr. President, I will not argue that this amendment will be \nthe final step that we should take. I think it greatly strengthens this \nbill. We have been putting off this gift ban for too long a period of \ntime. Over and over and over again, we have put off taking action on \nit. I think that that is unconscionable. I think we want people to \nbelieve in this institution. I think we want people to believe in the \nlegislation we pass. And I think the way that that will happen is when \npeople believe in the political process. That is what this amendment is \nall about.\n  Now, I do hope that some time in the near future, we can also deal \nwith another part of this which has to do with campaign finance reform. \nI think, ultimately, if we want to talk about accountability, the whole \nmix of money and politics is another part of the equation, and I do \nlook forward to that discussion and that debate and those amendments \nwhen that happens on the floor of the Senate, as well.\n  But, again, Mr. President, I do not want to take up any more time. I \nunderstand that my colleagues are going to be maybe breaking for \nconference, at least on the other side, and if other Senators want to \nspeak right now, I will be glad to simply be done.\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude my remarks for now. I see other \nSenators on the floor. I hope I did not take too much time. I wanted to \nalert Senators that this amendment will be coming up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. I \nrealize there is a conference pending at approximately 3:15. I would \nlike to have my views heard on this very important piece of legislation \nwhich I strongly support.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Grassley on the fine job he has done \nin his leadership on this issue. I am in very strong support of S. 2, \nthe Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. Mr. President, I am \npleased that the Senate is now addressing itself to this issue, \nfinally. It is a very important matter, assuring that Congress obeys \nthe same laws by which it requires the rest of the Nation to abide. \nThat is certainly not an unreasonable approach to take, I think.\n  It is an issue in which I have long been interested, and I am pleased \nto have served with Senator Grassley on the Senate Republican working \ngroup that developed the proposal that is now embodied as S. 2.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware that public opinion polls, whether we \nlike it or not, consistently report that the American people hold \nCongress as an institution in very low regard. The people's lack of \nesteem for Congress is based in large part on the perception that \nCongress is an arrogant and imperial body that has placed itself above \nthe law. We should not be doing things to enhance that perception. It \nshould be the opposite.\n  Unfortunately, in modern times at least, this perception has been \nwell grounded in reality. For decades, Congress has routinely--\nroutinely--exempted itself from a wide range of laws governing such \nmatters as civil rights, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, \nworkplace safety, and on and on and on.\n  In a very real sense, then, Congress indeed has placed itself above \nthe law. That decidedly was not what the Founding Fathers of our great \nNation intended. They have been amply quoted here, and there is the \npossibility of repetition; I would like to quote a couple of more \ntimes. In Federalist No. 57, Madison assured the American people that \nunder the Constitution, Congress would not abuse its lawmaking power \nbecause ``it can make no law which will not have its full operation on \nthemselves and their friends.''\n  So Madison was very clear about that. Later, as a Member of the first \nCongress, Mr. Madison spoke on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives about the important principle that all laws should be \nmade to operate as much on the lawmakers as upon the people.\n  It is amazing when you go back and read the words of these founders, \nMr. President. They were so brilliant, and so many times we walk away \nfrom their logic. It is interesting to hear contemporaries interpret \ntheir words almost 180 degrees differently from what they intended when \nthe Founders wrote them.\n  Mr. President, Madison was not alone in articulating this principle \nthat Congress should not be above the law, but rather under it. And in \nhis manual of parliamentary practice, Thomas Jefferson, another pretty \nwell-known founder, noted that ``the framers of our Constitution took \ncare to provide that the laws should bind equally on all, and \nespecially that those who make them shall not exempt themselves from \ntheir operation.''\n  Sadly, however, all too often the Congress has seen fit to ignore the \nsolemn principle that those two great founders, Madison and Jefferson, \nso clearly enunciated.\n  In recent years, mounting public pressure for change has prompted a \nmovement toward reform with respect to congressional coverage, and in \nresponse to that call for change in the 103d Congress, I, among others, \nintroduced legislation to deal with it. Mine was S. 579, the Equity for \nCongress Act.\n  The principal difference between the bill that I introduced, the \nEquity for Congress Act and the other congressional coverage bills in \nthe last Congress, is that the bill I introduced would have kept the \nCongress out of the business of policing itself with respect to its \ncompliance with the laws that my bill would have made applicable to the \nlegislative branch.\n  So under the bill that I introduced, there would have been no office \nof compliance created within the legislative branch. Rather, the \nexecutive and judicial branches would have enforced the laws with \nrespect to Congress in the same manner in which it has done in the \nprivate sector.\n  But I still believe the approach to enforcement taken under the \nEquity for Congress Act in the last Congress is \n[[Page S456]] the right approach. A number of Members of the Senate and \nHouse objected to this approach, however. It is a parliamentary body, \nand we sometimes have to compromise a bit. They use the separation of \npowers as the grounds for not wanting to do that. Their concern is \nfocused particularly on what they see as a potential for partisan \nmotivation in the manner in which the executive branch might enforce \nthe law.\n  In an effort to ensure the broadest possible support for, as well as \nspeedy enactment of, congressional coverage legislation, I agreed to \nsupport this compromise, the compromise embodied by the bill before us \nnow, S. 2.\n  Under this compromise, congressional employees who believe that their \nemployer--congressional employer--is violating one of the laws made \napplicable to the Congress by S. 2 have a choice, they have a choice \nthat is a compromise here. After counseling, they can either file a \nformal complaint with the new congressional office of compliance or \nthey can go directly to the courts.\n  The only highly limited exceptions are with respect to those \nsubstantive laws that do not afford an analogous right to go to court \nto other persons who are not congressional employees.\n  So, I agreed to support this compromise. It is a good compromise and \na reasonable compromise because it is consistent with the spirit of the \nproposal I introduced. I congratulate Senator Grassley for his \nleadership and his willingness to discuss this matter and to listen to \nthose of us who wanted to make some changes.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is imperative that we should move \nforthwith to take this important step toward restoring the confidence \nand the trust of the American people in their Congress. Acting promptly \nto place the Congress under the same laws by which it expects the rest \nof society to abide will send a powerful message to the American people \nthat we got the message. We got the message that the reign of an \narrogant and imperial Congress is over. By moving expeditiously, we in \nthe Congress can send that clear and unmistakable message to the \nAmerican people that we are committed to true and honest reform.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe that S. 2 has another equally \nimportant purpose. Beyond moving to restore the confidence of the \nAmerican people in their Congress, I believe the enactment of the \nCongressional Accountability Act will help us to make better laws. If \nwe have to live under the laws we make, we will make better laws. Some \nsay we ought to make a lot less laws, and I totally agree. Others say \nwe ought to repeal one for every one we pass. That sounds like a good \nidea as well.\n  But learning firsthand what effects the laws that are passed have on \nthose to whom the law applies will give Congress a unique and \ninvaluable way in which to learn by experience what is wrong with those \nlaws.\n  Moreover, living under those laws will give Congress a powerful \ndisincentive. It will think twice before passing laws which it would \nnot want to live under.\n  So I am hopeful, in conclusion, that one spinoff from this excellent \npiece of legislation will be that we may look at some of these laws \nthat are so onerous on the American people and on many businesses \nthroughout the country and change some of them, as well, when we \nrealize how bad they really are.\n  I thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \ncourtesy, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The able Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  It is with great pride that I appear today to speak on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate as Maine's new Senator, particularly because of the \nlegislation that is before us today on the Congressional Accountability \nAct.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Senate majority \nleader for setting this as a high priority in the 104th session of \nCongress.\n  In a year when people are talking about change, and looking for more \naccountability and accomplishments from Congress, there is no more \nimportant message that we could send than this: that we will play by \nthe rules, and we will abide by the laws--and Congress will no longer \nset itself above the law of the land.\n  Madam President, this is basic fairness, and I congratulate my \ncolleague from Iowa, as well, for his tireless efforts to bring this \nlegislation forward.\n  It was a decade ago, Madam President, when I first testified in \nsupport of the principles embodied in this legislation before the \nSenate today. Ten years ago, I spoke before the House's Post Office and \nCivil Service Committee about the need for Congress to treat its \nemployees in the same way we require private businesses to treat their \nemployees.\n  And I have made the application of our Nation's laws to this Congress \na chief objective since that occasion 10 years ago. The issue then, as \nnow, was fairness. Congress should not live above the law. In both of \nthe last two Congresses, I introduced legislation in the other body to \nextend coverage for Congressional employees under the Civil Rights Act \nand the Age Discrimination Act, as well as OSHA.\n  Last year, I testified before the Joint Committee on the Organization \nof Congress [JCOC], which was established in 1993 to review and improve \nthe legislative process. And last September, I expressed my support for \nthis Chamber's congressional compliance legislation in a bipartisan \nletter sent to former majority leader and fellow Mainer George \nMitchell, as well as to other Members of this body.\n  Madam President, I have remained vigilant in working for this \nlegislation because we must show the American people that we are \nwilling to abide by the same laws that we require of them. The \nelections last November made clear that the American people expect more \nof Congress--that they want changes in the way this institution does \nbusiness.\n  This is one of the most important and necessary pieces of legislation \nthis body will consider in this Congress, and I am proud that it is \namong the first we will consider this session.\n  We must support this legislation, not only to heed the wishes of the \nAmerican people to change Congress, but also to deliver on our promise \nto do what is right. Congress simply cannot continue to live above the \nlaw and call itself a body that is ``representative'' of the America we \nlive in today.\n  After all, what kind of message does Congress send to Americans when \nit sets itself above the law? What kind of message does Congress send \nto America when it believes it is beholden to different standards? And \nhow can Congress claim to pass laws in the best interest of the \nAmerican people if Congress refuses to abide by those very same laws.\n  Madam President, Congress should be the very last institution in \nAmerica to \n[[Page S457]] exempt itself from living under the Nation's laws. \nRather, Congress should always be the very first institution to be \ncovered by the laws of the land, especially as the body legislating \nsuch laws.\n  I am well aware of the arguments made in opposition to this \nlegislation in the past.\n  Some Members have expressed concerns that our Founding Fathers \nintended the three branches of Government to remain separate, and that \nis as it should be. But, at the same time, we also know that the \nlegislative branch has been entirely incapable of policing itself. A \nGeneral Accounting Office study of the House's Office of Fair \nEmployment Practices and its internal grievance process indicated that \njust 16 staffers in 4 years had enough confidence in the office to file \ncomplaints. Of those complaints, only four cases went to the end of the \ngrievance process that was established under the Office of Fair \nEmployment Practices. Strong enforcement measures are\n absolutely necessary if we are going to make Congress abide by the \nsame laws that apply to the private sector.\n\n  And that is why I am pleased with the legislation before the Senate \ntoday that will establish the entire independence of that office to \nensure that the congressional employees of the legislative branch will \nbe treated very fairly.\n  The U.S. Constitution and arguments about the constitutionality of \nthis bill are used as a cover by those who want to declare Congress \n``special''--and somehow deserving of special treatment.\n  Clearly our forefathers felt differently, as we have heard today on \nnumerous occasions about James Madison who made it clear that Congress, \nin fact, cannot make itself above the law.\n  Members have also expressed opposition in the past to making Congress \ncomply with OSHA regulations, citing cost considerations. OSHA requires \ncovered employers to provide a place of employment that is free from \nrecognized hazards that may cause serious physical harm or death, and \nto comply with the act's occupational safety and health reporting \nstandards. I have heard from many private sector employers who are \nconcerned about the cost of OSHA regulations. If this body is covered \nby the same regulations, then perhaps Congress will find a way to \nensure that employees are guaranteed a safe workplace without unduly \nburdening employers.\n  We have extended workplace and antidiscrimination laws to our \nconstituents because the\n Congress has felt, rightly in my opinion, that the American people \nwanted this from their leaders and their government. That is what \nrepresentative government is all about.\n\n  Now, we must make the Congress representative not only of our \nconstituents, but of our laws as well.\n  Applying the 10 laws included in this legislation to Congress will \nnot extract any great pain or price from our way of working. But it \nwill send a signal to Americans who are frustrated with Congress--who \ndo not believe that we get it.\n  In the past, passionate debates have been held, both in this Chamber \nas well as in the House, about the need to provide America's working \nmen and women with a fair living wage. We have gone to great lengths to \nensure a living wage, fair workplace practices, and high standards. We \nare justifiably proud of these standards, and our constituents \nwillingly meet them, often voluntarily. If the proprietors of the many \nstores, factories, and employers in my State and other States have to \nmeet labor standards laws, should not the Congress of the United States \nas well?\n  The same holds true for other laws included here: not only OSHA, as I \nmentioned, but Family and Medical Leave and the Americans With \nDisabilities Act. This legislation is a first step toward regaining its \ncredibility as a law-making and law-abiding institution--one that \nclaims as its master the American people, and not the other way around.\n  Madam President, Congress has shown great skill over the last 20 \nyears in passing laws barring discrimination and in passing regulations \nand requirements on America's small businesses. Unfortunately, Congress \nhas shown even greater skill in avoiding those same laws. While small \nbusinesses struggle to pay for renovations that would make it pass an \nOSHA inspection, the Capitol--and our own offices, I might add--has \nnever hosted an OSHA visit. And dare I say they would not pass an OSHA \ninspection, either. Why? Because, unbelievably, it has never had to.\n  That is why passage of this bill is an absolutely critical step in \ngiving this institution the reform it desperately needs and the reform \nthe American public so clearly wants. Now is the time to restore the \npublic's faith in Congress and the democratic process. And now is the \ntime to show the American people that, yes, we do listen, yes, we are \naccountable, and yes, we are delivering on our solemn promises of \nchange.\n  And let us also take this opportunity to demonstrate that we can do \nso in a bipartisan manner.\n That, Madam President, no institution should be above the law, \nespecially Congress. No institution should be exempted from the law, \nespecially Congress. And no one should ignore the law, especially \nCongress.\n\n  Madam President, I would urge my colleagues to vote for the passage \nof this very important legislation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995. This legislation would apply \nto the Congress the same regulatory laws that apply to the rest of \nsociety. The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] deserves extraordinary \ncredit for his long-term commitment to the principles incorporated in \nthis legislation.\n  During the most recent campaign in which I was engaged, I discovered \na sense of public outrage across the entire State of Michigan that we \nin the Congress were not required to abide by the same laws as the rest \nof the country. This outrage was based upon the perception that this \nwas a double standard, a hypocritical policy by which those who enacted \nthe laws of the land exempted themselves and only themselves from the \nburdens of these laws. The purpose of the present legislation is to \nbring the Congress in closer touch with the American people by making \nthem subject to a common set of laws.\n  There are two principles that lie at the heart of this legislation: \nfirst, there is the principle of equity. To the extent that the \nCongress has made the judgment that employees in the private sector are \nentitled to minimal standards and terms of employment, it is difficult \nfor me to understand why employees of the Congress should not be \nsubject to the same standards. While the Congress is a distinctive \ninstitution in its role in our public life, I am unable to see how that \ndistinctiveness relates to the proper standards and terms for treating \nits employees. Although the Congress clearly has the authority to \nexempt itself from the employment rules which it applies to other \ninstitutions, I believe that the integrity of the lawmaking branch of \nthe National Government is diminished when it seeks to treat itself in \na different manner than it treats the rest of society. If anything, we \nshould hold ourselves to higher standards than are applied to other \ninstitutions which do not make the rules.\n  Second, the Congressional Accountability Act incorporates the \nprinciple that sound legislation is better promoted when legislators \nmust abide by the rules set forth in their legislation. When I hear \nopponents of this measure arguing that Members of Congress should not \nbe subject to frivolous litigation or that reputations may suffer when \nindividuals are wrongfully sued, I am sympathetic but only to a point. \nPrivate employers should not be subject to frivolous litigation or \nliable to damage to their reputations any more than Members of \nCongress. If these concerns are legitimate, then they are legitimate \nfor all Americans not merely for those of us who toil on Capitol Hill. \nIf these concerns are legitimate, \n[[Page S458]] then they should be addressed directly by those who \nfashion these laws.\n  I am simply convinced that Members of Congress who are confronted \nwith the reality of having to comply with the same legal structure as \nother Americans are likely to be: first, more careful in their \ncraftsmanship in drafting laws; second, more attentive to detail in \nsaying precisely what is meant by the law; third, more concerned about \nresolving legal issues and definitions within the text of the \nlegislation rather than effectively delegating these decisions to \nunelected and unaccountable Federal judges; and fourth, more \nconscientious in carefully balancing the costs and benefits of their \nlegislative product.\n  To have separate classes of Americans, some subject to the law and \nothers exempt from it, is to have a fundamentally inequitable \nsituation, particularly when that line of division is drawn along the \nlines of legislators and legislatees. Also, the incentives in the \nlegislative process are skewed in the wrong direction when those who \ndraft the laws do not\n have to live with the consequences of those laws.\n\n  Although I recognize that constitutional considerations--separation \nof powers considerations--come into play whenever relationships are \ncreated between the Congress and enforcement agencies of the executive \nbranch, I do not understand there to be anything in the Constitution \nwhich would stand in the way of the immediate legislation. The \nCongressional Accountability Act attempts to address the concerns about \nseparation of powers by enacting a specific enforcement mechanism \nunique to this act. Although I do not believe that such a precaution is \nconstitutionally necessary, and would prefer that this special \nmechanism not have been included, ultimately I do not believe that it \nundermines the critically important thrust of this legislation.\n  Madam President, it is imperative that this institution restore to \nthe American people a sense of trust and confidence. Rightly or \nwrongly, too many Americans have viewed the Congress as increasingly \narrogant in their toleration of double standards of public policy. \nPassage of this legislation should be revived as a necessary step in \nreestablishing the proper relationship between our Government and its \ncitizens.\n  If we are going to ask the American people to make sacrifices as we \nattempt to restructure our bloated Federal Government, the Congress \nwill need credibility. This legislation can contribute to that \ncredibility. In a Congress that promises to be as active and aggressive \nas the 104th in reforming the way that government does business, there \nmay be no more important legislation than this measure. By restoring \npublic trust, S. 12 would enable us to do a better job in all of the \nrest of the areas of our public responsibility.\n  Because this legislation represents sound public policy, and because \nits enactment would signal a new sense of relationship between \nWashington and the rest of the country, I urge its enactment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, thank you very much. In the last day or \nso, we have seen in this Congress a shift of power, which is really \nquite a remarkable thing to see in a very successful democracy, the \noldest and most successful democracy on this Earth. Power shifts not at \nthe point of a bayonet or not in the track of a tank, but it shifts \nwith one simple act of an American citizen casting a vote.\n  Because of the vote last November, power shifted in the U.S. Senate \nand in the U.S. House. It is the way that our system works. There are \nebbs and flows over the centuries in political fortunes of political \nparties, and the American people decided to suggest a change in course \nand have now done that.\n  I think it is important not to misread the election. The election did \nnot produce a massive national mandate. Twenty percent of those \neligible to vote cast their vote for Republicans, about 19 percent of \nthose eligible voted for Democrats, and 61 percent of those eligible to \nvote said, ``It doesn't matter to us. We're not going to vote.''\n  Mandate? Not really. A change of direction? In this country, majority \nrules. The Republicans have won in the legislative races.\n  Now the question for us is not just how do we serve those who voted--\nRepublicans and Democrats--because we serve all of them, but how do we \nget the rest of the American people interested and involved in this \nprocess. Democracy must be a participatory activity.\n  Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin and others who sat in that room in \nPhiladelphia a couple hundred years ago and wrote the Constitution, \nalways knew in a representative government there would be just enough \npeople who were willing to work and participate to make this system \nwork. And the storm clouds grow over our democracy largely because not \nenough people are involved. Over half of the people do not even vote.\n  The task for us, it seems to me, as Democrats and Republicans, is to \nfind ways of advancing policies that advance the standard of living for \nevery American. If, at the end of the process, we have not advanced \npolicies that improve the lives of the American people, then we will \nall be judged as failures.\n  Oh, I have people say to me, ``Gee, the economy is booming, GDP is \nup, unemployment is down. Our economy is all revved up and I don't \nunderstand why people are upset.''\n  However, in judging the economy, the American people do not spend \ntheir evenings reading the dials and gauges that economists study to \nmake dertminations about our economy. When they sit down for dinner at \nnight, the question for the American family is: Am I better off? And \nthe answer for 60 percent of the American families is, no, we have less \nmoney now than we did 10 years ago and we're working harder. That is \nthe standard by which they judge all of us, in our ability to manage \nthis country's fortunes and its future.\n  We have massive problems in a whole range of areas, and we have to \ncome up with new approaches to resolve them and respond to them.\n\n\n                           UNFUNDED MANDATES\n\n  We were talking today about unfunded mandates in the Governmental \nAffairs Committee. It is an issue on which Republicans and Democrats \nwill demonstrate wide agreement. Do we too easily decide to mandate \nsomeone else do something without providing the money? Of course, we \ndo. But, as I said in the committee this morning, trouble runs on a \ntwo-way street. We are going to reform our ourselves on the trouble of \nunfunded mandates, and you Governors, mayors, and other local \ngovernments who are complaining about it--justifiably so--you have to \nreform the way you do business as well because while you complain about \nunfunded mandates, you want to hook your hose up to the Federal trough \nand suck money out in all kinds of schemes and ways, including a bogus \nphony tax called the provider tax, Medicaid, and I can describe all \nkinds of schemes in which they want the Federal money, and then they \nwant to complain about the mandates.\n  We should do something about mandates because it is right and \nnecessary to reduce them. On the other hand, local and State \ngovernments have a responsibility to reform the way they do business as \nwell because all of the money ultimately is the taxpayers' money.\n  Next week, when we bring the unfunded mandates bill to the Senate, I \nintend to offer an amendment on something not a lot of people think \nmuch about: The metric system.\n  Did you know there is a Federal mandate in this country to move \ntoward the metric system? There is. Some people say that is just trying \nto provide \n[[Page S459]] leadership, and that our Government should be a leader in \ngoing metric. I do not care how many kilometers it is to the next rest \nstop when I am driving down the highway, and I don't want some \nbureaucrat to change the sign that says 65 miles an hour to a sign that \nsays how many kilometers per hour I should drive. They do not need to \ndo it on my account. Do not spend millions of dollars changing signs. I \nwant to know how many miles it is to the next off-and-on ramp. I want \nto know how many miles it is to the next rest stop. I want to know how \nmany miles an hour I am supposed to drive as a speed limit.\n  We are building more than 20 houses on Indian reservations in North \nDakota to house doctors from IHS. We should not use the metric system \nin such a project because it increases costs and the time to get things \nbuilt.\n  For 3 months, I tried to change that. They want to use the metric \nsystem because they say the current rules require it be a metric system \nconstruction design and engineering. I am saying, look, if we are going \nto get rid of mandates, let us get rid of mandates like that. Why on \nEarth would we want to require the metric system be used on that kind \nof construction? It makes no sense.\n  I am pleased to tell the Members of this body that I am going to give \nus a chance to express bipartisan support on that issue. Incidentally, \nI have a Republican cosponsor who will join me next week on this issue.\n                A TAX POLICY THAT EXPORTS AMERICAN JOBS\n\n  There are a couple of other issues I am going to be involved in next \nweek. I am going to introduce a bill, again, that I hope this Congress \nwill do something about this time.\n  We are all concerned about jobs in this country and income. The \nbottom line answer to the question of whether the standard of living of \nthe American family is improved is this: Does the family have decent \njobs that pay a decent income? Do you know, we still have in our \nFederal Tax Code this perverse, insidious incentive that says to \nsomebody, If you have a choice, don't build your plant in America, \ndon't keep the plant you have open in America; close the darn thing and \nmove the jobs overseas to a tax haven, manufacture there and then ship \nback to the United States. We will give you a tax break if you do that.\n  We have something called deferral, which is deferral of income tax \nobligation. It occurs in cases where a U.S. business closes its plant \ndoors in the United States, moves the plant overseas, manufactures the \nsame product and ships it back here. Our tax policy says: ``Hooray for \nyou, not only did you ruin the opportunity for jobs for Americans and \nmove them overseas, we're free to give you a tax break for doing so.''\n  I tell you what, that is a tax break that ought to be gone in a \nnanosecond. We ought to decide here and now that our jobs in this \nCongress are to find ways to nurture and protect and support and \nprovide incentives for jobs here in the United States of America.\n  So I am going to offer that amendment next week, or at least offer \nthe legislation and find an appropriate time to offer the amendment. \nCongressman Gephardt, who offered that legislation on the House side \nlast year, will do the same, I believe.\n\n\n                NAFTA RESULTS: LESS EXPORTS, FEWER JOBS\n\n  Let me make one additional point that deals with jobs and income. \nToday I want to make the point about a subject that was very \ncontroversial, debated here in the Senate last year called NAFTA, the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement. I want to make the point that we--\nall of us--have been left holding the bag on NAFTA.\n  Do you recall those glorified claims of new jobs, new opportunity, \nnew expansion if we can simply pass this trade agreement with Mexico? \nGee, if we can just build this highway to heaven, this trade agreement \nwith Mexico, there will be massive new opportunities for the American \npeople.\n  Has anybody paid any attention to what has happened since then? What \nhas happened since then is the trade surplus we had with Mexico has now \nvanished. In the first 9 months of NAFTA we lost 10,000 jobs.\n  It is interesting, the administration only puts out the good news. \nThey said, ``You know, we sent 30,000 more cars to Mexico,'' and you \nthink, ``Boy, that is quite a success record, we sent 30,000 more cars \nto Mexico.''\n  But, as Paul Harvey would say, the rest of the story that they did \nnot tell you is Mexico sent 70,000 more cars to the United States. That \nmeans we had a net inflow of 40,000 additional Mexican-built cars into \nour market. The fact is, if you look at the whole picture, we lost \njobs, but the surplus we had with Mexico in recent years has now \nvanished, turned to a deficit.\n  And do you know something else? In recent days, the devaluation of \nthe peso in Mexico has meant that United States-made goods now cost 40 \npercent more in Mexico, and Mexican-made goods now cost 40 percent less \nin the United States. In one swipe they far more than wiped out every \nsingle advantage we gained in this country by negotiating a reduction \nin tariffs under NAFTA. The advertised benefit of NAFTA was to get more \nAmerican goods into Mexico.\n  Have you heard anybody talking about that? Do you hear the trade \nnegotiators talking about that? The ones that boasted as if they had \njust won the gold medal in the Olympics when they finished the trade \nagreement? ``What a wonderful thing it is for our country,'' they said, \nbusting their suit buttons talking about what a wonderful thing NAFTA \nwould be for Americans. Do you hear them now talking about the fact \nthat we were left holding the bag? The trade surplus is gone; the peso \nis devalued. Every single gain that was achieved in negotiating for \nlower tariffs on American goods going into Mexico is now gone, just \nvanished. In fact, much more than the gain is gone.\n  The fact is we have been ill-served by Republican and Democratic \nadministrations who, if you put a blindfold on, you cannot tell the \ndifference in their trade policy. They stand around like the Hare \nKrishna chanting ``free trade, free trade, free trade.'' Free trade \nmeans absolutely nothing if it is not fair and you do not have \nprotections to deal with currency fluctuations and other things that \ndetermine which way trade moves and who it benefits.\n  The plain fact is, after only 12 months, we now know NAFTA has cost \nthis country jobs, and after the devaluation of the peso we now know \nthat we are left holding the bag.\n  I hope, I really hope, that we can find a way for all of us to \nfinally get involved in a meaningful real debate about trade and what \nit means to jobs in this country. Every time some one of us stands up \nto talk about trade, we are put in two camps. There are the free \ntraders who are big thinkers and they can see over the horizon and have \na world view, and then there are the xenophobic, isolationist stooges \nwho do not know anything and want to build a wall around our country.\n  Debate on that basis is meaningless. However, trade policy is a very \nimportant issue for every American family. American trade policies that \nare fundamentally unfair to this country are creating conditions in \nwhich American personal income is pressed down and opportunities are \ndiminishing.\n  Should we build a wall around America? No, I do not suggest that. \nShould we have open trade? Yes. But we ought to finally insist on fair \ntrade opportunities, and we ought to insist there is an admission price \nto come into the American economy. And the admission price is you have \nto pay living wages. You have to have safe workplaces. You have to help \ntake care of your environment.\n  We have to start standing up for our economic self-interests. If we \ndo not care about American workers, who will? If we do not negotiate on \ntheir behalf, who will? Every other country with whom we have \nnegotiated on trade has had negotiators who have worn their jersey that \nsays, ``We are for our side.'' I want our trade officials wearing our \njersey, saying we insist on fair trade for American producers and fair \ntrade for American workers.\n  Madam President, I appreciate the patience of my colleagues who are \nwaiting to speak, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S458-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S459-S469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  [[Page S460]] Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise what the parliamentary \nstatus of the Senate is at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that debate is open on \nS. 2.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I am here today to recognize the importance of this \nlegislation that is being debated, S. 2. I think it is commendable that \nit is one of the first items that is being taken up. But I also want to \nremind the Senate and those people that are listening to the debate on \nthe Senate floor today that the legislative branch appropriations bill \nof 1992 required the establishment of a bipartisan task force to deal \nwith Senate coverage.\n  That was signed into law, and Senators Mitchell and Dole, the \nmajority and minority leaders of the Senate in 1993, appointed Senators \nReid and Stevens to cochair this commission and make a report to the \nSenate leaders about Senate coverage and what could and could not be \ndone.\n  Madam President, there were weeks of time spent working on a report \nthat was submitted to the majority and minority leaders in October of \nlast year. This report consumed a great deal of staff Member time being \nprepared. The Senate staff of the Rules Committee, minority and \nmajority, the Appropriations Committee majority and minority staff, \ntogether with significant help from the Congressional Research Service, \ncounsel for the Senate, and the American Bar Association worked with us \nin coming up with this staff report.\n  I am satisfied that the work done by the task force has helped arrive \nat a point where we now have this bill. If you look at the task force \nexecutive summary, you will find that we were charged according to law \nwith reviewing all existing statutes under which the Senate is covered, \nreviewing Senate rules to determine whether the Senate is effectively \ncomplying with other statutes that could be applied to the Senate and \nrecommending the extent to which and the manner in which these statutes \nshould be applied to the Senate. That was our charge.\n  We had to recognize, Madam President, that this unique legislative \ninstitution established by our Founding Fathers over 200 years ago sets \nforth certain unusual requirements that we had to be aware of, that the \nSenate has a special constitutional role; the separation of powers \ndoctrine and Members' immunity for speech or debate under article I, \nsection 6, of the Constitution.\n  We took all those things into consideration. We had to make sure that \nunder the Constitution by which we are all directed, which we all \nrespect, whatever we came up with secured the individual liberty of the \nseparate but equal branches of Government, each capable of protecting \ntheir independence from outside interference and coercion.\n  That is an important concept; that we had to make sure the \nlegislative branch of Government maintained independence and was not \ninterfered with by the executive branch of Government. And that is \nreplete through the task force executive summary and the report itself.\n  I am happy to report, Madam President, that the legislation which was \nconsidered on this floor last year and which is now being debated today \ndoes a real good job, I believe, of maintaining the independence of the \nlegislative branch of Government. It certainly does an outstanding job \nof protecting the legislative branch of Government from interference by \nthe executive branch of Government.\n  I would like to commend the parties who have worked so hard on this \nlegislation over the year or more.\n  I know that the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nthe former chairman of the committee, Senator Glenn, has literally \nworked on this for years. This is one of the first things that he \ntalked about when he came to the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Grassley, who is a member of the task force, has been \ndiligent in his efforts to make sure that we are at the point we now \nare. Senator Grassley participated in the task force. He was easy to \nwork with and was very diligent in what he wanted to accomplish. And I \nrepeat, Madam President, I think this legislation maintains the \nindependence of the legislative branch of Government.\n  What I fought from the very beginning of the task force and have \nalways complained about here in the Senate is I did not want these laws \nto be applied to the legislative branch of Government and have the \nexecutive branch of Government enforce the laws. That would have taken \naway our independence. I think that the movers of this legislation have \ndone a good job of maintaining that independence.\n  I would also like to commend the cochair of the task force that was \ncreated by law, and that is Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens is a \nperson who really understands and believes in the integrity of this \ninstitution. He wants to maintain the independence of the legislative \nbranch of Government. So working on the task force with him--all of \nthose who have worked with Senator Stevens know when he believes in \nsomething he never holds back an opinion or a feeling that he has. He \ndid not with the task force. We had a number of very heated discussions \nwith Senator Stevens and his staff. I believe --and Senator Stevens of \ncourse would have to speak for himself--that the report we came up with \nis as good as it is because of the input of Senator Stevens, the \ncochair.\n  We recommended that the Senate should adopt a resolution which \nextends to employees of the Senate offices the rights and protections \nnecessary to ensure their health and safety, including fair wages and \nhours and a workplace free of discrimination. This legislation we \nworked on last year, and the legislation that is now before this body \ntakes care of that.\n  Second, the task force believes the current structure of the Senate \nin which each office is separately administered by an elected Senator, \ncommittee officer, or official should be preserved. I believe that is \ndone as best as can be, under the confines of the current law.\n  The task force believes that the nonlegislative instrumentalities in \nthe legislative branch, which would include the Architect of the \nCapitol, the General Accounting Office, Government Printing office, the \nLibrary of Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, and the U.S. \nBotanic Gardens should be covered by the same standards in regard to \ncivil rights, OSHA, and the Fair Labor Standards Act as are executive \nbranch agencies.\n  So, Madam President, I am here to state that the task force completed \nits task. I believe we did a good job in reporting our findings to the \nSenate minority and majority leaders. And I am here to indicate that I \nsupport this legislation. I think it is imperfect, but I think \ncertainly it sends a message to the American public that we are willing \nto have the same laws apply to us that apply to the American business \ncommunity throughout America.\n  I would say that we should recognize that this will come with cost. \nIt will cost. The taxpayers will not save money on this one. This will \ncost the taxpayers more money. But in the long run, perhaps, when we as \nMembers of Congress find out the difficulty of having some of these \nlaws apply to us, maybe in the long run we will be more cautious in \napplying laws to the American workplace and the American business \ncommunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, before I call up my amendment, amendment \nNo. 3 that is at the desk, I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a \ncosponsor to S. 2.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Nevada be added as \na cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 3\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for the reform of the disclosure of lobbying \n activities intended to influence the Federal Government and for gift \n                                reform)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       [[Page S461]] The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for \n     himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. McCain, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Feingold, \n     and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 3.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senators \nWellstone, McCain, Glenn, Feingold, and Lautenberg. This amendment \nwould do two things. First, it would express the sense of the Senate \nthat we should pass a bill reforming our lobbying registration and \ndisclosure laws as soon as possible this year. Second, it would add to \nthe bill before us the tough new congressional gift rules that were \nincluded in last year's conference report on gift reform and lobby \nreform, a conference report that was not voted on for reasons not \nrelated to the gift ban which would be added by this amendment.\n  I offer this amendment because the bill before us is not the only \nunfinished business from the last Congress with regard to the issue of \ncongressional accountability. The bill before us, S. 2, is a good \nmeasure which had wide bipartisan support in the last Congress and it \nhas obvious bipartisan support in this Congress. But it is hard to see \nhow we can say that we have made the Congress accountable when we \ncontinue to allow special interests to pay for free recreational \ntravel, free golf tournaments, free dinners, free football, basketball, \nand concert tickets, and on and on.\n  Like the Congressional Accountability Act itself that is before us, \nS. 2, this lobbying disclosure and gift reform bill was almost enacted \nlast year. Cloture fell a few votes short, for reasons unrelated to the \ngift ban, in the final days of the Congress. Speaker Gingrich's \nContract With America fails to take on the three toughest political \nreform issues facing us: Campaign finance reform, lobbying reform, and \nreform of congressional gift rules. Those measures, those three \nmeasures, which are not addressed in Speaker Gingrich's contract--\ncampaign finance reform, lobbying reform, and reform of the \nCongressional gift rules--address the fundamental question of the \nrelationship between the Congress and the special interests, the \nlobbyists who make campaign contributions to us and offer us gifts or \nother special favors.\n  Because those three reforms would change the way business is done in \nthis city, they have the most opposition and will be the toughest to \nenact. For the same reasons, however, they are perhaps the most \nimportant measures for us to take on and enact.\n  When this issue was debated last October, a number of colleagues \nraised a number of substantive concerns relative to the lobbying reform \nportion of that bill. And I emphasize, that is not to be enacted by \nthis amendment. That is only referred to in sense-of-the Senate \nlanguage in this amendment, urging us to adopt lobbying disclosure \nreform this year. The purpose of the lobbying disclosure reform is to \nclose the loopholes that have existed now for 40 years in existing \nlobbying disclosure laws that are supposed to require paid lobbyists to \ndisclose who is paying them how much to lobby Congress on what issues, \nbut are ignored by probably two-thirds of the paid lobbyists in this \ntown because of various loopholes that exist.\n  For instance, in one of the laws, lawyer lobbyists are not covered. \nOther lobbyists are covered. But if you are a lawyer and you are a \nlobbyist you are not covered. That kind of loophole has to be closed. \nThere has been an effort to close these loopholes for 40 years. They \nare not easy to close for obvious reasons. Powerful interests want to \nkeep those loopholes open. But there were substantive arguments raised. \nI did not agree with the arguments. But they were raised.\n  So that portion of the bill that relates to lobbying registration is \nnot to be enacted under the amendment that I am offering today. That is \nsimply the subject of sense-of-the-Senate language saying let us get to \nthat this year. Since the substantive issues were raised, they should \nbe addressed. But that is very different from the gift ban. And the \ncontrast here is very, very stark. It is the gift ban language which \nwould be enacted by this amendment. We cannot justify any further delay \nin adopting the gift ban language. We must adopt congressional gift \nreform.\n  Senate bill 1935 which contained the gift reforms passed the Senate \nlast year on a 95-to-4 vote. When the conference report on Senate bill \n349 was brought to the Senate floor, Republican leadership stated in \nthe clearest and strongest possible terms that they had no objection to \nthe gift provisions of the bill and opposed cloture only because of the \nconcerns about the lobbying disclosure provision. Indeed, on October 6 \nof last year 38 Republican Senators cosponsored a resolution to adopt \nthe tough, new gift rules that were included in that conference report. \nThose are the rules in the amendment that I am offering today. Those \nare the same rules we will be voting on today or tomorrow when this \namendment is voted on. Those are the rules which a majority of \nDemocrats and a majority of Republicans in October of last year said \nthey supported. These are the same rules. So that there is no \nconfusion, these are rules which were in a conference report which a \nvery large majority of both Democrats and Republicans said they \nfavored. The reason that cloture was not invoked, according to persons \nwho opposed cloture, had to do solely with lobbying disclosure, not \nwith the gift ban which will be voted on.\n  For instance, Senator Dole stated at the time:\n\n       I support the gift ban provisions, no lobbyist luncheons, \n     no entertainment, no travel, no contribution to the defense \n     funds, no fruit baskets, no nothing. That is fine with this \n     Senator, and I doubt many Senators were taking that in any \n     event.\n\n  Senator McConnell stated:\n\n       We had a very spirited debate last night about the \n     appropriateness of the rules change with regard to gifts. I \n     think the Senate fully understood what we were about to do \n     because I was engaged in that debate as vice chairman of the \n     Ethics Committee just pointing out some of the regulatory \n     problems here in the Senate with the proposal. But we had a \n     good debate. Everybody understood the issue. We voted on it \n     and it is over. It would be my hope, Mr. President, that we \n     would pass the Senate rule related to gifts to Senators.\n\n  And other Republican Senators made similar statements of their \ncommitment to quick enactment of these gift rules, the same rules that \nare in the amendment which I am offering this afternoon. So a vast \nmajority of Democrats voted for cloture and Republicans who cosponsored \na resolution containing these rules said just last October, that vast \nmajority on both sides of the aisle, let us at long last enact these \ntough, new gift ban rules.\n  Madam President, we simply must enact tough, new gift rules if we are \ngoing to ensure the credibility of the Congress and we must not delay \nit. There have been reasons to delay this for Congress after Congress. \nI know we are going to be urged to delay it again. We just simply \nshould not. We just have to get rid of the junkets, the dinners, and \nthe tickets to sporting events and concerts which are supplied by \nspecial interests. The public is disgusted by them, and we do not need \nthem.\n  Just as one example, this is a Washington Post article of last June.\n\n       Lawmakers reveal that travel is still a frequent gift of \n     lobbyists. House Members kept up their flying ways on the tab \n     of lobbyists and other private interests last year even as \n     Congress moved to impose new restrictions on what critics \n     denounced as free vacations often in fancy resorts. \n     Destinations popular with the House Members included back-to-\n     back charity tournaments during the congressional recess last \n     August and a conference at the Tobacco Institute hosted in \n     Palm Springs.\n\n  Then it goes on to say that the Senate version would have ended it, \nand the gift rules that we have before us in my amendment would end it \nas well.\n  The Post goes on:\n\n       The public interest groups have criticized the recreational \n     trips. ``Ultimately the problem is that it is another avenue \n     which interest groups, corporations, and labor unions use to \n     try to influence how Members of Congress will act'', Josh \n     Goldstein, of the Center for Responsive Politics, told the \n     Associated Press. The ability to take the Congress to a nice \n     locale, have them give a little talk but essentially give \n     them a 3- or 4-day vacation where you were their constant \n     companion allows you to develop a friendship, a relationship \n     with them, and that is the key element in lobbying because it \n     is much more difficult to say no to a friend.\n\n  [[Page S462]] That is the kind of article we are going to continue to \nface until we adopt a tough, new gift ban. Some are going to be \nreluctant to make this change. As a matter of fact, the New Republican \nSpeaker of the House was quoted in Congress Daily on October 21 as \nsaying that he did not see any reason to change the current gift rules. \nCongress Daily reported that Speaker Gingrich, then Congressman \nGingrich, told Congress Daily that he supported the system already in \nplace and quoted him as saying, ``I do not see any reason to change,'' \nquoting then Congressman Gingrich.\n  But in contrast to what Speaker Gingrich said last year we have the \nSenate Republican leadership, a vast majority of Republicans in the \nSenate, a vast majority of Democrats in the Senate, who last October \nsaid they wanted to adopt these new tough gift rules which are in the \namendment which I am offering today. These are the same rules that a \nmajority of both parties in this body just last October said they \nwanted to adopt.\n  So the contrast between what the majority of us on both sides of the \naisle said we wanted to do and what Speaker Gingrich said he was \nsatisfied with last October is a very stark contrast indeed.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as I said earlier, the lobbying reform \nissue, the lobbying disclosure portion of that conference report is not \nincorporated in this amendment that we will be voting on. That issue, \nlobbying disclosure, lobbying registration reform, would be left for \nlater this year. It is not part of this amendment. There were \nsubstantive issues that were raised relative to the lobbying disclosure \nportion of that conference report. Even again, although I did not agree \nwith those issues, we do not attempt to incorporate the language of \nlobbying disclosure, lobbying registration reform.\n  We have tried for 40 years, and I hope we will continue to try this \nyear. It is the sense-of-the-Senate language in this amendment that we \ntry to reform those laws this year. But since substantive issues were \nraised about that amendment, that language reforming the lobbying \ndisclosure and registration laws is not incorporated in the amendment \nthat I now offer. What is incorporated is the gift ban, and it is \nincorporated because when the conference report came before us, a \nmajority--a large majority--of both parties, last October, said they \nfavored adopting these tough new rules, the same rules that are in the \namendment that is now pending before this Senate.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would put an end to business as usual. \nIt would put an end to the so-called recreational trips for Members, \nthe so-called charitable golf, tennis, and skiing tournaments. It would \nput an end to the meals paid for by lobbyists. But the tickets to the \nfootball games and other events paid for by lobbyists, under the \ncurrent congressional gift rules--Members and staff are free to accept \ngifts of up to $250 from anybody, including the lobbyists. Gifts under \n$100 do not even count. We are free to accept an unlimited number of \ngifts of less than $100 in value. That can be football tickets, theater \ntickets, anything you can think of. If it is worth less than $100, we \ncan take as many of them as we want and do not have to disclose it. \nThose are the current gift rules. There is no limit on meals. It does \nnot matter who pays for it, what the tab is, we can take it. \nCongressional travel under current gift rules is virtually unlimited. \nMembers and staff are free to travel to recreational events such as \ngolf and ski tournaments at private expense, even at the expense of a \ntrade or lobbyist group.\n  According to one estimate, private interests provide almost 4,000 \nfree trips to Members of Congress every 2 years, an average of almost \nnine trips per Member of Congress. If we continue that and delay the \nresolution of this, it is just a continuation of business as usual. It \nis not acceptable.\n  The winds of change are here. But three big parts of the change are \nunaddressed in the Gingrich contract--the hardest parts: Gifts to us, \nlobbying disclosure and registration, and campaign finance reform. In \ntwo of the three of those cases there are significant substantive \nissues which are still pending, which have been raised and are \nunresolved. But in this one, the gift ban, given what was stated last \nOctober by the leadership in the Senate on both sides of the aisle, and \nby a vast majority of Democrats and Republicans, that they are ready to \nadopt these rules that are in this amendment, we have no justification \nto delay this any longer. The votes were not unanimous when we passed \nthe bill adopting this tough new gift ban, but they were a very large \nmajority of both sides of the aisle.\n  When this bill was on the floor last year, we heard a lot of talk \nabout how shrinking congressional gift limits would shut down the \nKennedy Center and put restaurant employees out of work throughout the \nWashington area. What a horrible indictment of Congress that would be \nif it were true. Can it really be that we accept so many free meals and \ntickets that entire industries in the Washington area are dependent on \nus continuing to take these gifts? That seems inconceivable to me, but \nthat is what the opponents of the measure said last year.\n  The basic premise of S. 2, the bill before us today, is that we start \nliving under the same rules as other Americans. Average citizens do not \nhave trade groups and corporations offering them free trips to resorts, \ntreating them to fancy restaurants or giving them tickets--not average \ncitizens. But we have a higher responsibility, in any event, than does \nthe average citizen, because we have the responsibility to ensure \npublic confidence in this institution, and that is the issue.\n  The issue is public confidence in this institution and whether or not \nwhen we are seen on these free trips, these recreational trips, and \nwhen we are given tickets by special interests and lobbyists to \nconcerts and to sporting events, and when we are taken out to meals by \nspecial interests and lobbyists, whether or not that is the perception \nof this body, we then believe that the public will have confidence in \nthis institution. One of the reasons it does is because they have seen \ntoo much of that. They want us to act in the public interest, free of \nan appearance, even, of special interest influence. That perception is \nvery difficult to achieve when rules allow the kinds of gifts which our \ncurrent rules do from lobbyists and from others with interest in \nlegislation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the most recent public opinion poll that I \nhave seen asked the following question of the American public: ``Who do \nyou think really controls the Federal Government in Washington?''--and \nthey were given a number of options in their answers. ``Who do you \nthink really controls the Federal Government, the President, the \nCongress, or lobbyists and special interests?'' Fifty percent of the \nAmerican people said that lobbyists and special interests control the \nFederal Government. Fifty percent. Twenty-two percent said the \nCongress--both Democrats and Republicans. Seven percent said the \nPresident.\n  We have to change that. I think we are on our way to changing it. I \nthink the bill in front of us, S. 2, will help put us more closely \nunder the same laws as everybody else. This amendment contains rules \nwhich a vast majority of both sides of the aisle said they supported \njust last October, and it will also help contribute significantly to \npublic confidence in this institution.\n  I believe it is long overdue and that we cannot justify longer and \nlonger and longer delays. There is always an excuse not to act. But I \nthink it would be a real copout if we do not adopt these rules now and \njust simply say we are going to delay them for later consideration, \nwhen there was no substantive issue raised as late as last October by \nthe vast majority of Members of both parties in this body. It is hard \nto give up some things, but I do not believe the public is going to \ntake the claims of reform seriously until we do the tough things--the \ngift ban, the campaign finance reform, and the lobbying registration \nand disclosure reforms--to close those loopholes which have been so \negregious for so many decades.\n  I thank the cosponsors, Senator Wellstone, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Glenn, and Senator McCain, for their \ncontinuing energy and their continuing support. This amendment is the \nproduct of the work of many, many people on both \n[[Page S463]] sides of the aisle, and it is time now to adopt these \nchanges in our gift rules.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleague from Maine wants to speak now, I would \nbe willing to follow him.\n  Mr. COHEN. I will take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I might follow the \nSenator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine [Mr. Cohen] is recognized.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, first let me commend the Senator from \nMichigan. He and I have worked on the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nand the oversight subcommittee, since coming to the Senate in 1979. I \nregard him as one of the truly dedicated individuals in reforming our \nsystem both here and in the executive branch. I have the very highest \nregard for him, and I cannot praise him enough in terms of the work \nethic that he demonstrates day in and day out on the issues that we \ndeal with.\n  I have been an original cosponsor with the Senator from Michigan on \nboth the lobby disclosure and the gift ban bill.\n  And I might point out historically what has taken place. Initially, \nwe took up the issue of lobby disclosure because we realized that the \ncurrent laws governing lobbyists are a mess. The laws are so ambiguous, \nso riddled with exceptions, so unclear that only a very few of the many \nthousands of lobbyists in this city even bother to register.\n  In fact, many who register feel they are doing so at their peril, \nthat it is unnecessary for them to do so; they have insufficient \nstandards and guidelines. They realize that there is very little, if \nany, enforcement. I am aware of any penalty ever having been levied.\n  But we felt at the time that the public was genuinely concerned about \nfundamental questions, very simple questions. Who is paying how much \nmoney to whom to do what? Those were the simple questions we think are \non the minds of the American people.\n  And I think the Senator from Michigan is correct that many feel that \ntheir elected officials are no longer in charge of actually governing \nthe country; that ``special interests and lobbyists'' are in fact \ncalling the tune and dictating what the rules are going to be.\n  So I joined with the Senator from Michigan in sponsoring the lobby \ndisclosure measure, only to find out that after we had introduced the \nmeasure, after it had come out of the committee and was coming to the \nfloor, it was editorially attacked, as I recall, in one of the leading \nnewspapers of this country, saying what a gross oversight on the part \nof the Senator from Michigan and the Governmental Affairs Committee \nthat they did not deal with the gift ban issue.\n  It was not our intent at that time to link lobbying disclosure with \nthe gift ban issue. We were not ignoring the gift ban issue. We simply \nfelt lobby disclosure was an appropriate subject matter for us to \ndevote our energies to and to make recommendations. And, frankly, we \nthought at the time that we had a comprehensive agreement.\n  We found that most of the lobbyists who came in and testified \nactually welcomed a clarification of the existing laws. We took hours \nand hours of testimony. We thought that we actually were making a very \nconstructive proposal to all of them so they know there is one set of \nrules, not one for those who lobby for foreign firms or countries, not \none for domestic interests here at home, but one set of rules and very \nclearly stated. We thought that was in the best interest certainly of \nthe country, and also the lobbyists themselves.\n  Then the gift ban proposal was raised at the last moment and it was \nimplied unfairly that the Senator from Michigan did not want to deal \nwith the gift ban issue. At that point, we decided to hold additional \nhearings solely on the gift ban issue. We tried to put together \nlegislation addressing both the ban on gifts to Members as well as the \nlobby disclosure. That is how the two originally were linked.\n  As the Senator from Michigan indicated, he has now delinked these \nissues, calling for a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to take up \nlobbying disclosure later and to deal only with the gift ban issue for \nnow.\n  I take issue only with one statement the Senator from Michigan has \nmade. He said if we fail to act today, this is a copout.\n  I would like to indicate to my friend and colleague, with whom I have \nworked all of these years, that I do not intend to cop out on anything \nduring the course of this year. In fact, I was one of the few \nRepublicans who stood with him in the final moments of the last \nsession, over the objection of many of my fellow Republicans, in going \nforward with the legislation that we had developed.\n  But I must say today--and I have indicated this to him privately, and \nI will do so publicly now--that I will not support attaching this \namendment to the bill under consideration, for a very simple reason. I \nbelieve that the majority leader deserves the opportunity to work \nclosely and in concert with the House for the first time in the unique \nsituation that both bodies are now controlled by the Republican party \nto give the Republicans a chance to govern.\n  As I recall Senator Dole saying during the campaign in the fall \nmonths, ``Give us a chance to govern, and if we don't measure up, if we \ndon't do the job, throw us out.'' Those are pretty straightforward and \nvery tough words.\n  What Senator Dole is asking for is a chance to say: Let us take this \nmeasure up, S. 2; it is not perfect, but it is something that we think \nwe can reach agreement on very quickly with the House, that we may be \nable to avoid the need for a conference, and pass a bill quickly that \nwill tell the American people we are in fact subjecting ourselves to \nthe laws that we subject them to.\n  He has also made a pledge to me and to others--and it is a pledge \nthat I will repeat here today for myself: Let me tell my friend from \nMichigan, in the event that his amendment is not successful, in the \nevent it is tabled, that I pledge to him and to other Members here that \nI intend to support gift ban legislation. I intend to support lobby \ndisclosure. I intend to give Senator Dole an opportunity to bring it up \nin a relatively short time. He has not given me a specific timetable, \nbut I would say within the next couple of months, I expect we will \nconsider this legislation and any amendments that might be offered to \nit--and I suspect there will be amendments. There are people on this \nside that still do not agree with provisions that we supported.\n  I will make this representation to my colleagues: That I intend to \nsupport the legislation. I will not do so today. I will give the \nmajority leader an opportunity to carry through what he said he wanted \nto do, and that is a chance to govern. And if we fail to do so properly \nin the eyes of the American people, throw us out.\n  So at the appropriate time--and that time to be determined by the \nmajority leader; and it is something that I will continue to watch \ncarefully and work on with my colleague from Michigan--I will join him \nin offering his legislation. In the event he is unsuccessful in \nbringing this to a vote today, I will join him and vote for both of \nthese bills in the future.\n  But today, I am urging my colleagues, as one who is an original \ncosponsor of both bills, to give Senator Dole an opportunity to govern, \nto see if we cannot pass this legislation as quickly as possible so we \ncan avoid going through a lengthy conference with the House which could \nin fact derail the momentum that exists for taking swift action on the \nCongressional Accountability legislation. Give us an opportunity to \nprove what can be done in a short period of time and then insist that \nwe bring these two measures back to the floor for a vote, at which time \nI will be joining with my colleagues from Michigan, Minnesota, \nWisconsin, and Ohio.\n  I thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me not talk about this issue in \nterms of parties, which is I think part of what is now going on before \nthe Senate. Let me talk about this issue as an issue, as an \n[[Page S464]] issue which I think is very important to people.\n  When I was campaigning for office back in Minnesota in 1988 and 1989 \nand just talking with people in cafes, I was surprised then--and that \ngoes back 5 or 6 years--at the extent to which people did not feel well \nrepresented, the extent to which people felt ripped off, the extent to \nwhich people felt that politics, especially politics in Washington, was \na game that a few played but not them, not their families. So I came \nhere, Mr. President, requesting a very strong reform orientation. Ever \nsince I came to the Senate, this has been my primary focus.\n  Mr. President, I came here convinced that whereas, when I was a \npolitical science teacher I used to talk about some of the reform \nissues as issues that maybe the good government people cared about, \nunfortunately I would say in class, most of the people do not. People \ncare fiercely about a political process that has integrity, that is \nopen and is accountable to them.\n  While we delay, let me just read from an AP story today. ``The \nrevolution may have hit Congress on Wednesday, but lobbyists were still \npicking up the tab for the food and drinks. A sumptuous spread covered \ntables''--and I will leave out the committee and names--``in the \ncommittee's ornate meeting room put on to honor its new Republican \nchairman''--and I will leave out the name. ``Lobbyists from Tenneco, \nDow Chemical, Southwestern Bell, and Exxon munched and chatted with \ncommittee members and aides.''\n  Those lobbyists went on to describe this as a networking opportunity.\n  Mr. President, for the life of me, I do not understand what the delay \nis all about. This is not even a debatable proposition. I say to my \ncolleagues, many of whom are in their first term, many of whom are in \ntheir first year, who came here with a strong reform orientation, I can \nreally appreciate their perspective.\n  I am fairly new to the Senate. The argument to people is, well, you \nknow, I had a chance to vote on banning these trips and these gifts and \nthese meals and these tickets--because you know and I know this is an \nunacceptable practice--I had a chance to vote on it, but I voted \nagainst it. The reason I voted against it is because my party said to \nme that they wanted to put it off, and later on we would get to it.\n  This is a matter of how you draw the line between Republicans and \nDemocrats. I thought we were operating in a bipartisan fashion, Mr. \nPresident. I do not think I will get into any pointing of the finger, \nbut I could probably do a fairly good content analysis, when we hear \nabout being able to govern, of the number of amendments, in just the \nyears that I have been here, that have been brought out to a variety of \ndifferent bills, many of them not even germane amendments, by the then \nminority party.\n  This amendment meets the germaneness test. This is all about \ncongressional accountability. This is called the Congressional \nAccountability Act. There is not one word in this Contract With America \nabout lobbying disclosure, about gift ban, or about campaign finance \nreform.\n  Last session, at the end of the session, some 37 Republicans voted \nfor exactly the language of this amendment, understanding that Senator \nLevin has now a sense-of-the-Senate resolution dealing with lobby \ndisclosure: Mr. Dole, for himself; Mr. Simpson; Mr. Nickles; Mr. \nCochran; Mr. McConnell; Mr. Smith; Mr. D'Amato; Mr. Domenici; Mr. \nCoats; Mr. Lott; Mrs. Hutchison; Mr. Bennett; Mr. Shelby, now \nRepublican; Mr. Gregg; Mr. Coverdell; Mr. Durenberger; Mr. Packwood; \nMr. Gorton; Mr. Kempthorne; Mr. Thurmond; Mrs. Kassebaum; Mr. Brown; \nMr. Mack; Mr. Warner; Mr. Faircloth; Mr. Gramm; Mr. Hatch; Mr. Burns; \nMr. Helms; Mr. McCain; Mr. Grassley; Mr. Lugar; Mr. Bond; Mr. Craig; \nMr. Roth; Mr. Pressler; Mr. Cohen; and Mr. Chafee. It is the exact same \ngift ban provision.\n  Mr. President, for those who voted for it before, why is it not as \ncompelling an issue today? Since this practice goes on--I just read \nfrom a story that dealt with the giving of gifts yesterday--why is this \nnot a compelling reform issue today? For those in the Senate who were \nnot here last session but who ran for office on such a strong reform \nagenda and said they wanted to change business as usual in Washington, \nwhy would you vote no? Why would you vote no? I guess you could make \nthe argument, well, later on we will get to it. The only thing I can \nsay, and I have been hearing that argument ever since I came to the \nSenate: Delay and delay and delay. Maybe later on, we will get to it.\n  I can assure you that if we lose the vote today, we will keep \npressing on this issue and we will hold everyone accountable. But if an \namendment makes sense, if an amendment to a piece of legislation is a \npart of governing, the Senate is an amendment body. I do not quite \nunderstand the argument that we will not take any amendments. I mean, \nthe Senate is an amendment body. That is the way most of us operate as \nlegislators in the Senate. We bring amendments to the floor.\n  This particular amendment, without a doubt, is certainly germane. It \nis all about accountability. We are being told by some of our \ncolleagues that they will not support the very gift ban that they \nsupported before. Why? Why? Why the delay? Is this all about progress? \nIs this all about who is running the Senate?\n  Because, Mr. President, people in the country are the ones who run \nthe Senate. People in the country want to see the reform. People in the \ncountry have said over and over and over again, ``Nobody comes up to \nus.'' My neighbors in Northfield, if they had a chance to talk to \nSenators, would say: No one comes up to us and says, ``Listen, would \nyou like to take a trip, wherever?'' Or, ``Are you interested in going \nto some athletic event?'' Or, ``We would like to take you out to \ndinner.'' People do not have lobbyists coming up to them. Regular \npeople do not have lobbyists or other special interests or other folks \ncoming up to them to make an offer. Who are we trying to kid?\n  This is a real problem, a compelling issue. It is a compelling issue \ntoday. There is no reason why any Senator should vote against this. \nThere is a reason on substantive grounds. But it has overwhelming \nsupport, including from almost all of our colleagues on the other side, \nunless this is just a case of power and prerogative. What a shame that \nwould be. If a good idea comes from this side of the aisle, and it is \nrelevant to an important piece of legislation which deals with \ncongressional accountability, I ask my colleagues, why do you vote \nagainst it? How ironic it would be, Mr. President, if on this piece of \nlegislation, called the Congressional Accountability Act, we exempt \nourselves from the very rules that the executive branch lives by, which \nis precisely what this amendment attempts to rectify. Why the delay?\n  Mr. President, Roll Call, on Monday, October 17, 1994--and I will try \nto be very careful about not using names--has a very interesting and \nrevealing piece called ``How Lobbyists Put Meals, Gifts to Work.'' This \nmemo, obtained by Roll Call, says one prominent D.C. firm lays out 1994 \nstrategy, including meals, campaign contributions, and participation in \nleadership races. It is Timothy Burger's piece:\n\n       During the protracted debate over new lobbying and gift \n     rules which went down to stunning defeat in the waning days \n     of the second session, Members argued violently over the \n     influence of lobbyist-paid meals and campaign contributions.\n\n  Now, a Big Mac will not buy influence from anybody. ``I am sure \n$15,000 will not buy influence from anybody,'' Representative Dan \nBurton, Republican, Indiana, said on the floor. Retiring House minority \nleader Bob Michel said, ``Here we are, demeaning ourselves, saying, \n`Please stop me before I accept another cup of coffee and a Danish, and \nI am sure he was sincere about that because he is known to be that kind \nof Representative.\n  The article goes on to say, ``Despite such protests, meals and \ncontributions are fixtures in the lobbying world, and internal \ndocuments from a prominent Washington lobbying firm demonstrate just \nhow central they are to conducting business.''\n  I will not name lobbying firms and name different Representatives. \nAnd so on and so forth.\n  But it is very revealing.\n  Mr. President, again, 37 Republicans supported precisely the language \nof this amendment which puts an end to \n[[Page S465]] this egregious, unacceptable, unconscionable policy of \naccepting gifts from lobbyists and other special interests. It is \nwrong. We should not do it.\n  Each and every one of us, and I know each and every one of us, does \nfit within this framework who cares about this institution, each and \nevery one of us who wants to see some increase in public confidence and \ntrust and each and every one of us--and I bet I am speaking for every \nsingle colleague on this point who is tired of the bashing and the \ndenigration of public service and who is tired of this indiscriminate \nattack on everybody in public service and who understands that this is \nnot good for representative democracy. And it is not, Mr. President. If \nthat is the case, then there is simply no reason why you would vote \nagainst this.\n  Do not vote against this on a party basis. Do not vote against this \non the issue of prerogative. Do not vote against this again delaying. \nDo not be obstructionistic about this. Move forward on it. For those of \nyou who were here before, you voted for it once, vote for it again, and \nfor those of you who are new--and I know you have a strong reform \norientation--there is no reason in the world why you should not support \nthis amendment.\n  Finally--and I know Senator Feingold wants to speak--finally, Mr. \nPresident, let me just say that if we really want to change the \npolitical culture in Washington and if we want to talk reform out of \none side of our mouth, then we are going to have to act on what we say \nin terms of how we vote and what we do.\n  I will just say to my colleagues, as painful as this issue is and as \ndisliked as this reform effort is by some, this is the right thing to \ndo and we can no longer be accepting these gifts and expect people to \nrespect this process, much less respect each and every one of us.\n  I will have more to say about this, Mr. President, as we get into the \nthick of the debate, and I assume that we will have a debate about this \nbecause I think it is an extremely important issue that goes to the \nheart of whether or not the political process in this country is going \nto work well and is going to be honest and is going to be open and is \ngoing to be accountable to citizens.\n  For now, I will conclude my remarks and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you. I certainly appreciate the \nleadership of the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Minnesota \non this issue. Listening to them talk about this so early in the \nsession gives me heart that we are going to get going on a reform \nagenda that is so important right away in the 104th Congress.\n  Let me also say I enjoyed listening to so many new Senators today \ngive their first speeches on this important piece of legislation. Just \n2 years ago, I had the honor and pleasure to give such a speech. I just \nwant to take this chance to wish each of the 11 new Senators well, and \nI look forward to working with them.\n  Mr. President, as the first week of the 104th Congress, this is also \na time when I think it is natural and appropriate for us to try to \ninterpret what the elections were all about on November 8. That is \nsomething that all of us have been doing for the last couple of months, \ntrying to draw some lessons from those elections. It is an appropriate \nthing to do because, of course, we are here to exercise in part our own \njudgment, but most importantly, we are here to reflect the goals and \naspirations of the people who elected us.\n  So when we come here in the first week, there are a lot of theories \nabout what happened. Some people say this was an election where people \njust decided they wanted to have the country run by Republicans. That \nis not a completely irrational interpretation of the election results.\n  Others would say they want conservatives to run the country rather \nthan liberals. Some just think it is an anti-incumbent feeling, that it \nis just time to have different people in there, they just want change \nand maybe they will do the same thing in 2 years.\n  Others take a look at the election results and suggest some very \nspecific legislative policies were endorsed by the people, best \nsymbolized by the Republican contract, which I do not happen to think \nwas endorsed by the American people. I am not sure they were aware of \nit. Certainly, that is one thing people are suggesting--welfare reform, \nterm limits, school prayer. Others say that the people called for a \nmiddle-class tax cut. I strongly disagree with that. I do not think the \npeople wanted that at all. But these are among the things being \ndebated, and they are fair grounds for debate.\n  The one thing I am pretty confident we can almost all agree upon is \nthat the people of this country think that Congress itself needs some \nreform. We may disagree on the kinds of specific reform, but the one \nmessage that I think was loud and clear is that this institution needs \nsome changes before the American people can feel very good about it \nagain. In fact, that is why I am very pleased and I give the new \nmajority a lot of credit for leading with this bill, and I think many \nDemocrats helped initiate the idea of congressional compliance; that we \nshould not be able to live by different rules than the ones we have \nmade for everybody else.\n  I hold many town meetings back in my home State, and this one is just \nan obvious one. People constantly say, ``Why in the world don't you \nlive by the same rules you make for us?'' Unfortunately, what it is for \nmany people is a feeling that maybe we are being hypocritical by \npassing these laws and finding some reasons why they should not apply \nto us but apply to all their employers.\n  There are other obvious reforms: Revolving door legislation, the \nfrequent flier legislation discussed, I think campaign finance reform \nis something that almost all Americans realize needs to happen, \nlobbying disclosure, and the like.\n  To me and so many of my constituents, one of the most important, \neasily the most obvious, reform is the reason I rise today, and that is \nas a cosponsor of the amendment by the Senator from Michigan, the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Senator from New Jersey, the Senator from \nOhio and I am delighted to see the Senator from Arizona of the other \nparty joining as a cosponsor on that issue. That issue, the subject of \nthis amendment, is to finally get a gift ban for Members of Congress.\n  I heard the comment made a lot last year, and even this year, even \nthis week when we know this is a time of reform, that nobody cares \nabout this issue. Some even say the election was proof that this is not \nan issue. The argument goes something like this: ``The Democrats didn't \nwin and because the Democrats brought this issue forward, it couldn't \nhave been much of an issue.''\n  But as the Senator from Minnesota pointed out very well, at least at \none point in the process last year, this was not just a Democratic \nissue, it was overwhelmingly endorsed by Senators of both parties and \noverwhelmingly endorsed by the House of Representatives.\n  In fact, one could also argue that it was the failure to pass the \ngift ban that hurt the Democrats. I do not think that is fair, but \npeople may have perceived it as an example of the gridlock that they \nsomehow interpreted as having something to do with the Democratic \nmajority.\n  We know very well that this gift ban was merely a victim, a \nsacrificial lamb in a mass bill-killing at the end of the session. But \nwho knows, it may have been one of those factors that led people to \nwant to switch teams, and that is exactly what they did.\n  There is one thing I am very confident of, and that is if the people \nof this country knew what happened after the gift ban was killed here \nin this room and just outside this room, they would have been very, \nvery upset. There was a very loud cheer that rose up in that room out \nthere we call the lobby. The lobbyists cheered very, very loudly \nbecause this bill had been killed.\n  What more symbolizes business as usual in Washington than the loud \ncheers that came in that hall when this very simple proposition could \nnot pass after it passed overwhelmingly in the U.S. Senate?\n  So whatever the role this issue played in the election, I firmly \nbelieve that the practice of this gift-giving is a significant part of \nthe feeling of the \n[[Page S466]] American people that there is something rotten in \nWashington. I believe it is that feeling, that there is something \nrotten in Washington, that had more to do with the results of this \nelection than anything else. I think that is what it was about, and I \nthink that is why this gift ban, although it may look like a little \nthing, really is part of a much bigger and much more serious issue, and \nthat issue is, do the people have faith in their Government anymore?\n  It is not much to ask the Senate and the other body to come together \nto do something about it. In fact, it is my own personal observation, \nafter having held over 100 town meetings in my State over the last 2 \nyears, that people actually feel insulted and disgusted by the fact \nthat this practice exists. I start talking about it and I cannot even \nget a sentence out about the practice before the whole crowd breaks out \nin spontaneous applause at the idea of this gift ban.\n Believe me, they do not applaud that way for everything I say. This \none always elicits a very powerful reaction of revulsion that this \npractice is permitted in Washington.\n\n  Now, maybe that happens in Wisconsin because we are awfully proud \nthat for 20 years we have had this rule in our State legislature, a \nrule that applied to me for my 10 years as a State senator. It has \nworked very well. Members of our State senate and the assembly are not \neven allowed to take a cup of coffee from a lobbyist. It has been no \nproblem for 20 years.\n  So maybe it is just that. Maybe it is just the people in Wisconsin \ncannot understand why Washington cannot do it if we can do it. But I \nthink it is more than that. I think it just does not fit with what \npeople believe the Senate should be engaged in.\n  Mr. President, others say that whatever the public's view may be, \nthis is not a good thing to be talking about; that it is just a form of \nself-flagellation; that it is trivial. And the more serious Senators \nsay that bringing this up, that talking about it hurts this \ninstitution; that it hurts the Senate to talk about it; that it demeans \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, it is my belief that it is not talking about the gift \nban that hurts the Senate. It is the practice of allowing gift giving. \nIt is the spectacle of having to turn on television in prime time and \nseeing the elaborate portrayals of the tennis and golf tournaments. It \nis the spectacle of, in our office, having received 800 gifts in the \nshort 2 years that I have been here. Now, our policy does not allow us \nto keep them, but we have logged them, from a bottle of cognac, to a 6-\ninch Waterford crystal, to an alarm clock, and recently I am told, \nalthough I was back home, a Christmas tree for every office. I do not \nknow if it was for the House as well but certainly for the Senate.\n  Let us assume for a moment that this is all pure generosity and it is \nwell intended. I think it looks silly. I think it is demeaning to the \nSenate. It hurts the dignity of the Senate because it does not show us \nfollowing rules as strictly as the American people believe should be \nobserved by their very highest officials.\n  But let me just in the last moment, Mr. President, take this one step \nfurther. It is my view that even if this is just something that looks \nbad and even if it makes us just look silly, if I did not think this \nwas a bad practice on the merits itself, then I do not think I would \nhave supported this effort to try to attach this to one of the very \nfirst bills in the 104th Congress. But I do think it is a bad practice. \nI do think it plays its role in changing the outcome of what happens in \nthis town.\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, I have reached the conclusion that this \ngift-giving is part of a closed circle of special interests in this \ntown that does play its role in blocking meaningful change, whether it \nbe trying to bring down the deficit, whether it be trying to achieve \nhealth care for all Americans, or whether it be trying to protect our \nenvironment.\n  I will say I respect all my colleagues. I do not think it has \nanything to do with the value of these gifts. It is because these gifts \nand this practice is part of a culture of special interest money and \ninfluence which includes campaign finance abuses and revolving doors \nfor staff members and Members, and this is a culture that is a barrier \nbetween the Members of Congress and the people they represent.\n  Mr. President, I think it makes the beltway look like more than a \nroad. I think it makes the beltway look like a boundary that too many \nAmericans believe separates America from another country or another \nprovince and that would be something they tend to perceive as the \nkingdom of special interest influence known as Washington, DC.\n  Let me just conclude by saying that although there were many moments \nthat troubled me during the debate last year, the moment that made me \nrealize just how important this legislation was, was when the last-\nditch argument was made that we could not do this because a number of \nimportant Washington, DC, restaurants would lose a lot of business.\n  Now, if a lot of Washington, DC, restaurants are going to have \ntrouble surviving, that means it is an awfully significant practice. \nAnd if we have come to that, where something that troubles the American \npeople and offends them is less important than making sure that some \nrestaurants here have enough lobbyists buying meals for Members of \nCongress, we have really gone too far.\n  So that in the first week of the 104th Congress I do not think there \nis any more appropriate amendment than the one we are bringing forward \ntoday to this bill, and I again thank my colleagues, especially the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Minnesota, for all their \nhard work on this issue. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to add my full support \nfor and to be a cosponsor of the amendment. It is based on legislation \nwhich, through the hard work of Senator Levin and Senator Cohen and \nseveral of us working with them, passed the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee last year which was still on my watch as chairman. It was on \na bipartisan basis. Senator Roth also worked with Senator Levin and \nSenator Cohen and myself.\n  As the saying say goes, no more free lunches. I am glad to say this \nyear we hope this may also apply to Members of Congress. For that \nmatter, gone, too, if we pass this amendment, will be the junkets to \nwarm and sunny places to escape the chill of the winter wind here in \nWashington. Kiss good-bye to freebie baseball tickets, if they ever \nplay baseball in the major leagues again. It does not look very hopeful \nat moment but it may happen, too.\n  Say sayonara to first-run plays at the Kennedy Center. You can still \ngo. You can attend. It is just that you cannot have somebody pick up \nthe tab for you. That is the only difference. You have to pony up \nyourself, like every other American.\n  I say we have to give tribute to the American people who made all \nthis possible by expressing their concerns about this loud and clear in \nthe last election. We have heard many references to November 8 and \npeople trying to analyze and superanalyze what happened then. That will \nbe saved for another day. But I do not think in any event we can turn a \ndeaf ear because we have gotten the message.\n  Now, do I subscribe to the notion that Members of Congress can be \nbought or are up for sale for a few tickets or for a few dinners? No, \nabsolutely not. I do not. The very thought discredits our labors, the \nvery hard work that goes on here, and such thoughts only undermine and \ndemean this institution. But it goes without saying that Government's \nfaith and credibility have been sorely tested these last few years. And \nif banning gifts and other lobbyist amenities is what it takes to begin \nrestoring public trust and integrity, then so be it. Act we must, \nwhether we really feel it is having any impact on what we do here or \nnot.\n  Do I think the gift ban will actually make a difference in how things \nare done around here? Probably not as much as most people really think. \nI do not think most people are bought by a dinner or two, or whatever. \nBut the main thing is we want to put everything aboveboard. We want to \ndo business the true old-fashioned way by meeting our own constituents \nas well as special interest lobbyists in the ambiance of our own \noffices.\n  I meet constituents, I meet lobbyists all the time in my office. They \ndo not \n[[Page S467]] need to buy access. They do not need to do me some favor. \nThey do not need to send gifts into the office in advance. We schedule \nthem, talk about their particular concerns, or sometimes I have been \nknown even to take some people to lunch myself and pay the bill myself.\n  The point is we all recognize that in this world of politics we are \nnot dealing sometimes with what is rationally considered out in the \nbusiness world. We deal with perceptions of what people think, their \nview of us, what the general air is around, how you run an office.\n  I think that is the reality of the situation. This institution which \nought to be revered and respected by all Americans has been subjected \nto scorn and ridicule, part of it because the talk shows or the \neditorialists or somebody writes about the dinners and the freebies and \nthe tickets and the so on around here as though they really run \nWashington on that basis. So we have had much scorn and ridicule. We \nhave been depicted as out-of-touch Members, being wined and dined by \nspecial interests and caring not for the Nation or our State but only \nfor our own reelection campaigns.\n  Now I do not happen to believe that is true for 99 percent of the \npeople in the Congress. But the perception, once again, is what we are \ndealing with.\n  We certainly deserve much of the blame for having let this happen. So \nit is a big step we take today, one which hopefully will show that we \nare serious about improving this body's reputation and standing with \nthe public.\n  Having said this, however, I must confess that in my view these \nissues are a really a diversion from the true heart of the matter. If \nwe really wanted to attack the notion of special interest access we \nwould be dealing more directly with campaign finance reform. If we want \nto talk about what would clean up politics across country it is \ncampaign finance reform more than anything else, not whether we limit \n$20 lunches or not.\n  In fact, just to illustrate that, I find it just a bit hypocritical \nto say that a Member could be bought for a $20 lunch, yet he can sit \ndown with that same lobbyist and ask for a $5,000 PAC contribution and \nget it. We may have to foot the bill for the lunch but it is a small \nprice to pay for a hefty campaign check. And it just does not make \nsense to do one without dealing with the other.\n  I think, really, if we were dealing with this we would be dealing \nwith Federal financing and make some sort of matching funds that would \ncut down some of the costs of campaigning so we do not have to go out \nand be dependent upon lobbyists and big contributors across the country \nfor every campaign we run. If we did something like that, provide at \nleast partial Federal financing for campaigns, we would do more to \nclean up politics than anything else.\n  Let me also just say I regret we are not considering what I truly \nbelieve would be also some guts of this reform and that is lobbying \ndisclosure. We were not even able to take up the conference report on \nthat measure toward the end of the last session. The conference report \ncame back, as we all recall, and even the motion to proceed to it was \nfilibustered. There were supposedly some grassroots problems that were \nhad on the other side, basically, with it. The gift part was OK, as far \nas the provisions in that conference report. The gift part of it was \nOK, but the lobbying part of it was opposed by some people.\n  What Senator Levin has done is he has cut back on that lobbying \nportion of it as it came back last year in the conference report and \nstuck more tightly just to the gift part of this thing. So it has been \nweakened in some respects. But we could not even get that conference \nreport up to be considered late in the last session.\n  I think there was a lot of misinformation and I do not know whether \nall the motives were pure or not in what people were trying to do in \nopposing that even coming to the floor. In my judgment, lobbying \ndisclosure will probably have a greater impact in rebuilding the \npeople's trust in Government than the gift ban. And I look forward to \nthe day when everyone will be able to know who is paying what to lobby \nwhom on which issue. Sunshine is always the best disinfectant. In some \ncases it may even be a repellent.\n  I know the hard work put in on this effort by Senators Levin and \nCohen in our Governmental Affairs Committee last year. I think we can \nsurely address what legitimate concerns have been raised about lobbying \ndisclosure and pass this bill expeditiously.\n  I would add, we have two different bills that were proposed on this \ncongressional coverage. One is just congressional coverage, period. \nThat is it. And that is the one that is before us today that is \nproposed to be amended.\n  The other one was the one put in by Democratic leadership, by Senator \nDaschle, by our minority leader. And it took basically that same bill, \ncongressional coverage, but added lobbying and gift ban to it. That is \nnot the bill before us. So the effort now is to take those other \nprovisions and add them to this. I must admit I started out thinking \nthat perhaps this would complicate things in getting it over to the \nHouse and getting it passed expeditiously, which I certainly support \nand want to do. But when you look back at the track record and what has \nhappened with regard to this legislation, there is not all this need \nfor a chance to govern or for great Senate leadership that Senator \nCohen, my good friend Senator Cohen, alluded to a few moments ago. Let \nus look at the record on this. Play the tape over again.\n  In 1994 the House passed the gift ban, not once but twice. So it \npassed the House. It is not a matter of having to have great leadership \nto work out our differences with the House. They passed it twice last \nyear. They passed the lobbying part of it, which is not a major part of \nthis now. That has been watered down. But they passed this twice last \nyear. What happened in the Senate? In May of last year the Senate \napproved S. 1935 that banned gifts to all congressional personnel and \nstaff and passed it by a vote of 95 to 4. So here we have two votes \nover in the House, we have a vote here in the Senate on the same thing. \nWe had the agreement in conference that was worked out. Yet we could \nnot get that up.\n  So as far as this idea that the new congressional leadership has to \nhave a chance to lead, a chance to govern--to me rings just a bit \nhollow, rings a bit untrue here, because we have already had full \nagreement on these things between the House and the Senate repeatedly. \nAnd the filibuster last fall is the only reason we did not get the \nconference report through. So I feel the House already has spoken on \nthis.\n  There are a lot of new Members over in the House. But I do not think \ntheir views on gift ban and lobbying are going to be that different \nfrom those of the House the last time around. So this idea that we need \nsome great chance to govern or need some new leadership when both sides \nhave already agreed and voted repeatedly on the same issue that we are \ntalking about, rings just a bit hollow. So I think the House, with the \npast record over there, would be more likely to, if we put this on, put \non the amendment that Senator Levin is proposing--I would think they \nwould be prone to accept it. And hopefully we could get ahead with \nthis, rather than having to have a whole separate bill brought up and \ndebated once again, have its own series of amendments, I suppose, and \nit just delays it until later in the year when, I repeat once again, \nfor the fourth time, I guess, that the House and the Senate have \nalready acted repeatedly on the gift bans that he is proposing. So why \nnot put it on this and get it through in one bill? Then we can get on \nwith other legislation. This year is going to be full of legislation \nanyway.\n  The House passed this 306 to 112, I am told here. I did not look that \nup. They passed it overwhelmingly last year. We had overwhelming \nvotes--95 to 4 here in the Senate. The House passed it twice. And the \npart that disturbed some people here, the lobbying part of it--OK that \nhas been watered down by Senator Levin. So that is now just a sense of \nthe Senate.\n  So I see no reason why we should not accept this and go ahead. I \nthink real leadership here, a chance to govern, would be to include the \nmost we can in this package here that has already been agreed to by the \nHouse and Senate and get on with it so we can save floor time and \ncommittee time for other more important items as we go through the \nyear.\n  [[Page S468]] So I support this and want to compliment Senator Levin \nagain. He stuck with this. He has really stuck with it, not just \nbecause it is politically good for him. I know because I talked with \nhim. He stuck with it because he believes in it. He thinks it is right \nand I think it is right too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will be extremely brief. I understand \nthere will be a motion to table shortly, if debate has been completed. \nLet me just say that I am pleased that my friend from Michigan has \ndecided not to press the lobbyist disclosure measure at this particular \ntime. As he knows, I have been in discussions with the American Civil \nLiberties Union about that bill. It seems to this Senator and to the \nACLU that in many ways the bill, even in its current incarnation, \nsignificantly impairs the ability of citizens in this country to \npetition Congress, something they have a constitutional right to do. So \nI think we need to continue to work on that, and I am pleased that the \nSenator from Michigan has chosen not to press that here today.\n  With regard to the gift issue, as we all know the gift issue is a \nSenate rule. It can be enacted by the Senate alone, whenever the Senate \nchooses to act. It does not require the concurrence of the House. Back \nin the fall when we were engaged in a dispute, driven principally by \nthe flaws in the lobbying portion, I, along with a number of my \ncolleagues, proposed moving ahead and passing the gift provision, \nseparate and apart from the lobby disclosure provisions.\n  It was the prerogative, of course, of the then majority leader, \nSenator Mitchell, to bring up the gift matter since it could not be \noffered as an amendment to the measure before us because of the \nconference report. The conference report had married together the \nchanges to the gift rules and the lobby disclosure statutory change. \nAnd we had a conference report before us. Senator Dole had suggested \nthat we would defeat the conference report and be willing to act on the \nSenate rules. Senator Mitchell chose not to call up the Senate rule at \nthat time, apparently feeling that it was for whatever reason not a \ngood idea to pass the rule all by itself. That was at the end of the \nCongress.\n  Here we are at the beginning of the Congress. In fact, the first act \nof the day in the Senate, it would be in my view, could be that there \nwould be further refinements made in the gift measure. I do not think \nthere is any compelling reason to do it today. It is the beginning of a \nCongress, not the end of one. What is also at stake here, Mr. \nPresident, quite frankly, is the issue of running the Senate. Senator \nDole may well decide at a timing of his choosing to bring up a gift ban \nproposal. My view is that, should he decide to do that, we will have \none that makes sense and revises the current gift rule. We can do that \nwholly apart from what may or may not be going on in the House because \nwe can do that obviously with our own rule.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that what is really at issue today is \nsort of the control issue. We all would like to see congressional \naccountability pass. It seems to this Senator that the best way to do \nthat is to pass it as it is without amendment.\n  Even though I will predict that at some point this year we will pass \na gift rule revision, my prediction is that it will be better than the \none currently offered in this amendment, better for the Senate and \nbetter for the public; and that today what we ought to do is pass the \nCongressional Accountability Act, something I think virtually everybody \nhere is in favor of it. It is ready to go. We know the House is \ninterested in receiving our version.\n  So I hope that whenever a motion to table is made that it would be \napproved and that we commit to my friend from Michigan that we will \ncontinue to work on this. I think it is likely that it would be \napproved sometime soon. I believe we can make it even better than the \nversion currently being offered by the Senator from Michigan.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I will take a few \nminutes to discuss my point of view on this piece of legislation. I am \na cosponsor of the amendment which would prohibit Members of Congress \nfrom accepting gifts, travel from lobbyists and others.\n  Mr. President, if this past election proved anything it is that the \nAmerican people want change. They want Congress to respond first and \nforemost to the needs of ordinary citizens, not special interests, not \njust the wealthy, not just the lobbyists.\n  I introduced a piece of legislation, something so similar that this \nis indistinguishable from what I introduced at that time. It was in May \nof 1993. At that time, Mr. President, there were many of us here, many \nhere on Capitol Hill that did not appreciate the depth of the public's \nanger. Today I think it is quite obvious that the message was loud and \nthe message was clear. And I think that everybody today understands how \nthe public feels. And it is time, way past time, as a matter of fact, \nto finally translate that anger into action.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe, and few do, that Members of Congress \nare selling their votes for the price of a meal or a free trip to the \nCaribbean. But it is hard to believe that when a lobbyist takes a \nSenator to dinner that they are only buying a meal. What they are \nbuying is access, and access is power. Ordinary citizens do not have \nthat access. They cannot just take their Senator or this Congress \nperson to a quiet dinner at an expensive restaurant and explain what it \nis like to be afraid, to be concerned about the future, to be concerned \nabout your job, to be concerned about whether or not your child is \ngoing to be able to climb the ladder of success, what it is like to be \nemployed. Certainly they cannot take Members to resorts in the \nCaribbean or out in the mountains to discuss their personal tax \nproblem. But meanwhile lobbyists have been doing these things for \nyears. It gives them a distinct edge.\n  Mr. President, when Americans see Members of Congress being wined and \ndined by lobbyists, they do not like it. They resent it. They believe \nwith that kind of imagery that the deck is stacked against them, and \nthey think it is wrong. They do not respect the system that operates \nthat way.\n  As I said earlier, I do not stand before my colleagues to criticize \nanyone or to question anybody's motives. I am not claiming to be \nparticularly holier than thou--but I do think that we need to change \nthe way that we do business. This is the time and the place to do it. \nWe are, after all, considering a bill that is designed to eliminate \ndouble standards for the Congress, standards differing from that of the \naverage person. And it is a terrible double standard for the executive \nbranch to be living under stringent gift rules while Members of \nCongress continue to accept gifts from others.\n  I would also point out, Mr. President, that many in the private \nsector are living under the type of tough standard proposed in this \namendment. The occupant of the chair comes from the business community, \nas I do. As a matter of fact, our paths crossed indirectly in our \nprevious lives. I was a CEO of a major corporation before I came to the \nSenate, and I know that the distinguished Senator from Utah also was \nhead of a significant corporation.\n  In my company we had very strict rules prohibiting purchasing agents \nfrom accepting gifts from suppliers. I did not think our people were \ndishonest. But I wanted to make sure that there was no temptation, no \nseduction on the part of the supplier to get a special advantage. I \nwanted the products that we bought, the merchandise that we bought, to \nbe considered strictly on the basis of quality, ability to deliver and \nthe appropriate price, nothing more. Lots of companies have similar \nrules. If these companies can live with these restrictions, I believe \nthat it is fair to say that we in this body can also.\n  Mr. President, just a few months ago Republicans in this body and in \nthe House chose to defeat lobbying reform legislation that included a \ngift ban. At the time, our colleagues claimed that they were supporting \nthe gift ban but they were concerned about other provisions in the \nbill. Others suggested that perhaps the motive was partisan to deny \nDemocrats credit. I am not going \n[[Page S469]] to comment about anyone's motives last year. It is water \nunder the bridge. I made some comments at that time that I think \nperhaps were misunderstood, was taken piecemeal out of the television \ninterview.\n  But once again, I state very, very clearly that my view is that \npeople are not corrupted by a meal or a present or a trip or a golf \ngame. But the appearance is not one that the American people believe \ngives them the same fair deal that some on the special inside track \nhas.\n  I hope my colleagues will agree to support this amendment which \nincludes the very same gift ban that they claimed to support last year. \nAs a matter of fact, it won 95 to 4, I believe was the count--\noverwhelming. The eyes of America are on the new leadership and on this \nCongress. If we cannot bring ourselves to ban gifts from lobbyists it \nwill be a sign that for all of the talk of reform we are still back in \npolitics as usual. The fact of saying one thing but doing another, the \nfact of putting special interests first and the ordinary citizens last, \nwould be a terrible and deeply disturbing message for this Congress to \nsend, and we ought not to do that.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will join me.\n  Let it be voted upon. Let us take the count and see what happens. \nThat is what the American people are entitled to know. What do the \nMembers of this body really believe when they say they want to change \nthings? It is easy. Get a tally of the vote, and it adds up to 100. \nWhichever way the majority rules is what will be done.\n  So I would like to see it done with support from both sides of the \naisle, in the spirit of the new mood of cooperation. I hope it can be \ndone. I think it is very important to set the record straight, and you \ndo it step by step. This is a very important first step.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I just want to respond to some of the \ncomments from my colleague from Kentucky about this amendment, the gift \nban provisions. My colleague said that he thought it could be improved \nupon, but again I point out that this is precisely the language of the \nproposal introduced by the majority leader and 36 other Republicans. \nMr. President, I can go through the provisions of this gifts proposal--\nand I guess I would like to ask my colleague, what would you want to \nimprove on? What do you want in and what do you want out?\n  Mr. President, what I have heard on the floor of the Senate in the \nlast hour or so really startled me. And I think it is going to be a \nhuge problem for our country. The word ``governing'' was used earlier. \nAgain, Mr. President, people were talking about meals. It is not just \nmeals. There are examples of trade association-paid trips to the \nBahamas, Hawaii, you name it. We ought to end this practice. But I \nwould like people in the country to know--and I was amazed that I heard \nmy colleague from Kentucky just say it so clearly. He said, ``This is \nabout control.'' That is what this is about? So, colleagues, this is \nnot about merit, this is not about reform. When everyone ran for \noffice, they talked about reform. I doubt whether very many of my \ncolleagues talked about control. That is what this issue is about. Do \nnot vote for an amendment that puts an end to a practice that leads \npeople in our country to believe that something is wrong with the way \nwe conduct business in Washington. Do not respond to what people want \nus to do now. Continue with this practice, as egregious as it is, and \ndo it because of control. That is what I heard my colleague say from \nKentucky, that this is about control.\n  I thought it was about merit. I thought this was about reform. I \nthought this was about the Congressional Accountability Act. I thought \nthis was about making Senators more accountable. I thought this was \nabout good government.\n  Mr. President, I may or may not be a little out of line. I am just \nspeaking for myself as one Senator from Minnesota, but if the \ndefinition of control now in the Senate is that, by definition, any \namendment introduced from our side of the aisle bumps up against \ncontrol and, regardless of merit, will be voted down, that is very \ndifferent from the way in which I thought the Senate operated--at least \nduring the time I have been here. If that is what this is all about--\ncontrol--then I will have this amendment on gift ban up on the floor \nover and over and over again, and I guess we will be talking about \ncontrol and control and control over and over again.\n  I thought that this was a legislative process, a democratic process, \nan amendment body, and Senators voted amendments up or down on the \nbasis of their own independence and on the basis of merit, not on the \nbasis of control.\n  So, Mr. President, I yield the floor for the moment, but I would be \ninterested in some response by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, since I do not think people in the United States of America in \nthis past election voted for control. They voted for good change. They \nvoted for reform. They voted for reaching beyond our parties. They \nvoted for doing the right thing, albeit people have different \ndefinitions of doing the right thing. They did not vote for control. I \nthink this debate now about this amendment has become bigger than the \namendment. It has a great deal to do with the way we are going to \nconduct ourselves here in the Senate. I would be interested in a \nresponse from my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PELL.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a very prescient and sensible article about Cuba which \nappeared in the Winter 1994 Newsletter of the Duke Family Association.\n  The article, entitled Fidel Fading: U.S. Should Play Role in Cuba, \nwas written by Biddle Duke, a journalist working in Santa Fe. He has \nvisited Cuba twice in recent years, most recently last spring, when he \nserved as an aide to two Washington-based public policy groups, the \nAppeal to Conscience Foundation and the Council of American \nAmbassadors.\n  Mr. Duke makes a strong case for modifying United States policy on \nCuba. The economic crisis there has become so acute, he says, that it \ncan be used in effect as a lever for normalized relations. He \nrecommends that the United States send humanitarian aid and lift the \nembargo at least partially. While offering a hand of conditional \nfriendship we should push for a free and open Cuban society.\n  I concur with Mr. Duke's views and I ask unanimous consent that his \narticle be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n            [From the Duke Family Association, Winter, 1994]\n\n              Fidel Fading: U.S. Should Play Role in Cuba\n\n                            (By Biddle Duke)\n\n       Everywhere in Cuba one hears and sees the despair. A 24-\n     year old engineer works three days a week as a building \n     supervisor for less than the equivalent of three dollars a \n     month, has two thin meals a day, meat once a week, and spends \n     much of his time hanging out on Havana's waterfront. On \n     Friday in April he is swimming off the rocks with this \n     brother.\n       ``We've got schools and doctors, but what good is that \n     without food or medicine or jobs?'' he tell an American \n     visitor in Spanish.\n       In the same breath, he asks, ``Can you spare some \n     dollars?''\n       Then, sardonically, ``Viva la revolucion.''\n       Throughout the country, people seem to be waiting for \n     something to happen.\n       They are a people waking from the dream of communist Cuba's \n     heyday of the 1970s and '80s when Fidel Castro worked the \n     world stage like a master of the game, and his face and his \n     nation became synonymous with third world sovereignty and \n     nationalism; when Cubans fought proudly for working class \n     freedom around the globe.\n       They are waking from the glorious delusion of Soviet \n     subsidies to the tragic anachronism of present-day Cuba. \n     Cubans are all in something of national pause, standing on \n     [[Page S470]] a cusp of their history, either dazed in the \n     disbelief that their dreams are shattered, or cynical or \n     despondent.\n       In Cuba's dire economic crisis there is a tremendous \n     potential force for change. Basic foods, medicine, oil, \n     gasoline and electricity are strictly rationed. \n     Transportation is poor and undependable. Whole chunks of the \n     nation are regularly hit with black outs. Infant mortality is \n     up. So is suicide.\n       Cubans in exile and those remaining in Cuba are ready to \n     listen and make some steps toward reconciliation. The country \n     is poised for change. And, most importantly, it is \n     vulnerable.\n       Cuba's malaise has opened the door for the United States to \n     play a critical role in Cuba's future. In the mold of our \n     approach to China, Vietnam and South Africa, we should offer \n     a hand of conditional friendship while still pushing for a \n     free and open Cuban society.\n       Our national and political conscience dictates that we \n     respond to Cuba's plight by at least encouraging humanitarian \n     aid shipments. And, in doing so, this nation can send a \n     powerful message: Our capitalist democracy works. Despite its \n     many shortcomings, the United States has the medicine and \n     food to spare for many in need, especially Cubans, so close \n     to us historically and culturally.\n       Encouraging aid should be the Clinton administration's \n     first step in making friendly overtures to the Cuban people \n     and pushing Fidel and his intransigent Marxist Leninism into \n     obsolescence. The administration should initiate a bargaining \n     process over the embargo which should include a combination \n     of diplomatic overtures and policies to improve communication \n     between Cubans and Americans.\n       Although Fidel might use U.S. aid to blow a little breath \n     into the dying corpse of his revolution, the U.S. free press \n     is easily more effective over the long run in spreading the \n     truth about the food and medicine that would be making it \n     into the Cubans' hands. Already, CNN and other TV stations \n     are captured by thousands in Cuba by pirate satellites. Radio \n     Marti, out of Florida, offers a daily diet of information \n     from the outside world to Cuban listeners. The message to \n     Cubans from all of these sources would be loud and clear: \n     What you are getting is American goodwill. And if it is not \n     reaching you, blame Fidel.\n       The powerful message of freedom already is carried via the \n     vibrant but informal links that exist between the 1.2 million \n     American Cubans and their friends and families in Cuba. The \n     administration should encourage this exchange by negotiating \n     for direct postal and telephone service between our two \n     nations; the exchange of students, teachers, artists, writers \n     and other professionals; allowing travel to Cuba by American \n     tourists; and permitting U.S. journalists to be stationed \n     there.\n       Underlying all these proposals should be a request by the \n     administration to begin official discussions on the embargo \n     with Havana and an agreement to raise the level of the U.S. \n     envoy if Cuba does the same. The ultimate goal would be full \n     diplomatic relations.\n       The rest, and perhaps most significant elements of the \n     embargo, principally the prohibition of the U.S. investment \n     in Cuba, as well as a prohibition on most commerce, could be \n     lifted over the long term if political conditions in Cuba and \n     the nation's human rights record improve.\n       Setting the stage for negotiations would put the United \n     States in command, no matter what Fidel's reaction would be. \n     If he balked, Castro would have difficulty explaining to his \n     hungry people why he turned down food and medicine, the \n     scarcity of which define the embargo to most Cubans. If he \n     agreed to a gradual opening of relations, the irrepressible \n     forces of capitalism and social reform, some of which are \n     already evident, in all likelihood would sweep the nation.\n       Cubans are proud and patriotic, and Fidel plays on this. As \n     long as the United States is inflexible on the embargo, we \n     remain the imperialist enemy in their minds, and the \n     revolution, the Cuban struggle to get out from under our \n     thumb, goes on. But if the administration allows aid \n     shipments and sets up a bargaining table, and Fidel does not \n     step up, he will look like the defiant, stubborn dinosaur \n     that he is. And something of a hypocrite, since he \n     continually is calling for an end to what he calls the \n     ``blockade.''\n       The administration has so far taken the least politically \n     taxing course on Cuba, which is to maintain the antagonistic \n     status quo. And that's unlikely to change until after the \n     1996 election. In order to carry Florida, many believe \n     Clinton must let the conservative wealthy Cuban American \n     National Foundation dictate Cuban policy, which pushed for \n     the strengthening of the embargo as recently as 1992.\n       The truth is that many exiled Cubans want the embargo at \n     least partially lifted, enough to help those left on the \n     island through these tough times. And many Americans wonder \n     why the embargo, which was imposed in 1962 by President \n     Kennedy, wasn't dissolved with the end of the Cold War.\n       A growing number of conservatives and liberals and some of \n     the nation's leading newspapers already have advocated an end \n     to the embargo, saying that it is an antiquated policy that \n     is hurting Cubans, not Fidel's regime. They argue rightly \n     that Cuba and the spread of communism no longer are threats \n     to our stability or the stability of the hemisphere. \n     Communism and the Cuban revolution are indisputable failures.\n       Interestingly, Fidel is not a complete failure to Cubans. \n     He's all they have; just Fidel, who thumbed his nose at the \n     United States and put Cuba on the geopolitical map. But \n     that's not enough anymore.\n       A young Cuban woman told me this story of two old brothers \n     who lived together in the hills. They had fought in the \n     revolution and believed in it. Now, hungry and old and \n     crushed by the reality of the revolution's failure, one of \n     them hanged himself with his belt in the rafters of his \n     house. When the guardia came to take his body away, the other \n     man asked that the belt be left behind to remind him of his \n     brother and the reason he took his life. After the guardia \n     departed, the second brother used it to hang himself. These \n     are the stories of Cuba these days.\n       Optimism drives us all, and the future of Cuba, the dreams \n     of almost two generations of Cubans who've grown up both in \n     exile and under the delusion of the revolution, could be \n     realized in coming decades. Second to the Cuban people, the \n     United States is the most important force for positive change \n     on the island. Americans have a choice: between provoking \n     change with obsolete and misplaced hostility or encouraging \n     it, as we did in South Africa, as constructive, engaged \n     critics.\n       There is a chance that we could strangle Cubans into a \n     violent revolution. And there is a chance that we could offer \n     them some choices and hope, and help them make the right \n     decisions.\n       Biddle Duke has been to Cuba twice, most recently this \n     spring, as an aide to Washington-based public policy groups, \n     the Appeal of Conscience Foundation and the Council of \n     American Ambassadors.

Mr. President, as I look at the vast array of foreign \npolicy issues the 104th Congress will address, United States policy \ntoward Cuba stands out in my mind as the most in need of a dramatic \noverhaul. I believe all my colleagues agree on the goals of United \nStates policy toward Cuba--promoting a peaceful transition to \ndemocracy, economic liberalization and greater respect for human rights \nwhile controlling immigration from Cuba. Where some of us may differ, \nhowever, is on how we get there. In my view, current policy is not only \noutdated and ineffective, but, far worse, it is counterproductive to \nfostering these goals and contrary to U.S. national interests.\n  Rather than tightening the embargo and further isolating Cuba, as the \nUnited States has done, we should be expanding contact with the Cuban \npeople and lifting the embargo. I say this not because I believe the \nCuban Government should be rewarded; in fact, I am disappointed that \nthe Cuban Government has failed to make meaningful steps towards \npolitical reform and improving human rights. Nor do I believe that it \nshould be done as a quid pro quo. We should lift the embargo simply \nbecause it serves the U.S. national interests by helping foster a \npeaceful transition to democracy.\n  In my view, greater contact with the Cuban people will plant the \nseeds of change and advance the cause of democracy just as greater \nexchange with the West helped hasten the fall of communism in Eastern \nEurope. In his posthumously published book, former President Nixon \nwrote that ``we should drop the economic embargo and open the way to \ntrade, investment and economic interaction * * *.'' Nixon believed we \nwould better help the Cuban people by building ``pressure from within \nby actively stimulating Cuba's economic contracts with the free \nworld.'' William D. Rogers, who served as Assistant Secretary of State \nfor Inter-American Affairs for the Ford administration, also believes \nthe embargo should be lifted. As he testified before the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee last year, ``The breakup of the Soviet system \noccurred not because we cut off trade and human interchange, but \nbecause we didn't.''\n  United States travel restrictions to and from Cuba, only 90 miles \naway, are among the most prohibitive in the world. At this point, only \nUnited States government officials and journalists are allowed to \ntravel to Cuba without having to obtain a license, and only a handful \nof Cubans are allowed to travel to the United States. I would ask my \ncolleagues, do we not have enough faith in the power of our system to \nlet contact between our citizens flourish?\n  Current policy not only denies the United States the opportunity to \npromote positive change in Cuba, but it increases the likelihood of \nwidespread \n[[Page S471]] political violence and another mass exodus of refugees to \nFlorida. The Cuban Government, which is successfully expanding \npolitical and economic ties with the rest of the world, is unlikely to \ngive in to United States demands. If economic pressure succeeds in \nencouraging the people to take to the streets, the most likely \nconsequence would be bloodshed. The military remains united behind \nCastro, the opposition is too weak and the government too repressive \nfor any uprising to be successful.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle will join officials who served in the Bush, Reagan, Ford, Nixon, \nand Kennedy administrations as well as the editors of the Wall Street \nJournal, the Washington Post, the New York Times, USA Today, the \nEconomist, the Journal of Commerce, the Chicago Tribune, and U.S. News \n& World Report in calling for an overhaul of United States policy \ntoward Cuba and working to promote a peaceful transition to democracy \nin Cuba.\n  Let us try the same policies and the same methods that have produced \nthe freedom that has come to Eastern Europe and Central Europe and \nknocked off the shackles, chains of the Soviet Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S470-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH K. HAUGER\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened last month by the \ndeath of Deborah Hauger who served as the Latin American advisor to the \nformer chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Lee \nHamilton. I had the pleasure of meeting Deborah on several occasions \nand was struck by her intelligence, vibrance, warmth and her deep \ncommitment to doing what was right for United States foreign policy and \nfor the people of Latin America.\n  I came to know Deborah through my work with Congressman Lee Hamilton \nto change United States policy toward Cuba. On behalf of myself and \nCongressman Hamilton, she and a member of my staff traveled to Cuba and \nreported to us their strong belief that United States policy was \ncounterproductive and contrary to United States national interests. She \ndemonstrated enormous commitment to the Cuba issue in particular, and \nto promoting democracy and human rights throughout the hemisphere.\n  She died at the young age of 34 and her death is a great loss not \nonly to her family, friends and colleagues, but to the foreign policy \nof this country, to the people of Latin America and to the U.S. \nCongress as well. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending my \nsincere condolences to her family, to Congressman Hamilton and to her \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S471-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S471-S478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to call attention to a bit \nof an inconsistency in this amendment. If I may direct a question to \none of the managers with regard to the amendment that is pending.\n  Is it correct that the Senator from Alaska, as he reads the \nprohibition on gifts, that it precludes a Senator from being reimbursed \nfor travel or transportation to a charitable event such as the event \nwhich for a number of years was sponsored by former Senator Jake Garn \nof Utah? As my colleagues know, that was for a charitable purpose of \nthe Children's Hospital. I think several hundred thousand dollars were \nraised for that purpose. As a consequence, transportation was provided \nto Members as well as lodging.\n  Under the proposed amendment, would transporation and lodging \nreimbursement for such a charitable event be precluded? I would be \nhappy to have a response to my question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if the Senator would allow the Senator from \nMichigan to respond to that question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Surely.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the answer to the question is yes, it is \nthe same language as was in the conference report which was before the \nSenate last October, which had the support of the vast majority on both \nsides of the aisle and is the same language that was in an earlier \nbill. The answer is yes.\n  The reason for it is that a significant portion of the money which is \ncontributed by the interest groups to those events is used for the \ntransportation, lodging, and the recreation of Members of Congress. \nThat is the reason for it.\n  But the answer to your question is yes, it is the same language as \nwas in the conference report.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if I could follow up with one \nother question. Why would we preclude reimbursement for transportation \nand lodging for charitable events, yet allow transportation and lodging \nfor political events?\n  It is my understanding that there is nothing in this amendment that \nwould preclude a Member from going out to Los Angeles for a political \nevent, getting his lodging taken care of, getting his transportation \ntaken care of.\n  Mr. President, I think there is an inconsistency here as relates to \nthe merits of considering gift ban legislation. And I wonder why the \nfloor managers have not seen fit to include a prohibition which I \nunderstand was not in last year's bill either. I think that the \nAmerican people should understand as we consider the merits of banning \ngifts, that there is certainly reasonable expectation that if we ban it \nfor charitable events, that we ought to also ban it for political \nevents. I wonder if my colleague would enlighten me as to whether I am \naccurate in my interpretation that, indeed, for political events, one \ncould get full reimbursement for travel and full reimbursement for \nlodging.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Alaska raised this very point during a \ndebate on the language which would ban travel to the so-called \ncharitable events. That exact argument was raised. The Senator from \nAlaska attempted to strike the language which would have or which does \nprohibit the travel paid for to these so-called charitable events, and \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alaska was defeated, I believe, by a \nvote of 58-37.\n  So, that argument was made at the time and the distinction had to do \nwith whether political events are within the political activities of \nelected officials and are different from entertainment, lodging, meals, \nand travel to entertain where one brings his or her family. The \ndistinction was adopted by the Senate during that debate by a vote of \n58-37, I believe.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, Mr. President, I respect the response from my \ncolleague, but when we consider just what constitutes a gift, I think \nwe have to recognize that if we travel to a charitable event to raise \nmoney for a worthwhile cause, there is some merit to that. On the other \nhand, if we go to a political event in Los Angeles and get our \ntransportation paid for and get our lodging paid for, that is \nmeritorious, too, from a political point of view. But we are talking \nabout a great inconsistency here in this legislation that is proposed \nby my colleagues on the other side. We are talking about cleansing the \nprocess, the process of accepting gifts. But they do not want to touch \nthe area that is sacrosanct, and that is specifically political \ncontributions and the way that money is raised.\n  Money is raised by travel to legitimate political events. And \nreimbursement occurs not only for the Member but, very often, for the \nspouse as well. And so I hope that those watching this among the \nAmerican public, as they reflect on the merits of this debate on gifts, \nrecognize the inconsistency that is proposed here. If my friends on the \nother side were suggesting that we do away with gifts, period, do away \nwith gifts associated with charitable events, we do away with gifts \nthat are associated with political events from a standpoint of travel \nand a standpoint of lodging, then there would be consistency.\n  But clearly, that is not the intention because there is a lot of \nmoney raised in this process. That process gets Members elected. So, I \nthink as we address the merits of reform here in this body on the issue \nof gifts, we should specifically reflect on this other overlooked \nissue--political travel. As most of us recognize, the reason my \namendment did not pass last year is there was some motivation, the \nmotivation by those that suggested that that was too great a sacrifice, \ntoo great a sacrifice to give up political travel.\n\n[[Page S472]]\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment offered \nby the distinguished Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone]. I have \nlittle doubt that Congress, some time this year, will vote to ban most \ngifts to Senators and Congressmen.\n  Why will we make that change? Because there is a perception in the \ncountry that accepting a meal or a small gift from a lobbyist somehow \ncorrupts the moral fiber of Congress. So we will pass the gift and meal \nban to fix the perception problem.\n\n\n                         end pac contributions\n\n  I have no problem with banning gifts. But I believe it is \nhypocritical to say that you cannot buy a Senator lunch, but its OK for \na political action committee [PAC] to give a Senator $10,000 for his \npolitical campaign or for a lobbyist to sponsor a $500-per-person \npolitical fundraiser.\n  Last year, the Senate adopted my amendment banning all lobbyist and \nPAC contributions to Senators. However, when the lobby disclosure/gift \nban bill emerged from the Democratically controlled conference, my PAC \nand lobbyist contribution ban reform had, not surprisingly, been \ndeleted.\n  Mr. President, if we are really sincere in getting special interest \nmoney out of politics, then we ought to stop wasting our time arguing \nover small gratuities, gifts and meals, and instead focus our efforts \non ending the insidious activities of political action committees.\n  Since passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, the \nnumber of PAC's increased from 608 to 4,729 in 1992. Total PAC \ncontributions to Federal election candidates increased more than 2,000 \npercent--from $8.5 million in 1972 to $189 million in 1992.\n  In 1992, PAC contributions comprised 24 percent of Senate campaign \nreceipts and 38 percent of House campaign receipts. PAC's are touted by \ntheir defenders as a means to allow individuals to get together and \nadvance their collective interests in politics. Presumably, that would \ninclude supporting challengers. Yet, in 1992, in races where Members \nwere up for reelection, incumbents received 86 percent of the PAC \ncontributions--$126 million for incumbents versus $21 million for \nchallengers.\n  Overall, PAC's distributed more than $160 million to congressional \ncandidates in 1992; $24 million--15 percent--went to candidates running \nfor open seats. Since the 1970's, PAC's increasingly have funneled \ncontributions to incumbents with little or no regard for ideology or \nvoting records. Corporate and trade association PAC's are among the \nworst in this regard, giving upward of 90 percent of their PAC \ncontributions to incumbents.\n\n\n            reimbursement for charitable travel and lodging\n\n  Moreover, Mr. President, I oppose the portion of this amendment that \ndisallows Senators from being reimbursed for travel and lodging in \nconnection with a charitable event. This is another example of the \nhypocrisy of the bill. Nothing prevents a lobbyist from paying a \nSenator's travel and lodging if it is in connection with a political \nfundraiser. If a lobbyist wants to pay for a Senator to go to Hollywood \nto raise money for the Democrats or Republicans, that's permitted.\n  But if I want to host another charitable function like I had this \nsummer where I raised more than $120,000 for a portable mammography \nmachine that helps detect breast cancer, transportation and lodging \ncannot be reimbursed. This rule is not only hypocritical but also \ndiscriminates against charitable events in Alaska because the cost to \ntravel there is so high.\n  You can be sure that charitable functions will continue to be well-\nattended by Senators, Congressmen, and lobbyists if they occur inside \nthe beltway. But if we want to do a charitable function that benefits \nthe needy in Alaska, it's going to be nearly impossible.\n  Mr. President, my colleague Senator McConnell has been working on a \nrealistic gift ban and PAC ban bill that will address the so-called \nproblems associated with special interest influence in Washington. We \nwill surely have an opportunity to consider these issues later in the \nyear.\n  But now, the issue before us is whether we are willing to apply the \nlaws we impose on the rest of the country on our own institution. This \namendment is merely a diversion from that issue. Let us pass the \ncongressional coverage bill now, and address the gift ban/PAC ban \nlegislation at a more appropriate time.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not going to talk any longer. I just wanted \nto point out the inconsistency here.\n  This whole matter began rather curiously when the association of \nformer Senator Jake Garn from Utah ran a charitable event that was for \na children's hospital--a very worthwhile cause. But a so-called \ntelevision expose featured several Members of this body, some of whom \nhave already spoken on the issue of gift bans, and which implied that \nMembers were being bought off by accepting transportation and accepting \nlodging.\n  There is very little consideration as to the contribution given to \nthe Children's Hospital. I participate in that event each year, and I \nintend to participate in the event again this year because it is a \nworthwhile cause. Because Senators come, there is an attraction, \nwhether it be curious or otherwise, to raise money for the effort, and \nit is a worthwhile effort.\n  Obviously, I can hold a charity event here in Washington, DC. If I \nhold that charity event here, there is no transportation; there is no \nlodging. I can legitimately do it. But if I want to hold it in my \nState, it is a significant cost to Members if they want to come up to \nAlaska for a fishing event of some kind for a worthwhile charity.\n  We had an event last year to buy a new mammogram, a mammography \nmachine for the Best Cancer Clinic of Alaska. We raised $149,000. There \nwere no other Senators who could come because we were in session, but \nwe were not precluded because the legislation proposed last year did \nnot pass the conference. But it was a worthwhile cause.\n  The inconsistency, I think, is obvious, as a consequence of what we \nhave before us. We seem willing to do away with reimbursement for \ntransportation and lodging, but we would still provide it for political \nevents. That is the inconsistency which this Senator sees is so \nglaring. That is why I urge my colleagues, when the appropriate hour is \nhere, to reject the amendment because it is simply inconsistent; it \ndoes not do the job; it is less than a halfway effort.\n  Let me also comment relative to remarks that were made by others who \nspoke with regard to gifts to chairmen and CEO's of corporations. I was \na CEO. There are policies within corporations that you designate \nprocedures, and that is entirely different from the function within \nthis body. Those people, through boards of directors and oversight and \nchecks and balances, have to maintain the scrutiny and the appropriate \nresponsibility to the shareholders. We have a responsibility to the \ncitizens of this country, but part of that responsibility is \nconsistency.\n  When we talk about a gift ban, if we are going to be consistent, we \nare going to do away with a gift ban and political contributions \nassociated with transportation and travel. That is what is lacking in \nthis legislation.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to get into this at some length \nand hold the necessary hearings so we do not just end up window \ndressing a situation that many of the American public assume is being \ntaken care of under the gift ban, but still provides us with \ntransportation and lodging for our political events.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Michigan for responding \nto my questions. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I may comment further, briefly--and I \nknow my friend from Colorado seeks recognition; I will not be long--on \nthe points that were made by our friend from Alaska. I just have a \ncouple things to say.\n  First of all, we sure do need political campaign finance reform. I \ncould not agree with the Senator more. One of the glaring omissions \nfrom the Gingrich contract, it seems to me, is that there is no \nreference to campaign finance reform and how money is raised. I sure \nhope we address it. It is a glaring omission from any contract of \nreform.\n  Second, last year during the debate on this bill, the Senator from \nAlaska moved to strike the prohibition on reimbursement for \nrecreational travel \n[[Page S473]] and made the same points that were made here. The Senate \nrejected the deletion of that prohibition by a vote of 58 to 37.\n  Is it inconsistent, then, to permit travel to political events? Some \nthink it is, perhaps; some think it is not. Political events are closer \nto our duties in that they are not recreational; they are different.\n  On the other hand, for those who think there is no distinction, for \nthose who think there is an inconsistency, they had an opportunity to \nstrike travel reimbursement to political events. No Senator, including \nthe Senator from Alaska, offered an amendment to strike travel \nreimbursement to political events.\n  So if there is an inconsistency that people feel here, they surely \nhad an opportunity to offer the amendment to strike that travel \nreimbursement. There was no such amendment offered. I do not know \nwhether it would have been adopted or defeated.\n  I also know that 37 Republicans and a larger majority, I believe, of \nDemocrats, specifically supported this gift ban language in October; 37 \nRepublicans cosponsored a resolution of this gift ban language, and a \nlarge majority of Democrats voted for cloture on the conference report.\n  So we had a situation where if there were an inconsistency perceived, \nany Senator could have moved to strike the travel reimbursement. The \nSenate did vote to prohibit recreational travel, and that is the way it \nappeared before the Senate in the conference report when the majority \nof Senators of both parties indicated support for the language.\n  So I think there is a differentiation, arguably, but there is not. \nAny Senator could have offered to strike the travel reimbursement, and \nno Senator chose to eliminate that alleged inconsistency by amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think my friend will recall, last \nyear I offered an amendment and the amendment was adopted banning all \nlobbyist and PAC contributions to Senators. It was rather interesting \nbecause that clearly cut to the core of the question of PAC \ncontributions.\n  However, when the lobby disclosure gift ban emerged--emerged, Mr. \nPresident, from a Democratic-controlled conference--my PAC and lobbyist \ncontribution ban reform surprisingly had been deleted.\n  I say to my good friend, clearly we had an opportunity last year to \ndelete all PAC contributions. It passed the Senate, but it was not \nsupported in a Democratic-controlled conference.\n  The Senator from Alaska has to conclude one thing: A gift is a gift. \nIf it is a gift associated with a charitable event, it is a gift \nassociated with a charitable event and the merits are the charity. If \nit is for political purposes, it is still a gift. It is a gift if it is \ntravel. It is a gift if it is lodging. And the justification is the \npolitical event and who benefits from the political event.\n  Sure, we are professionals. We are professional politicians, so we \nobviously benefit, as opposed to a worthwhile charity out there. If we \ndid not subtract the transportation and did not subtract the lodging, \nthere would be more money coming back associated with the political \nevent. That is the logic that is used to say what is wrong with the \ncharitable event. They take too much out for travel and lodging.\n  I think we have made the point, Mr. President, and it is one that \nthis proposal lacks consistency and it lacks the reform that is \nrecognized. I know my friend from Michigan and I agree that we need \nsubstantial review of the various political contributions, and that \nwill come. But I rise in the sense of pointing out that, indeed, we \nhave an inconsistency. We had a chance to clear it last year by \naccepting my amendment which was done in this body, but I think many \npeople knew it would die in a Democratic-controlled conference, which \nit did.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Alaska will yield briefly, \nbefore he yields the floor, for a question.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I was one of the conferees last year in that conference, \nand the language which was added here was not adopted by the \nconference.\n  I do not know of any Republican in the conference or Democrat that \nsupported the language being in the final conference report because it \nwould have had the anomalous effect of discriminating against \nincumbents against challengers and is more properly part of campaign \nfinance reform. However, that was not just Democrats in the conference \nthat did not hold out for that language. There were no Republicans as \nwell. And I was wondering whether or not my friend from Alaska was \naware of that.\n  And second, this amendment that is pending is amendable. If the \nSenator from Alaska feels there is some inconsistency here, he is free \nto offer an amendment to the pending amendment to strike the \nreimbursement for political travel the way it is stricken for \nrecreational travel.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to my friend from Michigan, obviously I \nwas not in the conference but one has to conclude that as a consequence \nof the prevailing vote which this body initiated by adopting my \namendment banning all lobbyist and PAC contributions to Senators, one \nwould think that the conferees would have a responsibility to support \nit. Clearly, they chose not to. And one can come to his or her own \nconclusion as to why.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  I think my first contact with this basic issue that we consider \ntonight came in 1983 when I was a member on the House Judiciary \nCommittee. At that point, Congress was in the process of adding new \nstatutory controls over the direction of the private sector. I offered \nan amendment in that committee to apply the same guidelines, \nregulations, and restrictions to Congress that we applied to other \nmembers of this society.\n  That amendment lost on a straight party-line vote. Every Democrat in \nthat subcommittee voted against it. When I attempted to offer it in \nfull committee every Democratic Member voted against it, and I was \nrefused an opportunity to offer the amendment later on in the process.\n  Thus, it is with some surprise that I find that this measure, passed \nthe House unanimously last night. It appears that good ideas sometimes \ngrow.\n  I think part of the reason this bill is going to pass, and the reason \nit passed in the other body, is because the spotlight is on and people \nknow it is not fair to subject them, the working men and women in this \ncountry, to rules that this Congress will not apply to itself. It is a \nmatter of simple fairness.\n  Mr. President, let me confess also to another reason for favoring \nthis measure. The burden we impose on working men and women in this \nNation is atrocious. It is criminal what we do to the men and women of \nthis Nation who work and make the Nation go. The legal liability we \nimpose on them, the paperwork we impose on them, the incredible overlay \nof bureaucracy, red tape and guidance is outrageous. The tragedy is \nthat nearly half the Members of Congress have not had an opportunity to \nwork in the private sector. Many of them do not appreciate the \nburdensome regulations we have put on working men and women nationwide.\n  I truly believe that if Members of Congress have to live under the \nlaws we impose on the rest of the Nation, two things will happen. One, \nwe will be treated fairly and they will be treated more fairly. And \ntwo, we will take a strong look at the kinds of laws we impose on \npeople. This country is overregulated, productivity is damaged. We have \nlaid a burden of redtape, regulation, lawyers, CPA's, and audits on \nthis Nation that strangles our ability to compete in the international \nmarketplace.\n  What we need more than anything else is the men and women of this \nCongress to realize the damage they have done to this Nation and inject \ncommon sense into the kinds of statutory control we impose on our \ncountry.\n  So I am going to support this bill. I am going to do it not only \nbecause of simple fairness, but because I firmly believe that it will \nlead to the end of \n[[Page S474]] overregulation imposed on the citizens of our country.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of amendments, many of them \nsincerely offered and well founded, that should be considered. However, \nthe leadership has promised that they will provide another vehicle to \nconsider all of these amendments.\n  Indeed, there are many additions to this bill that I would like to \nsee. I will support the effort to bring these additional measures to \nthe floor.\n  I wish to say to the Senator from Michigan I think he has some good \nideas. I have supported the gift ban in the past, and I intend to in \nthe future. But I wish to see this bill enacted. I am not going to \nsupport amendments to this bill at this time. I am going to trust the \nleadership's commitment to bring these measures to the floor and \nprovide a full vote.\n  My hope is that we will debate the issues Members feel strongly \nabout; that we will proceed to pass this bill and enact it, and that we \nwill get to the additional task of other measures as quickly as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I shall be brief. I begin by associating myself with \nthe passion of the distinguished Senator from Colorado, as he \narticulates a very strong position against the overregulation by the \nFederal Government which is well known across the length and breadth of \nthis land. And I support the efforts which have been brought by the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] and the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] on S. 2 to provide \naccountability by the Congress, by making Members of the Senate and \nMembers of the House of Representatives subject to the same laws which \ngovern every other citizen.\n  As a matter of basic fairness, Mr. President, there is no reason why \na Senator or Member of the House should not be subject to every rule of \nlaw which governs every other American.\n  Basic fairness should mean that every rule of law applies equally to \nMembers of the Senate and House as they do to every other American. And \nif that were the case, there would be less regulation in our country.\n  With respect to the amendment which is now pending, offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, to have a gift ban, I believe that \nthere is great merit in that proposal and in fact supported the gift \nban when it was before the Senate during the 103d or last session of \nCongress. There are a great many amendments which might be offered to \nthe pending legislation; also talk about campaign finance reform which \nin a sense is related to the subject before the Senate at the present \ntime.\n  I believe that it is very important that we move forward with the \nCongressional Accountability Act, which is the pending legislation, \nwithout encumbering it with other amendments which will slow its \nprogress.\n  The reality, Mr. President, which may not be known by many watching \non C-SPAN 2 is that when an amendment is tabled or rejected on the \npending legislation, it does not mean that those who vote in favor of \ntabling the amendment disagree with the substance of it, if it were \npresent as a freestanding bill, as it was during the last Congress and, \nas I said before, a measure which I supported. There is an effort known \nwell through the length and breadth of the land at the present time for \nthe newly elected 104th Congress, controlled by the Republicans, to get \nsome things done and done promptly. And the House of Representatives is \nmoving on similar legislation on congressional accountability, and it \nis the effort now of the Republican-controlled Senate to move ahead \nwith this bill without having amendments pending which will slow the \nprogress.\n  Our distinguished majority leader has already given assurances that \nthis issue will be revisited and the distinguished Senator from Maine, \nSenator Cohen, has commented about bringing the matter up again with \nSenator Levin of Michigan. So this matter will again be before the \nSenate and we can act to do what is necessary to ban lobbyists' gifts. \nBut at the present time I think our focus ought to be on congressional \naccountability, which I support, and that is why I will back the \nforthcoming motion by the distinguished majority leader to table the \npending amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I think we have had considerable debate on \nthis issue and I do not, certainly, want to cut off anybody on the \nother side. But we have a problem that some of us are going to attend a \ndinner tonight in honor of the two leaders. Some may not be going \nthere. But I would like to move to table the pending amendment and have \nthe vote begin at 7:15, if that would accommodate the minority leader \nand the Senator from Montana. Then I need just about 1 minute.\n  Would that be enough?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, I know \nSenator Baucus has indicated to me that he needed somewhere around 6 or \n7 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Six or seven minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I only need a couple minutes, so I think that would work \nout very well.\n  Mr. DOLE. So could we agree, get unanimous consent there be a motion \nto table at 7:15?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That will be agreeable to this Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. If I could just have 2 minutes of that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I first want to applaud Senators Levin \nand Wellstone for offering this excellent amendment. It is very similar \nto the provisions in S. 10, the Comprehensive Congressional Reform Act \nwhich I introduced yesterday, and which a number of our colleagues have \ncosponsored. I believe it is essential that the amendment be included \nin the final legislation.\n  This debate really picks up where we left off last year when \nRepublicans blocked consideration of the legislation which was \ndeveloped through the tireless efforts of the, at that time, chairman \nand others. I hope my Republican colleagues will now work with us to \nenact this amendment.\n  Those of us who want real reform will not stop at congressional \ncoverage. We have to restore public confidence in Government, and our \nreform efforts must go further. The Levin-Wellstone amendment does just \nthat. Lobby reform is central to true congressional reform. Without it \nwe will never end the undue influences of special interests. But \nwithout a ban on special interest gifts to Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs, congressional reform is reform in name only. Senators \nLevin and Wellstone and many others have worked hard on lobbying and \ngift reform and, in so doing, have demonstrated their commitment to \ntrue reform, to the end of business as usual.\n  So again, Mr. President, passing the bill that should have been \npassed last fall, and would have been passed if it had not been for the \nRepublican move to block it, is a very good start today. But it will be \na hollow, cynical start if it turns out that those who blocked that \nlegislation did so only to reintroduce it this year, take the credit, \nand block other essential reforms. Lobby reform and a ban on gifts are \nessential to a genuine reform effort. Let us begin the year by \nfinishing our old business and moving forward from here. Doing so will \nprovide an even stronger foundation upon which to rebuild trust in this \ninstitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Congressional \nCompliance Act. It is time for Congress to act by example instead of by \nexemption. This act will apply 12 basic American labor laws to \nCongress. They include the civil rights laws, minimum wage, the \nOccupational Health and Safety Act, the Family Leave Act, and more.\n  If these and other acts covered by the Congressional Compliance Act \nare passed, the Federal Government's regulations on the people will \nthen be imposed also on the Congress. In these laws the Federal \nGovernment imposes \n[[Page S475]] a good bit of regulation and paperwork on private \nbusinesses. All that is in pursuit of good, important goals.\n  These laws have done a lot of good. Undoubtedly some can be improved. \nBut on the whole they make sure American workplaces are decent places, \nand there is no excuse for not asking the same of the Congress.\n  There is some symbolic importance to this. It shows that, as the \nFounding Fathers who wrote our Constitution intended, today's \nRepresentatives of the people are truly Representatives--that is, not a \nspecial privileged class.\n  The act will also have concrete beneficial effects. First, applying \nbasic labor laws to Congress will put a brake on overregulation and \noverlegislation. Laws like minimum wage, OSHA, and so on are important. \nBusinesses should have some basic standards. And it is no accident that \nAmerica has a lower rate of deaths and injury on the job than any other \nindustrial nation. It is because OSHA is a tough, effective law. It can \nno doubt be improved, but we do need a tough, effective OSHA law.\n  That is one side of the coin. On the other side is that well-meaning \npeople, in pursuit of honorable goals, are sometimes tempted to go too \nfar. They can lose sight of the basic American principle that in the \nvast majority of occasions, ordinary people do not need a lot of rules \nand regulations to do the right thing. So it is easy for people who \nwrite laws to move on from setting basic standards to requiring \npaperwork that adds costs, squeezes jobs, and does little good. With \nthis law in place, each Member of Congress will understand the burden a \nsmall business owner faces because that Member will live under \nprecisely the same burden. He or she will fill out the same forms, type \nthe same reports, and adjust his or her payroll in the same way. If you \nlive by the regulations you write, you probably will not go too far.\n  Second, the laws themselves will do some good. Legal guarantees of \nsafe workplaces, minimum wage, guaranteed family leave, and protection \nfor civil rights in congressional offices are important. They were \npassed to deal with the small minority of abusive employers. And no \ndoubt, in a Congress of 535 Members and dozens of support offices, \nthere are some offices where civil rights laws or workplace safety \nstandards are not being met. This law will help stop that.\n  Finally, this bill goes a long way toward making Congress a more \nresponsive body. I believe it needs to do more; to make it a \nresponsible body. I thus intend to support an amendment Senator McCain \nwill offer in February that makes sure when Members of Congress are \nfound guilty of violating any of these laws, that taxpayers are not hit \nwith the fine for it.\n  Again, this reform is long overdue. I cosponsored it in the last \nCongress. I applaud Senators Lieberman and Grassley for pushing the \nissue tirelessly throughout the Congress. And finally, today, we will \nsee this body pass it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if no one else wishes to speak and if the \nmajority leader does not need the full 5 minutes, I will take a minute \nor two before his motion.\n  Mr. DOLE. I just need 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the majority leader. I will just use 2 minutes.\n  I want to again urge our colleagues to defeat the motion to table. \nThis is precisely the same gift rule which the vast majority of \nDemocrats and 37 Republicans said they supported last October. There is \nno change in it. It would seem to me that we cannot duck this issue any \nlonger by just simply saying let us delay it, let us delay it.\n  If we are serious about reform and the way we run this place, we have \nto finally, after years of talk, end this scene where free travel, free \ntickets, free meals from lobbyists and others with interest in \nlegislation, come to Members of this Congress.\n  It is unseemly. It creates the exact wrong appearance. The American \npublic wants to end it. They are right. This is the time to end it with \nrules that were supported by the vast majority of Senators in October, \nincluding the majority of the Republicans and Democrats. I hope that \nthe tabling motion will be defeated.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kansas [Mr. Dole].\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the point I want to make was made before \nlast night. After 25 minutes of debate the House passed this measure by \na vote of 429 to zero. If we want to take 2 days, or 3 days I guess we \ncan. But I want to pass the coverage proposal as advanced by the \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from Connecticut. It is bipartisan. \nIt seems to me that the sooner we can do that the sooner we can move on \nto other legislation.\n  I indicated to my Republican colleagues earlier today that we intend \nto not only take this matter up but lobby reform, and other matters \nthat we believe should be addressed which were addressed last year.\n  I certainly commend the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, for his \nleadership. But we believe there are some changes that can be made even \nin the gift ban. This amendment would not be effective in any event \nuntil the end of May 1995.\n  It would be my hope that by that time we will have even a better \npackage. I hope that we can table this amendment and move to any other \namendments which my colleagues may offer. But we are going to finish \nthis bill either tonight or tomorrow or on Monday unless there is an \nagreement, a reasonable agreement. I should not say that we will finish \nit. I know that I have been in the Senate longer than that. We will try \nto finish the bill by tomorrow or Monday. I know Senators can prevent \nthat from happening.\n  So I urge my colleagues, including some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who had misgivings about lobbying reform and the gift \nban late last year, to join me in tabling this motion so we can move \nahead and pass this bill without amendment.\n  I think there is a good potential that the House may take our bill \nbecause it is a bit stronger and pass the Senate bill unless we clutter \nit up with amendments that require us to spend a considerable time in \nconference.\n  If anybody else wishes 2 minutes on either side, I would be happy to \nyield. If not, is there any objection to starting the vote?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have notified on the hotline that it \nwould be at 7:15. I would appreciate it if the majority leader would \nnot and to save us a couple of minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I would be happy to add 2 minutes at the end.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator has that prerogative. He is the leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am going to do it habitually, but I think some may want \nto vote right now and leave. I have already made the motion to table \nthe underlying amendment, the Levin amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to come to the floor today \nas the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee. Governmental \nAffairs has jurisdiction over this legislation. Our effort to bring \nthis matter to the Senate immediately, is not following the usual \nprocedure of committee referral. But this issue is not new. S. 2 is a \nmodified version of H.R. 4822 as reported by the committee at the end \nof last session. For a detailed explanation of that bill and for \nfurther legislative history, I would refer Members to our committee \nreport No. 103-397. To outline briefly, the committee did hold a \nhearing on June 29, 1994, and heard testimony from a variety of \nwitnesses, including legal and constitutional scholars, along with our \nown Senate Legal Counsel, Michael Davidson. On September 20, 1994, the \ncommittee voted to report an amendment in the nature of a substitute to \nH.R. 4822, which had passed the House of Representatives on August 10.\n  S. 2 was developed over the past several weeks in a remarkably \ncooperative effort of a bi-partisan working group comprised of Members \nand staff from \n[[Page S476]] both the Senate and the House of Representatives. The \nproduct we have before us today reflects the positive results that can \nbe achieved when we are willing to work together.\n  I want to commend the chief sponsors and floor managers, Senators \nGrassley and Lieberman, for their leadership and perseverance on the \nissue. Without them, as well as the leadership of the former chairman \nand current ranking member of the committee, Senator Glenn, we wouldn't \nbe here debating this issue today. I am pleased to join with them in \nthis effort to enact S. 2 as the first order of business in this 104th \nCongress.\n  I believe the bill before us demonstrates that congressional \ncompliance can be achieved without compromising the doctrine of \nseparation of powers. Great care has been taken to maintain the \nintegrity of the Congress as a separate branch of Government. However, \nthere is no way to guarantee that the potential may exist for conflict \nbetween the legislative and judicial branches concerning enforcement of \nsubpoena powers.\n  Another major challenge was to create a bicameral Office of \nCompliance, yet at the same time retain the independence of the Senate \nand House of Representatives to establish their respective Rules of \nProcedure without interference from the other body. Again, I believe \nthis issue has been resolved.\n  Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson wrote that ``the Framers of our \nConstitution . . . (took) care to provide that the laws should bind \nequally on all, and especially that those who make them shall not \nexempt themselves from their operation.'' In light of Mr. Jefferson's \nobservation, one might wonder why Congress created an ever-growing, \ncomplex set of employment and labor laws for the private sector that it \nhas failed for many years to apply equally to themselves. While we are \nhere today to correct that disparity, I do want to point out that \nCongress has made significant progress over the past few years in \nextending employment laws to congressional employees--most notably the \nSenate action in 1991 extending basic civil rights protections to \nSenate employees and creating the Senate Office of Fair Employment \nPractices.\n  S. 2 will go a step further in bringing together the patchwork of \nlaws that have applied in the past and make clear how these laws apply \nand provides for enhanced enforcement of those laws by establishing a \nmore independent and credible process for remedial action.\n  S. 2 is an extremely important measure for another reason. Beyond its \napplication of laws to the Congress. It is important because of the \nmessage it sends to the American public. It would be naive not to \nrecognize that this legislation is driven in large part by pressure \nfrom the public. This is an issue of fundamental fairness to them. We \nhave all heard the references to the ``Imperial Congress.'' For far too \nlong Congress has held an image of isolation, privilege and \nsuperiority. That is an image that must change, so that the governed \nonce again have confidence and respect in those that govern. Enacting \nS. 2 is a critical step moving us in that direction.\n  Enactment of this legislation will teach Congress valuable lessons \nabout living with the laws it passes. Many of the laws that Congress \nimposes on citizens are complex and burdensome. It's only fair to make \nCongress deal with the same paperwork and bureaucracy that the average \ncitizen does. That's certainly a complaint I hear from many of my \nconstituents. Compliance is not simply a matter of probity; it is also \na matter of paperwork, bureaucracy, and expense.\n  While I have long been a supporter of applying private sector laws to \nCongress, I recognize that some members may be concerned that these \nlaws may be misapplied or abused for political, rather than legitimate, \npurposes. I share this concern, but I hope that rule 11 of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure will fairly and adequately address this \nconcern. Rule 11 has been recently strengthened to specifically provide \nfor sanctions when misrepresentations are made to the court for an \nimproper purpose. Significantly, the rule is designed to cause \nlitigants to stop and think before initially making legal or factual \ncontentions and is designed to deter misconduct. I am hopeful that rule \n11 in conjunction with the counseling and mediation process developed \nby the Office of Compliance will preclude abuses of the process.\n  Let me reiterate, I do believe this is a very important issue and \nthat we will be sending the right message to the American people by \nmoving this bill quickly, without extraneous amendments.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Grassley for managing this bill on our \nside and also want to welcome him as a new member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am very pleased to join Senator \nGrassley, Senator Lieberman and my colleagues in the introduction of \nthe Congressional Accountability Act of 1994. This legislation applies \n10 labor and employment laws to Congress: First, the Fair Labor \nStandards Act of 1938, second, the Federal Labor-Management Relations \nAct 1978, third, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, fourth \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964, fifth, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967, sixth, the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, seventh, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, eight, \nEmployee Polygraph Protection Act; ninth, Work Adjustment and \nRetraining Notification Act and tenth, Veterans Reemployment Act.\n  James Madison is often quoted in relation to the issue of \ncongressional coverage. He said, ``Congress can make no law which will \nnot have its full operation on themselves and their friends, as on the \ngreat mass of society.'' But I am concerned that the meaning of his \nwords is lost due to their frequency of use in this debate.\n  What was Madison getting at, and what was so important for him to \nincorporate this phrase into the Federalist Papers? I believe he had a \nprofound sense of public accountability and integrity in mind when he \npenned those words. He also remembered the degenerating effect of \naristocracy upon the people.\n  Today, we are in a much different time period, but are never-the-less \nconfronting the same issues as Madison and our founding fathers. To \nbolster the integrity of this institution, now is the time for the \nadoption of congressional coverage legislation in keeping with our \nAmerican tradition. Congress has been exempting itself from employment \nand labor laws since 1935. I suspect this was done in a sincere effort \nto maintain a separation of powers. It was also done in a time when \nCongress was a far simpler organization, not the enormous bureaucracy \nwe have today. Because Congress has changed, so must the laws governing \nit. Until we are prepared to live under the laws, Congress should not \nbe imposing them on anybody else.\n  If business or private individuals run afoul of any labor, employment \nand health and safety laws, they face bureaucratic headaches and \npossible Federal court litigation. Congress has exempted itself from \nthese laws completely or has limited redress with no right to full \njudicial appeal.\n  During consideration of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, I offered an \namendment which would have made Congress and its instrumentalities \nsubject to all regulations and remedies contained in many of the \nemployment, discrimination, and health and safety laws enacted since \nthe 1930's. Later, I introduced the amendment as a free-standing bill, \nthe Congressional and Presidential Accountability Act both the 103d and \n104th Congresses.\n  Adopted in lieu of my amendment was a provision authored by the \nMajority Leader George Mitchell and Senator Grassley which provides \nprocedures to give Senate employees protection under several civil \nrights laws and limited judicial review. Under the adopted amendment, \nthe Senate was permitted to establish an internal enforcement mechanism \nunder civil rights laws. This was a good beginning.\n  Since my efforts on the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the efforts of \nthose before me on this issue including Senator Grassley, the joint \ncommittee to reorganize Congress and the bipartisan task force on \nSenate coverage were established and further analyzed and researched \nthe issue.\n  The bipartisan task force on Senate coverage report was sent to the \nmajority and Republican leader on November \n[[Page S477]] 19, 1993. Although the Senate task force report served an \nimportant function in analyzing the issue of congressional coverage, as \nmembers of the task force Senator Grassley and I believed its \nconclusions would only perpetuate the current lack of accountability to \nthe laws of the land by Congress.\n  Following the task force conclusions, I was pleased to join Senator \nGrassley and Senator Lieberman in the introduction of the Congressional \nAccountability Act during the 103d Congress. I believe this legislation \nmet the principles set forth by James Madison.\n  During the 103d Congress, the House overwhelmingly approved 427 to 4, \nsimilar legislation introduced by Congressman Shays and Congressman \nSwett. Following the House action the Democratic leadership in the \nSenate blocked any action and the 103d Congress ended without covering \nCongress under the laws of the land.\n  The legislation before us today will bring Congress under the \ncoverage of labor, civil rights and health and safety laws from which \nit has been exempt. I am proud to say that I believe this Congress will \nfinally do the right thing and ensure that Congress lives under the \nlaws it imposes on other and perhaps the consequence will be to ensure \nthat Congress will now understand how the laws it passes actually work.\n  Our legislation establishes an independent Office of Congressional \nCompliance to administer and enforce these laws. It also allows a \ncongressional employee the right to sue in Federal court under those \nlaws which allow a similarly situated private sector employee the right \nto sue. This right is extended to collective bargaining and \noccupational safety and health claims.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to end the \npractice of Congress living above the law and help to regain the trust \nand confidence of the public.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my firm support for \ncongressional coverage legislation. This bill represents a most \nfundamental ingredient in the recipe to reform this institution. By \nexempting itself from the laws it passes, Congress is truly losing \ntouch with the practical consequences of those laws. And today, we have \na Congress in Wonderland passing legislation that does not reflect true \nworkplace realities.\n  Over the years we have heard some very artful explanations as to why \nCongress continues to exempt itself from the very laws it passes. We \nhave heard that the constitution prevents executive branch enforcement \nof employment laws on Congress. We have heard that the constitution's \n``Speech or Debate'' clause protecting Members of Congress from legal \nchallenges against them includes their actions as employers. And we \nhave also heard how being a Member of Congress embodies certain highly \nunique circumstances not faced by other employers. I must say, not one \nof these explanations warrants these continued exemptions.\n  One of the biggest reason why Congress so freely exempts itself is \nbecause it is not governed by statute--rather we live by our own rules. \nWe set rules which allow us to go about our merry way with little fear \nthat if we do happen to cross the line from time to time, it doesn't \nreally matter because there is no practical enforcement mechanism.\n  The current system allows us to change the rules at any time--and for \nany reason. For example, when the Civil Rights Act of 1991 was signed \ninto law, Senators were held personally liable for any unlawful \ndiscrimination. But lo and behold, this provision was quietly dropped \nfrom the 1993 legislative branch appropriations bill.\n  Another example involves the minimum wage law. Last time we increased \nthe minimum wage to $4.25 an hour, Congress was covered. But because \nthe law was so burdensome, the U.S. Congress effectively exempted \nitself from the bill's major provisions a short time later. Just \nimagine if we allowed private employers to behave like this. Imagine an \nemployer tailoring regulations to suit his convenience, and changing \nthem whenever he chooses. Congress would cast a most disapproving eye \nupon that. So would the public.\n  Mr. President, it is no wonder why business organizations have made \ncongressional accountability their top legislative priority. If \nCongress is forced to live with the laws it passes, it may act with \nconsiderably more prudence.\n  Congressional accountability could well become a practical tool in \nour legislative work. True congressional coverage would provide each of \nus with immediate impact as to the successes, failures and \nunanticipated implications of our programs. Exemptions, on the other \nhand, insulate us from the real impact of the laws we pass. We need to \nknow how our laws feel to those out there in the real world where the \nrubber hits the road.\n  Congressional accountability is an issue of necessity. New employment \nlaws are increasingly rushed through congress on unrelated bills, with \nno opportunity for public hearings or debate. It is imperative that we \nput the brakes on the accelerating speed of carelessly enacted \nemployment requirements.\n  Congressional accountability is also about simple fairness. We do \nindeed deal with a lot of very complicated issues here in the U.S. \nSenate, but this issue is not really very complicated at all. The rest \nof American voters are out there paying taxes, complying with Federal \nregulation after Federal regulation, and playing by the rules. On the \nother hand, there is the perception that we continue to sit here in our \nivory towers issuing our decrees, yet, telling the American public to \n``Do as we say, not as we do.'' It is only fair that our own \ncongressional employees should be completely covered by employment \nlaws.\n  I urge the Senate to pass the Congressional Accountability Act. To \npass it cleanly, kept free of unnecessary and nongermane amendments. I \nthank the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Kansas to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Michigan.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 4\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the personal use of accrued frequent flyer miles \n               by Members and employees of the Congress)\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  I will not debate this amendment, but I am going to ask the clerk to \nread the entire amendment. I think it explains it totally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 4.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.--.USE OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES.\n\n       (a) Limitation of the Use of Travel Awards.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or any rule, \n     regulation, or other authority, any travel award that accrues \n     by reason of official travel of a Member, officer, or \n     employee of the Senate or House of Representatives shall be \n     considered the property of the Government and may not be \n     converted to personal use.\n       (b) Regulations.--The Committee on House Oversight of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate shall have authority to \n     prescribe regulations to carry out this section.\n       (c) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``travel award'' means any frequent flyer, \n     free, or discounted travel, or other travel benefit, whether \n     awarded by coupon, membership, or otherwise; and\n       (2) the term ``official travel'' means travel engaged in \n     the course of official business of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the clerk.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk relates to the \nuse of frequent flier bonuses usually awarded by airlines. Both the \nSenate travel regulations and those applicable to executive branch \ntravel require that any such benefits paid by an airline that are based \non travel that was paid by taxpayer funds must be used for official \npurposes.\n  Senate travel regulations on this subject are as follows:\n\n       Discount coupons, frequent flyer mileage, or other evidence \n     of reduced fares, obtained on official travel, shall be \n     turned in to the office for which the travel was performed so \n     that they may be utilized for future official travel. This \n     regulation is predicated upon the general government policy \n     that all promotional materials such as bonus flights, \n     reduced-fare coupons, cash, merchandise, gifts, credits \n     toward future free or reduced costs of services or goods, \n     earned as a result of trips paid by appropriated funds are \n     the property of the government and may not be retained by the \n     traveler for personal use.\n\n  This amendment will require that all such benefits be used for \nofficial travel by the office that pays for the original travel. In \nthis way, the Government rather than the individual traveler will \nreceive the benefit.\n  The correctness of this policy is so obvious that I find it strange \nthat an amendment, such as the one I now offer, should have to be \nconsidered. I can find no justification for a public official or \nelected Member of Congress to consider and use such a bonus for \npersonal purposes. The value of any such bonus awarded to a traveler is \nincluded in the price of the ticket. Since the taxpayers have paid for \nthat benefit when the travel is charged to the Government, it is only \nright that the taxpayer receive such a benefit.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the decision by the House Republican \nConference to abolish legislative service organizations brings to an \nend the proud and productive history of the Arms Control and Foreign \nPolicy Caucus.\n  With regret that the caucus will not be able to play a role at this \ncritical time of debate over the role of U.S. foreign policy in the \npost-cold-war world, the caucus will cost its doors in 1995. We are \npursuing the possibility of establishing a new private entity to \nperform certain caucus roles, but at this time we plan to transfer \ncaucus papers to the Legislative Archives Center of the National \nArchives. We also plan to transfer any unobligated caucus funds to the \nTreasury.\n  For 30 years this bipartisan caucus--formerly named Members of \nCongress for Peace through Law--has played a constructive role on \nissues of war and peace in our time: in the 1960's it opposed the war \nin Vietnam; in the 1970's and 1980's it championed efforts for nuclear \narms control; in the 1980's it built a powerful congressional coalition \nseeking negotiated solutions to the wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua; \nand in the 1990's it sought to focus on the post-cold war problems of \nweapons proliferation and the need for a strengthened United Nations. \nThroughout, it has also worked to promote human rights and improve the \neconomic situation of peoples in the developing world.\n  Its record in providing legislative services is also a proud one: \nduring the 103d Congress alone, the caucus issued 150 legislative \nalerts and reports, over 30 special issue reports and fact sheets, and \n3 in-depth comprehensive policy reports. It also hosted 10 meetings for \nMembers or staff with outside experts. Claims by LSO opponents that \nLSO's are simply special interest groups with little legislative \nfunction are, certainly in this case, patently untrue.\n  Finally, throughout its history, the Arms Control and Foreign Policy \nCaucus has upheld the strictest standards of financial accountability \nand has fully complied with LSO regulations and reporting.\n  On behalf of the 125 caucus members, I express our hope that in some \nway, even without a support staff to coordinate our efforts, will be \nable to continue the distinguished tradition of acting in a bipartisan \nand bicameral manner to pursue the goal of a more peaceful world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S478-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S478-S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be \nadded as a cosponsor of the Congressional Accountability Act. I have \ncosponsored this legislation during the past several years because of \nmy strong belief that what is fair is fair and what is right is right--\nwhether it is in the halls of Congress or the factories, shops and \noffices throughout America.\n  Traditionally, Congress has exempted itself from fair labor \npractices, occupational safety and health, age discrimination and many \nother laws with which \n[[Page S479]] the private sector as well as other branches of \ngovernment must comply. This legislation will require Congress to \ncomply with those laws.\n  I am glad to see us take up this legislation and act swiftly on it. \nIt is long overdue. The U.S. Senate should practice what we preach. We \nshould go by the same rules we establish for everyone else.\n  The critical need for this legislation was made clear to me over the \nlast few years by the appalling stories I heard from employees of one \nof the instrumentalities of the Congress, the Architect of the Capitol. \nThe Architect oversees more than 2,000 employees in the skilled trades \nas well as occupations such as restaurant worker, janitor, and laundry \nworker.\n  Historically, there was no oversight, no fair and independent appeals \nmechanism, and no clear written management procedures governing the \nworking conditions for these employees. And what happened? A plantation \nmentality emerged, in which employees were discriminated against, \nharassed, and denied opportunities for promotion and advancement. When \nthese employees wanted to complain, they felt they had nowhere to go--\nso they came to me.\n  I was proud to take up their cause and proud that last year, the \nCongress enacted the Architect of the Capitol Human Resources Act, \nfinally providing clear guidelines for modern management practices. I \nam proud to have been among the first Members of Congress to win real \ncongressional reform with the passage of this legislation.\n  Now it is time to apply similar fair and modern management practices \nto the rest of the congressional work force: the House and Senate \nSergeants at Arms, the Capitol Police, and our own staffs in Senators' \nand Representatives' offices and on the committees. That's why I'm \nhappy to lend my name to this needed legislation.\n  I thank my colleagues and I yield the floor.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S478-4", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Mr. President, it is very hard to lose an old friend. \nFor me and my family and for many of us in the Senate, Shirley Felix \nwas a friend. For years, whenever we were in the Senators dining room, \nwe stopped to talk to her. Her death, on December 13, was a tremendous \nloss, not just to her family but also to those who served with her in \nthe offices of the Architect of the Capitol and those of us on whose \nbehalf she worked diligently and tirelessly for many years.\n  Shirley was born on November 8, 1933, in Arlington, VA, the daughter \nof Dr. Rebecca Plumer and the Elder Irving L. Plummer, Sr. She attended \npublic schools in Washington and completed her education in New York \nCity where she met and married James Felix, Jr. They later moved to \nWashington, and became the parents of six fine sons.\n  Shirley started working for the Architect of the Capitol in 1967. Her \nculinary and management skills led to her promotion to the position of \nbanquet manager for the U.S. Senate. It was a position she filled \ncompetently, professionally and with extraordinary cheerfulness.\n  Shirley had a good memory and a warm heart. In the big, faceless \ninstitution that the Congress has become, with staff changing daily, \nShirley remembered who you were, not just Senators but staff as well. \nShe remembered your children's names, and always asked about them. She \nknew what you liked, and literally worked overtime to see that you got \nit. And she worked with a genuine smile on her face, for the pleasure \nof doing a job well, and knowing that her efforts were appreciated.\n  Shirley was a perfectionist. She took great pride in her work, and it \nshowed. When she prepared a lunch or dinner, it not only tasted great, \nit looked beautiful. She handled crises like a diplomat, never upset \nabout changes in the guest list or the menu. Nothing was ever too much \ntrouble, nothing ever took too much time. Even as her health failed, \nher spirit never faltered. To the end, she was a loving, giving person \nwho went out of her way to make others feel good.

A bill to authorize an entrance fee surcharge at the Grand \nCanyon National Park, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            the grand canyon public/private partnership act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation \nto help finance desperately needed improvements at our Nation's premier \nnational park--our great pride and joy--the Grand Canyon.\n  The measure would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nestablish a special public-private partnership account, under which \nentrance fee revenues would be matched with private donations to help \nfund vital projects called for in the park's general management plan.\n  This legislation will provide additional resources for the Grand \nCanyon at a time when park needs far outstrip the ability of the \nTreasury to fund them. The measure enjoys the support of two important \norganizations dedicated to protecting the interests of the Grand \nCanyon: The Grand Canyon Trust; and, the Grand Canyon Natural History \nAssociation.\n  We in Arizona are proud to be home to the crown jewel of our National \nPark System. We take immense pride in the park and appreciate the \nawesome responsibility with which our country has been vested as \nstewards of this world class resource. We also understand that we have \nmuch work to do in order to meet those responsibilities.\n  Resources are desperately needed to repair the park's aging \ninfrastructure. Compare that need to the canyon's park budget this year \nwhich is only $13 million--a gap as wide and formidable as the Grand \nCanyon itself.\n  The need is enormous and it is growing. Last year, 5 million people \nvisited the Grand Canyon--a number that will continue to grow at a \nrapid pace. The ever increasing demand will place even more stress on \nthe park's aging and needy infrastructure.\n  To address future needs, the National Park Service has been working \ndiligently on the park's general management plan. The plan will guide \nmanagement prerogatives into the next century. The draft plan which was \nreleased last year, identifies projects and programs which will help us \nto cope with the increased visitation, enhance visitor experience and \nprotect the canyon's valuable resources for this and future \ngenerations.\n  While the plan has not been completed, preliminary reports estimate \nthat it will cost nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to fully fund. \nProviding the necessary resources is a staggering challenge. The \nproposal I am presenting here today is one way to help us meet this \nenormous need.\n  As I said, the bill would authorize the Secretary to use fee revenues \nto leverage private contributions to help finance park projects.\n  In order to fund the Federal share of such partnerships, the \nSecretary would be authorized to add a surcharge of up to $2 on the \ncurrent $10 per vehicle park entrance fee.\n  Mr. President, no one, least of all this Senator, likes the idea of \nhigher park entrance fees. But, visitors understand that park services \nand infrastructure cost money and they are willing to support the park \nwith their fees as long as they know the revenue will be used for that \npurpose.\n  Under current procedures, entrance fees are collected at the park, \nreturned to the General Treasury and appropriated by Congress in many \ninstances for purposes other than the needs at the Grand Canyon.\n  The revenues raised under the measure I'm proposing would remain in a \nspecial account at the park to be used only in concert with private \ndonations for vital park needs. Such public-private partnerships have \nample and successful precedent in other areas of public administration, \nand are an excellent means of stretching our resources. I believe they \ncould be a useful tool at the Grand Canyon and perhaps other national \nparks as well.\n  Again, no one likes the idea of any increase in park fees. But, \nironically, we need only to look to Disney Land for a reality check. \nToday, visitors to Disney Land pay $35 a piece to see Mickey Mouse. By \ncomparison, Grand Canyon visitors pay a relatively modest $10 per \ncarload to view what John Wesley Powell aptly described as the most \nsublime spectacle on Earth. We all understand and accept the fact that \nkeeping that spectacle sublime and providing for its enjoyment by the \nmillions who visit costs money. An added surcharge to leverage private \ndollars would seem to be a justified and efficient means of making ends \nmeet, and it deserves our thoughtful consideration.\n  We estimate that the surcharge would generate an additional $2 \nmillion a year. Once leveraged with money from the private sector the \nfund would make a significant contribution to park improvements and \nmaintenance of infrastructure such as upgrading the park's \ntransportation system to relieve overcrowding; maintaining trails; and \nimproving the water system and housing, just to name a very few.\n  Mr. President, the creation of a special partnership account raises \nmany questions. I, like others, want to make absolutely certain that \nprivate contributions to the park are not used in any way that would \ncompromise park interests or values. This measure seeks to address that \nissue because management of the fund must be dictated solely by the \nneeds of the park and the ethic of stewardship.\n  The measure calls on the Secretary of the Interior to establish \nregulations, with full public comment and participation, to guide how \nthe fund will be managed, how private donations will be solicited, for \nwhat purposes they will be used and how the partnerships will be \nstructured and managed.\n  In addition, the bill specifically requires that any project funded \nunder the partnership must be consistent with the statutes, \nregulations, and rules governing the park, and that it is specifically \napproved and prioritized within the general management plan. These \nplans are developed with public participation and are subject to all \nthe applicable environmental laws. Ensuring that partnership funds are \nused only for purposes authorized by the relevant management plan will \nensure that only necessary and appropriate projects are undertaken.\n  [[Page S482]] Many businesses and individuals want to contribute to \nthe protection of Grand Canyon National Park because they realize that \nit is a national treasure and that it needs and deserves our \nassistance. Nevertheless, we must take steps to ensure that these \ndonations are not offered with strings attached that would place \ncommercial interests ahead of park needs and values.\n  Mr. President, Grand Canyon is at a critical point. Demand for park \nresources is increasing, as is the cost of maintenance. Given the \ncurrent budget constraints the administration and Congress are not \nlikely to provide the further increases necessary to adequately meet \nthe need.\n  We must look for innovative ways to fully fund the preservation and \nenhancement of our Nation's park system. I believe the method I'm \nproposing is a viable option that should be fully examined and \nconsidered. Secretary Babbitt has indicated that facilitating a public/\nprivate partnership at Grand Canyon is one of the Interior Department's \nhighest priorities.\n  Mr. President, last year we celebrated the 75th anniversary of Grand \nCanyon National Park. It is most appropriate that we recommit ourselves \nto the charge of Theodore Roosevelt ``to keep the canyon for our \nchildren and our children's children, and for all who come after us, as \none of the great sights which every American if he can travel at all \nshould see.'' Let's work to meet the needs at the Grand Canyon with \nthat purpose firmly in mind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Grand Canyon \nTrust and the Grand Canyon Natural History Association along with \neditorials and news articles regarding this measure be entered into the \nRecord. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grand Canyon Public/Private \n     Partnership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the existing \n     infrastructure of Grand Canyon National Park is not adequate \n     to serve the purposes for which the Park was established;\n       (2) improving the infrastructure of the Park would enhance \n     the natural and cultural resources of the Park and the \n     quality of the experiences of visitors to the Park;\n       (3) through the development of a general management plan, \n     the Director of the National Park Service has identified \n     reasonable measures that are necessary to improve the \n     infrastructure and related services of the Park, including \n     making improvements to transportation facilities and visitor \n     services, and reusing historic structures appropriately; and\n       (4) in order for the Director to implement the general \n     management plan referred to in paragraph (3) at the Park, it \n     is necessary for the Director to be authorized to--\n       (A) enter into agreements with non-Federal entities to \n     share the costs of the improvements; and\n       (B) assess and collect a special surcharge in addition to \n     the entrance fees otherwise collected by the National Park \n     Service.\n\n     SEC. 3.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am very happy to be able to write \n     this letter of complete and enthusiastic support for your \n     bill designed to authorize an entrance fee surcharge at the \n     Grand Canyon National Park, for the purpose of assuring a \n     Federal matching pool of funds for necessary capital projects \n     at the Park. We have previously discussed the value of such a \n     tool to be used to foster public/private partnerships to \n     accomplish the overdue rebuilding of infrastructure to \n     support the crush of visitors. We further believe that the \n     choice of Grand Canyon as the test case for such an effort \n     will enable us to create a model that can be used by other \n     National Parks and Monuments across the country. Please let \n     us know how else we can support this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert W. Koons,\n     General Manager, CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           Grand Canyon Trust,\n\n                                                  January 5, 1995.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for providing the Grand \n     Canyon Trust with the opportunity to review and comment on \n     both draft and final versions of your proposed legislation \n     regarding entrance fees and public/private cost-sharing at \n     Grand Canyon National Park.\n       We believe that your proposed legislation will greatly \n     assist the efforts of the National Park Service and other \n     entities who are struggling to find appropriate means to \n     generate the additional funding so urgently needed by Grand \n     Canyon National Park. In this regard, we strongly support the \n     core concepts in your bill: new fees to generate incremental \n     revenue for park projects and cost-sharing arrangements \n     between the park service and non-governmental entities.\n       We share your concern that Grand Canyon's pressing \n     infrastructure and resource management needs will not be met \n     unless Congress acts to provide the new authorities described \n     in your legislation. And, if those needs are not met, the \n     park environment and visitor experience will continue to \n     deteriorate--an utterly unacceptable and unnecessary fate for \n     the crown jewel of America's parks.\n       Senator McCain, we applaud your consistent leadership on \n     behalf of Grand Canyon. This bill, the National Parks \n     Overflights Act, Grand Canyon Protection Act, and so many \n     other measures reflect your unwavering dedication to the \n     needs of the park. Please be assured that we are prepared to \n     assist you in your efforts to move the bill through the \n     legislative process to final enactment.\n       Again, thank you for all you have done for the Grand \n     Canyon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas C.

A bill to reduce Federal spending by prohibiting the \nexpenditure of appropriated funds on the United States International \nSpace Station Program; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n\n                       spending cuts legislation\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.\n   Mr. President, I send seven separate bills to the desk that I am \noffering on behalf of myself, Senators Bradley, Kohl, Feingold, Pryor, \nWellstone, Lautenberg, and other Senators.\n\n  Just briefly, Mr. President, those bills contain seven specific \nspending cuts which, over the first 5 years would save $33 billion, and \nover a 15-year-period would save $114 billion; four of those seven \nwould terminate or cut spending on four specific weapons programs. One \nwould cut the intelligence budget. One would kill NASA's space station \nprogram, and the last would kill the Department of Energy's Advanced \nNeutron Source. Yesterday CBS News and USA Today-CNN released new \npublic opinion polls. Both asked over 1,000 people: What should be the \nhighest priority of this new Congress? Interestingly, according to the \nCNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll, out of about 15 items listed, 45 percent of \nthe people said defense spending should have a very low priority and 11 \npercent said it should have no priority. Mr. President, 56 percent of \nthe people in that poll said--bear this in mind--defense spending \nshould have no priority or a low priority.\n  Yesterday was admittedly a euphoric day for Republicans in Congress. \nI have been in those euphoric positions so I watched with a great deal \nof interest, and I know how much they enjoyed the day. But how many \ntimes did you hear yesterday that we are going to give Government back \nto the people, we are going to start responding to what the people \nbelieve? Here is a golden opportunity for this Congress to prove that \nthey can cut spending--they can cut spending the way the American \npeople want. Bear in mind that the Contract With America provides for \ntax cuts which are estimated to cost between $150 and $200 billion. \nUnder the 1990 Budget Act, that means the people who favor those tax \ncuts are going to have to cut mandatory spending; the great bulk of \nmandatory spending is entitlements--Medicare, Medicaid, Social \nSecurity. That means that people who favor those tax cuts are going to \nhave to find offsetting spending cuts in entitlements.\n  The Kerry Commission was just disbanded, after long, arduous work in \ntrying to figure out proposed recommendations of entitlement spending \ncuts. After spending over $1 million on that Commission, a basket of \nabout 100 proposals were submitted to the Commission, many of whose \nmembers were Members of Congress. Not one single proposal was adopted \nfor cutting entitlement spending. And here we have a tax cut proposal \nthat is going to require $150 to $200 billion in spending cuts over the \nnext 5 years. Yet those same polls yesterday showed that 77 percent on \none poll, and 82 percent on \n[[Page S484]] the other, said deficit reduction should be the highest \npriority.\n  So, Mr. President, I am introducing these spending cuts. Bear this in \nmind. In 1996 the deficit is going to start back up unless we do \nsomething. So here is our task, find $150 billion in Social Security \nand Medicare and Medicaid in order to provide for a middle-class tax \ncut, and you are going to have to find God knows how much else of \nspending to cut to keep the deficit from starting back up in 1996, and \nI promise you the American people will turn on this place like a saber-\ntoothed tiger if that happens, and rightly so.\n  So here is $33 billion in seven spending cuts. I have some charts. I \nwill show those later and I will speak more extensively on those \nspecific cuts, why I think they should be there.\n  This will give people a chance to put up or shut up.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the 1980's, we were told that it \nwas possible to increase defense spending, cut taxes and still balance \nthe Federal budget. The national debt quadrupled in those years. \nPresident Clinton was elected on a pledge to reduce the budget deficits \nthat had crippled the economy through the Reagan-Bush years. For the \nfirst time in two decades, we have actually cut the deficits and the \neconomy is improving. Now, we are again hearing the siren song of tax \ncutting and increased defense spending from the same people who were \nthe source of our national discontent. We have to build upon the solid \naccomplishments of the last 2 years--not upon the wreckage of the \nprevious 12 years.\n  Senator Bumpers is offering this thoughtful list of future spending \ncuts that will save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. They are in \ncontrast to the many words being tossed about to justify a return to \nthe failed policies of the past.\n  I support most of the spending cuts proposed here today. But we need \nsupport from the new Republican majority to relieve the American \ntaxpayer of the burden they impose on all of us.\n  Some of these cuts will actually enhance existing programs. For \nexample, if we cap production of the C-17 cargo plane at 40 planes and \ninstead buy existing aircraft like Boeing 747's or Lockheed C5's, we \ncan save $5 billion over the next 5 years and increase our air cargo \ncapabilities.\n  If we cancel the fifth and sixth military communication satellites \nknown as Milstar, we can save $2 billion over the next 5 years. These \nsatellites were designed to survive a nuclear war with the Soviet \nUnion, a nation that doesn't even exist any more. Instead, we should \naccelerate development of the smaller, cheaper Milstar III, which will \ndeliver more communications capability for the regional conflicts that \nwe are most likely to encounter in the future.\n  The international space station will consume $52 billion of taxpayer \nmoney over the next 15 years. I am not against space exploration, but \nNASA has never justified the immense cost of this program in terms of \nscientific returns.\n  We need to intensify our efforts to develop cheap, reusable launch \nvehicles that make space more accessible. then we can consider space \nstations, space factories and other futuristic projects.\n  The Navy wants to spend $3 billion over the next 5 years to refit our \nTrident ballistic missile submarines with the super-accurate D-5 \nnuclear missile. These missiles were designed as bunker-busters for \nSoviet ICBM's, which are being disarmed as we speak. And we have D4 \nmissiles that can deliver an acceptable nuclear punch in the unlikely \nevent of total nuclear war.\n  I don't agree with everything Senator Bumpers proposes. We differ on \nhis recommendation to cut $5 billion from the intelligence budget. I \nprefer to await the recommendations of the Presidential commission set \nup last year by Congress to review the roles and missions of our \nintelligence agencies.\n  I reserve my opinion on the Advanced Neutron Source reactor because I \nhave not had an opportunity to analyze the details of this program. I \nmay very well join Senator Bumpers in opposition in the future--but I \njust don't know enough to make an educated judgement at the present \ntime.\n  In sum, there are tens of billions of dollars to be saved in these \nspending cuts, without any threat to national security, and the very \nreal possibility that our defense will be strengthened as a result.\n  Along with Senator Bumpers, I urge incoming Senators and \nRepresentatives to make a genuine, bipartisan effort to review these \noptions to make our government less costly and more efficient. We have \nsome old white elephants straining the costs of government. We don't \nneed great new ideas--just a little courage--to end these \nprograms.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 158. A bill to provide for the energy security of the Nation \nthrough encouraging the production of domestic oil and gas resources in \ndeep water on the Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the outer continental shelf deep water royalty relief act\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I introduce the Outer Continental \nShelf Deep Water Royalty Relief Act. This legislation is intended to \naddress the serious decline in oil and gas exploration and development \nactivity in the Western and Central Gulf of Mexico on the Outer \nContinental Shelf [OCS]. This is not the same proposal introduced in \nthe Senate and reported by the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources in the last Congress. This specific legislation is the result \nof a compromise worked out with the Administration last session in the \ncontext of the mining law reform conference. This legislation has the \nsupport of the Secretaries of the Departments of Energy and the \nInterior.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf is an important domestic source of oil \nand clean-burning natural gas. Approximately 10 percent of domestic oil \nand 25 percent of domestic natural gas is produced from the OCS. The \nOCS is estimated to hold one-fourth of all domestic oil and gas \nreserves. The Central and Western Gulf account for 90 percent of the \noil and 99 percent of the gas produced from the OCS.\n  Domestic exploration and development have fallen off dramatically in \nrecent years as capital has moved to support drilling in other parts of \nthe world. In 1992, for the first time, the major oil companies spent \nmore on exploration and development activity abroad than on U.S. \nactivities. Between 1987 and 1992, $30 billion flowed from the U.S. oil \npatch to foreign operations. This translates to a loss of 450,000 jobs \nby the domestic industry over the last 10 years.\n  Mr. President, the deep waters of the OCS hold promise of substantial \noil and gas resources crucial to our domestic energy security. However, \nthe costs of producing these resources are substantial and increase \nsignificantly with water depth. One industry estimate places capital \ninvestment costs for a conventional fixed leg platform in 800 feet of \nwater at $360 million, compared to costs of nearly $1 billion for a \nconventional tension leg platform in 3000 feet of water. According to \nDepartment of Interior estimates there are some 11 billion barrels of \noil equivalent in the Gulf of Mexico in waters of a depth of 200 meters \nor more. This legislation is expected to bring into production at least \ntwo additional fields with possible reserves of 150 million barrels of \noil equivalent.\n  By allowing lessees to recover a significant portion of the capital \ncost prior to imposition of a royalty payment this legislation will \nencourage development of these important oil and gas resources. Royalty \nholidays of this type are commonly used in other parts of the world as \na mechanism for risk sharing between the government and the industry of \nthe huge up-front capital costs associated with developing this type of \nresource. The North Sea is a prime example. British and Norwegian tax \nand\n royalty changes, put in place in the 80's have yielded dramatic \nresults in the past couple of years. In fact, increases in this non-\nOpec production has contributed significantly to holding down \ninternational oil prices.\n\n  First, the legislation clarifies the authority of the Secretary of \nthe Interior to grant royalty relief on existing leases in the OCS to \nencourage development. Currently the Secretary may grant relief once a \nlease has been developed and is producing, it is not clear whether the \nauthority exists before \n[[Page S485]] production is initiated. The Department of Interior has \nsought this clarification. The legislation further provides for a \nspecified royalty holiday for existing leases in deep waters that are \nnot currently economic. Upon application, undeveloped leases in water \ndepths of 200 meters or more in the Central and Western Gulf that are \nfound to be uneconomic under current conditions, will have the royalty \npayment suspended until a minimum number of volumes have been produced. \nThe specific volumes covered by the royalty holiday are based on water \ndepth. The provision applies to production from leases coming on-line \nafter the date of enactment of the legislation and to production \nresulting from lease development activities undertaken pursuant to a \nDevelopment Operations Coordination Document approved after the date of \nenactment. In addition, for new leasing in the Gulf, the lease terms \nwill provide for an initial royalty holiday on a given number of \nbarrels of oil or gas equivalent, as determined by the Secretary. This \nnew leasing arrangement will be in effect for 5 years from the date of \nenactment. The royalty relief would not apply to the production of oil \nor natural gas, respectively, in any month when the average closing \nprice for the earliest delivery month for oil exceeds $28 per barrel or \nwhen prices for natural gas exceed $3.50 per million Btu's.\n  This is a win-win policy for the Federal Government. By stimulating \ndevelopment of indigenous oil and gas resources we reduce our \ndependence on imported supplies, create jobs and generate significant \nrevenues, initially in Federal and State income taxes then royalties.\n  Mr. President, this bill represents one step in addressing this \nproblem. It is a significant step, but we must look at other \ninitiatives, such as changes in the tax laws that can be taken to \naddress this serious decline in domestic oil and gas exploration and \ndevelopment activity. I look forward to considering other initiatives \nthat could complement the royalty relief proposal that I am introducing \ntoday.\n  I am also submitting a separate amendment to this legislation to \ncorrect an unacceptably onerous effect of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 \n[OPA 90]. The amendment gives the Secretary of the Interior the \nflexibility to set the financial responsibility requirement based on \nthe risk associated with different sorts of facilities. OPA 90 was \npassed and signed into law following the Exxon Valdez tanker spill in \nAlaska. The intent of OPA 90 was to lessen the risk of oil spills and \nto improve the level of preparedness and responsiveness when spills do \noccur. OPA 90 created a comprehensive prevention, response, liability \nand compensation regime for dealing with vessel and facility caused oil \npollution from spills in navigable waters. However, in the post-\ndisaster zeal to legislate, the solution went far beyond the problem. \nCurrently, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [OCSLA] requires \nowners of OCS facilities to demonstrate evidence of financial \nresponsibility equal to $35 million. OPA 90 increased the financial \nresponsibility of responsible parties to $150 million. This was done \nwithout regard to the actual risk and experience of nontanker \nfacilities operating in the OCS.\n  This same amendment was reported by the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources in the last Congress and was the subject of a \ncolloquy between myself and Senator Baucus on the Senate floor. The \nSolicitor of the Department of the Interior has since completed his \nreview of the financial responsibility provisions and determined that \n``OPA does not authorize MMS to set different responsibility levels for \noffshore facilities based on risk.'' The Administration agrees that a \nlegislative remedy is required.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation to provide deepwater royalty relief in the Western and \nCentral Gulf of Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 158\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That this \n     Act may be referred to as the ``Outer Continental Shelf Deep \n     Water Royalty Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to impose a moratorium on immigration by aliens other \nthan refugees, certain priority and skilled workers, and immediate \nrelatives of United States citizens and permanent resident aliens; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the immigration moratorium act of 1995\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to address \nthe seemingly perpetual problem of immigration. We are often told the \nUnited States of America was established by immigrants. Indeed, \nimmigration has been the cornerstone of America. I could not agree more \nabout the positive impact immigrants have played in America, nor will I \ndispute the positive role immigrants will play in the future.\n  We are taught to believe that immigration to America has been, and \nshould be, a perpetual and unlimited right.\n  However, our capacity, as a country, to process and assimilate the \nheavy flow of immigrants is not sustainable. Excessive demands on \nsocial, medical and welfare services accentuate the necessity to \naddress the problem immediately.\n  A quick survey of the condition of State budgets, particularly those \nof California, Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas will illustrate \nthe overwhelming demands on education, health care, welfare, prisons, \nand other social infrastructure. California, Florida, and Texas are \nactually suing the Federal Government for billions of dollars they have \nhad to spend for such immigrant related costs.\n  The dilemma before us is not limited to illegal immigrants as the \nmedia often implies. While approximately 300,000 illegal immigrants \ncome here each year, we actually admit almost 1 million legal \nimmigrants a year. Legal immigration creates a demand more than three \ntimes greater than illegal immigration. Simply put, States do not have \nthe resources to provide services to an additional 1.3 million persons \na year.\n  Some will say that these immigrants do not come over here for a hand \nout, but that they come over to work and live the American dream. \nHowever, if we assume this to be true--that they come to America to \nwork--then this means they increase the supply of the labor force. Of \nthe 974,000 immigrants that were granted legal permanent residence in \n1992, 672,303 were between the ages of 20 and 64.\n  If these immigrants enter the job market, their entry effectively \nreduces wages by increasing the labor supplied. At a time when real \nincome is stagnant if not declining, immigration policy should not \ncontribute such a strong downward pressure on real income. Such a \npolicy does not make fiscal or social sense.\n  The scenario just mentioned is the optimist view. If one chooses to \nassume the opposite, that immigrants choose not to work, the inevitable \nresult is an increase in the demand of social services. As mentioned \nearlier, the demand is already too high for many states.\n  Neither of the two scenarios paint a pretty picture. Indeed, both of \nthese scenarios are costly to the American taxpayer.\n  As a result, I am introducing legislation to provide relief to the \nAmerican taxpayer. This bill would lower the amount of legal immigrants \nfrom about 1 million to 325,000. This figure would include around \n175,000 spouses and children of U.S. citizens which has traditionally \nbeen the case.\n  The bill also includes a 50,000 level for refugees/asylees, 50,000 \nfor highly skilled workers and 50,000 for other relatives of U.S. \ncitizens.\n  In addition, my legislation would reduce the admissions backlog by \nfreezing it at the current level. New applications would not be \naccepted until the end of the moratorium unless the applicant came from \none of the allowable categories under this legislation.\n  This legislation would ease the demands on State governments while \nalso minimizing the negative economic consequences immigrants have on \nthe labor force. Although this is only a temporary 5-year remedy, it \nwill allow us the time needed to pass a complete, long-term solution to \nthe problem.\n  I support comprehensive reform efforts, but believe immediate relief \nis needed.\n  It is important that we strive for a rational and equitable \nimmigration policy that takes into account the economic and social \nneeds. We must do this without compromising the social and economic \nstability of this country and the quality of life for every American.\n  In order for immigrants to live the American dream, there has to be a \nhealthy, prosperous economy and a diverse, harmonious society.\n  To offer anything less, would be to cheat them of the American dream. \nMr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. MURRAY:\n  S. 161. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe rate of estate tax imposed on family-owned business interests; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the american family business preservation act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the American \nFamily Business Preservation Act of 1995.\n  My father ran a small business in Bothell, WA. He taught me as long \nas I worked hard and played by the rules, I could build a better life \nfor myself and my family. But, for years, it seemed that as hard as my \nhusband and I were \n[[Page S487]] working, we were still a pink slip away from real \nfinancial disaster.\n  Small businesses are the heart of the American economic system. They \nare the essence of the American dream. And, sadly, for many small \nbusiness owners that dream has been fading. Our great American middle \nclass is nervous. My bill aims to alleviate that anxiety and restore \nthe dream.\n  Mr. President, this bill will specifically reduce the particularly \nonerous estate and gift tax imposed on our small businesses during the \n1980s. This bill allows small manufacturers, service industries, \nfarmers, and woodlot owners to leave their children the benefits of \ntheir hard work. It will end the ridiculous penalties the Federal \nGovernment has imposed on American families when a loved one dies. It \nwill keep American families engaged in small business financially \nsolvent.\n  This reform is especially important to my home State of Washington. \nIt will encourage the stability and diversity of our economy. It will \nhelp assure that farms and woodlots stay in family hands and thereby \nensure stability in forest management. It is an environment-friendly \ntax cut.\n  Specifically, the American Family Business Preservation Act will \nreduce the 55-percent estate tax rate to 15 percent as long as the \nheirs continue to operate the business. If, for any reason, the heirs \nare unable to operate--but continue to own--the business, the maximum \nrate will be 20 percent.\n  It indexes the unified estate and gift tax credit for inflation. This \ncredit--which effectively exempts from tax estates valued at less than \n$600,000--was last increased 14 years ago, in 1981.\n  And, the bill allows hard-working Americans to keep more of their \nmoney in their family. I believe if you work hard and you play by the \nrules, you should be able to enjoy the rewards. When this bill passes, \nwe will be able to give up to 15 percent of our earned income each year \nto family members without being subject to gift tax.\n  Mr. President, this provision is important because many of this \nNation's hard-working people have yet to feel the impact of the current \neconomic expansion. During the past 2 years, we have created more than \n5 million jobs. Interest rates and inflation are subdued. We have \nreduced the size of Government. And, we have trimmed the one-third of \nour Federal budget deficit.\n  I am proud of this record.\n  But, we need to make sure working people really benefit from this \neconomic progress.\n  Mr. President, we are at an economic crossroads. We can continue \nalong the traditional route of corporate buy-outs, declining wages, and \na skittish middle class. Or, we can move boldly into a new century in \nwhich jobs and lives are valued, and all American families have a stake \nin our economic well-being.\n  That is why this bill is so important.\n  Mr. President, it gives our kids hope in the future. It brings common \nsense and the voice of average Americans to our tax policy. Hard-\nworking Americans need to be respected, and they deserve to reap the \nbenefits of their hard work. Our only hope of restoring the American \ndream is to empower the middle class.\n  When my colleagues, Congressman Bill Brewster and Congressman Jim \nMcCrery, introduced the companion bill in the other body in the last \nCongress, it deservedly gained quick and solid bipartisan support. I \nexpect the same record in this body.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 \nand the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 to improve natural \ngas and hazardous liquid pipeline safety, in response to the natural \ngas pipeline accident in Edison, New Jersey, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   the safety improvement act of 1995\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nNational Gas Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 1995. This bill \ndramatically decreases the chances of pipeline accidents and reduces \nthe risk to those who live, work, or go to school near a pipeline.\n  This bill is designed to prevent disasters like the one that occurred \nlast March 23, in Edison, NJ. The whole Nation witnessed the ball of \nfire over Edison in the wake of the explosion. Every American who saw \nthat image on television shuddered.\n  All too often, when a disaster happens, people focus on it for a few \ndays and then shift their attention to other events. That has not \nhappened in the wake of the Edison explosion and will not happen. I \nwon't let that happen. Senator Bradley won't let it happen. And the \npeople of Edison won't let it happen.\n  I was the destruction in Edison after the explosion. The explosion \nwas devastating to the families involved and traumatic to all residents \nof my State, which is home to a number of pipelines. I have talked to \nfamilies who lost everything but the clothes on their backs. I have \nseen the emotional fallout--the children and adults who replay the \nevents of that evening each night before they drift into a fitful \nsleep. And I know that even now, almost a year later, those people \nstill have very real problems.\n  Edison was not an isolated event. Since that terrible night on March \n23, there have been other pipeline problems. And there were problems \nthat preceded it. My major concern is what happened in Edison; but, Mr. \nPresident, we must make sure it doesn't happen in any community, to any \nAmerican.\n  I believe that if this bill had been law before that fateful night \nlast March things could have been very different.\n  Let me briefly describe the five major elements of my legislation:\n  First, my legislation would beef up compliance with existing laws by \nmaking sure that the Department of Transportation has the resources \nnecessary to conduct regular oversight inspections of corporations with \npipeline operations in New Jersey and around the country.\n  The bill achieves this goal by providing the U.S. DOT with the \nauthority to recoup the cost of accident investigations from pipeline \ncompanies. In this way, DOT inspections are not interrupted when Office \nof Pipeline Safety personnel and resources are diverted to investigate \na major pipeline failure.\n  Second, the bill would prevent accidents before they happen. Our \nlegislation will increase funding to States to advertise one-call \nnotification systems and expand the DOT role in pipeline safety to \ninclude pipeline safety awareness programs.\n  One-call notification systems require contractors to learn the \nlocation of underground facilities before they dig.\n  Third, the bill directs the Secretary to establish an electronic data \nsystem on existing pipelines. This will provide an adequate data base \nso DOT can cope with the potential problems we face.\n  This system will provide information on the nature, extent, and \ngeologic location of pipeline facilities to facilitate risk assessment \nand safety planning with respect to such facilities.\n  Fourth, we need to target attention to areas where the greatest \npotential threat exists. The legislation will increase inspection and \nsiting requirements for pipelines in high density population areas. I \nwould also encourage \n[[Page S489]] people who live near a pipeline to report suspicious \ndumping or digging on a pipeline right-of-way.\n  Finally, we need to have stronger punishment to deter negligent or \nwillful violations of law. Our bill would make it a Federal crime to \nillegally dump on pipeline right-of-way and mandate the installation \nand use of remotely controlled shutoff valves.\n  Mr. President, last June DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety sponsored a \npipeline safety summit. The summit was designed to develop a public/\nprivate agenda that establishes priorities for pipeline safety \ninitiatives and identifies the next steps needed to make them a \nreality. The report developed from the suggestions at the summit will \nform a blueprint for action. I expect that report to be completed soon. \nWhen it is, I will develop additional legislative proposals based upon \nit.\n  Meanwhile, I would like to remind my colleagues that no State in the \nUnion is exempt from the type of disaster that happened in Edison, NJ.\n  Mr. President, I would encourage all of my colleagues to examine and \ncosponsor the National Gas Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 1995.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the National Gas Pipeline \nSafety Improvement Act of 1994 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pipeline Safety Improvement \n     Act of 1994''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to \nrequire that allocations of budget authority and budget outlays made by \nthe Committee on Appropriations of each House be agreed to by joint \nresolution and to permit amendments that reduce appropriations to also \nreduce the relevant allocation and the discretionary spending limits; \nto the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with \ninstructions that if one Committee reports, the other Committee have \nthirty days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n         THE SPENDING REDUCTION AND BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Spending Reduction \nand Budget Control Act of 1995. This legislation fundamentally and \npowerfully reforms an appropriations and budget process that is too \nstacked in favor of continued public spending and a status quo of \nwasteful or outdated government programs.\n  I have been trying, along with a number of Senators, to reduce \ntaxpayer funding wasted on unnecessary programs and to reduce the \ndeficit. During the 103d Congress, over 20 separate, specific cut \nproposals were voted on in the Senate. Only three were adopted. Three. \nClearly, any attempt to cut programs on the Senate floor is a long \nshot.\n  The prospects are discouraging and, unfortunately, the Senate's own \nrules work against any attempt to cut spending. My legislation targets \nthese rules and the substantial procedural obstacles faced by any \nlegislator who dares to cut appropriations, and to cut Federal \nspending.\n  Every time one of us offers a amendment to cut a program, we face the \ncharge that these amendments do not lead necessarily to any deficit \nreduction. This happened again and again during the last Congress as a \nway to discourage Senators from supporting an amendment. Instead of \ncriticizing a proposed budget cut on substance, opponents simply remind \nSenators that these budget cutters are just tilting at windmills.\n  The problem is that this argument is valid. The rules governing the \nbudget and appropriations process in fact make it nearly impossible to \ncut a program and reduce spending. In reality, any attempt to do so \nwould almost certainly require a three-fifths supermajority to succeed. \nAnd the cuts, even if agreed to by the Senate, can be easily reversed \nin Conference.\n  My bill creates three key spending reforms, which I will describe in \ndetail. This legislation--first--creates real opportunities to \nestablish or redirect spending priorities, second--guarantees members \nan ability to cut spending with a majority vote, and--third--constrains \nthe appropriations conferences to retain spending cuts agreed to in \nboth Houses of Congress.\n  Consider how we allocate spending around here: after Congress \napproves the budget, the Appropriations Committees are allowed to \ndetermine discretionary spending within the budget resolution targets. \nWhile we debate functional categories during consideration of the \nbudget, the fact is that these categories (with the possible exception \nof the defense category) are almost entirely irrelevant to the \nappropriations process.\n  Constrained only by an overall discretionary spending cap, the \nAppropriations Committee distributes spending authority to its 13 \nsubcommittees. Based on virtually no guidelines, tens of billions of \ndollars are allocated to the subcommittees. The rest of Congress never \nknows how this was done or how their constituents' money can be spent \nuntil they've been handed the results.\n  We need to return this power to the voters by allowing all of their \nrepresentatives to determine how to distribute the money within the \nbudget targets and subcommittee jurisdictions. That means nothing more \nthan requiring a vote by each House on how much money each subcommittee \nshould get. This is the first element of may bill.\n  Unfortunately, this step alone doesn't solve the problem. When the \nappropriations bills come to the floor, there are different complex \nrules but the same problem: the ability to cut spending is greatly \nlimited.\n  Here's how it works on the House and Senate floors: if you offer an \namendment to cut a specific spending item, such as the purchase of \nLawrence Welk's childhood home, and it passes, the category that money \ncame from remains intact, and the money you saved can be spent \nsomewhere else in that category.\n  If you want to avoid the trap I just described, you also have to get \napproval to cut the overall allocation, and lock in that cut. These \nallocations and caps are very important in Congress--we have rules that \nsay you need 60, not 50, votes to reduce these privileged entities. You \ncan raise taxes with 50 votes but to cut spending you need 60 votes. \nThe second part of my bill would straighten this out--if you have the \nsupport of a majority, you can cut spending.\n  But there's one last problem. Even if the House and Senate agree on \nsimilar program and allocation cuts, the Conference Committee that \ncreates the final bill is virtually free to reinsert whatever funding \nmight have been cut. This couldn't happen under the terms of the third \npart of my proposal.\n  These problems are real. I know firsthand. This really happens. It \nhappened last Congress to a spending cut amendment I offered. After the \nSenate agreed to cut $22 million from the High Temperature Gas Reactor, \nthe Conference Committee scaled the reduction down to $10 million. Half \na loaf, but still $10 million in deficit reduction, right? Wrong. The \nEnergy and Water Appropriations Bill--which cut funding for the HTGR by\n $10 million--actually increased in size during the conference, gaining \nan extra $20 million out of thin air.\n\n  Let me make an analogy between cutting spending under the present \nsystem and basketball. Imagine you make a free throw--cut a specific \nprogram--but it doesn't count unless you go back to the three-point \nline and make the shot again--cut the allocation or cap. But it doesn't \ncount again unless you go back to the half-court line and sink a shot \nfrom there--keep the cuts in a conference report. All of that in order \nto get credit for a single free throw--or a single deficit reduction \namendment.\n  We've created this maze. We can straighten it out. We have to turn \nthe process around so that it's as easy to cut spending in the future \nas it is to protect spending now. We need a new system, which would be \ncreated by the adoption of my reforms.\n  Again, there are three key elements to my proposal:\n  First, we need to give to Congress the right to debate and set \npriorities for discretionary spending. These are the most fundamental \ndecisions, and they are out of the reach of most of the Congress.\n  I propose we put these decisions before Congress, for approval or \nmodification by majority vote. My bill would require a separate \nresolution to allocate spending among the appropriations subcommittees. \nBoth houses would have to agree beforehand on how much could be spent \nby each house's subcommittees.\n  Second, we need to change the rules that prevent cuts in \nappropriations spending from being actual budget cuts. These \nobstacles--which were put in place to hinder an increase in spending--\nrepresent bad policy when the goal is deficit reduction.\n  My legislation would allow cuts in programs and cuts in spending. \nThere would be several options: one, follow the status quo, and let \nmoney saved from an appropriations cut amendment be spent elsewhere; \ntwo, cut a program and cut the current year's allocation (thereby \nreducing the deficit); or three, cut a program, cut the current budget, \nand force a reduction in future budgets. All of these approaches would \nrequire only a majority vote--not the current supermajority of 60 \nvotes--to be adopted.\n  [[Page S492]] Third, real accountability is needed in conference \ncommittees, where expensive deals are often cut. Even when the House \nand Senate each cut programs, the compromise may turn out to be that no \nprogram is cut.\n  My bill would change Senate rules to prohibit an Appropriations \nConference Committee from reporting a bill that cuts spending less than \neither the House or Senate language. Even if the House and Senate cuts \nare in different programs, the conference will have to reduce spending \nby at a minimum the smaller of the two amounts. In other words, if the \nHouse agrees to $100 million in cuts on a particular appropriations \nbill, and the Senate agrees to $200 million on same bill, the Conferees \nwould be constrained to produce a Conference Report with at least $100 \nmillion in cuts included.\n  Are these budget reforms the answer to the deficit crisis? No. \nEntitlement and tax expenditure outlays are both growing rapidly, and \nneither can be addressed by changing congressional procedures. Even as \nwe tighten controls on discretionary spending, we must move forward to \nconfront the huge growth in the other two-thirds of the budget.\n  Americans are right when they think that we are truly inspired when \nit comes to spending; we need to bring the same zeal to cutting \nspending. We need basic reforms that assure that spending cuts are \nspending cuts, not just reasons for another press release.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider this legislation \nseriously. This bill would go a long way towards creating a rational, \nbalanced approach to the budget and spending.

The amendment gives legislators new tools to address \n     spending priorities and deficit reduction.\n\n\n                   step 1: fix the allocation process\n\n                                Problem\n\n       A central decision in the Appropriations process is the \n     distribution of available spending authority (BA and outlays) \n     among the thirteen subcommittees. While the Budget Resolution \n     may fix the total spending ceiling, the ``functional \n     categories'' provide little guidance for these ``302/602 \n     (B)'' allocations. As a result, the Appropriations Committee \n     made fundamental decisions about spending priorities that are \n     not subject to the approval by the entire Senate. \n     Additionally, the House and Senate figures often differ.\n\n                                Solution\n\n       The Congress would required to consider and approve \n     spending targets for each appropriation subcommittee. This \n     would be done by a Joint Resolution which would:\n       Originate and be managed within the Appropriations \n     Committees;\n       Have privileged status and supersede other pending \n     business;\n       Limit debate (Reconciliation-type rules--20 hour debate, \n     tight germaneness rules for amendments)\n       Specify allocations by Subcommittee\n       Meet appropriate overall Budget cap\n       Be passed by both Houses in final form prior to the \n     approval of any Appropriations Bills by either House.\n       Subcommittees allocations can be modified in subsequent \n     Appropriations Bills:--downward by a majority vote--upward by \n     a three-fifths vote, as is the case today.\n[[Page S493]] step 2: amendments to appropriations bills should be able \n             to produce budget savings with a majority vote\n\n                                Problem\n\n       A valid criticism to any amendment to cut Appropriations is \n     that such amendments are unlikely to result in deficit \n     savings. If a legislator succeeds in cutting an account, the \n     funds saved remain available under the Subcommittee's 302(b)/\n     602(b) allocation to be spent on other items. If the \n     appropriations cuts amendment contains reductions in the \n     302(b)/602(b) allocation, then it is subject to a \n     ``supermajority'' (i.e., three-fifths vote) point of order. \n     Finally, even if both Houses pass similar cuts or if both \n     Houses come in below the 302(b)/602(b) allocation figures, \n     there is no explicit constraint on Conference to maintain \n     deficit reduction.\n\n                                Solution\n\n       Senators and Representatives would be allowed to offer \n     appropriations cut amendments in one of three forms:\n       (i) Cut the program account, but retain current law \n     subcommittee allocation and discretionary cap figures;\n       (ii) Cut the program account and drop subcommittee \n     allocation and discretionary cap figures accordingly for \n     current year;\n       (iii) Cut the program account and drop subcommittee \n     allocation figure for current year and discretionary cap \n     figure for current year and for an additional four years.\n       Any amendment offered in one of the above forms would not \n     be subject to a three-fifths vote point of order.\n\n\n      step 3: focus the conference committees on deficit reduction\n\n                                Problem\n\n       Even if each House adopted reduced spending proposals, \n     there's no guarantee that the conference committee will \n     reduce spending. In fact, our experience is that the \n     conference committee can drop cut proposals and even report a \n     bill which increases spending higher than that reported by \n     either House.\n\n                                Solution\n\n       Conference would not be able to adopt a final 302(b)/602(b) \n     allocation figure higher than the highest of the House or \n     Senate figures; if two Houses agree on different budget cuts \n     on the same appropriations bill, Conference would be required \n     to pass savings equal to the lesser of the two packages of \n     budget cuts.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BRADLEY (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. \n        Exon):\n  S. 164. A bill to require States to consider adopting mandatory, \ncomprehensive, Statewide one-call notification systems to protect \nnatural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines and all other underground \nfacilities from being damaged by excavations, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n          the comprehensive one-call notification act of 1995\n\n Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Comprehensive One-\ncall Notification Act. I am very pleased to have as cosponsors of this \nbill Senator Specter, Senator Lautenburg, and the ranking member of the \nCommerce Committee's Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Exon.\n  The bill we are introducing today will create new assurance that \naccidents involving pipelines and underground utilities won't occur. \nEvery year, multiple fatalities and tens of millions of dollars worth \nof damage occur simply because people dig where they shouldn't. These \nthird-party incidents are the single leading cause of accidents \ninvolving pipelines. According to the Department of Transportation, \nthese accidents result in over half of the fatalities and half of the \nproperty damage caused by all pipeline failures. The Comprehensive One-\nCall Notification Act will create a mechanism to prevent the \ninadvertent injury and the potential tragedy.\n  Last March 23, just before midnight, an explosion ripped through the \ncommunity of Durham Woods in Edison, NJ. Within minutes, eight \napartment buildings were ablaze. Soon they were gone, wiped out by a \nfireball that lit up the sky over hundreds of square miles. One life \nwas lost. Hundreds lost their homes. Many more were evacuated.\n  The injuries were miraculously low. But who knows how many others \nstill lie awake at night, wondering whether it could happen again and \nfearing the future.\n  Reflecting on the accident today, it seems hard to fault anyone for \ntheir response to the tragedy. The community pulled together to help \nout those in need. Food, emergency shelter, general support and \nfinancial assistance were offered amply and unconditionally in the \nhours and days following the accident.\n  However, great as this response was, this is not what is most \nstriking about this accident. What is most striking about the accident \nis how lucky we were. Who would ever think that, given the timing and \nthe magnitude of the explosion, so many people--many fleeing with just \nthe clothes they had on--would escape without serious injury? Few who \nhave walked around that crater, seen the charged cars and the empty \nbuilding foundations would disagree with the conclusion that many there \nwere saved only by a miracle.\n  Unfortunately, miracles are a poor basis for public policy. You can't \ncount on them. I am not about to count on them. The\n fact is that there is no margin for error in today's pipeline \nindustry. The natural gas industry does have an excellent safety \nrecord, especially when you consider that 25 percent of the energy we \nconsume moves by these pipelines. For example, there are seven major \npipelines that cross my home State, and hundreds of smaller ones. But \nthe Edison accident never should have happened.\n\n  We need to acknowledge Edison for what it is: a breakdown in the \nregulatory and safety program. When the National Transportation Safety \nBoard testified before the Energy Committee in April, their analysis \npointed nearly conclusively to multiple gouges on the pipeline as the \nprobable cause of the disaster. These marks appeared to be due to some \npowerful machinery, such as a backhoe, that struck the pipeline \nrepeatedly.\n  At this point, we don't know whether the damage was unintentional or \non purpose. We don't know who struck the pipeline or whether they might \nhave been aware of the possibility. We do know, however, that there was \nno requirement of utility notification prior to the excavation. And we \nknow that there is no penalty for digging in the vicinity of the \npipeline without notifying the utility operator.\n  This is simply wrong, and represents a failure of public policy. At \nthe hearing before the Senate Energy Committee, every witness agreed \nthat we need a new national program of utility notification. If someone \nis excavating or grading a site, there has to be proper notification \nand it has to be mandatory--not voluntary--with penalties for \nnegligence or noncompliance. This national program will be created by \nthe comprehensive legislation we are considering today.\n  Right now, the gas industry is making plans for a rapid expansion \ninto new markets, particularly in the areas of natural gas vehicles and \nelectric power production. The Department of Energy has predicted that \nthe gas market will expand by a third over the next 15 years. If \naccidents occur--regardless of who is at fault or how the industry \nfollows up--this growth will not. It is that simple.\n  The telecommunications industry is likewise spending billions to \nexpand its infrastructure and capabilities. If this investment, \nhowever, is held hostage by every backhoe operator in every State, \nwithout serious controls and oversight, we won't see a lot of traffic \non this information superhighway.\n  In one sense, this bill is unnecessary. Sooner or later, I predict, \nevery State will adopt one-call provisions like those identified in \nthis legislation. The reason is simple: sooner or later, every State \nwill experience a major accident involving third-party damage to \nunderground utilities. Then, just as has happened in New Jersey, one-\ncall provisions will be introduced or strengthened. This is not an \nissue of cost. Most States have these programs already. The problem is \nthat, absent sufficient political motivation, these programs are just \nnot as effective as they need to be.\n  We shouldn't have to wait for another disaster to understand the \nimportance of this modest bill. This comprehensive one-call legislation \nrepresents a necessary step if we are to do everything reasonable and \nappropriate to protect the public from the kind of tragedy that struck \nEdison.\n  This bill, obviously, won't guarantee that another Edison will never \noccur. But mandatory, truly comprehensive one-call programs, based on a \nnational model, are a good place to start.\n  Passage of this legislation will send a message to the public that \nour concern is serious and the risks are real. A national program will \ncreate a new level of awareness and this awareness would \n[[Page S494]] be a powerful ally in our fight for increased safety.\n  Mr. President, last Congress, this legislation was passed twice by \nthe House of Representatives and was passed unanimously by the Senate \nCommerce Committee. This bill was on the verge of final approval when \nthe Senate adjourned last October.\n  It is clearly time to pass this legislation. I believe that there is \nno substantive reason why we cannot and should not act. It is endorsed \nvery broadly by industry. It is needed by the general public. I urge \nall my colleagues to consider this bill carefully and approve it \nwithout delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 164\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to transfer a parcel of land to the Taos Pueblo \nIndians of New Mexico; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n            [[Page S496]] taos pueblo bottleneck legislation\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing with my \ncolleagues, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Dole, will transfer 764 acres now \nlocated in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness of the Carson National Forest to \nthe Taos Pueblo, both in northern New Mexico.\n  The history of this area is fascinating and involves the only living \nculture in the United States to be recognized by the United Nations as \na World Heritage Site. Americans can be very proud of the Taos Pueblo \nIndians who live in the Rocky Mountains of New Mexico. I know New \nMexicans are proud of the Taos Pueblo for this most unique \ninternational honor in our land of enchantment.\n  Designation as a World Heritage Site is an honor we share with the \nGrand Canyon, Yosemite, the Statue of Liberty, and Independence Hall, \nto name several such sites in the United States. The Taos Pueblo, \nhowever, is the only living culture to be so honored in the Western \nHemisphere.\n  A well known cultural and religious attribute of this World Heritage \nSite at Taos Pueblo is the Blue Lake and its special spiritual \nsignificance to the Taos Pueblo and other New Mexico Indians. Blue Lake \nis nestled high in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains east of the Pueblo. \nThe sacred ceremonies of the Taos Pueblo people at this site pre-date \nthe signing of the Magna Carta.\n  The Bottleneck area is an integral part of Blue Lake and continues to \nbe used by Taos Pueblo for religious pilgrimages. The sacred Path of \nLife Trail, connecting the Pueblo with Blue Lake, runs through the \nbottleneck. The Blue Lake Wilderness includes Blue Lake, Star Lake, and \nBear Lake. Headwaters to Rio Pueblo de Taos and the Rio Lucero are also \nin this sacred area. There is no doubt that the Blue Lake Wilderness, \ndesignated a wilderness area in the 1970 law, has been a vital source \nof livelihood and spiritual strength for the Taos Pueblo for over 1,000 \nyears.\n  The bill pending before the Senate today is intended to complete the \nfull transfer of the Blue Lake territory to the Taos Pueblo. The Path \nof Life Trail in the Bottleneck Tract will be returned to its rightful \nowners.\n  Most of the Blue Lake area transfer took place in 1970, when Public \nLaw 91-550 was signed by President Richard M. Nixon. At that time, \n48,000 of the 50,000 acres of Blue Lake Wilderness were returned to the \nTaos Pueblo. The entire 50,000 acre area known as the Blue Lake was \nacknowledged by the Indian Claims Commission in 1965 to be Taos Pueblo \nland. The creation of the Blue Lake Wilderness in 1970 by the Congress \ntransferred 48,000 acres of the 50,000 acres back to Taos Pueblo to be \nheld in trust by the United States for the Pueblo.\n  In 1979, the Federal District Court in Washington, DC added 1,235 \nacres to the trust lands of Taos Pueblo in the Tract C transfer, \nleaving only the so-called Bottleneck Tract from the original 50,000 \nacre claim. Our legislation completes the Blue Lake transfer.\n  Drafted as an amendment to the Blue Lake Wilderness Act, our bill \nrequires that the Bottleneck also be maintained as wilderness. The Taos \nPueblo has an excellent record of maintaining the Blue Lake Wilderness. \nWe have every confidence that adding the Bottleneck to the Blue Lake \nWilderness will increase the enthusiasm of the Pueblo for continuing \nits excellent stewardship of the Blue Lake Wilderness.\n  The Wilderness Society, Audubon Society, Sierra Club, and the \nNational Wildlife Federation support the return of the Bottleneck to \nTaos Pueblo.\n  Under the terms of this legislation, Taos Pueblo will hold the \nresponsibility and right to manage and control the entire Blue Lake \nTerritory. The Bottleneck Tract is currently a part of the Wheeler Peak \nWilderness Area in the Carson National Forest, New Mexico, and is \nmanaged by the Forest Service. Taos Pueblo lands surround the \nBottleneck on three sides (east, south, and west). Unfortunately, \npublic access to this Bottleneck tract leads to unwelcome intrusions. \nDuring Indian ceremonials, hikers often find their way into the Blue \nLake Wilderness Area. Our bill will resolve this and related problems \nin favor of the Taos Pueblo. There will no longer be questions of \nownership or rights of way, and the Pueblo will be responsible for \nmanagement of the entire Blue Lake area including the Bottleneck Tract \nadded by this legislation.\n  The Bottleneck Tract, is currently managed by the Forest Service as a \nscenic overlook. Taos Pueblo leaders are issued permits and the Forest \nService closes the area for their pilgrimages. There are no public \ncamping, fishing, or other recreational uses permitted. Hiking is \nallowed.\n  It is the intention of Taos Pueblo, under the terms of this bill, to \ncontinue to use these lands for traditional purposes only. These uses \ninclude religious and ceremonial pilgrimages, hunting and fishing, a \nsource of water, forage for their domestic livestock, timber, and other \nnatural resources for their personal use. These uses are all subject to \nsuch regulations for conservation purposes as the Secretary of the \nInterior may prescribe as managed by the Taos Pueblo under the terms of \nthe Blue Lake wilderness legislation.\n  There is no intention in our legislation to change any water rights \nassociated with the Blue Lake area or the Taos Pueblo. I have \npersonally discussed this issue with the Taos tribal leaders who have \nassured me that the return of the Bottleneck will not alter their \nclaims to water in the Taos Valley. There will be no adverse impact on \ndownstream water users in the Taos Valley as a result of passage of \nthis legislation. In fact, I remain optimistic about the on-going water \nnegotiations in the Taos Valley and look forward to working with all \nparties to ratify a negotiated settlement in the Congress.\n  It is our intention that the lands shall remain forever wild and \nmaintained as a wilderness. Identical legislation is being introduced \nin the House by Representative Richardson of New Mexico. We urge our \ncolleagues to support our legislation to transfer the last parcel of \nthe Blue Lake Wilderness to the Taos Pueblo Indians of New Mexico.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. JOHNSTON:\n  S. 167. A bill to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I am today introducing \nlegislation to amend the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  The existing law was meant to provide for the permanent disposal of \nspent nuclear fuel from the Nation's civilian nuclear powerplants and \nhigh-level radioactive waste from our nuclear weapons program. It \ncalled for the construction of a deep geologic repository in which \nnuclear waste could safely be buried beginning in January 1998.\n  The existing law has fallen far short of its goals. The repository \nwill not be ready in 1998. The earliest completion date is now 2010, \nbut it may not be ready even then without significant program changes \nand budget increases. In the meantime, available storage capacity at \ncivilian powerplants is running out, threatening the ability of some \nplants to keep operating.\n  The existing program was designated to be self-funding. The law \nimposed a special fee on utilities, which is ultimately borne by their \nratepayers. The American people have paid over $8 billion into the \nNuclear Waste Fund. Over $4 billion has been spent, but our budget laws \nput the balance of the fund off-limits, where it can be used to balance \nthe deficit but not used for the purpose for which it was collected.\n  Mr. President, the program cannot succeed as it is presently \nconstituted. The time has come to restructure the program so it can \nsucceed. This bill I am introducing today would do so.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1995 provides a complete substitute \nto the 1982 law. It provides for the construction of an interim storage \nfacility, which would provide adequate spent fuel storage capacity \nuntil the repository can be built and licensed. It places the existing \nrepository program on sounder foundations by providing rational, \nhealth-based standards for licensing the repository. It provides \nauthority for the Department of Energy to begin construction of the \nrail spur needed to transport nuclear waste to the interim storage \nfacility and repository. And it provides special budget treatment for \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund to ensure that the program will be able to use \nthe funds that are now being collected for that purpose.\n  [[Page S497]] Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important legislation, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 167\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n     SECTION 1.

In the event the Secretary determines that either \n     insufficient or excess revenues are being collected, in order \n     to recover the costs incurred by the Federal Government that \n     are specified in subsection (d), the Secretary shall propose \n     an adjustment to the fee to ensure full cost recovery. The \n     Secretary shall immediately transit this proposal for such an \n     adjustment to Congress. The adjusted fee proposed by the \n     Secretary shall be effective after a period of 90 days of \n     continuous session have elapsed following the receipt of such \n     transmittal unless during such 90-day period either House of \n     Congress adopts a resolution disapproving their Secretary's \n     proposed adjustment in accordance with the procedures set \n     forth for congressional review of an energy action under \n     section 551 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.\n       (5) Contracts entered into under this section shall provide \n     that--\n       (A) following commencements of operation of a repository, \n     the Secretary shall take title to the high-level radioactive \n     waste or spent nuclear fuel involved as expeditiously as \n     practicable upon the request of the generator or owner of \n     such waste or spent fuel; and\n       (B) in return for the payment of fees established by this \n     section, the Secretary, beginning not later than January 31, \n     1998, will dispose of the high-level radioactive waste or \n     spent nuclear fuel involved as provided in title I.\n       (6) The Secretary shall establish in writing criteria \n     setting forth the terms and conditions under which such \n     disposal services shall be made available.\n       (b) Advance Contracting Requirement.--(1)(A) The Commission \n     shall not issue or renew a license to any person to use a \n     utilization or production facility under the authority of \n     section 103 or 104 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 \n     U.S.C. 2133, 2134) unless--\n       (1) such person has entered into a contract with the \n     Secretary under this section; or\n       (ii) the Secretary affirms in writing that such person is \n     actively and in good faith negotiating with the Secretary for \n     a contract under this section.\n       (B) The Commission, as it deems necessary or appropriate, \n     may require as a precondition to the issuance or renewal of a \n     license under section 103 or 104 of the Atomic Energy Act of \n     1954 (42 U.S.C. 2133, 2134) that the applicant for such \n     license shall have entered into an agreement with the \n     Secretary for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste \n     and spent nuclear fuel that may result from the use of such \n     license.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (1), no spent nuclear \n     fuel or high-level radioactive waste generated or owned by \n     any person (other than a department of the United States \n     referred to in section 101 or 102 of title 5, United States \n     Code) may be disposed of by the Secretary in any repository \n     constructed under this Act unless the generator or owner of \n     such spent fuel or waste has entered into a contract with the \n     Secretary under this section by not later than--\n       (A) June 30, 1983; or\n       (B) the date on which such generator or owner commences \n     generation of, or takes title to, such spent fuel or waste; \n     whichever occurs later.\n       (3) The rights and duties of a party to a contract entered \n     into under this section may be assignable with transfer of \n     title to the spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive \n     waste involved.\n       (4) No high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel \n     generated or owned by any department of the United States \n     referred to in \n     [[Page S501]] section 101 or 102 of title 5, United States \n     Code, may be disposed of by the Secretary in any repository \n     constructed under this Act unless such department transfers \n     to the Secretary, for deposit in the Nuclear Waste Fund, \n     amounts equivalent to the fees that would be paid to the \n     Secretary under the contracts referred to in this section if \n     such waste or spent fuel were generated by any other person.\n       (c) Establishment of Nuclear Waste Fund.--There hereby is \n     established in the Treasury of the United States a separate \n     fund, to be known as the Nuclear Waste Fund. The Waste Fund \n     shall consist of--\n       (1) all receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the \n     Secretary under subsections (a),(b), and (e), which shall be \n     deposited in the Waste Fund immediately upon their \n     realization;\n       (2) any appropriations made by the Congress to the Waste \n     Fund; and\n  (3) any unexpended balances available on the date of the enactment of \nthis Act for functions or activities necessary or incident to the \ndisposal of civilian high-level radioactive waste or civilian spent \nnuclear fuel, which shall automatically be transferred to the Waste \nFund on such date.\n       (d) Use of Waste Fund.--The Secretary may make expenditures \n     from the Waste Fund, subject to subsection (e), only for \n     purposes of radioactive waste disposal activities under \n     titles I and II, including--\n       (1) the identification, development, licensing, \n     construction, operation, decommissioning, and post-\n     decommissioning maintenance and monitoring of the interim \n     storage facility or repository constructed under this Act;\n       (2) the conducting of nongeneric research, development, and \n     demonstration activities under this Act;\n       (3) the administrative cost of the radioactive waste \n     disposal program;\n       (4) any costs that may be incurred by the Secretary in \n     connection with the transportation, treating, or packaging of \n     spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive waste to be \n     disposed of in the repository or to be stored in the interim \n     storage facility, including the cost of designing and \n     procuring multi-purpose canisters under section 201 and the \n     cost of constructing and operating rail systems under section \n     202;\n       (5) the costs associated with acquisition, design, \n     modification, replacement, operation, and construction of \n     facilities at the repository of interim storage facility; and \n     necessary or incident to such repository or interim storage \n     facility; and\n       (6) the provision of assistance to the State of Nevada, and \n     affected units of local government under section 204.\n       (e) Administration of Waste Fund.--(1) The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall hold the Waste Fund and, after consultation \n     with the Secretary, annually report to the Congress on the \n     financial condition and operations of the Waste Fund during \n     the preceding fiscal year.\n       (2) The Secretary shall submit the budget of the Waste Fund \n     to the Office of Management and Budget triennially along with \n     the budget of the Department of Energy submitted at such time \n     in accordance with chapter 11 of title 31, United States \n     Code. The budget of the Waste Fund shall consist of the \n     estimates made by the Secretary of expenditures from the \n     Waste Fund and other relevant financial matters for the \n     succeeding 3 fiscal years, and shall be included in the \n     Budget of the United States Government. The Secretary may \n     make expenditures from the Waste Fund, subject to \n     appropriations which shall remain available until expended. \n     Appropriations shall be subject to triennial authorization.\n       (3) If the Secretary determines that the Waste Fund \n     contains at any time amounts in excess of current needs, the \n     Secretary may request the Secretary of the Treasury to invest \n     such amounts, or any portion of such amounts as the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate, in obligations of the United \n     States--\n       (A) having maturities determined by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury to be appropriate to the needs of the Waste Fund; \n     and\n       (B) bearing interest at rates determined to be appropriate \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration \n     the current average market yield on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States with remaining periods to \n     maturity comparable to the maturities of such investments, \n     except that the interest rate on such investments shall not \n     exceed the average interest rate applicable to existing \n     borrowings.\n       (4) Receipts, proceeds, and recoveries realized by the \n     Secretary under this section, and expenditures of amounts \n     from the Waste Fund, shall be exempt from annual \n     apportionment under the provisions of subchapter II of \n     chapter 15 of title 31, United States Code.\n       (5) If at any time the moneys available in the Waste Fund \n     are insufficient to enable the Secretary to discharge his \n     responsibilities under this subtitle, the Secretary shall \n     issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations in such \n     forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject \n     to such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the \n     Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. The total of \n     such obligations shall not exceed amounts provided in \n     appropriation Acts. Redemption of such obligations shall be \n     made by the Secretary from moneys available in the Waste \n     Fund. Such obligations shall bear interest at a rate \n     determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, which shall be \n     not less than a rate determined by taking into consideration \n     the average market yield on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States of comparable maturities \n     during the month preceding the issuance of the obligations \n     under this paragraph. The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     purchase any issued obligations, and for such purpose the \n     Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public \n     debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities \n     issued under chapter 31 of title 31, United States Code, and \n     the purposes for which securities may be issued under such \n     Act are extended to include any purchase of such obligations. \n     The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the \n     obligations acquired by him under this paragraph. All \n     redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury of obligations under this paragraph shall be treated \n     as public debt transactions of the United States.\n       (6) Any appropriations made available to the Waste Fund for \n     any purpose described in subsection (d) shall be repaid into \n     the general fund of the Treasury, together with interest from \n     the date of availability of the appropriations until the date \n     of repayment. Such interest shall be paid on the cumulative \n     amount of appropriations available to the Waste Fund, less \n     the average undisbursed cash balance in the Waste Fund \n     account during the fiscal year involved. The rate of such \n     interest shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     taking into\n      consideration the average market yield during the month \n     preceding each fiscal year on outstanding marketable \n     obligations of the United States of comparable maturity. \n     Interest payments may be deferred with the approval of the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, but any interest payments so \n     deferred shall themselves bear interest.\n\n     SEC. 303.

A bill to ensure individual and family security through \nhealth insurance coverage for all Americans; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n            the affordable health care for all Americans act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the crisis in health care has not gone \naway, but hopefully the partisan gridlock that blocked action last year \nhas. Our failure to enact comprehensive reform in 1994 guarantees that \nthis crisis will worsen every year, until Congress finally has the \ncourage to pass a genuine solution.\n  Last year, despite the economic recovery, the number of Americans \nwithout health insurance increased by 1 million. This year, the number \nof uninsured is certain to increase again. The rise in national health \nspending was close to $100 billion last year, and total spending will \ntop $1 trillion this year. The main reason the Federal deficit is \nsoaring is that out-of-control health costs continue to drive up \nMedicare and Medicaid spending faster than anything else in the budget. \nNo American family can be confident that the insurance protecting them \ntoday will be there for them tomorrow if serious illness strikes.\n  Last year, we had the most extensive debate in the Nation's history \non comprehensive reform. Committees in both the House and Senate \nreported out measures that met the two key tests of \n[[Page S504]] real reform--guaranteed health insurance for all \nAmericans and control of health costs. For the first time, \ncomprehensive reform legislation was debated on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. In the end we were not successful in passing health reform, but \nthe American people expect us to keep trying until we succeed.\n  Today I am introducing new legislation to achieve the central goals \nof reform--the Affordable Health Care for All Americans Act. This \nlegislation builds on what we accomplished in the last Congress, while \nresponding to the criticisms of the various bills proposed.\n  This legislation will guarantee every American comprehensive, \naffordable coverage, and it will control health care costs. All \nemployers will be expected to contribute to the cost of coverage for \ntheir employees, except for mom and pop small businesses. Subsidies \nwill be provided to help low-income workers and the unemployed. Costs \nwill be controlled by market forces and by improved competition among \ninsurers and providers, with tough backup premium limits in cases where \ncompetition fails.\n  At the same time, the legislation responds to criticisms made in the \nlast Congress that the bills reported by the committees tried to do too \nmuch and were excessively regulatory and bureaucratic. The legislation \nI am introducing today is one-third the length of the bill reported by \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee in the last Congress. It does \nnot include proposals that are desirable but that can be considered \nmore carefully on a separate legislative track. It eliminates most new \nboards and commissions, and it adopts, in large measure, the market \nreform and oversight structure included in last year's bipartisan \nmainstream proposal.\n  This legislation will guarantee affordable, comprehensive health care \nfor every citizen through a system of shared responsibility among \nindividuals, businesses, and the Government. Employers are required to \ncontribute to the cost of insurance for their employees and their \nfamilies, and individuals are expected to contribute to the cost of \ntheir own coverage and the coverage of their dependents. Subsidies are \nprovided for low-income workers and the unemployed.\n  This measure also provides assistance to businesses for the cost of \ncovering low-wage workers, with greater assistance for smaller, low-\nwage businesses that have the most difficulty in affording a full \ncontribution to the cost. In addition, small businesses with 10 workers\n or less and below average wages are exempt from the requirements, and \nspecial help is provided to assure affordability for the employees of \nthese businesses. One hundred percent tax deductibility is provided for \nhealth insurance premiums paid by the self-employed. People who now \nrely on Medicaid for coverage of acute care services will participate \nin the same private health insurance system as all other Americans. \nInsurance reforms eliminate preexisting condition exclusion and provide \nguaranteed issue and renewability at affordable prices.\n\n  Elderly Americans and disabled Americans will benefit from \nsubstantial provisions on long-term home care and community care. The \nbill closes the greatest current gap in Medicare by providing \nprescription drug coverage. It also establishes a new, voluntary \nprogram of insurance against the high cost of nursing home care. Such \ninsurance will be available at a reasonable price to anyone 35 or \nolder.\n  The bill controls health care costs by improving the health care \nmarket. Reforms here will require insurers to complete by providing \ncare more efficiently and effectively, rather than by trying to insure \nonly those least likely to get sick. The bill relies primarily on \ncompetition to hold down spending, but it also recognizes that \nexcessive inflation is deeply embedded in the health care system and \nthat competition will work more quickly in some health care markets \nthan others. A backup system of premium limits is included in case \ncompetition forces are ineffective in restraining inflation. A reform \nof medical malpractice is also included.\n  Finally, the bill recognizes that an insurance card alone is not \nenough to assure access or protect quality. Increased funding is \nprovided to assure the viability of the Nation's teaching hospitals, to \nexpand access to care through community health centers and school \nhealth clinics, and to support biomedical research.\n  The bill is financed without broad-based new taxes. The basic \nfinancing comes from premiums paid by individuals and businesses, as is \nthe case today. The subsidies for low-income individuals and small \nbusinesses are financed by lower rates of increase and other savings in \nexisting government health programs and by an increase in the cigarette \ntax.\n  To respond to criticisms that the bills in the last Congress tried to \ndo too much, the legislation focuses only on those aspects of last \nyear's bills that are truly central to reform. Proposals that are \ndesirable but less essential have been eliminated from the bill, such \nas those dealing with administrative simplification, privacy, health \ncare fraud and abuse, new regulation of private long-term care \ninsurance, and new remedies for disputes between insurance companies \nand individuals.\n  Most important, this legislation eliminates much of what was \ncriticized as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. A great deal of \nthis criticism each disingenuous, but we have made a new effort to \neliminate unnecessary burdens on individuals, businesses, and State \ngovernments. The insurance reform and oversight is based on the \nproposal developed by the bipartisan mainstream group. Most of the new \nboard and commissions created in the earlier bills have been dropped, \nand essential functions given to existing agencies. The standard \nbenefit package has been eliminated and replaced by a test of actuarial \nequivalency to the insurance program that protects most Members of \nCongress, with assurances of attention to high priority needs. \nMandatory health alliances have been eliminated in favor of voluntary \nhealth insurance purchasing cooperatives, and the size of businesses \nrequired to participate in the community rating pool has been reduced \nto 100 employees or fewer.\n  Obviously, this legislation will be modified as it moves through \nCongress. But I believe it builds effectively on the progress we made \nin the last 2 years, without sacrificing fundamental goals.\n  All industrialized countries in the world except South Africa and the \nUnited States guarantee health care as a basic right for all citizens. \nThe American people deserve the same health security, and it is time \nfor Congress to provide it.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 170.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of alcoholism and drug dependency residential \ntreatment services for pregnant women and certain family members under \nthe Medicaid Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n      FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME AND FETAL ALCOHOL EFFECT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the \nComprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act and the Medicaid \nSubstance Abuse Treatment Act, legislation that will enhance our \nnational effort to eliminate the tragic problem of Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome [FAS] and the related condition known as Fetal Alcohol Effect \n[FAE].\n  FAS-FAE constitute the leading cause of mental retardation in the \nUnited States today. Although both conditions are completely \npreventable simply by abstaining from the consumption of alcohol during \npregnancy, many people unfortunately do not realize the dangers of \ndrinking while pregnant. The Office for Substance Abuse Prevention \nestimates that as many as 66 percent of all women drink while they are \npregnant, endangering their infants' health and putting them at risk of \nbeing born with FAS or FAE.\n  [[Page S505]] Misconceptions about the impact of alcohol intake \nduring pregnancy are not limited to the general public, however. Even \nsome health care providers are unaware of the danger of drinking during \npregnancy, and for many years it was widely held that moderate alcohol \nconsumption during pregnancy was beneficial.\n  There are approximately 5,000 children born each year in the United \nStates with FAS. It is estimated that the incidence of FAS is as high \nas 1 per 100 in some Native American communities. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention estimates that the lifetime cost of \ntreating an individual with FAS is almost $1.4 million. The total cost \nin terms of health care and social services to treat all Americans with \nFAS is close to $1.6 billion each year. This is an extraordinary and \nunnecessary expense, given the fact that FAS is 100 percent \npreventable.\n  The first step toward eliminating this devastating disease is raising \nthe public's consciousness about FAS-FAE. Although great strides have \nbeen made in this regard, much more work remains to be done. The \nComprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act attempts to fill in \nthe gaps in our current FAS-FAE prevention system. It contains four \nmajor components, representing the provisions of the original \nlegislation that have not yet been enacted. These provisions include \nthe initiaion of a coordinated education and public awareness campaign; \nincreased support for basic and applied epidemiologic research into the \ncauses, treatment and prevention of FAS-FAE; widespread dissemination \nof FAS-FAE diagnostic criteria; and the establishment of an interagency \ntask force to coordinate the wide range of Federal efforts in combating \nFAS--FAE. I ask that a summary of the bill be inserted into the Record \nfollowing the completion of my remarks.\n  A prevention strategy cannot succeed in the absence of increased \naccess to comprehensive treatment programs for pregnant addicted women \nso that women and their children can access care. Many pregnant \nsubstance abusers are denied treatment because facilities refuse to \naccept them, or the women cannot accept treatment because they lack \nadequate child care for their children while\n they receive treatment. In fact, many treatment programs specifically \nexclude pregnant women or women with children. To make matters worse, \nwhile Medicaid covers some services associated with substance abuse, \nlike outpatient treatment and detoxification, it fails to cover \nresidential treatment, which is considered by most health care \nprofessionals to be the most effective method of overcoming addiction.\n\n  The Medicaid Substance Abuse Treatment Act would permit coverage of \nresidential alcohol and drug treatment for pregnant women and certain \nfamily members under the Medicaid Program, thereby assuring a stable \nsource of funding for States that wish to establish these programs. The \nbill has three primary objectives. First, it would facilitate the \nparticipation of pregnant women who are substance abusers in alcohol \nand drug treatment programs. Second, by increasing the availability of \ncomprehensive and effective treatment programs for pregnant women and, \nthus, improving a woman's chances of bearing healthy children, it would \nhelp combat the serious and evergrowing problem of drug-impaired \ninfants and children, many of whom are born with FAS and FAE. And, \nthird, it would address the unique situation of pregnant addicted \nnative American and Alaska Native women in Indian Health Service areas.\n  Mr. President, the cost of prevention is substantially less than the \ndownstream costs in money and human capital of caring for children and \nadults who have been impaired due to prenatal exposure to alcohol and \ndrugs. These prevention and treatment services are an investment that \nyields substantial long-term dividends--both on a societal level, as \nwelfare dependence by substance abusers and their children is reduced, \nand on an individual level, as mothers plagued by alcohol and drug \naddiction are given the means to heal, for themselves and their unborn \nchildren.\n  FAS and FAE represent a national tragedy that reaches across economic \nand social boundaries. The demand for a comprehensive and determined \nresponse to this devastating problem is clear. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport these measures, and am hopeful that, with widespread support, \nwe can enact this important legislation without delay. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of both bills and a summary be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Comprehensive Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading known cause of \n     mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;\n       (2) each year, more than 5,000 infants are born in the \n     United States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering \n     irreversible physical and mental damage;\n       (3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects, which are lesser, though still serious, \n     alcohol-related birth defects;\n       (4) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects are \n     national problems which can impact any child, family, or \n     community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is especially alarming;\n       (5) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol \n     dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a \n     newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects are 30 times greater than national averages;\n       (6) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and \n     their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, \n     including the costs of health care, education, foster care, \n     job training, and general support services for affected \n     individuals;\n       (7) as a reliable comparison, delivery and care costs are \n     four times greater for infants who were exposed to illicit \n     substances than for infants with no indication of substance \n     exposure, and over a lifetime, health care costs for one \n     Fetal Alcohol Syndrome child are estimated to be at least \n     $1,400,000;\n       (8) researchers have determined that the possibility of \n     giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects increases in proportion to the amount and \n     frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that \n     stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy \n     reduces the risks and the emotional, physical, and mental \n     consequences of alcohol exposure to the baby; and\n       (9) we know of no safe dose of alcohol during pregnancy, or \n     of any safe time to drink during pregnancy, thus, it is in \n     the best interest of the Nation for the Federal Government to \n     take an active role in encouraging all women to abstain from \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       It is the purpose of this Act to establish, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services, a comprehensive \n     program to help prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n     Alcohol Effects nationwide. Such program shall--\n       (1) coordinate, support, and conduct basic and applied \n     epidemiologic research concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and \n     Fetal Alcohol Effects;\n       (2) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and \n     community-based public awareness, prevention, and education \n     programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects; \n     and\n       (3) foster coordination among all Federal agencies that \n     conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol \n     Effects research, programs, and surveillance and otherwise \n     meet the general needs of populations actually or potentially \n     impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effects.\n\n     SEC. 4.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) a woman's ability to bear healthy children is \n     threatened by the consequences of alcoholism and drug \n     addiction;\n       (2) an estimated 375,000 infants each year are born drug-\n     exposed, at least 5,000 infants are born each year with fetal \n     alcohol syndrome, and another 35,000 are born each year with \n     fetal alcohol effect, a less severe version of fetal alcohol \n     syndrome;\n       (3) drug use during pregnancy can result in low \n     birthweight, physical deformities, mental retardation, \n     learning disabilities, and heightened nervousness and \n     irritability in newborns;\n       (4) fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading identifiable \n     cause of mental retardation in the United States and the only \n     cause that is 100 percent preventable;\n       (5) drug-impaired individuals pose extraordinary societal \n     costs in terms of medical, educational, foster care, \n     residential, and support services over the lifetimes of such \n     individuals;\n       (6) women, in general, are underrepresented in drug and \n     alcohol treatment programs;\n       (7) due to fears among service providers concerning the \n     risks pregnancies pose, pregnant women face more obstacles to \n     substance abuse treatment than do other addicts and many \n     substance abuse treatment programs, in fact, exclude pregnant \n     women or women with children;\n       (8) alcohol and drug treatment is an important prevention \n     strategy to prevent low birthweight, transmission of AIDS, \n     and chronic physical, mental, and emotional disabilities \n     associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol and other drugs;\n       (9) effective substance abuse treatment must address the \n     special needs of pregnant women who are alcohol or drug \n     dependent, including substance-abusing women who may often \n     face such problems as domestic violence, incest and other \n     sexual abuse, poor housing, poverty, unemployment, lack of \n     education and job skills, lack of access to health care, \n     emotional problems, chemical dependency in their family \n     backgrounds, single parenthood, and the need to ensure child \n     care for existing children while undergoing substance abuse \n     treatment;\n       (10) nonhospital residential treatment is an important \n     component of comprehensive and effective substance abuse \n     treatment for pregnant addicted women, many of whom need \n     long-term, intensive habilitation outside of their \n     communities to recover from their addiction and take care of \n     themselves and their families; and\n       (11) a gap exists under the medicaid program for the \n     financing of comprehensive residential care in the existing \n     continuum of medicaid-covered alcoholism and drug abuse \n     treatment services for low-income pregnant addicted women.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase the ability of pregnant women who are \n     substance abusers to participate in alcohol and drug \n     treatment;\n       (2) to ensure the availability of comprehensive and \n     effective treatment programs for pregnant women, thus \n     promoting a woman's ability to bear healthy children;\n       (3) to ensure that nonhospital residential treatment is \n     available to those low-income pregnant addicted women who \n     need long-term, intensive habilitation to recover from their \n     addiction;\n       (4) to create a new optional medicaid residential treatment \n     service for alcoholism and drug dependency treatment; and\n       (5) to define the core services that must be provided by \n     treatment providers to ensure \n     [[Page S507]] that needed services will be available and \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 3.

This bill would create an Inter-Agency Task Force \n     to coordinate federal efforts and report on an annual basis \n     to the Secretary of HHS and to relevant congressional \n     committees. The panel will include representatives from the \n     Departments of HHS, Agriculture, Education, Defense, \n     Interior, Justice, and Veterans Affairs; from the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; from the Federal Trade \n     Commission; and from any other relevant Federal agency.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, in reintroducing the \nComprehensive Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act. Through this \nlegislation, we are proposing a comprehensive, coordinated, national \neffort to prevent one of the leading causes of birth defects in this \ncountry: Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\n  The need for this legislation is well documented. Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome [FAS] is the Nation's primary known cause of mental \nretardation; yet it is completely preventable. According to a 1993 \nreport issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nnumber of reported FAS cases has tripled over the past decade. The CDC \nreports that in 1992, nearly 4 infants out of every 10,000 births were \nborn with FAS, suffering irreversible physical and mental harm. In \n1979, the first year CDC collected information on the incidence of \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome, it estimated the number of reported FAS cases \nat only 1 per 10,000 births. Adding to the extent of the problem are \nestimates which indicate that each year 10,000 to 12,000 infants are \nborn with lesser, though still serious, alcohol-related birth defects \nknown as Fetal Alcohol Effects [FAE].\n  In my home State of New Mexico, the number of infants born with FAS \nhas exceeded the national average for a number of years. Each year, \nmore than 36 babies are born in New Mexico with FAS, and more than 80 \nare born with FAE. Some experts believe our FAS rate has been \nconsistently higher than the national average because our doctors, who \nhave benefitted from a significant amount of State-based FAS research, \nare more familiar with its signs and symptoms.\n  If this is true, then nationally the number of FAS and FAE births \ncould be higher than today's estimates. In fact, the CDC believes this \nto be the case. According to Dr. David Erickson, the chief of the CDC's \nBirth Defects and Genetic Diseases branch, the new CDC count--which we \nneed to remember is a threefold increase over the 1979 estimate--\nprobably is a substantial undercount. It is an undercount for a number \nof reasons, but chief among them is undoubtedly lack of awareness.\n  Although the exact number of infants and families impacted by FAS and \nFAE is not entirely certain, there is no question that Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome is a national problem. It can impact any child, any family, \nand any community. But I am especially troubled about the threat FAS \nposes to the Navajo, Apache, and Pueblo children and families in New \nMexico and to American Indians throughout the Nation.\n  New Mexico health officials estimate that the combined FAS rate for \nour State's 22 Indian Tribes is two to five times that of the national \naverage. According to the Indian Health Service, the prevalence of FAS \nis significantly higher among American Indians and Alaska Natives than \nnationally. I have been told that in some American Indian and Alaska \nNative communities, as many as one in four newborns may be affected by \nFAS or FAE.\n  Mr. President, the real tragedy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \nAlcohol Effects is that both are completely preventable. Not one more \ninfant would be born with FAS or FAE if every pregnancy was an alcohol-\nfree pregnancy. If we could get the message out that alcohol and \npregnancy do not mix, if we could explain the compelling need for every \nmother to stay away from alcoholic beverages while she is pregnant, \nthen we could eliminate this disease. The key is prevention through \neducation.\n  Prevention through education is the cornerstone of the Comprehensive \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome Prevention Act. As I mentioned earlier, this \nbill will create a comprehensive, coordinated program within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to help prevent FAS and FAE. \nSpecifically, this bill:\n  Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: coordinate and \nsupport national and targeted public awareness, prevention, and \neducation programs on FAS-FAE; coordinate and support basic and applied \nepidemiologic research on FAS-FAE; assist states in establishing FAS-\nFAE surveillance programs; focus efforts on the needs of at-risk \npopulations, and American Indians and Alaska Natives in particular.\n  Establishes an Inter-Agency Task Force on FAS-FAE: to coordinate all \nFederal agencies that conduct or support FAS-FAE research, programs, \nand surveillance or otherwise meet the general needs of populations \nactually or potentially impacted by FAS-FAE.\n  I believe one of the most important provisions of this bill is the \nsection that would help states and local communities develop targeted \ncampaigns to increase public awareness of the symptoms and impact for \npreventing FAS and FAE. The central focus of every campaign will be \nclear, effective, and culturally-sensitive methods and messages for FAS \nand FAE prevention. Initially, Federal efforts will focus on the needs \nof at-risk populations, and in particular, American Indians and Alaska \nNatives.\n  I urge my colleagues to study this legislation and lend it their \nsupport. As I mentioned earlier, FAS knows no boundaries. It can, and \ndoes, impact children and families in every State in this country. It \nis a problem so pervasive, yet so readily preventable, that it requires \na broad-based, concerted, and coordinated effort for elimination.\n  Existing FAS-FAE prevention programs need increased funding, and we \nneed to work to make this happen. But money alone is not the answer. We \nneed a firm commitment from the Federal Government, the States, local \ngovernments, Indian tribes, schools, community-based organizations, and \nfamilies to assume responsibility and work together, in a coordinated \nmanner, for the benefit of our children. If we have this commitment, we \ncan improve the quality of life for children already afflicted with \nFAS, and we can put an end to this terrible, and 100-percent \npreventable, disease.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HEFLIN:\n  S.J.Res. 13. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution to provide for a balanced budget for the United States \nGovernment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            BALANCED FEDERAL BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, as in morning business, I would like to \nintroduce legislation to amend the U.S. Constitution to require the \nFederal Government to achieve and maintain a balanced budget. I have \nintroduced in each Congress, at the beginning, a similar joint \nresolution during the time that I have served in the U.S. Senate. I \nmight say that the first bill, or resolution--the first legislative act \nthat I introduced when I came to the Senate was to introduce a bill for \na constitutional amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget.\n  I believe the opportunity to adopt this legislatively and to submit \nit to the States for ratification is now at hand. In 1982, the Senate \ndebated it at great length and a vote was taken and there were 69 \nvotes. As Members of the Senate know, a constitutional amendment \nrequiring a balanced budget requires a two-thirds vote. So there were \ntwo additional votes over the required number back in 1982. Since that \ntime, we have had three votes in the Senate relative to the \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. One year there \nwas one vote shy, which was 66 votes. And then on another occasion we \ngot 63 votes.\n  In each of the occasions in which the Senate has acted pertaining to \nthe constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the House has \nfailed to pass it by the required two-thirds vote. But this time I \nbelieve the House will pass it. Regarding the last time when we got 63 \nvotes, I believe if the House had not acted before the Senate, the \nSenate would have voted the required two-thirds vote at that time. This \nmeasure has been around for a long time. It has narrowly missed its \nmark in the past, but I believe it will meet the mark of a two-thirds \nvote in the Senate and in the House this year.\n  It is also particularly important that we go ahead and act now. \nInterest rates are going up. A major portion of the \n[[Page S510]] budget each year deals with debt service. If interest \nrates were to double, then you can see that the amount of money that \nwill be required to pay debt service will be doubled also. And so it is \nimportant that we go ahead and act soon to provide the necessary fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  It has been 33 years since the Government of the United States has \noperated on a balanced budget. Most of the States have provisions that \nrequire a balanced budget, and it provides the discipline which is \nneeded relative to Government operations and fiscal restraint.\n  So it is my pleasure again today to offer a bill or resolution which \nis quite similar to the resolutions which I am cosponsoring with other \nSenators, including Senator Hatch. I want to congratulate Senator Hatch \non his leadership in moving forward. He has a hearing set today \nrelative to resolutions requiring a balanced budget which has a group \nof very distinguished Americans, a lot of former Attorneys General, and \nothers, who will be testifying at that particular time.\n  So I think it is important that we move forward and we move forward \nas fast as we can. So I send to the desk at this time a resolution \nrequiring it.\n  Mr. President, the time has finally come to pass this legislation and \nsend it to the States for ratification. This amendment is not a \ngimmick, nor is it chicanery; it is good common sense.\n  Since I first came to the Senate in 1979, every Congress I have \nintroduced legislation proposing a constitutional amendment to balance \nthe Federal budget, and I have dedicated myself to many years of work \nwith my colleagues to adopt a resolution which would authorize the \nsubmission to the States for ratification of a constitutional amendment \nto require a balanced budget.\n  For much of our Nation's history, a balanced Federal budget was the \nstatus quo and part of our unwritten constitution. For our first 100 \nyears, this country carried a surplus budget, but in recent years this \nNation's spending has gone out of control. Indeed, the fiscal \nirresponsibility demonstrated over the years has convinced me that \nconstitutional discipline is the only way we can achieve the goal of \nreducing deficits.\n  As you know, in 1982, the Senate did pass, by more than the required \ntwo-thirds vote, a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced \nbudget. There were 69 votes in favor of it at that time. It was sent to \nthe House of Representatives, where, in the House Judiciary Committee \nit was bottled up. The chairman would not allow it to come up for a \ncommittee vote, in order that it might be reported to the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  In order to bring the measure up for a vote in the House of \nRepresentatives, it was necessary to file a discharge petition. This is \na petition that has to be signed by more than a majority of the whole \nnumber of the House of Representatives, and then it is brought up and \nvoted on without amendment. The Senate-passed amendment failed to \nobtain the necessary two-thirds vote that was required in the House of \nRepresentatives at that time.\n  In the 99th Congress, after extensive debate, passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment by the Senate failed by one vote--but got 66 votes. \nDuring the 101st Congress, I supported a measure which passed the \nJudiciary Committee, but it was never considered by the full Senate. In \nthe 102d Congress, the Judiciary Committee favorably reported a bill, \nbut since an amendment failed to pass the House by the necessary two-\nthirds vote, this killed the possibility of favorable action by the \nSenate.\n  In the 103d Congress, the Senate again narrowly defeated an \namendment, which I cosponsored, by a vote of 63-37--only four votes \nshort of the 67 votes needed for passage. If the recent elections tell \nus anything, it is that the American people want a leaner, more \nefficient Federal Government and a government that lives within its \nmeans.\n  Mr. President, I hope the time has come to finally adopt this long-\noverdue amendment and begin to move toward our goal of a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  Section 1 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote of each House \nof Congress before the Federal Government can engage in deficit \nspending. A 60-percent vote in the Senate is a very difficult one to \nobtain. This requirement should establish the norm that spending will \nnot exceed receipts in any fiscal year. If the government is going to \nspend money, it should have the money on hand to pay its bills.\n  Section 2 of the amendment requires a three-fifths vote by both \nHouses of Congress to raise the national debt. In addition to the \nthree-fifths vote, Congress must provide ``by law'' for an increase in \npublic debt. As I understand it, this means presentment to the \nPresident, where the President has the right to veto or sign. If the \nPresident chose to veto the bill, it would be returned to Congress for \naction to possibly override the veto. It is also important to note that \nsection one, regarding the specific excess of outlays over receipts, \ncontains this same requirement that Congress act ``by law.''\n  Section 2 is important because it functions as an ``enforcement \nmechanism'' for the balanced budget amendment. While section 1 states \noutright that ``total outlays * * * shall not exceed total receipts'' \nwithout the three-fifths authorization by Congress, the judicial branch \nwould lack the ability to order the legislative and executive branches \nto meet this obligation. Therefore, section 2 will require a three-\nfifths vote to increase the national debt. This provision will increase \nthe pressure to comply with the directive of this proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Other than just being directory, the amendment, by way of section 2, \nhas some teeth and that is what is so important if we are going to do \naway with deficit spending and operate so that we do not spend any more \nmoney than the amount coming into the government. That is what we are \ntrying to achieve here.\n  Section 3 provides for the submission by the President of a balanced \nbudget to Congress. This section reflects the belief that sound fiscal \nplanning should be a shared governmental responsibility by the \nPresident as well as the Congress.\n  Section 4 of the amendment requires a majority vote of the whole \nnumber of each House of Congress any time Congress votes to increase \nrevenues. This holds public officials responsible, and puts elected \nofficials on record for any tax increase which may be necessary to \nsupport Federal spending.\n  Section 5 of the amendment permits a waiver of the provisions for any \nfiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. This section \nalso contains a provision long-supported by myself--that of allowing a \nwaiver in cases of less than an outright declaration of war--where the \nUnited States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent \nand serious threat to national security, and is so declared by a joint \nresolution, which becomes law. Under this scenario, a majority of the \nwhole number of each House of Congress may waive the requirements of a \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I firmly believe that Congress should have the option to waive the \nrequirement for a balanced budget in cases of less than an outright \ndeclaration of war. Looking back over the history of our Nation, we \nfind that we have had only five declared wars: The War of 1812, the \nMexican War, the Spanish-American War, the First World War, and the \nSecond World War.\n  The most recent encounters of the United States in armed conflict \nwith enemies have been, of course, undeclared wars. We fought the Gulf \nwar without a declaration of war. In addition, we fought both the \nVietnam and Korean actions without declarations of war.\n  This country can be faced with military emergencies which threaten \nour national security, without a formal declaration of war being in \neffect. Circumstances may arise in which Congress may need to spend \nsignificant amounts on national defense without a declaration of war. \nCongress and the President must be given the necessary flexibility to \nrespond rapidly when a military emergency arises.\n  The United States has engaged in only five declared wars, yet the \nUnited States has engaged in hostilities abroad which required no less \ncommitment of human lives or American resources than declared wars. In \nfact, our Nation has been involved in approximately 200 instances in \nwhich the United States has used military forces abroad in situations \nof conflict. Not all of these would move Congress to seek a \n[[Page S511]] waiver of the requirement of a balanced budget, but \nCongress should have the constitutional flexibility to provide for our \nNation's security.\n  Section 6 of the amendment permits Congress to rely on estimates of \noutlays and receipts in the implementation and enforcement of the \namendment by appropriate legislation.\n  Section 7 of the amendment provides that total receipts shall include \nall receipts of the United States except those derived from borrowing. \nIn addition, total outlays shall include all outlays of the United \nStates except those for repayment of debt principal. This section is \nintended to better define the relevant amounts that must be balanced.\n  Section 8 directs the amendment to take effect beginning with fiscal \nyear 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning after ratification, \nwhichever is later. This section will thus allow Congress an adequate \nperiod of time to consider and adopt the necessary procedures to \nimplement the amendment and to begin the job of actually balancing the \nFederal budget.\n  Mr. President, the future of our Nation's economy is not a partisan \nissue. Furthermore, the problem of deficit spending cannot be blamed on \none branch of government or one political party. Similarly, just as \neveryone must share part of the blame for our economic ills, everyone \nmust be united in acting to attack the growing problem of deficit \nspending. I recognize that a balanced budget amendment will not cure \nour economic problems overnight, but it will act to change the course \nof our future and lead to responsible fiscal management by our national \ngovernment.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S481-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 2\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2, a bill to make certain laws applicable to the legislative branch of \nthe Federal Government.\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, her name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 2, supra.\n  At the request of Mr. Levin, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2, supra.\n  At the request of Mr. Reid, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2, supra.\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2, supra.\n\n\n                                  S. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n4, a bill to grant the power to the President to reduce budget \nauthority.\n\n\n                                 S. 10\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the names of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr. Reid] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 10, a bill to make certain laws applicable to the \nlegislative branch of the Federal Government, to reform lobbying \nregistration and disclosure requirements, to amend the gift rules of \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives, and to reform the Federal \nelection laws applicable to the Congress.\n\n\n                                 S. 14\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 14, a bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct of 1974 to provide for the expedited consideration of certain \nproposed cancellations of budget items.\n\n\n                                 S. 50\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 50, a bill to \nrepeal the increase in tax on social security benefits.\n\n\n                                 S. 92\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatfield, the name of the Senator from \nWashington [Mr. Gorton] was added as a cosponsor of S. 92, a bill to \nprovide for the reconstitution of outstanding repayment obligations of \nthe administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration for the \nappropriated capital investments in the Federal Columbia River Power \nSystem.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 1\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States to require a balanced budget.\n\n\n                          Senate Resolution 1\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Resolution 1, a resolution informing the President of the United \nStates that a quorum of each House is assembled.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S511-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 26--RELATIVE TO APPOINTMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE ON \n                          GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN (for Mr. Dole) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

YOUNG\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, one of the people who has been \ncalling for justice in the field of health care in this Nation for many \nyears is Dr. Quentin Young.\n  Recently, he was interviewed by the Christian Century, and that \ninterview was published. It contains so much common sense that I hope \nsome of my colleagues will read what he has to say.\n  I ask to insert his comments at the end of my remarks.\n  A person does not have to agree with everything that he mentions in \nhis interview to recognize that we should be doing much better and that \nour friends in Canada are doing much better.\n  My conversations with Canadian Members of Parliament suggest that \nthere are some improvements that we could make on the Canadian system, \nif we were to adopt a similar system. To suggest, as have so many in \nour country, that the Canadian system is a failure, is an outright \nfalsehood. It is of interest that not a single Canadian Member of \nParliament has introduced legislation to repeal the Canadian system.\n  The article follows:\n\n  Health Reform and Civic Survival: An Interview With Quentin D. Young\n\n       (Since his days as a medical student at Cook County \n     Hospital in Chicago, Dr. Quentin D. Young has been engaged \n     professionally and politically in issues of public health. \n     Currently clinical professor of preventive medicine at the \n     University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, Young is \n     also national president of Physicians for a National Health \n     Program. He has been a leading and tireless spokesman for \n     health care reform. We spoke with him recently about the fate \n     of the Clinton health care proposal and the alternative of a \n     single-payer insurance system like Canada's.)\n       A year ago many people had high hopes for health care \n     reform. It was at the top of President Clinton's agenda and \n     it seemed to have widespread public support. Now the issue is \n     dead, and perhaps a crucial political opportunity has been \n     lost. What went wrong?\n       President Clinton produced an enormously complicated \n     proposal, which left him vulnerable to attacks from across \n     the spectrum. Those of us who support a single-payer plan \n     thought that if the reform had been enacted the way he \n     proposed, it would have been a dreadful disappointment and a \n     step backward. By going the route he did, he was forced to \n     rely on the whole insurance infrastructure and a real \n     nightmare of managed competition. All these huge bureaus he \n     proposed--they invited ridicule and defeat. From his public \n     and private comments it is clear that he understands the \n     redundancy and the parasitic role of the insurance industry: \n     it adds nothing to the product and subtracts mightily. \n     (Basically insurance agencies and conglomerates are in the \n     business of finding reasons not to give care.) So in light of \n     that, his proposal showed a lack of courage. Another form of \n     cowardice was that he didn't come right out and call his \n     mandated premium--which had all the force of law--a tax. So \n     that's the President's contribution to the failure of reform.\n       The decisive factor was the appalling undermining of the \n     democratic process that took place in Congress. At least $150 \n     million were spent on lobbying, on polls, on onslaughts from \n     small business groups and others. In the face of this \n     pressure, Congress became impotent. I think that viewing this \n     activity intensified people's dislike of the political \n     process. And I also think that there's a little bit of \n     concern by those involved that perhaps the lobbyists engaged \n     in overkill--that they created a sense of futility among the \n     public. And power elites usually don't like to see a sense of \n     futility among the public. Nor is it wholesome from the point \n     of view of a reformer.\n       The conventional wisdom was--probably still is--that a \n     single-payer plan is politically unfeasible.\n       Well, the route Clinton tried was politically unfeasible. \n     His proposal couldn't have done any worse than it did. And \n     winning isn't the whole thing. The big changes that have \n     occurred in American politics--the abolition of slavery, the \n     adoption of unemployment insurance and social security--did \n     not happen in one swift action. There was a buildup of \n     popular pressure and finally a breakthrough.\n       [[Page S517]] A battle over a single-payer plan would have \n     clearly defined the issues, as is happening in the debate \n     over the referendum on universal coverage in California. They \n     are having a huge David-and-Goliath fight against the same \n     forces that defeated the Clinton plan, because those forces \n     know that if California should miraculously pass such \n     legislation, then the game is over. In Canada in 1967 \n     Saskatchewan passed health insurance legislation, and two \n     years later Alberta did. In '71 the Tory Parliament in Ottawa \n     voted unanimously for Medicare, which is what they call their \n     national single-payer system. And, of course, the rest is \n     history.\n       It's clear that you regard Canadian experience as a success \n     story.\n       Canada has a humane, fair, extremely popular system. It \n     does better than we do in longevity and infant mortality and \n     most other health indices. Its achievement in cost \n     containment is very simply summarized. Twenty-three years \n     ago, before Canada initiated its reform, the U.S. and Canada \n     were both spending 7.1 percent of their respective GDPs on \n     health care. Now Canada's spending has risen to 9.5 percent--\n     not a tiny rise, but nothing like our rise to about 15 or 16 \n     percent, with no end in sight.\n       Whenever we talk about implementing a single-payer plan \n     like Canada's that aims both to offer universal coverage and \n     to cut costs, don't we have to talk also about putting limits \n     on services? And that's what scares people. We don't like the \n     thought of needing a heart bypass operation and being 315th \n     on the list.\n       There has been an inordinate amount of Canada-bashing and \n     exploitation of fear on this topic. The short answer is that \n     that kind of denial of care can't possibly happen in the \n     short run. We're spending about a trillion dollars per year \n     now on health care, and the figure is rising. That's a per \n     capita expenditure that's 40 percent higher than Canada's--so \n     in terms of funding we would have 40 percent more available \n     if we were to adopt their system. If you suddenly were to \n     give the Canadian system a thousand dollars more per capita, \n     then any problems of rationing would be solved.\n       In the U.S. under single-payer you'd immediately get a \n     minimum of $100 billion available for health care by \n     eliminating the waste in the insurance system. That's what \n     Canada experienced when it initiated its reform. Canadians \n     used to devote 11 percent of health costs to health insurance \n     administration--which is what we spend. Now Canada spends \n     less than 1 percent on insurance administration.\n       Add to that the benefits of negotiated fees with doctors. \n     Many billions of dollars are truly squandered on excessive \n     fees, breathtaking fees--a half hour's work is rewarded with \n     $2,000 or $4,000. That's ridiculous.\n       The problems of the Canadian system, compared to ours, are \n     trivial. More to the point, whatever problems it has involve \n     a relative shortage in the area of high technology. That's \n     precisely the area in which we have too much--literally too \n     much equipment and too many specialists. This is a burden on \n     the system. No reform will work until we rectify this \n     problem: 75 to 80 percent of our physicians are specialists, \n     only 20 to 25 percent are in primary care. The ratio should \n     be 50-50, possibly 60-40 primary care. Those are the kinds of \n     problems the marketplace gives us. Specialties offer the \n     higher rewards.\n       A third source of savings with single-payer is that you \n     could really control the laissez-faire medicine that is \n     supposedly controlled by managed competition. I'm speaking, \n     for example, about unnecessary surgery. About a third of \n     hysterectomies performed in the U.S. were unneeded. There's \n     thousands of dollars and harm to patients that could be \n     saved. We're doing twice as many Caesareans as needed. At \n     least 20 percent of coronary bypasses shouldn't have been \n     done. So I don't think we have to ration yet if we eliminate \n     these problems.\n       In the year 2010 it may be different. People are living \n     longer. There is no question about the correlation of age \n     with medical utilization. And scientists keep coming up with \n     more and more complicated things that we can do to help \n     people, which always adds big costs. But on the other end of \n     the spectrum, you wouldn't have to treat some people at all \n     because you've immunized all the kids and you will have early \n     detection of breast cancer, and so on.\n       One often hears reports that wealthy Canadians come to the \n     U.S. for treatment--the implication being that care here is \n     quicker and better.\n       I'm sure Canadians went to the Mayo Clinic and to Johns \n     Hopkins before there was mass health reform and they probably \n     do now. Many Americans are going to Canada for care. But the \n     crucial thing is that 99 percent of the health care the \n     Canadians receive is under the system, which maintains high \n     standards of research and training.\n       One of the very important characteristics of single-payer \n     as it's played out in Canada, which I concede is due to its \n     parliamentary system of government, is the fact that every \n     week in each of the provinces and in Ottawa the minister of \n     health has to face questions and complaints--``Mrs. Jones \n     spent six hours in the emergency room'' and so on.\n       Also, it is illegal in Canada, as it would need to be under \n     single-payer legislation here, for a private insurer to offer \n     a benefit that is covered under the plan. If you allow that, \n     you begin to undermine the system. You have to have everybody \n     in it--particularly the elites. They will guarantee the \n     product. They will see that by and large there's equity, \n     there's high quality, there's a way to correct incompetence.\n       This point came home to me when I was on a radio show with \n     an Anglican archbishop from Canada. He talked about the \n     danger of Canada's being torn apart by the Anglophile-\n     Francophile issue, and how a survey was conducted to see what \n     makes Canadians feel patriotic, what brings them together in \n     the midst of division. And way up at the top in the poll, for \n     Canadians of all stripes--including those in Quebec--was the \n     national health system. Here's a civic adventure that has \n     brought people together. Compare that to the U.S. system of \n     tooth and claw, of fear and bankruptcy and denial.\n       One of the reasons physicians and patients in the U.S. are \n     wary about government-run health insurance is that they \n     suspect it will mean an unreasonable limit on physicians' \n     autonomy.\n       One of the benefits of single-payer is that, with \n     everything going through the same computer, as it were, you \n     can easily create a physician profile, noting frequency and \n     interval of patient visits, number of ECGs prescribed, and so \n     on. With this profile you can easily begin to see the doctor \n     who is off the charts--who's doing three times the average \n     number of ECGs, for example. That's a place to look for \n     saving resources without oppressing physicians.\n       U.S. doctors already face scrutiny, but of a different \n     kind: we doctors have an insurance person at the other end of \n     the line from whom we have to get permission to practice \n     medicine. Sometimes the line is busy, sometimes you're put on \n     hold, and finally when you talk to the person she needs to \n     have you spell the diagnosis that you're getting permission \n     to treat. Not a happy scene. Do that three or four times in \n     an afternoon and you wonder why you went into machine.\n       The insurance system has transformed doctors into \n     technicians and given them some incredible restrictions. HMOs \n     sometimes forbid doctors from discussing treatment options \n     that aren't available under the plan. That violates the \n     principle of informed consent, central to any real patient-\n     doctor relationship.\n       I can give myself as an example of the need for appropriate \n     scrutiny. I was trained at Cook County Hospital in the late \n     1940s and '50s when one-third of the hospital beds were \n     dedicated to TB. We used to do X-rays on these patients every \n     week--it was the only guide to how someone was doing. And it \n     became an article of faith that one had to do a chest X-ray \n     of every new patient, certainly of every over-40 urban \n     dweller. About five years ago a younger colleague told me \n     that there's no medical justification for doing this. Routine \n     chest X-rays of people who have no symptoms are simply not an \n     effective diagnostic tool anymore. I was acting out of my \n     experience and training. But my old-fashioned approach had \n     ceased to be good medicine.\n       You mentioned your own medical training. As you look back, \n     do you recall any particular experience that galvanized your \n     concern for reforming the way health care is delivered?\n       Well, certainly training at Cook County was part of it. \n     It's a big public hospital that deals with an endless sea of \n     patients--1,500 a day come through the doors in every state \n     of malady: end-stage Alzheimer's, gunshot wounds, bad colds, \n     gallbladder problems, cancer. Whatever there was, County had. \n     And you see the most disenfranchised, the most impoverished, \n     the wretched of the earth. I was just a middle-class, kind of \n     liberal person, but it became clear that a doctor at County \n     could adopt one of two philosophies--and the staff was about \n     evenly divided along these lines. About half the doctors felt \n     that they were witnessing divine justice, a heavenly--or \n     Darwinian--retribution for evil ways, for excesses in drugs, \n     in booze and everything else. Patients came to the hospital \n     with their breath laden with alcohol, with needle marks on \n     their arms, their babies illegitimate and all the rest. The \n     other half decided that here was the congealed oppression of \n     our society--people whose skin color, economic position, \n     place of birth, family size, you name it--operated to give \n     them a very short stick. When you saw them medically and \n     psychologically in that broken, oppressed state, it was clear \n     that you had to address issues of justice, not just medical \n     treatment.\n       I had to decide which of these value systems was fair and \n     just, and which one I could live with. It seemed to me the \n     first approach is judgmental and harsh and simplistic. Taking \n     the alternative view gave me a shot at being a part of the \n     human race. And taking that view also accounts for my \n     optimism. While we are not a noble species, I've seen \n     evidence that when people are given the opportunity they can \n     be very noble. People get bigger than themselves, take risks, \n     are altruistic. I've been privileged to be in a few of those \n     moments, like the civil rights movement. That little kernel \n     of altruism, which may account for .002 percent of everyday \n     behavior, at times expands to be 100 percent for that day, or \n     that week. My notion, both as a doctor and as a citizen, is \n     that you have to expand that altruistic fraction.\n       When we interviewed former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop \n     about health reform, he said at one point that a central \n     issue is the simple question, ``Am I my brother's keeper?'' \n     Is it fair to say the American public, or a large section of \n     it, has basically said no to that question?\n       [[Page S518]] It's not fair to say that. The polls keep \n     saying that Americans want universal care. They even say \n     health care is a human right, which of course it isn't. It \n     is, at best, an implied right the way privacy is.\n       There's a dialectic to being one's brother's keeper. It \n     isn't simply, ``Christ asserted it and therefore it's \n     right.'' It's a living thing. I don't have the credentials to \n     be theological, but I do think that the act of taking care of \n     everybody in our health care system will make us our \n     brother's keeper. It will emancipate us to attack the other \n     enormous problems that we must solve. We can't have people \n     hungry every night. We can't have children uneducated. But we \n     do. We have to stop that. We won't survive otherwise. And \n     nowhere is it written that every society survives. It's \n     written somewhere that they all perish. And we've got all the \n     credentials to go down the road to oblivion--not tomorrow or \n     the next day, but not necessarily very much later. Time is \n     running out.\n       You are putting health care reform in the context of a much \n     larger moral crisis.\n       I do see health care reform as crucial to national civic \n     survival. Consider some of the huge problems we have: air \n     pollution, waste disposal, failed schools, homelessness, \n     crime in the streets, hunger. The common denominator is that \n     there are no resources available to solve these problems \n     beyond what's already out there. Then consider health care, \n     which is the biggest problem, and one that affects everybody. \n     Homelessness affects those who have to live around the \n     homeless, and it affects some sensitive people, but otherwise \n     the problem belongs to the people who are homeless--and so on \n     with all the problems I mentioned. But when you get to \n     health, it's everybody's problem--if not today, then \n     tomorrow. And it's the only social problem that we can fix \n     using the resources--manpower, facilities, expenditures--we \n     already have in place.\n       I don't want to be apocalyptic, but I think the case can be \n     made in terms of the national mood--the polarization, the \n     hate, the despair, the dissatisfaction with the political \n     process--that health care reform offers us our last best \n     chance to restore a sense of civic life and civic \n     responsibility.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S516-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             COSPONSORSHIP OF THE BASEBALL PRESERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I lend my support to the National \nPastime Preservation Act submitted to the new Congress by Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan and cosponsored by Senator John Warner.\n  Once again, Major League Baseball has shown that it does not warrant \nan exemption from our antitrust laws. Our national pastime has been \nsilenced, with little or no immediate prospect of a resumption in play.\n  Mr. President, today is perhaps the coldest day of the winter so far \nthis season. On these chilly days, our Nation should be on the verge of \nanticipating the annual ritual that signals hope of warmer weather on \nthe way; the crack of bats at spring training.\n  But spring training could be lost. The possibility--which would \ncompound the loss of part of the 1994 regular season and the World \nSeries--underscores the urgency of prompt consideration of the National \nPastime Preservation Act.\n  For Florida, the loss of spring training would result in an estimated \nloss in tourism dollars of at least $350 million, perhaps $1 billion. \nIn the last several years, communities in Florida have made substantial \ninvestments in new and upgraded training facilities for the very clubs \nthat will not be able to play.\n  This crisis has hurt Florida and America. Clearly, it is time to \nsubject Major League Baseball to the same laws of competition that \napply to the rest of business in our country. No other professional \nsport has an antitrust exemption.\n  Major League Baseball has used it antitrust exemption to prevent \nfranchise migration to areas more willing to support teams. A \nconsequence of this failure to allow the market to determine franchise \nlocation is a wide disparity between franchises. This, in turn, had led \nto the revenue-sharing proposal to be financed by a ceiling on players' \nsalaries. Thus, the issue which is at the heart of the current \ncontroversy--a ceiling on players' salaries--is attributable to a \nmisuse of the antitrust exemption. Additionally, removal of the \nantitrust exemption would be an incentive to the players to go back to \nwork and continue negotiations.\n  I urge my colleagues--in the name of restoring our national pastime--\nto consider and support the legislation to remove baseball's antitrust \nexemption.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S518-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S518-S520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  SPEECH BY U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ARMENIA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, recently, I read in the news of the \nArmenian General Benevolent Union, a speech by Ambassador Harry \nGilmore, the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia.\n  Because it has insights into the problems faced in Armenia, I am \nasking to insert it into the Congressional Record at the end of these \nbrief remarks.\n  The United States must exert every effort to see that Armenia and her \nneighbors, Turkey and Azerbaijan, can live together in peace.\n  This is in the best interests of Armenia and is in the best interests \nof Turkey and Azerbaijan.\n  But there are emotional barriers to achieving this.\n  While those emotional barriers remain, the people of Armenia \nstruggle.\n  This speech was given in Los Angeles, on June 14, 1994, to guests \nattending a fundraising banquet for the American University of Armenia, \nwhich I have had the privilege of visiting in Armenia.\n  The speech follows:\n   Harry Gilmore--United States Ambassador to the Republic of Armenia\n\n       Distinguished friends and guests of the American University \n     of Armenia, I bring you a story tonight of darkness and \n     light. The darkness you know. Armenia is going through \n     perhaps the most difficult period it has endured since the \n     end of first Republic of Armenia in 1920. The people of \n     Armenia have been living without heat and light, beset by war \n     and economic hardship. But in the middle of the darkness \n     there are some islands of light--and one of those is the \n     American University of Armenia.\n       Tonight I want to tell you some of my experiences as the \n     first Ambassador of the United States to the Republic of \n     Armenia. I want to tell you something about what the United \n     States Government is doing in Armenia. And I want to tell you \n     why I believe in the future of Armenia.\n       Our Embassy in Yerevan, the first foreign Embassy in \n     Armenia, opened in February 1992, in the Hrazdan Hotel. Now \n     we are in the building that once was home of the Young \n     Communist League. We have about fifteen Americans working in \n     our Embassy from the Department of State, USAID, USIA, and \n     the Peace Corps, and about sixty Armenian employees. Plus \n     there are 25 Peace Corps Volunteers in Armenia, with more to \n     come in July.\n       As you may know, in August 1992 I was first nominated to be \n     Ambassador by President Bush. After the 1992 elections, \n     President Clinton re-nominated me. I was finally confirmed by \n     the Senate in May 1993. I arrived in Yerevan with my wife \n     Carol that same month, one year ago.\n       I found our diplomats in Yerevan were living, much like the \n     residents of Yerevan, frequently without electricity, heat, \n     or water. There was, and often still is, only about one or \n     two hours of electricity each day. During the first winter, \n     our diplomats often wrote their cables by the light of butane \n     lanterns. One diplomat found that his laptop computer \n     wouldn't start unless he heated it up first on top of his \n     wood stove.\n       Now we are fortunate to have generators and kerosene \n     heaters in our homes and at the Embassy. Most Armenians are \n     not so lucky. Nuclear physicists are working by candlelight. \n     A factory that used to produce microprocessors is making \n     kerosene stoves. One daily newspaper, The Voice of Armenia is \n     being printed on ice-cream wrapping paper. The winter before \n     I arrived, the temperature inside school classrooms was often \n     below freezing. Some classes consisted of little more than \n     jumping up and down to stay warm.\n       I decided from the beginning that our Embassy should have \n     three goals: first, to help Armenia survive, emphasizing \n     humanitarian assistance; second, to try to help Armenia \n     achieve peace, and an end to its economic isolation; and \n     third, to help Armenia build a democratic government and new \n     free market economy that will allow Armenians to control \n     their own destiny, and guarantee their own future.\n            helping armenia survive: humanitarian assistance\n\n       Our first job has been to help provide humanitarian aid, so \n     Armenia can survive the economic crises caused by the \n     collapse of the Soviet Union and the war. The Armenian-\n     American community, the Armenian Church and other private \n     donor organizations have been extremely active in these \n     efforts. Soon after the Embassy opened, the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development located its regional office for the \n     Caucasus in Yerevan, and our government got involved in a \n     major way.\n       Much of our time has been taken up by the logistics of \n     getting wheat and fuel moving to Armenia. I now know more \n     about the Georgian railway system than I ever wanted to know. \n     When U.S. government wheat was stranded in Batumi, in \n     Georgia, because there was no electricity to run the Georgian \n     railways, we chartered diesel locomotives, and provided fuel \n     for them. When there was a shortage of wheat in Armenia, \n     because the trains in Georgia weren't running, we obtained \n     money to buy kerosene and diesel fuel to trade to the \n     Armenian farmers for wheat.\n       [[Page S519]] An airlift of planes chartered by the United \n     States government has brought in medicine, flour, and other \n     necessities of life, purchased by the government or donated \n     by private organizations in the U.S. Thanks largely to the \n     lobbying efforts of the Armenian-American community, a winter \n     airlift brought in over eighty thousand kerosene heaters, and \n     trains of tank cars brought thousands of tons of kerosene to \n     Armenia, so schools and homes of the elderly, one-parent \n     families, and other people sitting at home in the cold could \n     have heat.\n       The winter of 1992-93 all the schools closed in Armenia. It \n     was too cold to study. This winter was different. In February \n     I visited a working class school in the Charbakh district \n     outside Yerevan. You could see through a crack in the wall \n     caused by the 1988 earthquake. The temperature in the \n     hallways was freezing, and the students and teachers wore \n     winter coats, hats, scarves and mittens inside but because of \n     the heaters and kerosene we and a French organization named \n     Forum had furnished, classes were going on, and students were \n     learning. With great pride, they sang Armenian songs and \n     recited Armenian poetry for me. So I can tell you first hand \n     that our help is getting there, and is getting to the people \n     who need it most.\n       But humanitarian aid, though it takes much of our time and \n     efforts, is only a temporary measure, not a long-term answer. \n     The real answer lies in finding an end to the conflict in \n     Artsakh.\n                             ending the war\n\n       Helping the parties to find an end to the war is the most \n     important, and the most difficult, of our objectives. Without \n     peace--and I mean a just peace--there cannot be any end to \n     economic isolation, no development, no trade. The war is \n     taking the resources of Armenia, and the lives of some of its \n     best young men. I see the new graves in the cemeteries, the \n     faces in the newspapers, the memorial shrines in the schools. \n     The war is a very heavy burden for the people of Armenia, \n     Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh.\n       Some people think that the war could be ended by a few \n     telephone calls. I wish it were so simple, Hatred and \n     distrust have built up over the decades, and have often been \n     used by politicians for their own purposes. It may take a \n     long time for the hatred to die down, and the people of \n     Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan will have to live \n     again as neighbors.\n       Our job is to encourage and facilitate an end to the \n     fighting, and then to get the participants to sit down \n     together, talking instead of shooting. We believe the best \n     way to do this is through the international efforts of the \n     so-called ``Minsk Group'' of the Conference on Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe, a process which includes all the \n     countries in the region, except Iran, and which allows the \n     people of Nagorno-Karabakh to be heard. The Russian \n     Government is also working to achieve a settlement. We are \n     trying to encourage the Russians to combine their efforts \n     with those of the CSCE.\n       It is difficult and frustrating process. At this point, the \n     leaders of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh say they want to \n     talk. But so far the kind of compromise which would end the \n     fighting and launch a negotiating process has been elusive. \n     We are trying, step by step, to find common ground and build \n     trust. It will demand compromise from both sides. The \n     compromises may be painful. But the only alternative to \n     compromise is an endless war. I don't believe that anyone in \n     Armenia wants to see the children of the next generation \n     fighting the same endless war.\n\n\n          HELPING ARMENIA TOWARD DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\n       Our third objective is to help Armenia build a durable \n     democracy and a working free market. The government of \n     President Ter-Petrossian is now one of only two governments \n     in the former Soviet Union not headed by a former Communist. \n     Armenia has a multi-party system and an active free press. \n     Despite great criticism, an independent Armenia is stubbornly \n     following the course of market reforms and independent \n     foreign policy. Armenia has the potential to remain a \n     democratic and truly independent state.\n       What Armenia needs is the experience of democracy and a \n     free market, and the training to make it work. This is why \n     the American University of Armenia is so important.\n       We know that no single Western form of government or \n     economic life can simply be copied in Armenia. America and \n     Armenia have different histories and different traditions. \n     But many Armenian members of parliament and members of the \n     government have asked us for help. They want to learn from \n     our experience, take note of our successes, try to avoid our \n     mistakes.\n                              peace corps\n\n       Today we have 25 Peace Corps Volunteers in Armenia, 16 \n     teaching English in villages and towns, and 9 experienced \n     small business advisers. They've spent two winters there, \n     sharing the hardships of the local people. I'm very proud of \n     these young, and some not so young, men and women, who are \n     helping share our American know-how in Armenia.\n\n\n                        farmers and agriculture\n\n       We have brought American farmers and agricultural experts \n     to Armenia to help establish an extension service, similar to \n     our own, for the farmers of Armenia. And we have provided new \n     varieties of wheat seed both to replenish stocks and to \n     improve yields. One example of what they did: in Soviet \n     times, combine opertors were given quotas of acres to \n     harvest, regardless of how much wheat they actually \n     harvested. Our extension agents shared their experience of \n     how to use their harvesters to get the maximum amount of \n     grain, with the least waste.\n\n\n                         educational exchanges\n\n       We are working to give more Armenian students and \n     professionals the chance to study in America, so they can \n     take their new experiences back to Armenia and help rebuild \n     the country. We have open competitions in Yerevan for \n     Fulbright scholarships and other exchange programs. Under the \n     Fulbright program, leading scholars from Yerevan State \n     University will be teaching and doing research in the United \n     States, and Armenian scholars are working at the State \n     University. This year we will send over 100 Armenian \n     professionals for specialized short courses and workshops in \n     the U.S.\n       Today thirty-four high school students from Armenia, chosen \n     by an open competition from among 1500 applicants, are \n     studying at high schools all over the United States. Each one \n     is making Americans aware of the new realities in Armenia. \n     Each will return with an expanded understanding of the U.S., \n     and, I hope, with useful knowledge that can help Armenia.\n\n\n                               eco sphere\n\n       We are also providing assistance to privatize Armenia's \n     urban housing stock and to improve a range of Armenia's \n     energy systems. For example, U.S. legal advisors have helped \n     draft the first land use code and condominium legislation. We \n     have initiated successful weatherization/winterization trials \n     in schools and hospitals and we are providing critical \n     equipment and technology both to conserve energy in power \n     plants and industry and to develop new sources of hydro, coal \n     and oil energy.\n       In the two years since the Embassy opened, we've learned a \n     lot. We've learned that some people, and some institutions, \n     are resistant to change and even find it threatening. The old \n     menatlity, of waiting for someone at the top to make a \n     decision, is hard to change. We've learned that it's \n     sometimes better to start entirely new institutions than to \n     try to reform old ones, and that it's often best to target \n     the younger people and professionals, who are the most open \n     to change, and the most important resource for the future. \n     Most of USAID assistance targets 23-35 year old \n     professionals. That is one reason why, on many projects, \n     we've chosen to work with the American University of Armenia.\n                   the american university of armenia\n\n       To me, the American University of Armenia exemplifies what \n     is best about Armenian education. When you walk in the doors \n     of the American University, you feel a sense of energy, of \n     purpose. When you look in the computer lab, and see the \n     students at work stations, you could be in any American \n     University. But I think there are very few universities in \n     the United States where the students work with such \n     dedication and enthusiasm. There is another difference--when \n     you talk to the students, you learn they are not there just \n     for themselves, they are there because they want to make \n     Armenia a better place to live for future generations.\n       We are working together with the University on a number of \n     projects. The U.S. Information Agency opened its library, the \n     first in the Caucasus, alongside the library of the \n     University. This library is open to the whole community, not \n     just AUA students, and serves students and teachers from \n     Yerevan State University and schools all over Yerevan.\n\n\n                           junior achievement\n\n       USIA, the Peace Corps and the AUA worked together to launch \n     the Junior Achievement Program in Armenia. Today high school \n     students in Yerevan are learning practical business and \n     economics by running their own small businesses.\n\n\n                                 cepra\n\n       USAID is working with the University and the Ministry of \n     Economy to establish Armenia's first economic research \n     center, ``CEPRA'', which represents a watershed in \n     university-government collaboration in finding answers to the \n     country's most pressing macroeconomic problems. The \n     establishment of this innovative government center within the \n     University is a testament to the flexibility and foresight of \n     AUA's leadership in applying its intellectual resources to \n     the current economic situation.\n\n\n                             radio station\n       Students learn more than just theory at AUA. One group of \n     recent AUA graduates is trying to open the first independent \n     radio station in Armenia. A second group has started a \n     newspaper. A third group has started a publishing house, and \n     translated and published the first market economics textbook \n     in Armenian for the Junior Achievement Program.\n       A team organized by the Center for Business Research and \n     Development at AUA, with support from the Embassy, has \n     translated into Armenian two books on business management, \n     and is at work translating a university economics textbook \n     that will be the standard text for Armenian universities.\n       While we work closely with AUA, I should emphasize that we \n     are not ignoring the State University. This year, for the \n     first time, two Fulbright lecturers will be teaching jointly \n     [[Page S520]] at the State University and at AUA, in the \n     areas of American history and law. We are sponsoring a \n     program with the University of Colorado to help reshape the \n     economics curriculum at the State University. And several \n     scholars from the State University will receive Fulbright \n     fellowships to do research in the United States. In our view, \n     AUA and the State University are partners, not rivals.\n       To put it simply, AUA is a model of how the Armenian \n     Government, the American Government, and the Armenian-\n     American community are all working together, preparing \n     Armenia for the future, and looking together for solutions to \n     Armenia's problems. Some people say that a pessimist is an \n     optimist who has spent the winter in Armenia. But I have \n     spent the winter in Armenia, and I remain an optimist. When I \n     visit the American University, I know that there is hope for \n     the future. The future of Armenia is the hands and minds of \n     today's students.\n\n\n                              conclusions\n\n       In my first year in Armenia, I developed an even deeper \n     respect for the Armenian people. Against terrible adversity, \n     against heavy odds they have kept their faith, their \n     language, their culture and their pride intact. What would \n     happen if, in America, we had to endure the conditions they \n     endure; virtually no light, no heat, no gas, no electricity? \n     The Armenian people have borne this stoically for four \n     winters.\n       At the beginning of my remarks, I mentioned the First \n     Republic of Armenia. You all know how it ended after roughly \n     two years--divided within, fighting with neighboring \n     Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, beset by hunger and cold, \n     warring with Turkey, without substantial help from the West, \n     it was invaded by the Red Army, lost its independence, and \n     became part of the Soviet Empire.\n       This new Armenian Republic has now lasted longer than the \n     first Republic. Today's Armenia is also beset by many \n     problems; petroleum and transportation embargoes, the same \n     geographic dilemma, and again conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.\n       What is different now is that Armenia is a member of the \n     United Nations and the CSCE, a full member in the family of \n     democratic nations. Today, there are international mechanisms \n     for helping resolve conflicts, and for helping newborn \n     countries to get on their feet. Today there is a successful \n     and vigorous Armenian diaspora especially in the U.S. which \n     is actively involved in supporting the reborn Armenian \n     republic. These are now available to the Armenian Republic, \n     and Armenia is using them.\n       But in the end, what can guarantee the independence of \n     Armenia? In the 1930's, the great Armenian poet Charents \n     wrote an acrostic into one of his poems--the second letter of \n     each line spelled out, ``Oh Armenian people, your only \n     salvation is in your united strength.'' For these words \n     Charents was expelled from the Soviet Writers' Union and died \n     in prison. But what Charents said then is still true today. \n     Ultimately, it is the Armenian people themselves, working \n     together, who can guarantee their independence.\n       Armenia cannot survive in economic or political isolation. \n     For Armenia to be a successful member of the community of \n     nations, it will have to develop all of its resources. It \n     must and will find ways to end the isolation, to establish \n     new political and economic links with its neighbors, to \n     establish connections with the rest of the world. Armenia has \n     much to offer the world--a unique culture, a rich history, \n     and above all an abundance of talented people--especially \n     young people--who want to make a mark on the future. I hope \n     and believe they will continue to enrich world culture and to \n     contribute to the welfare of the reborn Armenian \n     state.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S518-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S520-S521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              INTERSTATE BANKING AND BRANCHING ACT OF 1994\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, last year we worked hard to \nensure, after careful consideration by the Senate Banking Committee, \nthe Senate, and the conference committee, that banks providing credit \nto out-of-State borrowers would be unaffected by other changes made in \nthe new interstate banking and branching law. We considered the \ninterests of the States, financial institutions, and regulators, and \nconsumers on this very important point.\n  Unfortunately, and notwithstanding the care we took with the words we \nused, it has come to my attention that a recent court decision has \nmisinterpreted several provisions of the interstate banking law. I want \nto set the record straight so that there is no confusion or \nmisunderstanding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the intermediate appellate court in Pennsylvania issued \nits decision on December 14, 1994, in the so-called Mazaika case. In a \n6-3 decision, the court held that a national bank located in Ohio was \nnot authorized by section 85 of the National Bank Act to collect \ncertain credit card charges from Pennsylvania residents--charges that \nthe court acknowledged to be lawful in Ohio. Mr. Chairman, every other \nfinal decision by other courts on the merits of this very question has \nconcluded that such charges were authorized by section 85 to be \ncollected from all borrowers, anywhere in the Nation, as long as they \nwere legal in the bank's home State.\n  In its decision, the majority noted the enactment of the Riegle-Neal \nInterstate Banking and Branching Act of 1994 and said that the \ninterstate banking law ``expressly provides that a national bank is \nbound, as to operations carried on in a particular State, by the \nconsumer protection laws of each State in which it operates any \nbranches.'' The majority was referring to the applicable law provision \nof the interstate law.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my view that the Mazaika majority made several \nmistakes in its reference to the applicable law provision of the \ninterstate banking law. These matters should be clarified.\n  First, the applicable law provision in the interstate law applies \nonly and by its terms when a bank actually has branches in a second \nState. And even in such circumstances, the applicable law provision \nsubjects the interstate branch of a bank to certain State laws only \nwhere those laws are not preempted by Federal law. This provision has \nno bearing on or relevance to the Mazaika case because, in that case, \nno branching by the Ohio bank into Pennsylvania is involved. Moreover, \nthe law has long been settled by the courts that section 85 is \npreemptive.\n  Second, the Mazaika majority simply ignored the very important \nsavings clause in the interstate law. The savings clause is part of \nsection 111 of the interstate law. Mr. Chairman, I well recall that \nthis provision was included in the Senate bill at the request of the \nSenator from Delaware for two reasons. The clause makes clear that a \nbranch of a bank in one State may charge interest allowed by that \nState's laws in making loans to borrowers in another State even if the \nbank has branched interstate into the borrowers' State. In addition, \nthe Senate Banking Committee and the Senate very much wanted this \nprovision in the law in order to ensure that a bank's ability to \ncollect all lending charges had not been affected by other provisions \nof the interstate law--such as the applicable law provision.\n  The savings clause provides that nothing in the interstate law \naffects section 85 of the National Bank Act and also section 27 of the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Act, which relates to charges by State banks. \nThe savings clause therefore preserves the preexisting lending \nauthority of banks to collect all lending charges in accordance with \nhome State law, without regard to the changes in branching authority \nmade by the interstate law.\n  Does the Senator agree with my understandings that the majority in \nMazaika seriously misconstrued the interstate banking legislation?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I most certainly do, and I agree that it is very \nimportant to confirm these points.\n  At the Senate Banking Committee, I requested, and the Managers' \nAmendment included, the savings clause. The savings clause, as I have \npreviously stated, made clear that the adoption of interstate banking \nlegislation will not and was not intended to affect the existing \nauthority with respect to any charges imposed by national and state \nbanks for extensions of credit from out-of-state offices.\n  The Senate Banking Committee report and the conference report both \ncontain explanatory language that is consistent with this reading of \nthe interstate law. The reports state that, as a result of the savings \nclause, nothing in the interstate banking law affects existing \nauthorities with respect to any charges under section 85 of the \nNational Bank Act or section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act \nthat are assessed by banks for loans made to borrowers outside the \nState where the bank or branch making the loan is located.\n  I took to the floor of this Chamber on September 13, 1994, to \nreemphasize these important points.\n  I very much agree with the Senator from Utah that the majority in \nMazaika misread and seriously misconstrued the interstate banking \nlegislation. I hope our discussion today clarifies these matters.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chairman, I also wish to set the record straight \nabout another provision in the interstate banking law. Section 114 \nestablishes a \n[[Page S521]] new procedure concerning when the Federal banking \nagencies issue interpretive rulings or opinion letters that preempt \ncertain State laws. I have learned that some are arguing that section \n114 and its legislative history somehow overrule, or cast doubt upon, \ninterpretations of the word ``interest'' by the OCC, the FDIC, and the \nOTS. These interpretations have been repeatedly cited by many courts.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my interpretation that nothing in section 114 or \nthe legislative history of the interstate banking law overrules, or \ncasts doubt upon, these prior interpretive letters issued by the \nFederal banking agencies. The savings clause in section 111 makes this \nabundantly clear. Indeed, it is my understanding that section 114 \naddresses only procedural matters, and was not intended to alter or \nestablish any principles of substantive law.\n  May I ask the Senator from Delaware whether he agrees with my \ninterpretation?\n  Mr. ROTH. I do.\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S520-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S521-S522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      WHEN GAMBLING COMES TO TOWN\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, during the last session of Congress, \nI introduced a bill to set up a commission to look at the whole \nquestion of where we're going in the United States on gambling and what \nour policy should be. This is a major cultural shift that is taking \nplace that has an impact on our citizens and has an impact on \ngovernment revenue.\n  Recently, I heard reference to an article by Stephen J. Simurda in \nthe Columbia Journalism Review, and I got a copy of the article. I ask \nto insert it at the end of my remarks.\n  My instinct is that we should move with some caution in this field.\n  The article mentions that the Center for Addiction Studies at Harvard \nUniversity says that between 3.5 and 5 percent of adults exposed to \ngambling can be expected to develop into pathological gamblers. Even \nmore disturbing, the percentage is higher, 6 to 8.5 percent, for \ncollege and high school students.\n  I do not know what the answer is, but I know that Congress and our \nfederal government probably should not ignore this phenomenon.\n  The article follows:\n\n                      When Gambling Comes to Town\n\n                        (By Stephen J. Simurda)\n\n       Just five years ago state-authorized casino gambling in the \n     United States was confined to Nevada and Atlantic City, New \n     Jersey. Today, casinos can be found in eighteen states. Many \n     are Indian-owned--as in New York, Connecticut, Minnesota, \n     Michigan, Arizona, and Oregon. Others are floating casinos--\n     like those on the rivers of Illinois, Iowa, and Mississippi.\n       And more are on the way. Missouri and Indiana have recently \n     approved casinos, and the biggest one in the world is being \n     built in New Orleans. Several more states, including Ohio, \n     Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and South Carolina, are \n     considering various forms of legal gambling.\n       ``All of a sudden it's like, bang! legalized gambling is \n     the biggest economic development force in almost every state \n     in the country,'' says Robert Goodman, an urban planner at \n     the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who recently \n     completed a two-year study of the gambling industry.\n       The current gambling surge can be traced, in part, to state \n     lotteries, which have become a fixture in the American \n     landscape in the thirty years since New Hampshire started the \n     first public lottery of this century. Today, thirty-six \n     states have lotteries, and legislators would be hard pressed \n     to make fiscal ends meet without the millions of dollars they \n     generate.\n       Taken together, these developments add up to a fundamental \n     shift in the role gambling plays in U.S. society. In 1992, \n     Americans spent a staggering $30 billion on legal gambling, a \n     figure The Wall Street Journal reports was more than was \n     spent on books, movies, recorded music, and attractions (such \n     as amusement and theme parks) combined.\n       The transformation of America into a gambling society was, \n     of course, greatly accelerated by years of federal cutbacks, \n     compelling cities and states to generate more revenue at a \n     time when few politicians dare to prescribe an old-fashioned \n     formula--raising\n      taxes. So State legislators, mayors, and governors are often \n     quite receptive to gambling promoters, a group that \n     generally includes deep-pocketed developers, prominent \n     local attorneys or financial consultants, and, in some \n     cases, powerful political colleagues. Armed with glowing \n     economic impact studies, promoters set out to convince \n     communities that casino gambling will provide a big boost \n     to their economy.\n       Journalists across the country who are asked to cover \n     legalized casino gambling may find it a difficult and \n     confusing assignment, for a variety of reasons. ``It doesn't \n     fit easily within the framework of a beat that most \n     newspapers have, and there is a certain amount of technical \n     expertise needed,'' says Robert Franklin, who covers \n     philanthropy and charitable gambling for the Minneapolis/St. \n     Paul Star Tribune. ``There is no place from which to gather a \n     lot of information in a hurry,'' adds Steve Wiegand, who has \n     covered gambling for The Sacramento Bee. ``And so many of the \n     people I speak to are so self-serving it is hard to know how \n     much of what they tell me is true.''\n       These and other problems and potential pitfalls were \n     mentioned by several journalists who have come up against one \n     of the biggest local stories of the decade. What follows, \n     then, is something of a field map for reporters and editors \n     who find themselves suddenly compelled to explore and explain \n     a complicated piece of terrain.\n\n\n                              the proposal\n\n       It promises a lot and has a strong marketing effort behind \n     it. In Bridgeport, Connecticut, a city that recently emerged \n     from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Steve Wynn of Mirage \n     Resorts promised 12,000 new jobs, four million visitors a \n     year, and millions in tax revenues. And over the first half \n     of 1993 he and other casino promoters spent more than $2 \n     million on lobbying, the most ever in Connecticut, to gain \n     approval of a casino bill.\n       Legislators declined to act on the bill after the \n     Mashantucket Pequots--a tribe that operates a huge and hugely \n     successful casino on tribal lands in Ledyard, Connecticut--\n     agreed to pay the State $113 million, an amount equal to the \n     State's budget shortfall for the fiscal year, out of slot \n     machine profits. (Indian-owned casinos nationwide enjoy tax-\n     free status; their success has spurred efforts to legalize \n     corporate-owned casinos that would pay taxes.)\n       Inevitably, casino proposals will promise lots of jobs and \n     tax money, among other incentives, but the promises are just \n     that, and the reality may not match the sales pitch.\n       In Iowa, residents of Davenport--and the local media--were \n     dazzled in 1989 by promises of a $76 million investment by a \n     floating-casino developer, including the building of a \n     fifteen-story hotel, a shopping center, and an office \n     building. By last year it was estimated that less than $20 \n     million had actually been spent, and nothing had been built. \n     ``The city was looking for bricks and mortar, land-based \n     development, and that's what we didn't get,'' says Clark \n     Kauffman, a reporter for the Quad-City Times in Davenport.\n       As a city or state reacts to a gambling plan with its own \n     ideas about how the money might be spent, it's important to \n     examine who will benefit. In many states, lottery revenues, \n     for example, are supposed to contribute to education or \n     services for the elderly. But in California and Illinois, \n     among others, it's been shown that lottery funds have often \n     just replaced legislative appropriations, not supplemented \n     them, as many people thought they were intended to do.\n\n\n                     getting a variety of opinions\n\n       It's never hard to find promoters eager to make the case \n     for gambling. ``Reporters can expect to be showered with \n     attention'' by gambling promoters, says Daniel Heneghan, who \n     has covered gambling for the Atlantic City Press since 1979 \n     and has been offered free trips to other gambling properties \n     by casino owners. (He declined the offers.)\n       Meanwhile, ``informed critics of the industry are very hard \n     to find,'' says David Johnston, a writer and editor at The \n     Philadelphia Inquirer and author of Temples of Chance: How \n     America Inc. Bought Out Murder Inc. To Win Control of the \n     Casino Business. As a result, opposition presented in the \n     media often comes from the religious community, which makes \n     moralistic arguments against casinos--the kind of arguments \n     many people don't take very seriously. Last August 20, The \n     Washington Post ran a front-page story about gambling headed \n     d.c. considering casino gambling: option viewed as economic \n     booster. The only opponent quoted in the piece was an \n     assistant pastor at a Baptist church, who said, ``We don't \n     support gambling, because it's anti-Biblical and anti-\n     Christ.''\n       Reporters can usually get a more cogent analysis from \n     economists, planners, psychologists, and other professionals. \n     Pauline Yoshihashi of The Wall Street Journal, for example, \n     in researching a piece that appeared in the Journal last \n     October, asked a cultural anthropologist to explain the lure \n     of gambling, and an entertainment industry analyst from a \n     brokerage house to talk about the effect gambling may have on \n     other entertainment businesses.\n       In a five-part series in The Boston Globe last September, \n     reporters Mitchell Zuckoff and Doug Bailey turned to an \n     architect and regional planner to discuss the government's \n     promotion of legalized gambling, and to a professor of \n     commerce and legal policy to address the parasitic nature of \n     legalized gambling on the economy.\n\n\n                  looking out for financial conflicts\n\n       ``Gambling interests suck up everybody,'' says Vicki Abt, a \n     professor of sociology at Penn State University and author of \n     The Business of Risk. Abt says that includes her co-author, \n     Eugene Christiansen, who is often described as a ``gambling \n     industry analyst,'' as he was in The Boston Globe's generally \n     first-rate series on gambling.\n       In fact, Christiansen is a consultant who makes about half \n     of his income working for the gambling industry--a bit of \n     background \n     [[Page S522]] information he's rarely asked about. \n     ``Reporters are much less interested in exploring my ties to \n     the industry than they are in getting me to give the secret \n     as to why gambling is bad.'' Christiansen says. His \n     willingness to be critical of the spread of legalized \n     gambling, it should be noted, does not conflict with the \n     interests of some large casino companies that stand to lose \n     revenue if rivals move in on their turf.\n       Then there's I. Nelson Rose, a professor at the Whittier \n     Law School in California, whose resume calls him the \n     ``nation's leading authority on gambling and the law.'' But \n     nowhere in his nine-page vita does Rose mention that for the \n     past three years he has been a partner in a plan to develop a \n     string of Indian-owned casinos in southern California.\n       ``I have no trouble talking about it.'' says Rose when \n     asked about his business ventures, but he doesn't always \n     volunteer the information to reporters. (In the Globe series, \n     Rose was described as a professor ``who studies gambling \n     law.'' The Quad-City Times called him ``one of the nation's \n     top authorities on legalized gambling.'')\n       It's worth noting that Christiansen and Rose are still good \n     sources for gambling stories, says David Johnston, ``but you \n     need to put them in the universe.''\n       Almost no source is safe, it seems. A reporter calling the \n     National Council on Problem Gambling in New York City, for \n     example, might expect to get an anti-gambling perspective, or \n     at least a view that is cautious about the spread of \n     legalized gambling. ``That's not what my board wants me to \n     do,'' says Jean Falzon, the group's executive director. \n     Instead, the council, whose board includes several gambling \n     industry executives, focuses on raising money, often from the \n     industry, for research about, and the education of, \n     compulsive gamblers.\n       What's a reporter to do?'' You flat out ask them'' if they \n     make money off the industry, says The Wall Street Journal's \n     Yoshihashi. (For the record, two of the experts quoted in \n     this story, Goodman and Abt, say they take no money from the \n     gambling industry.)\n\n\n                    evaluating the economic benefits\n\n       A casino proposal will offer enough numbers to confuse even \n     an experienced business reporter. And they're all soft. \n     Nevertheless, exploring the economic side of casino \n     development can offer some of the best stories about the \n     issue.\n       ``Many real economic issues are not being discussed by \n     promoters or local politicians'' who are eager to get casinos \n     open and generating money, says Yoshihashi. One of these \n     issues involves how many of a projected casino's anticipated \n     customers will come from outside the immediate area. If most \n     of the gamblers are local, the dollars spent at the casino \n     represent money not being spent on other things in the local \n     economy, inevitably hurting some area businesses. Then, too, \n     there's the issue of jobs, which are\n      usually touted as skilled and high-paying. In reality, the \n     skills are usually pretty minimal, as is the pay, which \n     generally anticipates generous tips. There's also a \n     history of racial discrimination and sexual harassment in \n     the casino industry.\n       Another issue centers around the likelihood that a casino \n     will help a community turn its luck around. ``There can be a \n     lot of false expectations about long-term economic \n     development,'' says William Eadington, director of the \n     Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming at \n     the University of Nevada at Reno. ``It's all driven by a \n     myopic perspective that all that matters is economic, which \n     is bound to be disappointing.'' (Eadington, by the way, makes \n     money off the industry, running training sessions for casino \n     managers and sponsoring an international gambling conference \n     that draws from industry and academia.)\n       Lastly, despite regular denials from gambling promoters, \n     there is abundant evidence that legalized gambling, \n     especially state lotteries, is regressive, with poorer \n     citizens gambling a disproportionate share of their income. \n     Information on this often-scanted subject has come from the \n     New Jersey Lottery Commission, The Heartland Institute in \n     Chicago, and Duke University, among others.\n\n\n                      looking at the social costs\n\n       Examining the social cost of gambling can be a fertile area \n     for an enterprising journalist. ``There's absolutely been an \n     explosion in the number of compulsive gamblers in Minnesota'' \n     since casinos began opening on Native American reservations \n     across the state, says Jim Kelly, assistant city editor of \n     the Star Tribune in the Twin Cities. The paper has attempted \n     to cover this issue, a notable example being a page-one \n     November 12, 1992, piece that examined increases in crime \n     related to compulsive gambling.\n       Howard Shaffer, director of the Zinberg Center for \n     Addiction Studies at Harvard University, says that between \n     3.5 and 5 percent of those adults exposed to gambling can be \n     expected to develop into pathological gamblers. Even more \n     disturbing, the percentage is higher (6 to 8.5 percent) for \n     college and high school students, according to Shaffer's most \n     recent research. ``It's like crack was to cocaine. It's \n     becoming too easy to gamble,'' says Shaffer.\n       New forms of legalized gambling may also contribute to an \n     increase in crime, or at least increases in the cost of \n     ensuring public safety. Meanwhile, there's the likelihood of \n     more white-collar crime when gamblers who lose too much in \n     the casinos try to make up their losses by stealing from \n     employers or institutions.\n\n\n                       how will it be regulated?\n\n       ``If you're going to have gambling as public policy, you \n     have to have regulation,'' says Yoshihashi. The Wall Street \n     Journal reporter suggests that communities consider imposing \n     a waiting period between the time someone leaves the industry \n     and the time the person can serve in a regulatory capacity, \n     and vice versa.\n       David Johnston of The Philadelphia Inquirer adds that \n     reporters should find out, for example, whether a tax agent \n     will be required to be on hand when money is counted, and how \n     much casino operators will have to disclose about their \n     business relationships with those in the community. He also \n     suggests looking into whether the casino will permit credit \n     gambling, which he says creates a host of problems, and \n     whether there will be stiff penalties for casinos that permit \n     underage patrons to gamble.\n       Regulation is a particularly big issue at casinos on Indian \n     reservations because their sovereign-nation status has put \n     them into something of a regulatory limbo. A recent article \n     in Gaming & Wagering Business, a trade magazine, raised \n     allegations of misuse of funds, ties to organized crime, and \n     sexual harassment at one reservation-based casino in \n     Minnesota.\n       Chris Ison, one of five reporters at the Star Tribune who \n     cover gambling in an unusual team approach, says he is aware \n     of the allegations, but has yet to explore them in depth. \n     Ison has uncovered and reported on other forms of wrongdoing, \n     some of which involve the regulators themselves. Last year, \n     for example, he co-wrote a piece revealing that the area \n     director of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs was \n     receiving cash vouchers with which to gamble when he made \n     regulatory visits to a casino.\n\n\n                            The bottom line\n\n       In general, gambling needs to be covered like other \n     economic development proposals--glitz and hype \n     notwithstanding. Journalists should not forget that they may \n     be the only ones able to cast a skeptical eye on plans to \n     expand legalized gambling in their community.\n       ``Remember, this is an industry that's in the business of \n     selling illusion,'' says David Johnston. ``And it begins long \n     before the casino ever opens.''\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S521-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S522-S523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      THE PEACE POWERS ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nS. 5, the Peace Powers Act of 1995, introduced by Majority Leader Dole. \nThis is a much-needed piece of legislation, in that it not only unties \nthe President's hands in those instances where he needs to act to \nensure American interests, it also enacts important reforms in the \nmanner in which the United States participates in U.N. operations.\n  First, S. 5 repeals the unworkable--and probably unconstitutional--\nWar Powers Resolution. This is long overdue. I, like many of my \ncolleagues, have always believed that the Framers of the Constitution \nalways intended that the President should be able to act with dispatch \nto protect American interests in his capacity of Commander in Chief of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces. While Congress retains the power of the purse, \nand the continuing right to cut off funds at will, there is no clear \nright for Congress to preemptively subject the President to a drop dead \ndate in the conduct of military operations. This bill does retain the \nconsultation and reporting provisions of the War Powers Resolution, \nwhich have not been controversial and with which all administrations \nhave complied, in the spirit of cooperation between the executive and \nlegislative branches.\n  A major provision is section 5 of the bill, which amends the United \nNations Participation Act to prohibit the President from placing any \nelement of the U.S. Armed Forces under the command or operational \ncontrol of any foreign national in any UN peacekeeping operation. This \nis a matter that commands strong support among the American public, who \ndo not want to see our service personnel placed willy-nilly under the \ncontrol of non-Americans, exposed to dangers in operations that may \nhave little if any relation to American interests. I am pleased to \npoint out that this provision is very similar to an amendment that I \nattempted--unsuccessfully, at that time--to add to the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill in 1993. However, as President Clinton has \nshown himself more and more willing to delegate his constitutional \npower to international bureaucrats at the United Nations, the wisdom of \nthis prohibition has become more and more apparent. I look forward to \nits becoming law in the very near future.\n  Finally, S. 5 includes provisions to reform the way U.N. peacekeeping \nis \n[[Page S523]] paid for. With passage of this legislation, costs \nincurred by the Defense Department in U.N. peacekeeping operations will \nbe credited to the United States against our assessments to the United \nNations. No more would the United States be, in effect, stuck with the \nbill twice: the first time, when the Defense Department expends \nresources to support a U.N. mission, and the second time when the U.N. \nbills us for our share of the same mission.\n Also, the Peace Powers Act requires that advance notice of funding \nsources for peacekeeping operations be identified before the U.N. \nSecurity Council votes to establish, extend, or expand U.N. \npeacekeeping operations. This would prevent ``deficit voting'' by the \nClinton Administration--which has treated peacekeeping, in effect, as a \nsort of ``international entitlement program,'' where we commit to an \noperation and only worry about paying for it afterward.\n\n  The Peace Powers Act is the start of what I hope will be a major \nreexamination of U.S. priorities in the national security area. In \nparticular, the Clinton Administration, in the view of many of us, has \nnot approached its responsibilities in this area with sufficient \nseriousness. For example, we have seen the way in which the Clinton \nAdministration has completely mishandled the nuclear crisis involving \nNorth Korea. In fact, while the Clinton Administration claims that \npreventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a top \npriority, its actions, as evidenced by the October 1994 nuclear \nagreement with North Korea may do more to promote nuclear \nproliferation.\n  The agreed framework commits the United States to provide North Korea \nwith immediate economic, political and security benefits in return for \nPyongyang freezing its nuclear complex.\n  What signal does this send to other would-be proliferators? That \nbuilding a nuclear weapons complex, in violation of an international \naccord--namely, the 1968 Nonproliferation Treaty--is the best way to \nget economic aid, political concessions, and national security \nassurances from the United States. Here is what Iraqi foreign minister \nMohammed Saeed Sahhaf [sah-YEED sah-HAHF] had to say about the United \nStates-North Korean deal: ``What does North Korea get for its \nrefusal?'', [referring to international inspections of two sites \nsuspected of holding nuclear weapons-related materials] ``They get a $4 \nbillion light-water reactor, get a couple billion dollars in addition, \nplus unlimited oil deliveries. What do we get? We get nothing.'' [As \nrelated to the Washington Post by Rolf Ekeus [EH-kyoos], director of \nthe U.N. Special Commission on Iraq.]\n  Under the agreed framework the United States will: Immediately \nprovide North Korea with close to $4.7 million worth of heavy oil; \nestablish liaison offices with North Korea; begin relaxing trade \nrestrictions; and cancel the annual United States/South Korean military \nexercise ``Team Spirit.'' And North Korea's shooting down of a United \nStates helicopter that accidentally strayed north of the snow-obscured \nborder-line--and then holding the surviving pilot prisoner--has not \ndiluted this Administration's eagerness to deal with North Korea.\n  But even more astounding is that despite months of North Korean\n   intransigence over allowing international nuclear inspections, the \nClinton administration agreed to provide these valuable assets without \nensuring international inspections. Only after about 5 years into the \nagreement's implementation, and close to the completion of the first of \ntwo light water reactors, is North Korea required to come into full \ncompliance with the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, which prohibits the \ndiversion of nuclear materials from peaceful purposes to weapons use \nand obligates signatories to accept ``safeguards'' to monitor and \nverify compliance. And it is only at this point that the special \ninspections of the two nuclear waste sites will be allowed.\n\n  To give another example, I applaud the proposal of my colleague, \nSenator McConnell, the incoming Chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations, to take a new look at our foreign aid to Russia and other \nstates of the former Soviet Union in light of some of the things that \nare happening there. Senator McConnell has called for cutting aid to \nRussia upon evidence that Moscow is directing or supporting the \nviolation of another nation's sovereignty. In addition, I am sure my \ncolleagues feel as I do about the disturbing television pictures we are \nseeing from Chechnya [chech-NYAH], and the actions of Russian forces \nthere. While Chechnya is legally part of Russia and not a neighboring \ncountry, I am concerned what these actions may indicate about the \ndirection of the Russian Government and its commitment to democratic \nreform.\n  So, as I have said, Mr. President, there are many issues for us to \ntake a look at in the 104th Congress. The Peace Powers Act is an \nexcellent beginning. I hope it will rapidly be enacted.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/05/senate-section/article/S522-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S523-S525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nUNITED STATES-NORTH KOREAN AGREED FRAMEWORK: WHAT IT MEANS FOR US; WHAT \n                           IT MEANS FOR SEOUL\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, last month my colleague Senator \nMurkowski and I made a factfinding trip to several Asian countries, \nincluding North and South Korea. In both Pyongyang and Seoul we \nnaturally focused much of our attention on the Agreed Framework \nrecently concluded between the United States and North Korea. According \nto that document, North Korea is to dismantle its nuclear weapons \nproduction capability in exchange for assistance--primarily from South \nKorea and Japan--in reconfiguring its energy sector.\n  I know that some in this chamber have serious misgivings about our \ndeal with North Korea. I understand that; given Pyongyang's record, it \nwould be a mistake to treat that government's ``commitments'' with \nanything less than a very healthy skepticism. But I believe that the \nmore one looks at the Agreed Framework with North Korea the more one \nsees that the agreement does not depend on trusting Pyongyang. Rather, \nthe United States has crafted an agreement that gives us and our \npartners, South Korea and Japan, new levers over North Korea. If the \nNorth Koreans don't live up to their commitments, they lose out, and \nwe're the ones who decide if those obligations are being met.\n  When I was in Seoul our talented and hard-working Ambassador there, \nJames T. Laney, gave me a memo that spells out very cogently just how \nmuch we and the South Koreans stand to gain from the Agreed Framework \nwith North Korea. The memo does have a shortcoming: like many documents \nproduced within the U.S. Government, it is full of acronyms. Let me \nspell some of those out. The DPRK is the Democratic People's Republic \nof Korea--North Korea--and the ROK is the Republic of Korea--South \nKorea. The ROKG is the Republic of Korea Government. An LWR is a Light \nWater Reactor, the NPT is the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, and the \nIAEA is the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  Ambassador Laney also gave me a very interesting statement describing \nthe evolving South Korean reaction to the Agreed Framework. No country \nlooks more warily at North Korea than South Korea does. So it's worth \nnoting that, as details about the agreement became known, the Seoul \nstock market went up more than 20 percent. That's not the reaction of a \nbusiness community that thinks its country has been left more \nvulnerable.\n  I respectfully request that Ambassador Laney's memo, ``What the U.S.-\nDPRK Agreed Framework Means for Korea,'' and his statement, ``Seoul's \nSecond Thoughts,'' be inserted into the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n          What the U.S.-DPRK Agreed Framework Means for Korea\n\n       South Koreans are nobody's fools when it comes to trusting \n     North Korea. They don't. They are watching like hawks for the \n     first sign of DPRK backsliding or nonperformance regarding \n     the Geneva Agreed Framework. We drew heavily on the ROK's \n     experience and advice to design a Framework that avoids the \n     mistakes of past agreements with the DPRK. The Framework was \n     designed to compel the DPRK to take measurable steps in \n     compliance before getting significant benefits.\n       Determined not to be cut out of the game, the South Koreans \n     are trying to promote inter-Korean dialogue. Equally \n     determined to hobble ROK influence (and perhaps unwilling to \n     talk before the succession is completed in Pyongyang), the \n     North Koreans are \n     [[Page S524]] resisting. The recent ROKG initiative to \n     unfreeze private commercial projects in the North was a \n     clever first step which, in tandem with pressure from the \n     U.S., may move Pyongyang back towards substantive dialogue \n     with Seoul. Inter-Korean dialogue is essential because many \n     of Korea's problems can only be solved by the Koreans and \n     because the absence of dialogue generates ROK public fears \n     about progress in U.S.-DPRK relations.\n\n\n                   origin of the u.s. ``concessions''\n\n       LWR's: When North Korea floated the idea of converting from \n     gas-graphite (GGMR) to the light water system (LWR), U.S. \n     arms-control experts were intrigued. However, we declined its \n     request that we supply LWR's because the DPRK could not pay \n     for them. In mid-1994, the Kim Young-Sam administration \n     indicated that it wished to provide an LWR to the DPRK as an \n     investment in Korea, by Korea, and as an important inducement \n     to the North to settle the nuclear issue on our terms. The \n     LWR ultimately became the centerpiece of the settlement.\n       We refused to allow the offer of an LWR project to serve as \n     a reward for North Korea belatedly complying with the NPT. \n     Only on the condition that the DPRK would obtain a clean bill \n     of health from the IAEA before getting any significant \n     components did we use the ROK offer to induce the DPRK to go \n     beyond the requirements of the Treaty and give up its entire \n     graphite-based nuclear program permanently. The South's \n     unique willingness to sponsor a LWR project denies this \n     proposal any precedential value, and North Korea's unenviable \n     position in the world makes it an unlikely role model for \n     would be proliferators.\n       Heavy Oil: The second ``trade-off'' was designed to bring \n     the DPRK even further beyond its NPT obligations--to freeze \n     its nuclear program immediately and to dismantle it before \n     the LWR project was even finished. We persuaded the DPRK to \n     stop building and operating nuclear facilities (as was its \n     right under the NPT) and instead take heavy oil (which the \n     North cannot refine into gasoline) for generating substitute \n     electricity. The DPRK renounced all nuclear activity, \n     civilian or military, until the LWR project is completed in \n     the next decade, to be verified by IAEA monitoring.\n                        south korean perspective\n\n       War against Non-Proliferation: The U.S. and ROK shared the \n     goal of ending the North Korean nuclear threat and agreed on \n     strategy for accomplishing that. South Korea's overriding \n     concern in dealing with the DPRK nuclear threat was to avoid \n     turning the Korean peninsula into a battlefield. The \n     conventional military threat--unabated despite the Geneva \n     Framework--was a more immediate danger than the nuclear \n     threat in the eyes of many Koreans. During negotiations, we \n     systematically but quietly upgraded our deterrent posture and \n     today the U.S. is in the strongest position militarily that \n     it has ever been with regard to the DPRK. Further South \n     Korean objectives were that a settlement also promote inter-\n     Korean relations by engaging North and South in a joint \n     project that will bring about--indeed compel--cooperation \n     (while rendering the North increasingly dependent on the \n     South); give the North nothing of possible detriment to the \n     U.S. security presence or the U.S.-ROK alliance (such as the \n     bilateral Peace Treaty that the DPRK had sought as a first \n     step towards withdrawal of U.S. forces) and avoid giving the \n     DPRK a legally-binding inter-Governmental agreement (but \n     instead describe the unilateral steps the U.S. would take in \n     response to DPRK fulfillments of its commitments). The ROK \n     got what it wanted.\n\n\n           what south koreans don't like about the settlement\n\n       Zero-Sum Approach: A large and influential minority of \n     Koreans who fled south during the war has traditionally \n     dictated a ``zero-sum'' approach to North Korea. During U.S.-\n     DPRK talks there was discomfort at having the ROK's ally \n     engaged in dialogue with its adversary ``over ROK heads''. \n     Exaggerated (and largely uninformed) reports of U.S. \n     ``concessions'' to the North during negotiations generated \n     criticism of the U.S. and heightened unjustified fears. \n     Nevertheless, all Koreans seemed to agree that only the U.S. \n     could negotiate a peaceful settlement with the DPRK. The ROK \n     was unable to sustain its own its own bilateral talks with \n     the North, and flatly opposed the idea of a multilateral \n     approach such as the Russians suggested or the older idea of \n     a U.S.-DPRK-ROK ``trialogue.'' While the sensitive details \n     were withheld from the public, the ROKG was briefed every \n     step of the way in the course of negotiations.\n       Special Inspections: When the Geneva Framework was signed, \n     initial South Korean complaints centered around the length of \n     time before Special Inspections, which had become a symbol of \n     DPRK non-compliance. Yet most ROK analysts had judged that \n     Pyongyang would never provide access to the disputed sites \n     which were tangled in DPRK national pride and had become an \n     important source of its negotiating leverage. The ROKG agreed \n     with us that the right of IAEA access was non-negotiable, but \n     the timing could be adjusted because freezing the DPRK's \n     current program took precedence over uncovering more details \n     about its past activities. In the end, the DPRK agreed to \n     permit IAEA access to the disputed (and any other) site by \n     the mid-point in the LWR project.\n       No turning back: South Korea has already shifted from \n     analyzing the framework to implementing it. No critic of the \n     agreement believes it is renegotiable or that we would be \n     better off without it. In fact, the Koreans are worried that \n     U.S. domestic debate on the Framework could inadvertently \n     lead to results that threaten their interests. ROK analysts \n     point out that the perceived threat the U.S. might renege on \n     the deal only encourages the North to retain and strengthen \n     its leverage to forestall us. And in the event of any U.S. \n     retreat from the Framework, they fear the DPRK might stop \n     cooperation with the IAEA, expel the inspectors, restart \n     plutonium production, and reprocess its accumulated spent \n     fuel--returning us to the situation that prevailed this \n     summer.\n                             Six months ago\n\n       U.S. pressure: We veered as close to armed conflict on the \n     Korean Peninsula in 1994 as at any point since the 1953 \n     Armistice. The U.S. attacked DPRK non-compliance to IAEA \n     requirements in the UNSC and mobilized support for economic \n     sanctions. We took a firm line and--to the great discomfort \n     of many South Koreans--came close to an exodus of U.S. \n     citizens and a massive augmentation to U.S. military forces.\n       DPRK defiance: The North Koreans remained intransigent. \n     There was no sign they would capitulate; instead, Pyongyang \n     began to speed up its nuclear program. Experts believed the \n     DPRK could withstand economic sanctions for some time, \n     particularly with Chinese help. The ROK feared that North \n     Korea would lash out in response to sanctions. Predictions \n     included provocations on the DMZ; punitive military attacks \n     on Seoul by commandos, artillery, missiles, and possibly even \n     chemical weapons; terrorist acts in Seoul, Tokyo and \n     Washington; or the extreme scenario of a full-fledged \n     suicidal attack on the ROK. Only when we found a way to \n     return to negotiations did the DPRK begin to reverse its \n     hardline positions.\n       Strains on the Alliance: Anti-U.S. feelings were evident in \n     South Korea during this period. A misperception took root \n     that the U.S. was baiting a wounded but dangerous animal--\n     gambling with Korean lives and property in defense of its \n     global non-proliferation policy or, less flatteringly, U.S. \n     business interests.\n\n\n                          Six months from now\n\n       In the Region: The U.S.-ROK alliance is stronger than ever \n     and we are working as partners to see the Framework to a \n     successful conclusion. The DPRK nuclear threat gave birth to \n     a three-way partnership: the U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral \n     alliance. North Korean efforts to find a seam to exploit have \n     been frustrated. At the same time, China has been prevented \n     from wielding influence without responsibility or reaping \n     benefits without investment in the settlement.\n       Prospects: By mid-1995, KEDO should be operating under U.S. \n     leadership, investing Japanese capital, and overseeing a ROK \n     contractor who will build the LWR project in the DPRK. The \n     ROKG is satisfied with its central role in KEDO and the LWR \n     project. Seoul is encouraged by early DPRK cooperation with \n     the IAEA and the U.S. technical delegation negotiating the \n     stabilization and shipment of the spent fuel. While sensitive \n     to the risk that the opening of U.S.-DPRK liaison offices \n     will reawaken anxieties in the South, the ROKG has taken a \n     constructive position, recognizing that liaison offices will \n     be critical in settling problems during the process of \n     implementing North Korea's agreements.\n       Prying loose the shutters: In the weeks since the agreement \n     we have acquired a great deal of information about North \n     Korea and stand to uncover more. U.S. nuclear experts have \n     visited its nuclear installation. IAEA inspectors have \n     gathered significant new information of direct value in \n     evaluating DPRK nuclear capability in the event that \n     Pyongyang decided to abrogate the agreement. DPRK diplomats \n     and negotiators have been exposed to the U.S. and have \n     revealed information about their system and its problems that \n     gives us important clues. Americans are entering the DPRK for \n     a first-hand look. In the process, we are loosening the \n     hermetic seals that have kept out foreign ideas and \n     influences, and bringing that country closer to freedom.\n       For South Korea: Since talk of UN sanctions gave way to \n     U.S.-DPRK talks in Geneva, the Korean stock market has shot \n     up: adding some $30-plus billions of wealth to the Korean \n     economy and aiding U.S. investors and businessmen. The South \n     Korean focus has measurably shifted away from a cold war \n     fixation on beating the North--a mindset that spawned anti-\n     democratic laws and policies that the U.S. has worked to \n     erase. Instead, the ROKG has adopted measures to spur \n     economic intercourse with the North, promoting trade and \n     investment as a means to reduce tensions on the peninsula and \n     accelerate reform in the DPRK. The South's interest now is in \n     developing the North's resources and integrating it into this \n     prosperous region. Not only can that strategy benefit the \n     U.S. economy, it also gives North Korea a stake in the game \n     that works to our advantage: something to lose from \n     misbehavior.\n\n\n                      Maintaining U.S. Leadership\n\n       Like us, the ROKG is watching the DPRK's performance and is \n     keeping its powder dry. Seoul is not about to let North Korea \n     evade the terms of the settlement, which the ROKG has \n     embraced as a blueprint for solving the nuclear threat and \n     for transforming the DPRK. The leaders of the U.S., the ROK, \n     [[Page S525]] and Japan stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Jakarta \n     and promised to make the Framework succeed. The UN Security \n     Council formally welcomed and endorsed it. The IAEA has \n     blessed it and has begun performing its part. For the U.S. to \n     abrogate that settlement would precipitate a crisis, not only \n     with the DPRK, but a crisis of confidence in U.S. leadership \n     throughout Asia. It would compound the difficulty of any \n     effort by the U.S. to employ UNSC sanctions against the North \n     in response to the renewed DPRK nuclear activity that would \n     surely follow. If, on the other hand, the DPRK balks at \n     living up to its commitment, the U.S. retains the full range \n     of options in deterring, coercing, or punishing the North \n     Koreans.\n       Implementation of the terms of the Framework, as the North \n     Koreans repeatedly pointed out, will compel the DPRK \n     systematically to strip itself of a nuclear capability. But \n     far from achieving its major objective--normalization and an \n     end to the U.S. embargo--North Korea faces precisely the same \n     set of requirements that has confronted it for years. \n     Pyongyang must make significant progress in accounting for \n     and returning MIA remains, towards ending weapons and \n     ballistic missile sales to the Middle East, in reducing the \n     conventional military threat, in improving human rights \n     practices, and the rest of the broad agenda of U.S. concerns. \n     The South Koreans, who share these concerns and have many \n     more of their own, believe that the significant leverage the \n     U.S. retains will be an important tool for influencing DPRK \n     behavior in the non-nuclear area.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                        Seoul's Second Thoughts\n\n       With the new leadership in Congress taking a hard look at \n     the recent Geneva Agreement Framework between the United \n     States and North Korea, it seems worthwhile to ask how South \n     Koreans view it, since they are the ones that will be most \n     affected by it and the ones who will carry the largest share \n     of the cost.\n       It is true that, despite the closeness of U.S.-ROK \n     consultation in both Geneva and Seoul throughout the course \n     of the negotiations, and although the outcome met our joint \n     objectives and priorities, the settlement was initially \n     greeted with criticism and even some dismay in Seoul. Just \n     before the completion of the Geneva talks, President Kim \n     Young Sam himself voiced some caustic comments about American \n     foreign policy in an interview with the New York Times. The \n     real issue behind the criticism, however, was the pain that \n     Koreans felt because they were not at the table in \n     negotiations that were of such paramount importance to their \n     nation. Still, it is interesting to see how much Seoul's \n     early criticisms (most of which, like President Kim's \n     interview, came before the agreement was final--let alone \n     public) parallel the more recent comments by the new \n     Republican leadership in Congress. ``We gave away too much.'' \n     ``We are waiting too long to find out about the past.'' ``How \n     can we trust the North Koreans to keep their word?''\n       Here in Seoul, however, after a few weeks of close \n     inspection and vigorous public debate, public opinion has \n     shifted unmistakably in favor of implementing the agreement, \n     and there is no serious thought of turning the clock back. In \n     fact, President Kim recently announced a policy of \n     encouraging economic ventures in the North. While North Korea \n     pretends to spurn this initiative, its officials already have \n     begun to welcome South Korean business trips to Pyongyang. \n     The opportunity of doing business in the North has been a \n     lure to the South for several years. Furthermore, since the \n     U.S. and North Korea agreed to return to negotiations six \n     months ago, the investment climate in Seoul has improved \n     remarkably, and the Seoul stock market has shot up more than \n     20% for an apprecitation of some 28 billion dollars in the \n     equity market. These economic indictors speak worlds about \n     the way business views the reduction in tensions.\n       Partly as a gesture of reconciliation but also shrewdly \n     assessing the future, President Kim, in a major policy speech \n     last August, offered to build Light Water Reactors for the \n     North. Even those who have complained that Seoul is having to \n     carry too large a share of the financial burden acknowledge \n     that the Light Water Reactor can be viewed as a long-term \n     investment in Korea's future. And while everyone would prefer \n     to have the secrets of the past unlocked now, the fact is \n     that the agreement requires the North to open up all of its \n     nuclear facilities before the core nuclear components will be \n     installed in the first Light Water Reactor. Meanwhile, the \n     production of weapons-grade plutonium has been stopped, dead.\n       Only a few months ago, the United States was headed \n     resolutely towards U.N. sanctions, which the North had \n     declared would be ``an act of war.'' During the previous six \n     months, the United States had enhanced its military \n     capability significantly by the introduction of Patriot \n     Missiles, Apache Helicopters and Counter-Fire Radars to check \n     the enormous strength of the North Korean artillery along the \n     DMZ. Our resolve to defend the Republic of Korea and our \n     preparations for any eventuality did not go unnoticed by the \n     North. We discouraged North Korean adventurism while \n     encouraging them to negotiate.\n       While many South Koreans preferred the status quo, \n     sustained through mutual deterrence for 40 years, the fact is \n     it had been irrevocably shattered by the aggressive nuclear \n     program of the North, leading to a situation totally \n     unacceptable to the United States, the Republic of Korea, and \n     the the international community. Washington and Seoul agreed \n     that we had to act, either by inducing the North Koreans to \n     relinquish their nuclear program through negotiations, or by \n     forcing them to give it up. Mindful of the risks, we were \n     prepared to pursue the latter course if negotiations did not \n     work. Since the North had already isolated itself from the \n     world, the effect of sanctions would have been limited. And \n     with more than a million men under arms near the DMZ, the \n     provocation of a weak and possibly unsteady regime could well \n     have brought nightmarish results. No South Korean wanted to \n     take that chance.\n       Those here who have claimed that we have rewarded North \n     Korea's bad behavior have been reminded that the agreement \n     calls not only for North Korea to meet all of the NPT \n     conditions, but to go far beyond them: no further \n     construction of new reactors and no reprocessing; and in the \n     end, the demolition of all the facilities associated with the \n     present program. We tend to overlook how much the North is \n     actually giving up--years of enormous investment in their \n     ultimate and prized symbol of independence. United States \n     technicians have even visited the nuclear site at Youngbyon, \n     an event unthinkable a few months ago.\n       Of course the jury is still out on whether this agreement \n     will finally work. After all, North Korea has been an enemy \n     for more than forty years, and as long as its nuclear and \n     conventional threat remains, we will continue to be prepared \n     and wary. The settlement is driven by performance, not by \n     trust. But the International Atomic Energy Agency has \n     confirmed that Pyongyang has taken the first steps in the \n     agreement, and South Korea and the Northeast Asia region are \n     breathing a little easier now with the reduction of tensions \n     and the prospect of opening up the North.\n  Mr. DOLE.
