Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying \nH.R. 1817, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1817) making appropriations for military construction, family \n     housing, and base realignment and closure for the Department \n     of Defense for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and \n     for other purposes, having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     the conferees.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 14, 1995.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Under the previous order, there will \nbe 20 minutes of debate equally divided between the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Burns], and the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], or their \ndesignees. There will be 10 minutes under the control of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], and there will be 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain].\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nconference report on military construction appropriations for fiscal \nyear 1996.\n  The conference report is within the 602(b) budget allocation for both \nbudget authority and outlays. I would like to mention just briefly some \nof the provisions in this conference agreement.\n  First, the conferees agreed with the Senate and approved $3.9 billion \nfor the implementation of the base realignment and closure decisions. \nThis amount includes $785 million for the 1995 round. There is also \n$457 million for environmental cleanup of these facilities. It has been \na difficult year for all of us in this area, and I am hopeful that \nthese funds will relieve some of \n\n[[Page S 14108]]\nthe burden that has affected the communities and what they are \nexperiencing with these base closings.\n  Mr. President, 38 percent of our bill is for family housing. We have \nincluded Secretary Perry's initiative for a new family housing program. \nWe are hopeful that this will start to relieve some of the burden in \nkeeping adequate housing for our service people.\n  With regard to the barracks and dormitories, we provided $675 \nmillion. We are hopeful that the Department will soon begin another \nprogram to provide alternative methods of housing our service members. \nWe cannot afford to continue to build brandnew barracks when we still \nhave people living in open bays.\n  The conferees did agree to earmark 430 million dollars' worth of \nfunds for the National Guard and Reserve. The Department continues to \nignore the needs of our citizen soldiers, and we will not ignore them, \nbecause we are keenly aware of the vital role they play in the defense \nof this country.\n  We did not fund any armories this year. This has been a difficult \ndecision. However, we want the National Guard to take a hard look at \nwhere we are going with armories. There are about 3,000 armories in the \nUnited States, and we cannot keep adding new ones. In these austere \ntimes, the overhead has become too much of a burden.\n  This is the first year for me on this subcommittee, and I look \nforward to the process next year. We have just begun to change on how \nwe build and maintain our facilities for the military.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada, with whom I have \nworked closely on this bill, and the conferees in the House, because I \nthink we have come through with a bill that is fair and balanced. We \nhave kept everybody informed exactly on what we have been doing, and we \nhave also taken a look at what the administration wants to do and some \nof the needs that might have been overlooked by the administration.\n  So I yield the floor to my friend, the ranking minority member, the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, at this time, I ask Senator Bingaman to go \nahead and use his 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to speak on this \nlegislation. I wish to speak in opposition to the conference report on \nH.R. 1817, which is the fiscal year 1996 Military Construction \nAppropriations Act.\n  I opposed the bill when the Senate debated it in July, and now the \nconferees, in my view, have brought back an even worse bill with even \nmore add-ons for Member interest projects.\n  We hear much these days about the need for deficit reduction. \nCritical domestic programs, such as education and health care and \nenergy assistance for the poor and civilian research are being \ndecimated by the Republican Congress on the grounds that we absolutely \nmust fulfill the electorate's mandate to balance the budget by the year \n2002.\n  Committees throughout the Congress are busily reporting their \ncontributions to the reconciliation bill and including provisions that, \nin my view, will do major damage to our Nation's health and future \nprosperity.\n  We have already debated some appropriations bills that make major \nreductions in critical programs, such as Indian education and health. \nWe will soon be debating others which decimate domestic programs in \nhousing, education, and many other areas.\n  While these domestic programs are being cut to the bone, we have \nbefore us now a conference report that includes 129 Member interest \nprojects not requested by the Pentagon.\n  The projects, totaling $795 million, are spread among 45 States--all \nexcept Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Texas \ntops the list with nine add-on projects, totaling $47 million. Kansas \nhas five projects worth $33.5 million and, accordingly, is another big \nwinner.\n  Mr. President, this bill makes a mockery of all the protestations \nabout deficit reduction coming from this Congress and leading \nRepublican candidates. In my view, the President should veto this bill. \nThe President was not stingy in his request for funding for military \nconstruction projects. His fiscal year 1996 military construction \nbudget proposed a 22-percent increase; that is nearly a $2 billion \nincrease above the 1995 level. He put particular emphasis on the needs \nfor family housing and implementation of base closure and realignment \nrecommendations.\n  What this Congress is now proposing to send to the President is a \npork-laden bill with a net addition of $479 million above the \nPresident's budget request. Essentially, this so-called fiscally \nconservative Congress is saying that a 22-percent increase in military \nconstruction is not enough, that the increase needs to be 28 percent.\n  Mr. President, where else are we saying that this year? Outside of \nthe defense budget, is there a single major discretionary or mandatory \nspending category that is growing 27 percent? I cannot think of a \nsingle one. I can think of a lot that are being cut at least 28 \npercent. In reality, the increase is even larger because many of the \nso-called cuts made in the bill are phony. They will just pay the bills \nin future years. A few large projects are stretched out so that we can \ndefer paying the total bill until some future fiscal year. For example, \n$92 million is postponed from the third phase of a project in the Army \nInstitute of Research in Maryland out of $119 million requested.\n  I could give other examples. Unfortunately, this bill has sailed \nthrough both Houses with bipartisan support. There is so much money \navailable to spend in this area that there has been plenty to allocate \nto interest items on the Democratic as well as the Republican side. \nWhen Senators McCain, Kerrey, and I attempted on July 21 to trim $300 \nmillion out of the Senate version of the bill that had at the time \nabout 100 unrequested projects, we were defeated 77 to 18. That vote \noccurred minutes after the Senate had given final approval to the $16 \nbillion in rescissions in domestic programs for fiscal year 1995.\n  The President has not condoned business as usual on this bill in the \nCongress. Throughout the budget process, the administration has \nexpressed strong objections to the hundreds of millions of dollars in \nunrequested military construction projects. OMB Director Alice Rivlin \ntold Senate Appropriations Chairman Hatfield on July 18 that ``with the \nNation facing serious budget constraints, such a spending increase is \nnot affordable.''\n  The American people are not clamoring for additional spending for the \nPentagon. What little support there is for increased Pentagon spending, \nin my view, will dwindle further when the public realizes how the \nadditional funds would be spent by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I hope that President Clinton will not associate \nhimself with this bill. He should use his bully pulpit to explain to \nthe American people that there are better uses for this money, \nincluding deficit reduction and education and health.\n  The American people want a strong defense. They also want a brighter \nfuture for their children through investments in education and \nresearch. They want a society that does not turn its back on those \nleast able to fend for themselves. Our defense is not strengthened by \nsquandering money on projects that the Pentagon has not requested. If \nCongress insists on doing so, the American people should hold us \naccountable for these misplaced priorities.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to set aside the narrow parochial \ninterests and to resist the temptation of the easy press release about \nhow good this bill is for bases in their home State, and to cast a vote \nagainst this conference report in the national interest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from New \nMexico have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 3 minutes, 20 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator allow that time to be used by Senator \nGlenn?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am pleased to yield that time to Senator Glenn.\n  Mr. GLENN. I appreciate that. Mr. President, I will be brief today.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to raise my concerns over the pending \nfiscal year 1996 military construction conference report.\n  The conference agreement provides a total of $11.2 billion in funding \nwhich is \n\n[[Page S 14109]]\n$480 million more than the budget request; $775 million of that amount \nis for military construction projects for which the Pentagon made no \nrequest.\n  I have mixed feelings about this conference report, Mr. President. I \nstrongly disagree with the practice Congress has developed over the \nyears, with the tacit assent of the Pentagon, that results in $770 \nmillion in unrequested projects being included in the bill.\n  Members are expected to get military construction projects added to \neach year's bill in order to demonstrate that he or she can bring home \nthe bacon. This, in part, results from the Pentagon's recurring failure \nto adequately fund Guard and Reserve construction requirements. The \nPentagon does not request these projects but, instead, expects Congress \nto add these projects to the budget.\n  The result is a skewing of priorities, in my opinion, Mr. President. \nRather than informing Congress of what is really needed, projects are \nfunded based on a given member's ability to get the funding included in \nthe authorization and appropriations bills. The Senator from Arizona \nand I contacted Secretary Perry earlier this year to express our \nconcern over this practice and asked that the Guard and Reserve \nrequirements be included in the budget request.\n  As I mentioned, I have mixed feelings about this year's conference \nreport because, even though we are still engaging in the practice of \nadding close to a billion dollars in projects, on the Senate side, we \nhave adopted a set of criteria by which to measure add-on requests. I \nhave worked on those criteria over the years with the chairman of the \nReadiness Subcommittee, the Senator from Arizona. And, I am pleased \nthat the appropriators followed those criteria this year as well.\n  I do not think it is too much to ask, Mr. President, that a military \nconstruction project meet certain minimum standards like being a valid \nmilitary requirement, being in the service's 5-year program or having \nthe project be sufficiently designed to be able to begin the project in \nthe year in which it is authorized and appropriated. Quite frankly, if \na project does not meet these criteria, we should not be including it \nas a military construction project.\n  Unfortunately, there are projects in this conference report that do \nnot meet the standards we have set. I understand that these projects \ncame over in conference from the House, but there are several that are \nnot included in the 5-year plan and there is one that the Army simply \ndoes not want. I hope we can continue our efforts to clean up the add-\non process so that we do not end up with these kinds of projects being \nfunded in the future.\n  I will add that I think we are making enormous progress in this area. \nWe used to have sheets and sheets of these things that came over. \nAlmost every member on the committees over there, and also here, wanted \nsomething put in to sweeten the pot to show back home that they made a \nspecial effort. This year we are down to very few--practically none in \nthe Senate, and about a dozen or so, or 15 or 20 from over in the \nHouse.\n  There are several important positive things about the conference \nreport that are worthy of support. The BRAC accounts are fully funded--\nthese projects are important so that we can get closed back into \nproductive use. Secretary Perry's housing initiative is fully funded--\nwe are hopeful that this new approach will work to leverage limited \nfunds to get new housing for our troops and their families. And, there \nis a considerable number of barracks, family housing projects, health \ncare centers, and child care centers that will add to service members' \nquality of life.\n  All in all, I can support this conference report, Mr. President, but \nI felt compelled to outline my concerns on the add-on issue. I would \nhope next year we can see, for the first time, no add-ons that do not \nmeet the criteria.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield so I can propound a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, first of all, I ask for the yeas and nays \non the adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur \nat 10:20 this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Ohio for all his \nefforts on behalf of bringing about a rational and reasonable process \nin allocating scarce taxpayer dollars for military construction \nprojects. I also agree with my friend from Ohio that we have made \nsignificant progress. There has been a dramatic decrease in the numbers \nof MilCon properties that have been added--if I might say bluntly, pork \nbarrel projects--over the years.\n\n  I say to my friend from Ohio, we have a long way to go. There are in \nthis bill 21 projects that came from the House of Representatives that \nhad no--no--relation to any national security requirement, was not on \nany person's list, was not any requirement by the Defense Department \nand simply was added on because it clearly related to members of the \ncommittee of oversight.\n  Let me also point out there is one here on the Senate side which \njumps out to me. It is from the State of West Virginia.\n  Now, there is no rationale for that project. There is no rationale \nfor the 21 that are from the House. There is also a distortion in the \nprocess which Senator Glenn and I are working on with the Secretary of \nDefense, and that is that when we take from the future years defense \nplan MilCon projects we are given a list of several thousand projects \nthat would be proposed over the next 5 or 6 years.\n  What Senator Glenn and I are proposing to Secretary of Defense Perry \nis that now the Department of Defense prioritize their list 1 through \n2,000 or 10,000 or whatever it is, so when we pick additional \nprojects--and Mr. President, I deeply regret the reality there will be \nadditional add-ons which I will talk about, whether we should be adding \non money for military construction projects or other priorities as \narticulated by the Secretary of Defense, the President of the United \nStates, and all of the Joint Chiefs--when we do have add-ons, at least \nthere will be a priority list.\n  Now, some of these additions that meet the criteria that Senator \nGlenn and I were working on come from projects that were not planned by \nthe Pentagon until the year 2001. That is not appropriate, either, I \nsay to my dear friend from Ohio. We have to narrow this down and make \nit a lot better.\n  Again, I appreciate the fact that Senator Glenn and I have been able \nto work on this issue in a bipartisan fashion now for some 8 years. I \ndo believe that we are making some progress.\n  I do not mean my remarks to be critical about the hard work of the \nchairman of the subcommittee, and the ranking member from Nevada. I \nbelieve that they have done a very dedicated job and I appreciate their \nefforts.\n  I point out that there are $706 million of add-ons in this bill, $480 \nmillion above the President's request and there are 110 new projects.\n  Mr. President, I wrote a letter on August 9 to the four military \nservice chiefs and I asked them to comment on their priorities for add-\nons. I want to talk about this because I hear from people who support \nthese additional projects. ``Well, we are doing this for the good of \nthe men and women of the military. We have to improve their lifestyle. \nWe have to make sure that their living conditions are better,'' et \ncetera, et cetera. No one is more dedicated to that proposition than \nthe service chiefs.\n  The service chief priorities, all four I wrote to, with the exception \nof the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, said their priorities are \ndifferent than those of the members of the Military Constructions \nAppropriations Subcommittee.\n  Admiral Boorda said, ``* * * there is no issue more important to Navy \nthan our long-term shipbuilding and TACAIR procurement requirements.''\n  General Krulak, ``My first program priority is for those initiatives, \nboth ground and air, that will enable us to out-maneuver and out-shoot \nour opponents on tomorrow's battlefield.'' \n\n[[Page S 14110]]\n\n  General Fogleman, ``At the top of the list are * * * F-22, * * * \nstrategic airlift, * * * additional six F-15E's and six F-16 block 50 \naircraft * * .''\n  On and on and on. I got the same response from the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  So, we should not be a little deceived at our zeal for the betterment \nof the men and women in the military. All of us share that commitment \nand desire. But the fact is that this is not in keeping with the \npriorities of the service chiefs and the Secretary of Defense.\n  Since 1990, we have had $5 billion--billion, Mr. President--add-ons \nwhich are not requested by the Secretary of Defense for military \nconstruction projects.\n  Now, we have done some good things. There is a new effort at better \nhousing conditions for the men and women in the military, and military \nfamilies.\n  In the Readiness Subcommittee and in the Personnel Subcommittee we \nworked very hard on seeing that initiative move forward. We took a step \nforward on improvement of barracks. That is the rational way to do it.\n  It is not rational, Mr. President, to add 21 projects which have no \nrequirement whatever by the Department of Defense. Hypervelocity \nballistic range facility at Redstone Arsenal, AL; a fire station at \nGrissom Air Force Reserve Base in Indiana; electrical system upgrade at \nPicatinny Arsenal, NJ; Stallion Range Center water development project \nat White Sands Missile Range; infantry platoon battle course and \nantiarmor tracking and live-fire range at Fort Drum, NY; Coscom health \ncenter and SOF barracks at Fort Bragg.\n  Notice, Mr. President, most of the 21 add-ons that came from the \nother body have nothing to do with quality of life. There are some, but \nmost of them in my view are simply pork barrel projects.\n  A foundry renovation at Philadelphia Naval Shipyard; modified record-\nfire range at Tullahoma Training Site in Tennessee; dining facility at \nFort Bliss; a highway overpass at Fort Sam Houston; a BEQ expansion in \nCorpus Christi; small craft berthing pier at Ingleside; dormitory at \nFairchild Air Force Base, WA; family housing at several other places.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to point out 37 States are \nrepresented on the Defense Committee or 74 percent of the total States. \nMr. President, 34 of these States got add-ons in this bill, 84 projects \ntotaling $537 million, representing 75 percent of the total adds that \nwere awarded to those 34 States. Mr. President, I do not think it is \ncoincidence.\n  Mr. President, General Shalikashvili, responding to questions from \nthe Armed Services Committee was clear and unequivocal in his \nprioritization of additional funding, did not mention military \nconstruction. He said:\n\n       Contingency funding is at the top of the list for any \n     additional funding provided by Congress. . . priorities for \n     additional 1996 funding would include the accelerate of \n     warfighting enhancements identified in the Bottom-Up Review. \n     . . other priorities would include funding critical \n     modernization and procurement requirements that have slipped \n     in the future year's defense plan.\n\n  None of the service chiefs or the Chairman cited any specific \nmilitary construction projects as a high priority for additional \nfunding.\n  Now when we stand up here and talk about how this bill is for the \nbetterment of the men and women in the military, I repeat, the service \nchiefs and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary \nof Defense have the same zeal and dedication to their betterment.\n  They also know that they have to have the weapons with which to fight \nand die. General Mundy, before my subcommittee, stated he wanted the \nwife of a marine officer or enlisted person to be living in a very \ndecent house but he did not want that person to be living in a decent \nhouse when the chaplain came to tell her that her husband was killed \nbecause he did not have the proper war-fighting equipment with which to \nsave his life.\n  I think that is as important a statement as I have ever heard and \nencapsulates my opposition to the $5 billion we have added since 1990 \nin unneeded and unwanted military construction add-ons.\n  Last year, the Congress added over $1 billion for specific \nunrequested military construction projects, and I believe this bill is \ntoo high, but it is only two-thirds of that amount, and I believe that \nis progress of a sort.\n  I want to talk a moment about two projects which demonstrate the \nillogic of the decisions of funding add-ons. One is an add-on of $6 \nmillion for renovating a foundry at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. \nThe funds are used to bring the facility up to occupational standards \nto be utilized by the Navy at some point in the future.\n  This project was not requested by the Navy, nor was it included in \nthe Navy's long-term funding plan. It does not meet the Senate's \ncriteria, and not included in the Senate's version of the bill, but it \nsurvived in the conference agreement. I do not understand why this \nproject was chosen as a high-priority military requirement by the \nconferees.\n  The other probability that I want to talk about is the addition of \n$10 million for the Barstow-Daggett Airport facility. This project was \nnot requested. In fact, it was specifically rejected by the Army in a \nletter dated September 12 in which the Secretary of the Army stated \nthat the project was not necessary because of better, cheaper and more \nreadily available facilities at Edwards Air Force Base, yet the House \nadded $10 million for the projects for the conferees and the conferees \nincluded in their agreement.\n  Let me note that I do not intend to include this project in the \nmilitary construction authorization conference report and I believe \nSecretary Perry should include both of these projects in his list of \nrescissions of low-priority military construction projects.\n  Mr. President, I want to tell the chairman and the manager of the \nbill and the distinguished minority member, the Senator from Nevada, I \nintend to send a letter to the Secretary of Defense and the President \nseeking for him to submit to Congress a list of rescissions. I hope we \nwill have passed that line-item veto legislation by then so that the \nPresident could simply line-item veto it.\n  Mr. President, I cannot point solely to the Appropriations Committee \nfor continuing the egregious practice of adding funding for unrequested \nmilitary construction projects.\n  With the addition of $7 billion to the overall defense budget \nrequest, I must admit that the Armed Services Committee was not able to \nresist the temptation to fund Members' special interest projects. One \nauthorization conference report will likely authorize most of the added \nprojects in this bill, even over my objection.\n  The American people sent a message to Congress last year that things \nin Washington had to change, but unfortunately this bill shows just how \nmuch they have not changed.\n  I mentioned already the amounts of money. Mr. President, 37 States \nare represented on either or both the Armed Services and Appropriations \nCommittees, and 34 of those States got projects. Mr. President, 84 \nState projects totaling $503.7 million, or 75 percent of the total add-\nons, are awarded to those 68 percent of the States which are \nrepresented on the committee. The list goes on and on. The bottom line \nis 86 percent of the States receiving add-ons in this bill are \nrepresented in the committee.\n  It seems to me there is a shift occurring, and I am glad to see some \nof it happening, though. The $700 million added for unrequested \nprojects as well as more than $5 billion added over the past 5 years \nwere added directly for high priority programs supported by the armed \nservices.\n  As I noted before, the services need money for modernization, \nreadiness, and other valid military requirements, not for military \nconstruction projects selected by Members of Congress. I recognize the \nfutility of expecting Congress to stop adding money for military \nconstruction projects, but I think it is time to make those allocations \nbased on the military services' priorities rather than location.\n  This year is the first year, as Senator Glenn pointed out, the Senate \nused, or was supposed to use, the evaluation criteria for Member add-\nons which were adopted last year in the 1995 Defense Authorization Act. \nThese criteria were set forth in a sense-of-the-Senate provision, and \nwere designed to allow the Senate to evaluate Members' requests for \nadditional military construction projects. Now that we have completed \nmost of the review cycle, I \n\n[[Page S 14111]]\ndiscovered an oversight in the criteria, which I mentioned before, and \nwe need to correct that. I hope we can correct it soon.\n  I intend to add to the established criteria a requirement that \nrequests for add-ons be screened for priority against the relevant \nservices' unfunded military construction priorities. In this way, the \nhighest priorities can be funded first.\n  Another serious concern I have about this bill concerns the inclusion \nof projects which do not meet the criteria of last year, and I have \nalready discussed that.\n  We still have a long way to go in the fight to eliminate pork barrel \nspending from the military construction bill in both the authorizing \nand appropriating cycles. The good news is that the total amount of \nmilitary construction add-ons this year will be only two-thirds of the \n$1 billion added last year. In just 1 year, that is progress.\n  The bad news is that when additional funds are available for Defense, \nit is difficult to argue successfully that none of these additional \nfunds should be spent for military construction projects. My colleagues \nshould also consider that it will be even more difficult next year to \nprovide additional funding for Defense. Balancing the budget has become \nthe most urgent priority facing the country.\n  Another consideration of which my colleagues should become aware is \nthe potential of a veto of the 1996 Defense appropriations bill. The \nPresident has threatened a veto in large part because of the additional \n$7 billion added to Defense. If the Defense bill is vetoed, Congress \nmay be forced to cut back on some of the added spending in that bill, \nspending which was allocated principally to the modernization program \nso important to our military service chiefs.\n  The question I put to my colleagues is: What share of any reduction \nin defense spending will be allocated to military construction? That \nmay be a very important question.\n  The conference report in some ways represents a significant \nimprovement, but I believe we have a long way to go. I am glad to see \nthe conferees did not add funding for any projects which were not \nincluded in either the House or the Senate versions of the bill. Of \nthat I am deeply appreciative. There are many other laudable provisions \nin the bill, particularly the new family housing initiative which will, \nI believe, begin to solve the daunting problem of undertaking a massive \noverhaul of military housing across the Nation.\n  I want to summarize by saying, in case some of my colleagues have not \nrecognized it, defense spending overall has come under intense scrutiny \nand intense criticism throughout America. Many Americans do not \nunderstand why we are spending as much money as we are on defense in \nlight of the fact that the cold war is over. They do not understand why \nwe are purchasing post-cold-war relics such as the B-2 bomber and \nSeawolf submarine. They certainly do not understand why we add on \nmilitary construction projects which have no relevance to national \nsecurity requirements.\n  The problem that we are facing, all of us, is maintaining the \nconfidence of the American people that their tax dollars which are \nearmarked for defense are being spent wisely. If we continue to fund \nunneeded and unwanted projects, we will see further cuts in defense, \nwhich in my view will endanger our ability to defend this Nation's \nvital national security interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to take that into consideration as they consider \nprojects which are relevant only to their home State or district.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Montana \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 5 minutes. The \nSenator from Nevada has 10 minutes. And the Senator from Arizona has 3 \nminutes left.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the distinguished President pro tempore \nrequire?\n  Mr. THURMOND. About 4 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield him 2 minutes of my time and the Senator from \nMontana will yield 2 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. BURNS. That will be good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to compliment Senator Burns and \nSenator Reid for their leadership in arriving at this conference. This \nmilitary construction bill mirrors the construction priorities and \ncriteria for projects established by the Armed Services Committee. I am \nparticularly pleased by the emphasis placed on projects that will \nenhance the quality of life of the men and women in our military and on \nprojects which will enhance the readiness of our Armed Forces. The bill \nalso fully funds the base closure account request and provides the \nnecessary funds to support environmental compliance projects. Both are \nareas which have historically been used as sources of funds for other \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, I believe overall this is a good conference report, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Although I urge the adoption of this conference report, I do not \nfavor every item in it. If I had my way, I would have eliminated some \nof the add-ons, and other parts of the report. But this Appropriations \nCommittee--and I am not a member of that committee--has studied this \nmatter well. They have come up with this report. It is not perfect. No \nreport is perfect. No report pleases everybody. But as a whole, this \nreport will provide for the needs of the Defense Department and the men \nand women of our Armed Forces. I think it is important to our Nation \nand to our defense.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt the report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the distinguished \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Burns from Montana, in presenting \nthis conference report on military construction for the next fiscal \nyear. I also want to extend my appreciation to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, the President pro tempore of the Senate, \nfor his statement in support of this conference report.\n  There is no one in the Senate who has more authority, more \nexperience, and more ability in speaking about military readiness of \nthis country than the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. It \nmeans a lot to the two managers of this bill to have him on the floor \nsupporting this conference report.\n  This conference report fulfills an obligation to fund downsizing of \nour extensive military overhead, extensive basing system, and fully \nfunds the implementation of the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission. That is a sizable chunk of this bill, almost $4 billion. \nMore than a third of the dollars appropriated in this measure go to the \nBase Realignment and Closure Commission.\n  So the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Nevada really were \nin an uphill battle in arriving at the conference report we did, when \nwe start out using approximately one-third of the dollars appropriated \nfor base closing and realignment.\n  There are two other aspects of the bill which merit the Senate's \nattention. It goes a long way to getting our hands around the long-\nneglected problem of housing for our military families and for our \nsingle soldiers. Housing has always taken a back seat to more urgent \nnear-term military requirements.\n  But it is the feeling of the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nMontana that housing is an important element of maintaining a safe, \nsecure, and contented military.\n  This year, as the distinguished chairman has pointed out, some 38 \npercent of the bill is for housing. The new initiative by Secretary for \nprivate sector participation in new housing is included in the bill. \nIndeed, the committee has included about $179 million above the \nPresident's request for this housing. All of it, and more if we could \nafford it, is needed to bridge the gap that must be overcome in order \nto be able to maintain a high quality All-Volunteer Force in the years \nahead. The request by the administration could have been higher, and I \nwill give you an example. There were zero dollars in the request for \nwhole barracks \n\n[[Page S 14112]]\nrenewal at one major western Army facility.\n  It is in Hawaii. The structures are some 50 years or more old. They \nhave had it. The conference committee wisely included $30 million for \nthis project, money which was in the 5-year defense program, but only \nin future years. When we asked the Army why the barracks had no funding \nat all in fiscal year 1996, there was no coherent answer. So the \nsubcommittee took what I think was a prudent step in beginning this \nproject. This is but one example of actions which we took that put our \nfinal bill above the budget request by about $480 million over the \nPresident's request.\n  Mr. President, a similar story can be told for the funding of the \nReserve and Guard Forces of our country.\n  Mr. President, it is traditional that the Pentagon never asks for \nmoney for the Guard and Reserve. I repeat: It is traditional. When we \nhave this bill before us, we have an obligation to our Guard and \nReserve Forces to fund them. It really is unfair what this \nadministration has done and past administrations have done in funding \nthe Guard and Reserve.\n  If we are going to continue to be ready to deploy and fight in the \nPersian Gulf, or Korea, or elsewhere, and reduce the size of our Active \nForces, we must maintain robust Reserve and Guard Forces. \nUnfortunately, the administration followed past practice this year and \nseriously underfunded these accounts.\n  I cannot understand why this administration and past administrations \nignore the Guard and Reserve. I do not understand. Well, I do. They do \nit because they know that we are going to take care of it. And I say \nthis, Mr. President, we are going to continue, as long as I am part of \nthis committee, to try to take care of our Guard and Reserve Forces \nregardless of how the administration ignores them, because it is an \nimportant and it is becoming a more important part of the national \nsecurity of this country.\n  Consider these figures--in fiscal year 1995 the Congress appropriated \n$574 million for the Reserves and Guard, while for fiscal year 1996 the \nadministration requested only $182 million.\n  They did not even ask for a third of what was given last year to the \nGuard and Reserve.\n  So the committee had little choice but to dramatically increase the \nfunding for projects in these accounts not requested for fiscal year \n1995, and appropriated some $430 million. So on the one hand we ended \nup some 25 percent below fiscal year 1995, we were still $248 million \nabove the President's request. If we had just met the President's \nrequest, we would soon have a Reserve Force not ready to fight. That is \nclearly the case.\n  Mr. President, the administration wrote to me and the chairman, \nproviding its views on the bills passed by each Chamber and before we \nwent to conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1995.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Subcommittee on Military Construction Appropriations, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on H.R. 1817, the Military \n     Construction Appropriations Bill, FY 1996, as passed by the \n     House and by the Senate. As you develop the conference \n     version of the bill, your consideration of the \n     Administration's views would be appreciated.\n       The Administration is committed to balancing the Federal \n     budget by FY 2005. The President's budget proposes to reduce \n     discretionary spending for FY 1996 by $5 billion in outlays \n     below the FY 1995 enacted level. The Administration does not \n     support the level of funding assumed by the House or Senate \n     Committee 602(b) allocations. The Administration must \n     evaluate each bill both in terms of funding levels provided \n     and the share of total resources available for remaining \n     priorities. Both the House and Senate versions of this bill \n     exceed the President's request by over $450 million.\n       The Administration has recognized the need for significant \n     funding increases for military construction programs by \n     proposing an overall increase of 22 percent over the FY 1995 \n     enacted level. However, the Administration believes that \n     further increases, as provided by both the House and the \n     Senate, are unwarranted, particularly when other legislation \n     is drastically cutting programs that are vitally important to \n     a higher standard of living for all Americans. Because the \n     Administration has serious concerns about the overall \n     priorities reflected in the appropriations process, we \n     believe that it is essential to reduce the total funding \n     level provided in this bill.\n\n\n                           funding priorities\n\n       The Administration appreciates the support of the House and \n     Senate for funding the request for the base realignment and \n     closure program, the family housing program, and requested \n     construction projects. The Administration particularly \n     appreciates the approval of funding for the family housing \n     improvement program. The funding provided will enable the \n     Department of Defense to improve the quality of life of our \n     military members.\n       The Administration notes, however, that both the House and \n     the Senate have provided approximately $650 million in \n     funding for unrequested construction projects. Many of these \n     projects are funded at the expense of high-priority requested \n     projects, and a number of these unrequested projects are not \n     included in the Defense Department's long-range plan. The \n     Administration strongly urges the conferees to eliminate \n     unrequested funding for low-priority programs.\n\n\n                         overseas construction\n\n       The House version of the bill provides $65 million, as \n     requested, for high-priority prepositioning projects at \n     classified locations overseas. The Senate has recommended \n     eliminating funding for these projects. Failure to pursue \n     these projects would increase military response time to areas \n     of particular importance to the U.S. and discourage further \n     cooperation by affected countries. Prepositioning on land is \n     a cost-effective way to permit our armed forces to react to \n     threats quickly and with the necessary military capability. \n     The conferees are urged to adopt the House position and to \n     provide the funding requested for these projects.\n\n\n                         environmental cleanup\n\n       The Administration objects to the House and Senate language \n     that would limit funding for environmental cleanup at base \n     realignment and closure sites. The Base Realignment and \n     Closure (BRAC) accounts were created with a great deal of \n     flexibility to permit DOD to allocate BRAC funds to the \n     programs and locations with the greatest need at the moment. \n     Constraining DOD's ability to apply BRAC funds to \n     environmental cleanup could, if estimated requirements \n     change, delay the transfer of base property to local \n     redevelopment authorities, worsening the economic impact on \n     the affected communities. The Administration urges the \n     conferees to uphold the flexibility of the BRAC accounts and \n     to support the affected communities by removing these \n     artificial ceilings.\n\n\n                       chemical demilitarization\n\n       The House version of the bill provides $95 million, as \n     requested, for continued construction of two chemical \n     demilitarization facilities at Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and \n     Umatilla, Oregon. The Senate has recommended eliminating \n     funding for these two projects in the belief that unobligated \n     appropriations for construction of a chemical \n     demilitarization facility at Anniston, Alabama, would be \n     available for the projects. Contract award for the Anniston \n     facility, however, is scheduled during FY 1996. To help \n     maintain the construction schedule and prevent cost increases \n     in the chemical demilitarization program, the conferees are \n     urged to adopt the House position and to provide the funding \n     requested for these two facilities.\n       The Administration believes that the suggested changes \n     discussed above would result in a fiscally responsible bill \n     that funds programs of national significance. We look forward \n     to working with the conferees to address our mutual concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the conference committee did make the \nserious effort to accommodate the administration on a number of items. \nWe added some $65 million for an overseas construction item, in the \nMiddle East, which the Senate had zeroed out in order to give the \nadministration some incentive to secure matching funds of some kind \nfrom the recipient country.\n  We did not get those matching funds. But we acceded to the \nPresident's request, and the request of the House, and met that $65 \nmillion figure in conference. Such funds have not been secured, but we \nacceded to the administration's request in any event. Second, the \nadministration asked to be relieved of a statutory ceiling on the \namounts to be appropriated for environmental cleanup in the BRAC \nprocess. Here too we completely acceded to that request in the \nconference. Third, the administration wanted to reinstate funding for \nchemical demilitarization facilities which the Senate eliminated. In \nthis case, the conference included planning and design funds for the \nprojects. So I think it is fair to say we made a good faith effort to \nmeet the administration's objections to the Senate bill. \n\n[[Page S 14113]]\n\n  I say to the administration that they are making a mistake even \nthinking about vetoing this bill. This bill passed the House 326 to 98. \nIt does not take much math to understand that is not very good material \nfor vetoing. I believe this bill will pass the Senate by the same large \nmargins because it is a good bill. It meets the problems of this \ncountry.\n  Therefore, I think the administration should look hard and \nsympathetically at the committee's efforts to adequately fund the Guard \nand Reserve, and to adequately fund our housing needs in considering \nwhether there was arguable justification for going above the \nPresident's request in its final appropriations recommendation. Nearly \nall the additional funds the committee added above the President's \nbudget were dedicated to quality-of-life housing and Guard and Reserve \nprojects. Therefore I strongly encourage the President to sign this \nbill and join with us in attacking the problems which the committee \nrecognized as important to our Nation's national security.\n  Mr. President, every project in this bill is for the national \nsecurity of this country. I believe if we look at the Guard and \nReserve--and we had a caucus on the Guard and Reserve which was \nbipartisan and chaired by Senator Bond and cochaired by Senator Ford. \nThey support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. It is a bill that meets the \ndemands of our national security interests.\n  I would like to say it has been a pleasure to work closely with the \ndistinguished chairman on this measure. We have had an open, bipartisan \napproach to the problems of base closure, family housing, Reserve and \nGuard forces, and the other matters in this bill. It could have been a \ndifficult conference. I think the work we did in pre-conferencing made \nit a relatively easy conference. We have not had any significant \ndisagreements.\n  I thank the chairman for his support and for the chairman's staff \ndirector, Jim Morhard, and his assistant, Warren Johnson, as well as \nDick D'Amato assigned to me by the full committee leadership. I also \nappreciate the work of B.G. Wright, a congressional fellow working on \nthis bill, and also Peter Arapis of my staff.\n  Mr. President, this legislation could never have been accomplished \nwithout the leadership of the chairman, the distinguished Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Hatfield, and the ranking member, the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Senator Byrd. I extend to them also my \nappreciation.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the chairman \nof the Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, for his comments, because all of these issues were talked \nabout in the Armed Services Committee and have been authorized by that \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, the ranking member, the Senator from Nevada, is \nexactly right on target. We worked very hard on this because we took a \nlook at the inventory of housing that we had for our armed services. We \nfound that half of that housing was substandard. It would not even be \nqualified to be inhabited under today's standards.\n  We have taken a giant step toward this with this piece of \nlegislation. So I appreciate his cooperation and enjoyed working with \nSenator Reid on this.\n  I appreciate the work of Dick D'Amato and his staff, and also Jim \nMorhard and Julie Lapeyre, who worked hard to make this a very good \nbill and a balanced bill.\n\n\n                      gulfport air national guard\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the distinguished chairman and manager \nof the bill yield for a clarification?\n  Mr. BURNS. I would be pleased to yield to the assistant majority \nleader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my friend from Montana. I note that the conference \nreport includes funding for a road relocation project at the Gulfport \nAir National Guard base in Gulfport, MS. The funding level associated \nwith this project in the conference report is half the amount required \nfor the entire project.\n  The conference report, however, does not note that the funding \nprovided for this important project is only half the total required. Is \nmy understanding correct that the funds provided for this project in \nthe conference report is specifically designated for phase 1 of this \neffort--and that next year phase 2 of this project will be addressed?\n  Mr. BURNS. I appreciate my friend from Mississippi raising this issue \nand I am pleased to clarify the scope of this project. The funds \nprovided in this conference report for the road relocation project in \nGulfport, MS, are intended to pay the first half of the cost for the \ntotal road relocation effort. This phase 1 effort is intended to begin \nthe job of relocating the road. It is my hope that the second phase of \nthis funding effort will be in the 1997 military construction \nappropriations request.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if I could join my colleague, Senator \nLott, in this discussion, I would like to add that the full amount of \nthe project was included in the Senate reported military construction \nappropriations bill. I know very well the difficult negotiations \nrequired to move this appropriation bill through the conference \ncommittee. I know that great effort was made to secure this funding for \nthe road relocation project and I appreciate his diligence on this \nissue.\n  I would like to ask the chairman of the committee if this phase 1 \nfunding will allow the Department of Defense to initiate actions, \ncontractual or otherwise, to start this project in fiscal year 1996?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the conference committee's decision to \ninclude funding for phase 1 of this project was intended to initiate \nactions to execute this project in fiscal year 1996, including contract \naward and initial construction. I would note that the project is in the \nSenate defense authorization bill currently in conference, and under \nthe authority which will be provided by the adoption of that conference \nbill, the Department should proceed in due course to execute all \nactions required to perform this work. We hope to pay for this work in \ntwo phases--not just one.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the attention of the chairman to this \nimportant project, as well as the invaluable assistance of my colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Cochran.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I join Senator Lott in expressing appreciation to the \nchairman for his diligent efforts on this issue and many others in this \nimportant bill. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the \nconference agreement accompanying H.R. 1817, the fiscal year 1996 \nmilitary construction appropriations bill.\n  The bill provides a total of $11.2 billion in budget authority and \n$3.1 billion in new outlays for the military construction and family \nhousing programs of the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1996.\n  When outlays from prior year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill totals $11.2 billion in budget \nauthority and $9.6 billion in outlays for fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, the bill provides for readiness and quality of life \nprograms for our service men and women. The bill is at the \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation in budget authority and the bill is \nbelow the subcommittee's 602(b) allocation in outlays.\n  I wish to convey my thanks to the committee for the support given to \nseveral priority projects in New Mexico, including a learning center at \nHollomon Air Force Base.\n  I commend the distinguished subcommittee chairman, the Senator from \nMontana, for his efforts on this bill.\n  I urge the adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Budget Committee table \nshowing the final scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION SUBCOMMITTEE                   \n  [Spending totals--Conference report (fiscal year 1996, in million of  \n                                dollars)]                               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                      Category                       authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense discretionary:                                                  \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........     6,486\n  H.R. 1817, conference report.....................     11,177     3,110\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Adjusted bill total..........................     11,177     9,597\n                                                    ====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary............................     11,178     9,693\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary..........................         -1       -96\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be \nprinted in \n\n[[Page S 14114]]\nthe Record a communication to the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction, the Committee on Appropriations, \nthe Honorable Conrad Burns, signed by the Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy, explaining the need for housing at Sugar Grove, WV.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Navy,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 1995.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Military Construction, Committee on \n         Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in response to your inquiry \n     regarding the requirement for family housing at NSGA Sugar \n     Grove, WV.\n       As you are aware, adequate housing is the top quality of \n     life issue the Navy faces today. We currently have a deficit \n     of 44 housing units at NSGA Sugar Grove. The remote location \n     of this base makes it extremely difficult for the private \n     sector to accommodate the housing needs of Navy personnel. \n     The project added to this year's military construction \n     appropriations bill will meet approximately half of our need.\n       With a total family housing deficit of 14,700 we were \n     unable to program this project within the resources \n     available. While this does not diminish the need for these \n     units, they were not included in the President's budget.\n       I trust this answers your question.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on H.R. 1854 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1854) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of July 28, 1995.)\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring the legislative \nconference report to the floor of the Senate this morning. I want to \nbegin by expressing my appreciation to Senator Murray. While we did not \nagree on every issue as we worked our way through this, we did agree to \nwork together to bring a bill to the floor that the Senate could \nsupport and, in fact, could be proud of.\n  We began this process early in the year with a resolution being \npassed in conference indicating we wanted to make substantial \nreductions in funding of the legislative branch.\n  We have, under this bill, reduced spending for legislative operations \nby almost 9 percent. That is a reduction in real terms from last year's \nlevel. Again, not some projected increase and a reduction from that but \nfrom actual levels from last year.\n  We, in fact, did take on some controversial issues, and they were \ndebated in full on the floor of the Senate with respect to the Office \nof Technology Assessment. In conference, there was further debate on \nthat issue and the House, in fact, receded to the Senate's position and \nagreement was reached that the Office of Technology Assessment should \nbe eliminated.\n  In addition to that, the bill called for--well, I should back up. The \nresolution passed earlier in the year by the Republican conference \ncalled for a 25-percent reduction in the General Accounting Office. We \nhave, in essence, reached that objective, but we are going to do it in \na 2-year period.\n  Under this bill, or with this conference report, we will reach the \nobjective of a 15-percent reduction in the General Accounting Office in \n1996, with the remainder of those reductions to take place in the next \nfiscal year.\n  Again, we worked with Chuck Bowsher on this issue, and our feeling \nwas that rather than for us to micromanage how these reductions would \nbe made over this 2-year period, we concluded it would be best to work \nwith the GAO and, in essence, ask them to devise a plan about how they \nwould reach those objectives.\n  They came back to us with a proposal. We felt, again, listening to \nwhat they had proposed and asking us to give them some flexibility, \nwhich we have done in this conference report, there was general \nagreement that we should go forward with the effort to reach that goal. \nIn fact, we have done that now, and I think that both the House and the \nSenate can be proud of the approach that we took with respect to the \nGeneral Accounting Office.\n  In addition to that, we suggested that the Sergeant at Arms and other \nsupport agencies of the Congress should make reductions. There is a 15-\npercent reduction in committee staffs. We asked the Sergeant at Arms, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, and others, to meet a goal of a 12.5-\npercent cut. Some of those agencies--in fact, the Sergeant at Arms came \nup with cuts of greater than 12.5 percent.\n  So all in all, Mr. President, I will say that we have reached our \nobjective. We have done it in a manner the Senate can be proud. \nTherefore, I encourage my colleagues to support this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table relating to the \nconference agreement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S 14115]]\n\n\n

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the conference \nagreement on H.R. 1854, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 1996. Compromises between the House and Senate version of \nthis bill were necessary in order to reach this agreement, and I am \npleased that we were able to work out our differences cooperatively.\n  The appropriations made in the conference report total \n$2,184,856,000. This is a $205,698,700 below the 1995 level, and \nroughly $5 million below the Senate-passed bill.\n  I want to at this time express my appreciation and respect for \nSenator Mack, the subcommittee chairman. He handled this bill in a very \nopen, nonpartisan manner. He took his responsibility seriously and he \ndid a very excellent job, and he was really good to work with. I thank \nhim publicly for the hard work he has done on this bill.\n  We did not agree on every issue. I am particularly concerned about \nthe elimination of the Office of Technology Assessment. However, \nSenator Mack made sure all views on this subject were fully aired in \nconference before we settled this issue.\n  In the end, we were able to get some protection for OTA workers to \nensure that they are not thrown out on the street the moment this bill \npasses. I \n\n[[Page S 14118]]\nwant to thank our chairman for his help with that matter, as well.\n  I also want to take a moment to express a few personal thoughts about \nthis bill. This bill cuts over $200 million out of the congressional \nbudget. That is about a 10-percent cut. In this time of fiscal \ndeficits, and the need to reduce spending, I believe we did it the way \nit should be done--line by line, program by program, bill by bill. We \nthought this through and made tough, but sensible, decisions. Most \nimportantly, we are showing we can lead by example in the battle to \nreduce Federal spending by cutting Congress first.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the conference \nreport. It makes sense, and it sets the right tone in the broader \neffort to reduce spending.\n  (Mr. CAMPBELL assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1854, the \nlegislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996.\n  The bill, as reported provides $2.1 billion in new budget authority \nand $2 billion in outlays for the congress and other legislative branch \nagencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Government Printing Office, among others.\n  When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.2 billion in budget authority \nand $2.3 billion in outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's \n602(b) allocation by $35 million in budget authority and $2 million in \noutlays.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe Legislative Branch Subcommittee for producing a bill that is \nsubstantially within their 602(b) allocation.\n  I am pleased that this bill incorporates most of the changes endorsed \nby the Republican Conference last December and achieves the goal of \nreducing legislative branch spending by $200 million from the 1995 \nlevel. It is important that the Congress set an example for the rest of \nthe country by cutting its own spending first.\n  Another important feature of this bill is that it provides an \nincrease of $1.1 million over the 1995 level for the Congressional \nBudget Office to enable that agency to meet the new requirements that \nwere created in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act passed earlier this \nyear.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this conference report.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a Budget Committee table showing the \nfinal scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                     LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SUBCOMMITTEE                    \n  [Spending totals--conference report (fiscal year 1996, in millions of \n                                dollars)]                               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Budget           \n                                                     authority   Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNondefense discretionary:                                               \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................  .........       202\n  H.R. 1854, conference report.....................      2,125     1,977\n  Scorekeeping adjustment..........................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal nondefense discretionary............      2,125     2,180\n                                                    ====================\nMandatory:                                                              \n  Outlays from prior-year BA and other actions                          \n   completed.......................................         92        92\n  H.R. 1854, conference report.....................  .........  ........\n  Adjustment to conform mandatory programs with                         \n   Budget Resolution assumptions...................         -2        -2\n                                                    --------------------\n      Subtotal mandatory...........................         90        90\n                                                    ====================\n      Adjusted bill total..........................      2,215     2,270\n                                                    ====================\nSenate Subcommittee 602(b) allocation:                                  \n  Defense discretionary............................  .........  ........\n  Nondefense discretionary.........................      2,167     2,188\n  Violent crime reduction trust fund...............  .........  ........\n  Mandatory........................................         90        90\n                                                    --------------------\n      Total allocation.............................      2,257     2,278\n                                                    ====================\nAdjusted bill total compared to Senate Subcommittee                     \n 602(b) allocation:                                                     \n    Defense discretionary..........................  .........  ........\n    Nondefense discretionary.......................        -42        -8\n    Violent crime reduction trust fund.............  .........  ........\n    Mandatory......................................  .........  ........\n                                                    --------------------\n      Total allocation.............................        -42        -8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1244.\n  The bill will be stated by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1244) making appropriations for the government \n     of the District of Columbia and other activities chargeable \n     in whole or in part against the revenues of said District for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year \n1996 District of Columbia appropriations bill to the Senate. The bill \npresented is within the subcommittee's allocation and contains a \nFederal payment of $660 million, which is the authorized amount and the \nsame amount as last year.\n  I should make clear that the Federal payment is not a gift from the \nFederal Government to the local government, it is a payment in lieu of \ntaxes. More than half of the District's property is untaxable to the \nlocal government. Of course all Federal property and buildings are \nexempt, but so are many other valuable properties in the city. In \naddition to foreign embassies and offices, also unavailable for tax \npurposes are facilities owned by entities with congressional charters. \nProperties such as the National Geographic Society, the International \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary \nFund, the Inter-American Development Bank, and all of the hospitals and \nuniversities in the city are also exempt. The properties I just listed \naccount for more than $1 billion in value that is not taxable to the \nDistrict.\n  In addition, the Congress restricts the city's taxing power in other \nways. The District is prohibited by law from taxing income earned in \nthe city by those who live in the suburbs. This is no small amount. The \nCensus Bureau estimates that of the $33 billion earned annually by \nindividuals in the District, $19 billion is earned by nonresidents--\nover half--and therefore completely escapes District taxes.\n  This past year many of the District's financial problems came to a \nhead. Fiscal year 1994 ended with a record deficit of $335 million. In \nan unusually cooperative endeavor Members of the House and Senate \nworked together, along with the Office of Management and Budget, to \ncraft legislation which established a five-member unpaid financial \ncontrol board for the District. The board, formally known as the \nFinancial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority, has been \nworking since June 1, and has made a significant contribution to the \nbill we are recommending to the Senate today.\n  The bill before us represents the recommendations of the authority of \nthe District's fiscal year 1996 budget. The authority is a powerful new \nplayer in the District's budget process. This authority must approve \nannual budgets and multiyear financial plans developed by the Mayor.\n  This authority is designed to provide the kind of day-to-day and \nmonth-to-month oversight as well as fiscal expertise that the Congress \nis neither designed nor inclined to exercise. The authority has the \npower to require the city to change its budget estimates of both \nrevenues and expenditures. If the estimates are unrealistic and the \ncity does not make the necessary changes, \n\n[[Page S 14119]]\nthe authority can implement those changes on its own.\n  Each year between now and fiscal year 1998, the District is permitted \nto submit and operate with an unbalanced budget, as long as it makes \nprogress toward a balanced budget. This will give time to Congress and \nthe local political leaders to address some of the issues concerning \nour relationship to the local government.\n  On July 15, the authority made recommendations to the city council \nfor changes in the budget that the District had adopted in May. On \nAugust 1, the council responded by adopting an amendment in their \nbudget. Finally, on August 15, the authority submitted to Congress the \nDistrict's response to their recommendations. The committee's bill is \nbased upon these recommendations.\n  The District has a long way to go to be a well-run, efficient, and \nfinancially stable city. With the control board in place, we have made \nimportant first steps.\n  On September 14, the chairman of the authority, Dr. Andrew Brimmer, \ntestified before our subcommittee that the authority is developing a \npositive, working relationship with city officials based on \ncooperation. At a recent budget summit, where authority representing \nthe city officials questioned various agencies about their budget, Dr. \nBrimmer testified that the discussion focused on improving the city's \nservices, accountability, and getting the information necessary for \nmanagers and decisionmakers.\n  Those inquiries came from both the authority and the senior district \nofficials. Of course, the proof will be in the doing, but the start is \ngood. I am really pleased with the way they have been working.\n  While the control board will be charged with overseeing the \nrestoration of the District's financial health and improving its \nmanagement effectiveness, the Congress must review the complete \nrelationship with the local government. Its fiscal problems are not \ncaused by lack of revenue. The city elects and spends more than $3 \nbillion of local revenue each year. That ought to be enough to operate \nthis city.\n  In order for the city to maintain its long-term financial health, we, \nthe Congress and the Federal Government, must reevaluate our \nrelationship with the city in a dispassionate discussion with the \nDistrict residents and their elected representatives. When we began \ndrafting the control board legislation, we asked the General Accounting \nOffice to talk to people in other cities that have had similar \nfinancial difficulties and established similar boards about their \nexperiences.\n  One factor that everyone volunteered in our interviews was that the \npoor quality of public schools had exacerbated the middle-class flight \nfrom that city and was a major impediment in economic development. This \nis not just an economic development issue. Nationally, we are creating \na generation of kids that cannot read or write properly.\n  This is not just bad educational policy; it is a devastating \nimplication for unemployment, welfare, and crime policy in the near \nfuture, and especially in our cities like Washington. Each kid that we \ndo not teach to read is a lost asset to this Nation, and we cannot \nafford to let our national assets decay. The District is no exception. \nWe do not need to recite all the statistics.\n  Washington, DC, spends more per student than any other school \ndistrict yet has the poorest student outcomes on standardized tests of \nany school district. We have old, high maintenance school buildings and \ntoo many of them. The problems of the District schools have been \nstudied over and over and proposal after proposal has been made, but \nsomething happens between the commitment to reform and the \nimplementation of a plan. It is time that we stop studying, analyzing, \nand strategizing, and start implementing and holding accountable those \nwho are responsible for realizing set goals.\n  Mr. President, the committee is recommending establishment of a \ncommission to hold consensus around public school reform in the \nDistrict. I emphasize consensus. The seven-member commission will be \nmade up entirely of local citizens charged with working with the school \nboard and the superintendent to develop and implement a reform plan. I \nemphasize working with the school board and the superintendent to \ndevelop and implement a reform plan.\n  What we are providing is the structure for effecting reform, not \ndictating what the details of that reform should be. I want to \nemphasize that again. It is a structure for effecting reform, not \ndictating what the details of that reform should be.\n  Some District leaders have reacted to this proposal with charges that \nit thwarts home rule and circumvents the citizens of the District, \ncharges which I might add were made before having access to the entire \nproposal. Mr. President, to make these charges is to completely ignore \nand cast scorn on what Congress has been all about this last 9 months. \nThe District of Columbia is in trouble fiscally, managerially, and I \nthink most important, educationally in public schools.\n  In difficult times, the city of Washington has no one to turn to but \nthe Federal Government. We, the Congress, and the citizens of the \nDistrict are partners in whatever happens to this city. We are partners \nin finding solutions to all these difficulties that Congress \nspecifically and the Federal Government generally must be careful not \nto dictate or impose solutions on the citizens of the city. We need \nconsensus.\n  Another important charge to the commission and the board is to \ndevelop a capital investment plan for the needed school buildings and a \nseparate funding mechanism to ensure that the work is done.\n  Mr. President, on August 14, 1995, the superintendent received the \nreport of the task force on education infrastructure for the 21st \ncentury. This report is an excellent description of the fiscal state of \nthe public schools and needed steps to remedy the deficiencies. It sets \nout in plain terms the current condition of the public schools in this \ncity.\n  Mr. President, 62 percent of the District's public schools are over \n45 years old but only 8 of the 163 operating schools have ever had \ntotal renovations.\n  There is an inability to accommodate educational programs and \ninitiatives and technology in these buildings. Continuing from the \nreport: ``There is no school building able to support a comprehensive \nvocational or career focus to prepare students for work in the 21st \ncentury.''\n  That is totally intolerable and unacceptable. Based on the current \nnumber of schools and administrative buildings, the task force \nestimates that it will cost $1.2 billion to restore these buildings to \na state of good repair and to modernize the schools and provide \ninfrastructure to support for technology that is available and will be \navailable.\n  This price tag is overstated because the first priority is to \ndetermine how many school buildings will be needed for the future \nstudent enrollment. Once the decision is made on how many and in what \nlocations school buildings are needed, a final cost estimate can be \nmade.\n  I am not just calling for the wholesale closure of school buildings. \nWe must take into consideration the fiscal condition of the current \ninventory as well as answer questions as, What effect will the success \nof economic development programs have on enrollment? Or, What effect \nwill the success of drop-out prevention programs have on the number of \nhigh schools needed?\n  Currently, with the discussion on a number of needed school \nbuildings, debate must begin on the funding mechanism. It is imperative \nthat this mechanism be under the control of the District of Columbia \nfinancial responsibility authority and that any debt issue to outside \nthe District's 14 percent of the local revenue cap on outstanding debt. \nWe are right at that cap right now for all of the other infrastructure \naspects of the city. There is no latitude in that, nor should it be \nused for the purposes of the school improvement program.\n  This latter point is necessary due to the extensive deferred \nmaintenance that exists in the system because the school fiscal \ninfrastructure has not been maintained routinely. The schools' normal \ncapital program cannot be expected to handle the high annual \nexpenditures that will be needed over the next 10 years.\n  In order for this new funding mechanism to be viable, it will require \na separate revenue stream for debt service. \n\n[[Page S 14120]]\n All potential sources will be considered, including a small dedicated \nshort-term reciprocal income tax to provide a stable and reliable \nsource for debt service funds. Another obvious source is the cash flow \ngenerated by the sale to the surplus school property.\n  These options should be explored by the control board, the board of \neducation, District council, and the Mayor along with all other \nregional and District groups of interest. Local or Federal legislation \nshould be developed that would facilitate creation of an appropriate \nfunding mechanism and source of income.\n  The bill also contains language that establishes a charter schools \ninitiative for District public schools to improve and encourage \ncommunity involvement. The subcommittee developed this initiative in \ncooperation with Senator Specter, who is very interested in this \nsubject and his help was important to its inclusion.\n  Charter schools offer great promise in reforming public education \nbecause they link the important factors of school-site autonomy, \nparental choice, regulatory flexibility, private sector initiative, \naccountability for student outcomes, and community participation. The \ncommittee believes that the autonomy of individual charter schools from \nexternal controls, such as those of the school district and union \nrequirements, is essential for their success.\n  To ensure charter schools' autonomy, the committee has defined them \nas public schools that operate with independence from the District of \nColumbia public schools as local education agencies. This definition in \nno way removes charter schools from the oversight of the District of \nColumbia public schools or other charter granting authorities. Unlike \ntraditional public schools, these schools must meet the terms of their \ncharters, including specified student outcomes. If not, their charters \ncan be revoked or not renewed.\n\n  I want to note the efforts of the current superintendent who has \nestablished schools-within-schools charters and enterprise schools \nwithin the public schools. These schools-within-schools share some of \nthe same attributes of our proposed charter schools but are chosen by \nonly one entity and are not as independent as they ought to be. It is \nour intention to build upon this good start, not reinvent the wheel.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I thank my other colleagues on the \nsubcommittee, our able ranking member, Senator Kohl, and my colleague \non our side of the aisle, Senator Bennett, who have attended our \nhearings and taken a genuine interest in the work of the subcommittee. \nFinally, I thank the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, the \nSenator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, and our distinguished ranking \nmember, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for the \nleadership and guidance we have received in bringing this bill before \nthe Senate today.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my formal presentation, I will be happy \nto answer any questions or consider any amendments that Senators may \nhave. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman, Mr. Jeffords, for his hard work and dedication in bringing \nthis measure to the Senate floor.\n  The fiscal year 1996 District of Columbia appropriations bill is the \nresult of a bipartisan effort. It cleared the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee by a vote of 28 yeas to 0 nays.\n  The bill includes a Federal payment of $660 million, which is the \nsame as the President's budget request and the previous year's level.\n  The bill also provides the overall budget for the District of \nColumbia. That budget has been developed and presented to the Congress \nby city officials and the Financial Responsibility and Management \nAssistance Authority for the District of Columbia, otherwise known as \nthe Control Board. The Control Board was created earlier this year by \nthe District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Act of \n1995.\n  The bill recommends a balanced budget for the District government. \nThe funding levels recommended in the budget are the same as those \nrecommended by the Control Board. The Board is expected to work with \nthe Mayor and City Council to oversee and make further reforms in the \nDistrict's budget, finances, and operation.\n  The bill would also establish a seven-member Commission on Consensus \nPublic School Reform. The Commission, which is strongly supported by \nthe subcommittee chairman, will seek to develop reform goals and \napprove and oversee annual reform implementation plans for the school \nsystem.\n  The bill would also establish procedures for public charter schools \nto open in the District, which would offer innovative educational \napproaches and opportunities to District students. In addition, the \nbill calls for city officials and the Control Board to develop options \nfor consolidating and modernizing the public school infrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I again commend the distinguished subcommittee \nchairman and urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is the bill open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The bill is open to \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2768\n\n   (Purpose: To improve order and discipline in District of Columbia \n                            Public Schools)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2768.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 53, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       (H) The Chief of the National Guard Bureau who shall be an \n     ex officio member.\n       On page 66, strike line 15 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 211. IMPROVING ORDER AND DISCIPLINE.\n\n       (a) Dress Code.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the first day of the 1996-\n     1997 school year, the Commission shall develop and implement, \n     through the Board of Education and the Superintendent of \n     Schools, a uniform dress code for the District of Columbia \n     Public Schools.\n       (2) Considerations.--The dress code--\n       (A) shall include a prohibition of gang membership symbols;\n       (B) shall take into account the relative costs of any \n     policy for each student; and\n       (C) may include a requirement that students wear uniforms.\n       (b) Community Service Requirement for Suspended Students.--\n       (1) In general.--Any student suspended from classes at a \n     District of Columbia Public School who is required to serve \n     the suspension outside the school shall perform community \n     service for the period of suspension. The community service \n     required by this subsection shall be subject to rules and \n     regulations promulgated by the Mayor.\n       (2) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect \n     beginning on the first day of the 1996-1997 school year.\n\n     SEC. 212. EXPIRATION DATE.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is no secret that over the years the \nDistrict of Columbia Public School System has suffered from a lack of \ndiscipline in the classroom. It appears that the situation is not \nimproving and is probably deteriorating. The lack of discipline in a \npublic school classroom by even one student can thwart the education \nprocess for the teacher and the students who want to learn. Mr. \nPresident, it is time to reclaim the classroom--for the teachers and \nfor the serious students--from the disruption caused by problem \nstudents lacking in self-discipline and a desire to learn.\n  I commend the distinguished Subcommittee Chairman, Mr. Jeffords. His \nis a thankless task. He has done a good job. One of his initiatives has \nbeen to propose the establishment of a seven-member Commission on \nConsensus Public School Reform. I will have more to say about that in a \nmoment.\n  Mr. President, the thrust of the amendment I am proposing builds upon \nthe initiative of the Subcommittee Chairman. In the first place, it \nproposes that any student suspended from classes at a District of \nColumbia Public School, who is required to serve the suspension outside \nthe school, shall \n\n[[Page S 14121]]\nperform community service for the period of the suspension.\n  Mr. President, often the misbehavior detected in the public school \nsystem is punished by a suspension; however, this suspension is very \noften looked upon as a vacation by the individual suspended. The thrust \nof my amendment is to see that any student that finds himself or \nherself suspended shall use that time to perform a community service. A \ncommunity service required by my amendment would be subject to rules \nand regulations promulgated by the Mayor. Thus, the individual under \nsuspension would not be rewarded by a week off of idle time, but would \nbe required to make some contribution to the community during that \ntime.\n  Students who are expelled and then left to their own devices tend to \nbecome bored and then, as a result, may get into further trouble. \nRequiring them to perform service for the community benefits the \ncommunity, provides supervision for the time the student is out of the \nclassroom, and demonstrates to the student that job opportunities will \nlikely be limited without the benefit of an education.\n  A second part of my amendment is related to a dress code. I am \nadvised that in the year since Long Beach, California, made uniforms \nmandatory for all elementary and secondary school students, the Long \nBeach School district has seen a 36-percent drop in school crime and a \n32-percent reduction in student suspensions. Many parents now spend a \ngreat deal of money on elaborate, fashion-conscious clothing ensembles, \nwhich cost far in excess of most uniforms. One reads newspaper articles \nabout young people fighting and even murdering each other over articles \nof clothing, high-priced tennis shoes, and so forth. A dress code would \nkeep obnoxious or inappropriate clothing out of the classroom, \nminimizing the differences between income levels among students, and \nremoving the focus from clothes and gang symbols and placing it, \ninstead, on scholarship and school activities.\n  The amendment I am proposing would implement through the Board of \nEducation and the Superintendent of Schools a uniform dress code for \nthe District of Columbia Public Schools. The dress code would include a \nprohibition of gang membership symbols; it should take into account the \nrelative cost of any policy for each student; and, it may even include \na requirement that students wear uniforms. It does not require that, \nbut this would be up to the District authorities. This modest proposal \nhas yielded improvements in discipline in some of the jurisdictions in \nwhich it has been employed, and it appears to be a worthwhile effort.\n  The third aspect of the amendment that I am proposing relates to the \ninitiative of the Subcommittee Chairman to establish a Commission on \nConsensus Reform in the District of Columbia Public Schools, to create \na consensus around reform goals and to oversee and monitor the \nimplementation phase of the reforms. This Commission, according to the \nSubcommittee's legislative proposal, will consist of a member appointed \nby the Senate Majority Leader; a member appointed by the Speaker of the \nHouse; two members appointed by the President--one who should represent \nthe local business community and one who is a teacher within the \nDistrict of Columbia public schools. Also, the President of the \nDistrict of Columbia Congress of Parents and Teachers and the President \nof the District of Columbia Board of Education, as well as the \nSuperintendent of Public Schools of the District of Columbia would be \nmembers of the Commission. The Mayor and Council Chairman would each \nname one non-voting, ex-officio member. The amendment that I am \nproposing would add the Chief of the National Guard Bureau as an ex-\nofficio member.\n  Mr. President, for the past two years, the National Guard has been \ndirectly involved in youth programs throughout the United States. \nDuring this time, the National Guard has had a direct and positive \nimpact on ``at-risk'' youth in over thirty states and territories \nthrough its sponsorship of five separate youth programs. I am told that \nall of these programs have been a success. With this in mind, I am \nrecommending that the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, Lieutenant \nGeneral Edward D. Baca, be an ex-officio member. The purpose would be \nto increase National Guard participation in the District of Columbia \nPublic Schools, so that a number of new and positive programs can be \npursued, which will tend to promote discipline in the District's \nschools and which will assist ``at-risk'' youth. The National Guard is \nan organization comprised of the local interested citizenry. They have \nproven themselves to be dedicated professionals, who have displayed \ntime and again their commitment not only to the national defense, but \nto the community as well.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I am proposing an amendment that would \ninitiate a program of community service for suspended students. It \nwould also propose a dress code and would strengthen the initiative of \nthe Subcommittee Chairman, by making the Chief of the National Guard \nBureau an ex-officio member of the Commission on consensus reform in \nthe District of Columbia public schools.\n  Discipline is a problem in classrooms all across America. Students \ncannot learn and teachers cannot teach when the classroom is disrupted \nby disorder, and, in many cases, even by fear of violence.\n  Jurisdictions around the country are trying to craft new approaches \nto curb classroom violence and restore sanity to our institutions of \nlearning. New approaches must be tried. I believe that the steps \nproposed in my amendment may enable the District's schools to get a \nhandle on some of the violence and disruptive behavior which are all \ntoo common in our Nation's classrooms.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2769 to Amendment No. 2768\n\n(Purpose: To limit the amendment to 2 school years in order to evaluate \n                    the effectiveness of amendment)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I send an amendment in the second degree to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2769 to amendment No. 2768.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, after line 25 insert the following:\n       (c) Expiration Date.--This section and the membership \n     provided in section 202(a)(2)(H) shall expire on the last day \n     of the 1997-1998 school year.\n       (d) Report.--The Commission shall study the effectiveness \n     of the policies implemented pursuant to this section in \n     improving order and discipline in schools and report its \n     findings to the appropriate committees of Congress 60 days \n     before the last day of the 1997-1998 school year.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment makes this a \npilot program. It very well may be instructive and helpful for the rest \nof the country to have a pilot program here in the District of \nColumbia. This would be a 2-year pilot program and would require a \nreport to the Committee of Congress after a 2-year period on the \neffected school discipline resulting from the initiatives embodied in \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both managers. I have discussed this \nmeasure with both the majority and minority managers. They have been \nvery careful in their study of the amendment. They will speak for \nthemselves in regard to it. But I do appreciate their cooperation and \ncourtesy, which are characteristic of both of them.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to commend the senior Senator \n\n[[Page S 14122]]\n  from West Virginia for what I think is an excellent suggestion as to \nhow we can help the District of Columbia find some of the answers that \nhave been lacking in our educational system in this country.\n  I think the pilot program to take care of those who get turned out of \nthe school system is an excellent one. One of the greatest problems we \nhave in the city of Washington and the cities throughout the country is \nkids that are dropping out and those that leave involuntarily. At the \nsame time nationally, we are cutting back on the number of young people \nthat are being brought into the military, and often those young people \nwho have that problem have found that the military has helped them \ngreatly in their ability to straighten their lives out and to get back \ninto the school systems and get an education.\n  I, therefore, am willing to accept both the second-degree amendment \nand the original amendment on this side of the aisle.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill for his comments in support of the amendment and for his \nwillingness to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I must reluctantly object to the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from West Virginia. While I \nbelieve this amendment has many fine parts to it, and it certainly is \nwell-intentioned, I believe that it would interfere with the \ndevelopment of a cooperative relationship between the Congress and the \nDistrict.\n  I have consistently supported the principle of home rule, and I \ncontinue to feel that it is a very important objective.\n  I do not intend to debate my distinguished colleague. But I do feel \nit necessary to lodge my objection. I hope at some point that we will \nhave a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I know there is a desire to stack votes \nso that Members will not be interrupted in their committee meetings. I \nsuggest at this time that this amendment be set aside so that the \nleaders can meet and give us a suggestion as to how we can proceed. I \nbelieve there may be one other vote on an amendment. The other \namendments, I believe, will be accepted.\n  So, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set \naside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2770\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on tax cuts and Medicare)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Dorgan) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2770.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the suspension of the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I object to suspending the reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to read the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON BUDGET PRIORITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year \n     1996 (H.Con.Res. 67) calls for $245 billion in tax reductions \n     and $270 billion in projected spending reductions from \n     Medicare;\n       (2) reducing projected Medicare spending by $270 billion \n     could substantially increase out-of-pocket health care costs \n     for senior citizens, reduce the quality of care available to \n     Medicare beneficiaries and threaten the financial health of \n     some health care providers, especially in rural areas;\n       (3) seventy-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries have \n     annual incomes of less than $25,000;\n       (4) most of the tax cuts in the tax bill passed by the \n     House of Representatives (H.R. 1215) go to families making \n     over $100,000 per year, according to the office of Tax \n     Analysis of the United States Department of the Treasury.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Committee on Finance and the Senate should approve \n     no tax legislation which reduces taxes for those making over \n     $101,000 per year; and\n       (2) the savings from limiting any tax reductions in this \n     way should be used to reduce any cuts in projected Medicare \n     spending.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the sole purpose of considering the \nfollowing amendments: An amendment by Senator Inhofe, an amendment by \nSenator Dole and myself, an amendment by Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. After those are taken care of, we would return to the \nstatus quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2771\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2771:\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following: ``None of \n     the funds provided in this Act may be used directly or \n     indirectly for the renovation of the property located at 227 \n     7th Street Southeast (commonly known as Eastern Market), \n     except that funds provided in this Act may be used for the \n     regular maintenance and upkeep of the current structure and \n     grounds located at such property.''\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I asked the clerk to go ahead and read it in its entirety \nso people could understand that this is simply a one-sentence, very \nsimple, straightforward amendment, one that I have had before this \nbody, successfully passed by the other body, on numerous occasions.\n  We have a very unique institution not far from the Capitol known as \nthe Eastern Market. The Eastern Market has a unique type of a character \nof its own. And for a number of years, there have been notions trotting \naround that it should be renovated and contracted out to various \npeople, against the wishes certainly of everyone I have ever talked to. \nThe neighborhood associations want to keep it as it is and the same \nvendors who have been in there, not for years, but for decades.\n  So, this would preclude, and it would be clearly the intent--I want \nthe Record to reflect this--that no funds directly or indirectly could \nbe used for renovation or for construction or for changing the \ncharacter of this institution; in other words, not using local funds to \nbe replaced with Federal funds. I think it is something we have dealt \nwith every year.\n  I will respond to any questions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma \nwould yield to me for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is that--I ask if it is correct--the \nSenator from Oklahoma is attempting to prevent the use of funds to \nessentially \n\n[[Page S 14123]]\ncome in and raze the Eastern Market and create a new gasoline station \nwith 26 pumps and 1 person working there, or for that matter a motel or \nan office complex.\n  I very much support what the Senator is doing. I supported him when \nhe did it in the House of Representatives. The Eastern Market, for \nthose who have never seen it, is a very unique place. It is a market \nwhere individuals come and set up fruit stands and sell fruits and \nvegetables, and they sell fresh meats over there.\n  It is a wonderful neighborhood magnet, unique in character. It has \nbeen there for many, many years. And I know a lot of people think \nprogress is knocking all those things down and paving it all over and \nbuilding something bright and shiny. Boy, I will tell you, it would not \nbe progress, in my judgment, to see the Eastern Market destroyed in \nthis town. It is a wonderful, wonderful thing.\n  I think the Senator's amendment makes a great deal of sense, and I \nsupported him previously on it. I compliment him on it.\n  Is it the case that the Senator is simply trying to prevent the \nrazing of the Eastern Market in one form or another and trying to \npreserve it in this town?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Either razing it or transforming it. It would lose its \ncharacter that it has had for the last 150 years. That is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am prepared to accept the amendment for this side.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, we are also prepared to accept the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2771) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2772\n\n          (Purpose: Making a technical correction to the bill)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2772.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2 at line 17: Strike ``$52,070,000'' and insert \n     ``$52,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is a technical amendment to bring \nthe printed bill into compliance with the committee's recommendations \nand the tables in the back of the committee report.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend the two floor \nmanagers of the bill, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, \nand their staff, for their excellent and efficient management of the \nFiscal Year 1996 Appropriations Act for the District of Columbia.\n  I would like to take a few moments to discuss an amendment I am \noffering on this appropriations bill. My amendment encourages agencies \nfunded under the bill to become more energy efficient and directs them \nto reduce facility energy costs by 5 percent. The agencies will report \nto the Congress at the end of the year on their efforts to conserve \nenergy and will make recommendations for further conservation efforts. \nI have offered this amendment to every appropriations bill that has \ncome before the Senate this year, and it has been accepted to each one.\n  I believe this is a commonsense amendment: the Federal Government \nspends nearly $4 billion annually to heat, cool, and power its 500,000 \nbuildings. The office technology assistance and the alliance to save \nenergy, a nonprofit group which I chair with Senator Jeffords, estimate \nthat Federal agencies could save $1 billion annually if they would make \nan effort to become more energy efficient and conserve energy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment will encourage agencies to use \nnew energy savings technologies when making building improvements in \ninsulation, building controls, lighting, heating, and air-conditioning. \nThe Department of Energy has made available for Governmentwide agency \nuse streamlined energy saving performance contracts procedures, modeled \nafter private sector initiatives. Unfortunately, most agencies have \nmade little progress in this area. This amendment is an attempt to get \nFederal agencies to devote more attention to energy efficiency, with \nthe goal of lowering overall costs and conserving energy.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, this amendment has been accepted to \nevery appropriations bill the Senate has passed this year. I ask that \nmy colleagues support it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this amendment that I am offering on behalf \nof Senator Bingaman is intended to reduce the energy costs of the \nFederal facilities for which funds are made available under this act. \nThis amendment has been attached to nearly all of the other \nappropriations bills and reemphasizes the energy conservation \nrequirements mandated under the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n  I understand that there is no objection on the other side of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment. \nWe believe it is a good amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2774) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the managers if they have any \nfurther business pending, or may I at this time offer my amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the unanimous-consent request that we \nhave allows the Senator to offer her amendment at this time provided \nthat she does not intend to require a vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2775\n\n (Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress and the President shall \n            not be paid during Federal Government shutdowns)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I send it up on behalf of Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole, Mr. \nBumpers, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Bryan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Dole, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Feingold, and \n     Mr. Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 2775.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . PAY OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT DURING \n                   GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Members of Congress and the President \n     shall not receive basic pay for any period in which--\n       (1) there is more than a 24 hour lapse in appropriations \n     for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure \n     to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing \n     resolution; or\n       (2) the Federal Government is unable to make payments or \n     meet obligations because the public debt limit under section \n     3101 of title 31, United States Code has been reached.\n       (b) Retroactive Pay Prohibited.--No pay forfeited in \n     accordance with subsection (a) may be paid retroactively.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the amendment I have just sent to the desk \nwould stop the pay for Members of Congress and the President during any \nperiod in which the Government fails to meet its obligations because of \nour failure to enact a budget. President Clinton supports this \namendment.\n  Americans are being warned every day that we may come to a train \nwreck over the budget. If we fail to enact appropriations bills by the \nend of the fiscal year or if the debt limit ceiling is reached, the \nGovernment will stop paying its bills and its debts. Small business \npeople holding Government contracts, senior citizens with questions \nabout their Medicare coverage, even major financial institutions \nholding Government securities would be severely impacted by that so-\ncalled train wreck.\n  Certainly there are major differences among Members of Congress and \nthe President over what our national priorities should be. Yes, we have \na Democratic President and a Republican Congress. But we were elected \nto work together, Mr. President. And I believe if we fail to do that, \nthe most basic job we are sent here to do, then we should pay a price.\n  The way this amendment would work is simple. If any part of the \nGovernment shuts down because of a lapse in appropriations for any \nFederal department or agency, or there is a shutdown because the debt \nceiling has been reached, Members of Congress and the President will \nnot get paid.\n  Mr. President, some here have raised legitimate constitutional \nquestions regarding this amendment. But I think the amendment is \nconstitutional. I think it sends an important message to the people \nacross the country that we understand that we are paid to do our jobs \nfully.\n  Today, the House Speaker threatened to take the Nation into default \nsaying, and I quote him, ``I do not care what the price is.'' Mr. \nPresident, this is the greatest country on Earth. We must not default \non our financial obligations. I truly believe my amendment will help \nprevent a Government shutdown. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment, and I hope that we will do it right now very quickly without \nfurther debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This amendment is acceptable to us on this side.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this side also accepts the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2775) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table. \n\n[[Page S 14125]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the rules, a Senator cannot reserve the \nright to object in calling off the quorum call.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An objection is heard. The clerk will continue \nto call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 5 minutes, and further, \nthat the Senator from North Dakota be allowed 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator has 5 minutes and the Senator from North Dakota \nhas 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I want to tell my colleagues who may be \nwatching these proceedings where we are and why we are where we are.\n  I offered an amendment some while ago, about half hour ago. We \nintended to offer a second-degree amendment to it to slightly modify \nit. We intended to get a vote on it. At that point, the Senate was put \ninto a quorum call. Since that time, two noncontroversial amendments \nhave been adopted. Except for this morning business, the Senate has \nbeen in a quorum call.\n  I wanted to use this 5 minutes to explain what this amendment was and \nwhy I am offering it and why there is no intent at all to delay the \nproceedings of the Senate today. I understand we want to finish this \nappropriations bill. I think we can do that quickly. On my amendment I \nwould agree to a very short time limit. I told the chairman of the \ncommittee I would agree to a half hour time limit, if necessary. So we \ncan finish this bill quickly.\n  My amendment does something very simple. Because the Finance \nCommittee in the Senate next week will deal with Medicare and Medicaid, \nand because we have proposals on the table for substantial cuts in \nMedicare, proposals that were included in the budget that call for a \nvery substantial tax cut, my amended is an amended amendment to try to \nsend the sense of the Senate to the Finance Committee about priorities. \nI suggest if there is a tax cut coming out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee --and I do not think we ought to cut taxes at this point; we \nought to keep our eye on the goal of reducing the Federal deficit. \nCutting taxes may be popular but, in my judgment, it ought to be \ndiscussed after we have managed to balance the Federal budget. My \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment is that if there is a tax cut that comes \nout of the Finance Committee, it be limited to those making $100,000 a \nyear or less. And by limiting the tax cut to those making under \n$100,000 a year, the savings could be used to reduce the cut that is \nanticipated in Medicare. It is a very simple amendment with respect to \npriorities.\n  I know people here will grit their teeth because of this amendment. \nBut the reason there is the requirement to offer it is that the \nminority will have very little opportunity in the Senate Finance \nCommittee; they are not involved in writing the bill. I am not \ncomplaining about that. That is the way the system works. The majority \nwon, they control, they write the legislation.\n  But we have an opportunity, it seems to me, to try to express \nourselves on priorities. The priority here is the juxtaposition between \ntax cuts and the cut in Medicare. I hope very much that if there is to \nbe a tax cut, it be a tax cut that is focused on those who earn less \nthan $100,000 a year. I was on a television program two mornings ago \nwith a member of the majority party. The member of the majority party \nsaid, ``Look, our tax cut is a family tax cut. It is going to go to \nworking families, modest-income families.'' I said, ``Then we will give \nyou chance to vote on it. As a matter of priorities, let us decide that \nis what we are going to do.'' That is what my amendment does. When we \ntried to second-degree it, of course, there was an objection to the \namendment being considered as read and, therefore, we were not able to \noffer the second degree, and the Senate was put into a quorum call.\n  I say to the chair that I have no intention of holding this bill up. \nBut this amendment is not going to go away either. You can second-\ndegree this amendment and do it three or four times, and I will offer \nit again as a second degree to something else, because I believe we \nought to have the right to vote on this. So it is not going to go away. \nWe can dispose of it very quickly. I will agree to a time limit. I have \nno intention of impeding the working of the Senate this afternoon. I \nhope very much that you will allow us the opportunity at an early time \nhere to vote on an amendment of this type.\n  Again, as I said, I think we should finish this bill this afternoon. \nThe timeliness of this amendment is--the Senate Finance Committee \nbegins work on this next week. I have no choice, really, but to offer \nthis at this point. It is not a breach of any agreement or a breach of \nunderstanding by anybody. It is not an attempt to stretch out the time. \nIt is about priorities in this country, and these are important \npriorities which I will speak on at a point in time when the \nopportunity exists for debate on the amendment itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14125-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14125-S14127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2770\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand the desires of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, and this obviously is a very important amendment. \nHowever, we are dealing with the appropriations bill for the District \nof Columbia. It is my intention--after a brief period of time for the \nleader to debate--to move to table the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President we have already discussed the amendment. I \nwonder if we need anymore time. It has been explained two or three \ntimes by the Senator from North Dakota. If we can just have 1 minute on \nthis side to explain our side, that would be sufficient. He has had 15 \nor 20 minutes. I do not see any reason for additional debate. A lot of \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle had hoped we might be finished \nwith this bill and the other conference report by 12:30.\n  If the Senator from North Dakota could accommodate that, we will be \nprepared to table the amendment immediately.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to the majority leader that I have not had 10 or 15 \nminutes to debate this, but 5 minutes under morning business.\n  I have no intention of delaying. If the Senator wants to proceed and \nthere will be a tabling motion, I accept that. I appreciate that. \n\n[[Page S 14126]]\n\n  I will ask for a couple more minutes, and if a colleague shows up who \nwants to speak, I hope we can accommodate a colleague, but I do not \nintend to string this out.\n  If your intention is to table this, we can move ahead quickly, but I \nwant a couple of additional minutes to talk about the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be allowed to debate his amendment for an additional \n4 minutes, and that the majority leader be given 1 minute, and after \nthat I will move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays \non the motion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, without a second-degree?\n  Mr. DOLE. No second-degree.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated to the majority leader, it \nis not my intention to delay this piece of legislation. It is my \nintention to try in whatever way I can before next week's markup begins \nin the Senate Finance Committee to have the Senate express itself on \nthe issue of priorities.\n  Now, we will have, I am sure, a raucous debate around here for weeks \non the issue of Medicare. I will not revisit that entire debate today.\n  The issue of Medicare is not unimportant. It is not just politics. It \nis about priorities. I imagine that those who will stand up on this \namendment ultimately will say this is just politics, nothing but pure \npolitics.\n  That is not what this is. It is about priorities and what is \nimportant. I happen to think that the Medicare Program is critically \nimportant. The $270 billion proposed to be cut from the baseline of \nMedicare is the $270 billion that is anticipated to be needed for the \nincreasing cost of health care and for the number of new senior \ncitizens becoming eligible in the 7-year period for the Medicare \nProgram.\n  We have 200,000 new Americans becoming eligible for Medicare every \nmonth. A lot of people hear that and say that cannot be right. It is \nright. America is graying. Mr. President, 200,000 new people every \nsingle month become eligible for Medicare.\n  It does cost a lot. We ought to make changes. We ought to make sure \nit is fiscally solvent. We ought not under any condition in my judgment \ndecide that we ought to cut Medicare so that we can accommodate a tax \ncut for the most affluent in this country.\n  People say, tax cut for the affluent? We are not proposing a tax cut \nfor the affluent. Fifty percent of the tax cut, the one done in the \nHouse, goes to families making over $100,000 a year.\n  The priority side of this is to say we ought not do that. I am saying \nlimit the tax cut, if there is one, to those with incomes of under \n$100,000, and to the extent that that limitation saves us some money, \nthen use that money to reduce the needed cut in Medicare.\n  It is simple priorities. We have a series of charts, and a number of \nother people wanted to speak. I accept the notion it is not an easy job \nfor the majority leader to run this place. I am not sure I would want \nthat job. I guess I would want the majority title these days, as being \nin the minority is not easy.\n  It is one of the reasons we have to, from time to time, find a way on \nthe floor of the Senate to make a point about priorities. We feel \nobligated to do that. The failure to do that means that we are not \ndoing what the loyal opposition should and must do to represent their \ninterests.\n  In the spirit of cooperation, I have no intention of holding up this \nbill. I appreciate the willingness of the majority leader to give us an \nopportunity to vote on this motion without a second degree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I do not have a \nquarrel with the Senator offering an amendment. That is how it works \naround here. I am certain we have done the same when we wanted to make \na point when we were in the minority.\n  We have a provision in the budget that about 90 percent of any tax \nbenefit would go to people making less than $100,000--in that range. I \ncannot remember the precise wording. So it seemed to me we pretty much \nare in compliance with what the Senator may suggest.\n  Having said that, we also have a real problem with Medicare. We are \ntrying to address that problem. We have been working, members of the \nFinance Committee and others. Three of the President's Cabinet members \nwho are trustees of the Medicare trust fund agree that it will go broke \nby the year 2002 if we do not fix it.\n  We are trying to preserve, strengthen, and protect Medicare. We \nbelieve we can do it without any serious impact on any beneficiary or \nany of the providers in the program.\n  We believe we have a good program. We have just left a press \nconference where the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nand others outlined precisely what the Republican Senate plan did with \nMedicare. We have not yet come to the tax cut portion.\n  That tax cut will go to families with children. They do not make over \n$100,000. Many in my State are making $20,000, $25,000, or $30,000. \nThey will get the benefit.\n  For all the reasons I can think of--it does not belong to this bill, \nit is subject to a point of order, 60 votes if the tabling motion \nfails--I am pleased that the chairman of the committee will now move to \ntable the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The Senator from West Virginia has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my amendment, as amended, specifies that any \nstudent suspended from classes at a DC public school must serve the \nsuspension by performing community service for the period of suspension \nunder regulations promulgated by the mayor.\n  It would require the Commission on Consensus Reform in the DC Public \nSchools to develop and implement a uniform dress code for the public \nschools.\n  It would become effective at the beginning of the 1996-1997 school \nyear.\n  It would add the Chief of the National Guard Bureau as an ex officio \nmember to the Commission on Consensus Reform in the DC Public Schools \nto facilitate the establishment of programs to assist at-risk youth.\n  It would require a report to Congress within 60 days at the end of \nthe 1997-1998 school year on the improvements and discipline resulting \nfrom dress code policy and community service requirements.\n  It would limit the provisions to a 2-year pilot program which would \nexpire at the end of the 1997-1998 school year.\n  Mr. President, this might help to point the way to other school \ndistricts throughout the country and enable them, on the basis of the \nresults, to initiate such programs within their own districts.\n  I hope that the Members of the Senate will support the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment. It is an effort to try to end some of the problems we have \nwith young people who get in trouble in school and need some guidance \nand support. It helps, I think, to maintain discipline. I think it is \nworth a demonstration project, as the amendment provides, to see if in \nthe city we can demonstrate alternatives to kids just being put out of \nschool for disciplinary reasons and then just walking the streets and \ngetting into trouble.\n  So I think it is a good amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I see no other speakers, so I yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2678, as amended. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I know Members are anxious to leave, and I \nknow there will not be a vote on final passage. This will be the last \nvote of the day. There will be voice votes but no more rollcall votes.\n  On Monday, there will be no rollcall votes, but we do expect to take \nup VA-HUD. The managers will be here at 3 p.m. Senator Bumpers will be \nhere, I think, about 4 o'clock to offer an amendment on the space \nstation, to add money to the space program. But probably not.\n  [Laughter.]\n  We will be in space here at 4 o'clock.\n  What we would like to do is accommodate everybody. We know it is a \nholiday for some. There will not be any votes until, let us say, after \nthe policy luncheon on Tuesday, but we want to get some work done. \nStill, we will be down to three appropriations bills. If we can do \nthose next week, we are out of here for 8 days. That ought to be an \nincentive for less talk, fewer amendments. If we can do it on each \nside, we can finish by late Thursday or Friday.\n  So I just hope, in accommodating everybody who wants to be \naccommodated, that they will accommodate us. So there are no further \nvotes today, no votes on Monday, and any votes that are ordered will \noccur on Tuesday after the policy luncheons.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 2768, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1244, the fiscal \nyear 1966 District of Columbia appropriations bill, as reported by the \nSenate Appropriations Committee.\n  The pending bill provides Federal payments to the District of \nColumbia totaling $712 million. The Senate bill provides $660 million \nfor the Federal payment and $52 million as the Federal contribution to \ncertain retirement funds.\n  The Senate bill is funded at the President's requested level.\n  It is at the subcommittee's 602(B) allocation for both BA and \noutlays.\n  I hope the Congress will work with the District of Columbia as it \naddresses its serious financial situation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        D.C.

Mr. President, I noted with interest a provision of the \nD.C. appropriations bill which earmarks money for police details in \nGeorgetown, Adams Morgan, Capitol Hill, and East of the River. \nGeorgetown is to receive the highest amount--$250,000.\n  Every day the Washington Post and the Washington Times remind us that \nthe District of Columbia is wracked by crime. The citizens of this \ncity, in every quarter, deserve the best possible police protection.\n  I hope my colleagues would agree, police resources should be \nallocated to the areas of highest and most serious crime. Those \ndecisions, I would submit, are best made by police authorities, not \nCongress.\n  I know that Georgetown has a serious crime problem, but I'm not sure \nthat the areas targeted for earmarks are the areas with the highest \nneed. I'm troubled that Congress seems to be taking it upon themselves \nto make that determination and micromanage the allocation of law \nenforcement resources. I hope that the conferees will examine this \nissue and assess whether such earmarks are necessary or fair to all the \nresidents of the District of Columbia and visitors to our Capital City.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments to the \nbill, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  So the bill (S. 1244), as amended, passed, as follows:\n  [The text of the bill will appear in a future edition of the Record.]\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes action on S. 1244 that it be held at the desk, and \nthat when the Senate receives the House bill making appropriations for \nthe District of Columbia for the fiscal year 1996, that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1244 as passed by the \nSenate be inserted in lieu thereof; I further ask consent that the \nHouse bill as thus amended be immediately passed without any further \ndebate, amendment, motion, or action of any kind, and the motion to \nreconsider the vote by which the bill is passed be laid upon the table; \nI further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment and \nrequest a conference with the House of Representatives thereon, and \nthat the Chair be authorized to appoint the managers on that on the \npart of the Senate; finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1244 be \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on September 20, I voted against an \namendment offered by Senator Brown to cap economic assistance to \nTurkey, because I believe the United States should strongly support \neconomic development in that country.\n  Turkey is a NATO member and a close ally of the United States. Turkey \nhas been instrumental in enabling the humanitarian program in Northern \nIraq to proceed. Turkey is also struggling to become more closely tied \nto the European economic community, and to reform its constitution to \nstrengthen democracy. I believe we should support that.\n  I also believe, however, that we have a responsibility to speak out \nabout the mistreatment of the Kurdish minority in Turkey, which is \nprimarily located in several southeastern provinces.\n  The undeniable fact is that the Kurds are second-class citizens in \nTurkey, where they are discriminated against in law and practice. In \nthe southeast, where the PKK are waging a terrorist campaign against \nthe Turkish Government, virtually any Kurd is branded with the \n``terrorist'' label and considered by the Turkish military to be the \nenemy.\n  Thousands of Kurds, including innocent civilians, have been caught up \nin this struggle, and there are persistent reports of the excessive use \nof force by Turkish soldiers. There is also no denying that the PKK has \nused abominable tactics, resulting in many innocent deaths.\n  But according to a report requested by the Appropriations Committee \nlast year and released by the State Department several months ago, and \nother reports by Turkish and international human rights organizations, \nUnited States military equipment, particularly fighter aircraft and \nhelicopters, have been routinely used to strafe and destroy Kurdish \nvillages.\n  The villages are targets because the Turkish Army regards them as \nhavens for the PKK, which in some instances they may be. But the \nattacks have been indiscriminate, resulting in many civilian \ncasualties. There has been a pattern of human rights violations against \nthe Kurdish people, who have been dehumanized by Turkish society.\n  It recently came to my attention that the Turkish Government does not \npermit the International Committee of the Red Cross into Turkey. \nFrankly, it is inconceivable to me that a democracy, an important \nmember of NATO, \n\n[[Page S 14129]]\nand a country that seeks closer ties to Europe, would deny the ICRC \naccess when there is clearly a need for it. Any armed conflict involves \nabuses of human rights against civilians, and in Turkey the evidence of \nsuch abuses by both sides is overwhelming. In addition, the State \nDepartment has reported on the mistreatment and torture of prisoners in \nTurkish jails for many years.\n  The ICRC operates confidentially. It does not seek to embarrass \ngovernments. It does not discuss its findings with the press, or with \nthe Congress, or anyone else. Its goal is to monitor human rights and \nprovide objective advice to whoever is deemed to be violating them on \nhow to improve respect for human rights.\n  I am told by administration officials that they have raised this \nissue with Turkish officials in the past, to no avail. That is \ndiscouraging, and it is for that reason that my amendment calls on the \nPresident of the United States to raise this himself with the Turkish \nPrime Minister. I believe this issue is that important. I also believe \nthat Turkey's willingness to do this would be an important sign of its \ncommitment to improve human rights.\n  It is for this reason that yesterday I offered an amendment, which \nwas adopted, which aims to encourage the Turkish Government to permit \nunimpeded access to the ICRC, especially in the southeast where its \npresence is so urgently needed. I think this is the least that a \ncivilized, democratic country should do.\n  I hope the administration understands the importance of this \namendment, and will give it the urgency and serious attention that it \ndeserves.\n  I also joined Senator Pell in an amendment, which was also adopted, \nwhich provides $5 million for nongovernmental organizations to carry \nout humanitarian and other activities on behalf of Kurds in \nsoutheastern Turkey. I think this is very important. It is consistent \nwith United States policy of promoting economic development, cultural \nand ethnic tolerance, and human rights, and it makes clear that we want \nto see a portion of our assistance to Turkey used to directly further \nthese goals. I trust the administration will make every effort to \nencourage the Turkish Government to permit the use of these funds as \nintended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14128-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS--AMENDMENT NO. 2743\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, an amendment that was adopted yesterday \nwhich I cosponsored with Senator Dodd and which was also cosponsored by \nSenators Kerry and Murray, aims to address the travesty that has been \ngoing on in Guatemala for as long as most of us can remember.\n  Guatemala is now the only country in Central America still plagued by \ncivil war. It is winding down, but it continues to claim innocent \nlives, and it is an excuse for continuing human rights atrocities by \nthe Guatemalan Armed Forces, as well as the URNG guerrillas.\n  But it is the Guatemalan Armed Forces, and their armed supporters, \nthat are guilty of the majority of these crimes. Their victims are \nstudents, nuns, journalists, human rights lawyers, union organizers--\nanyone who dares speak out about Government corruption or Government-\nsponsored violence.\n  The estimate of the number of killed and disappeared ranges from 40-\n70,000, over the past three decades. In any given week, the toll is \nstaggering. Death threats, disappearances, and extrajudicial executions \nare routine in human rights reports on Guatemala.\n  Let me describe some recent incidents. In May of this year, nearly \n100 bodies were found with signs of torture--an increase in \nextrajudicial executions by 40 percent, with 195 violent deaths \nreported.\n  In June, a teacher was abducted, 21 judges were threatened with \ndeath, a 17-year-old street youth was shot to death by a member of the \nNational Police, several bodies of disappeared persons were found, a \nunion leader was abducted, beaten, and raped, a former judge was \nattacked for the third time with a bomb, high school student leaders \nwere harassed by armed men--who reportedly tried to abduct them, a \nCongressman was attacked, and the remains of hundreds of people in mass \ngraves were exhumed.\n  On June 14, several religious organizations and human rights \nadvocates signed a letter to President Clinton, asking that an \nindependent human rights expert be appointed to undertake a full \ninvestigation into human rights violations in Guatemala. On Father's \nDay, a march was organized for children of disappeared parents. ``The \nfather who took care of us was taken away,'' said one of the children \nat a press conference. ``He did not come back and we never heard from \nhim again.''\n  For years, the Congress has passed resolutions, written letters, cut \noff aid. We have tried to get the Guatemalan Army's attention, to no \navail. There has been virtually no progress in bringing to justice \nthose responsible for any of the thousands of human rights abuses.\n  Jennifer Harbury, a U.S. lawyer, lost her husband 3 years ago and has \nbeen searching for him ever since. His name is Efrain Bamaca Velasquez. \nHe was murdered after being tortured. There is evidence that a \nGuatemalan colonel, paid by the CIA, may have been involved in Bamaca's \ntorture and death, as well as the death of American Michael DeVine.\n  A Guatemalan officer who was convicted in the DeVine case \nmysteriously escaped from prison the next day, and has not been seen \nsince. Efrain Bamaca's fate remains unknown, and the Guatemalan army \nhas obstructed justice every step of the way. Despite a court order, \nthey have refused to permit a special prosecutor to excavate where \nBamaca's body, and the bodies of many others, are believed to be \nburied.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take the time to repeat the details. \nI have spoken before about the Harbury case, the DeVine case, about \nnumerous other human rights cases in Guatemala over the years.\n  Guatemala's President de Leon Carpio is doing his best, and he \ndeserves credit for keeping the peace negotiations moving forward, \nenabling U.N. human rights monitors to take up residence in Guatemala, \nsupporting democratic elections, and taking some steps to improve human \nrights. But impunity among the army and civil patrols remains the \ncentral problem. There is no justice when a member of the armed forces \nis involved.\n  This amendment makes it clear who is the problem. It praises \nPresident de Leon Carpio, who deserves our support. But it prohibits \nany assistance to the armed forces and the URNG, any sales of military \nequipment, and cuts off visas for any member of the armed forces and \nURNG who are suspected of involvement in human rights violations, or of \ncovering up such crimes.\n  These restrictions will end when the President certifies that the \nGuatemalan armed forces are fully cooperating in solving these crimes, \nand in carrying out the recommendations of the U.N. monitors.\n  I am not among those who believes that everyone in the Guatemalan \narmy is corrupt, or guilty of crimes. Far from it. I know some \nhonorable, honest Guatemalan officers who are disgusted by what some of \ntheir fellow officers do. I also know that there are honorable members \nof the URNG who are fighting because for years they were excluded from \nthe political process, but that is changing. This amendment is aimed at \nthe bad apples. It is time for all Guatemalans who believe in \nrespecting human rights, in justice, to stand up for it, and to end the \nimpunity once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14129-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14129-S14131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO DOUGLASS CATER\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the death of a \ngreat friend and great American, S. Douglass Cater, Jr.\n  A native of Montgomery, AL, Douglass Cater traveled north to school \nat Exeter and Harvard, interrupting his education to serve as a Russian \nspecialist in the Office of Strategic Services in World War II. After \nthe war ended, he remained in Washington, writing eminent prose on \nWashington and national affairs for The Reporter. His articles, along \nwith his first-rate books ``The Fourth Branch of Government'' and \n``Power in Washington'' brought him to the attention of Lyndon Johnson. \nIn 1964, he joined the Johnson \n\n[[Page S 14130]]\nWhite House as the President's education specialist, assisting in the \ndevelopment of programs that established Federal aid to education as \nthe national policy. He also oversaw much of the work that went in to \nthe creation of the Public Broadcasting System.\n  Always a dedicated educator, Douglass Cater became the President of \nWashington College after stints at the Aspen Institute and The \nObserver, the great English newspaper. As president of Washington \nCollege, Douglass moved to a new plateau above that of Chester Dana, \nthe title character of his masterful 1970 fiction book, ``Dana: The \nIrrelevant Man.'' I reviewed that book back when it was first published \nand wrote the foreword to an upcoming edition. That brilliant novel \nremains as true today as ever, even though the climate and culture of \nthis city and government have drastically changed.\n  Douglass Cater gave new meaning to the terms ``gentleman'' and \n``scholar.'' He brought a thoughtfulness and intelligence to all his \nwork, and continually preached the value of civilized discourse over \npolitical bickering. His faith in reason was much appreciated by all \nthose who came to know him.\n  Douglass Cater was, in the words of Edwin Yoder, ``one of the best of \na fine generation.'' And so we will remember him, even as we offer our \ncondolences to his beloved wife Libby, and all his children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \narticles from the New York Times and the Washington Post be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 16, 1995]\n\n      Douglass Cater Is Dead at 72; Educator and Presidential Aide\n\n                      (By Robert McG. Thomas, Jr.)\n\n       Douglass Cater, a soft-spoken student and practitioner of \n     government power who began his working life as a journalist \n     and ended it as a college president--after a heady detour \n     through Lyndon B. Johnson's White House--died yesterday at \n     the guest house at Washington College in Chestertown, Md.\n       He was 72 and had lived in Montgomery, Ala., since his \n     retirement as the president of the college in 1990.\n       His wife, Libby, said that her husband, who was stricken \n     during a visit to the college six weeks ago, died of \n     pulmonary fibrosis.\n       By the time he went to the White House in 1964 at age 40, \n     Mr. Cater was already an old Washington hand. An original \n     editor of The Reporter magazine, he had spent 14 years \n     covering Washington and national affairs, with occasional \n     time off to write books or serve as a Government consultant.\n       Indeed, he began his stint as a special assistant to \n     President Johnson two months after the publication of his \n     third book, ``Power in Washington.''\n       It was a measure of Mr. Cater's evenhandedness that five \n     years before his journalist's examination of Government \n     power, he had given his own profession the same treatment in \n     ``The Fourth Branch of Government.''\n       Mr. Cater, who had written admiringly of Johnson's use of \n     power as Senate majority leader, had been asked to join his \n     Vice Presidential staff in 1963, but had demurred.\n       At the time, Mr. Cater was on a leave from his magazine \n     working as associate director of the Center of Advanced \n     Studies at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and wanted to \n     finish his book.\n       The second call--this time from the White House--``got his \n     attention,'' Mrs. Cater recalled yesterday.\n       Mr. Cater, who was given a vague mandate to ``think ahead'' \n     and had been told by other Presidential assistants that they \n     ``made it up'' as they went along, took a while to find his \n     niche.\n       The breakthrough, his wife said, came when he noticed that \n     Johnson's face lit up whenever he read a memorandum on \n     education. Taking the Presidential visage as his guide, Mr. \n     Cater became the resident education specialist, with far-\n     reaching results, among them the first legislation \n     establishing Federal aid to education as a national norm.\n       ``It was one of his proudest achievements,'' his wife said, \n     recalling that another was the spadework her husband did in \n     creating the Public Broadcasting System.\n       Mr. Cater, who left the White House in 1968 to join Vice \n     President Hubert H. Humphrey's Presidential campaign staff, \n     later worked as an executive of The Observer and joined the \n     Aspen Institute, which became his base as a freelance writer \n     and political gadfly before taking the Washington College \n     post in 1982.\n       A native of Montgomery, Mr. Cater, whose full name was \n     Silas Douglass Cater Jr., came by his interest in government \n     naturally. His father, Silas Cater, was a politically attuned \n     lawyer who served in the Alabama Legislature and later became \n     Montgomery City Clerk.\n       After attending Exeter, Mr. Cater went on to Harvard, \n     interrupting his education during World War II to serve as a \n     Russian specialist with the Office of Strategic Services in \n     Washington, an experience he found so dull, his wife said, \n     that he vowed never again to work as a specialist but to \n     operate as a generalist.\n       By most accounts he did that brilliantly, earning a \n     reputation as a civilizing influence who brought \n     thoughtfulness to both his extensive writings and his other \n     work.\n       Resorting to reason when others might rail, Mr. Cater was \n     forever preaching the value of civilized discourse.\n       In 1984, for example, he persuaded two former Presidents \n     and six former Secretaries of State to endorse a bipartisan \n     statement urging Presidential candidates to moderate their \n     comments on foreign affairs.\n       Mr. Cater, who wrote widely, including a number of Op-Ed \n     articles for The New York Times, had less success a campaign \n     to persuade the news media, particularly television, to \n     moderate their voices in reporting on Government.\n       Although his published works on Government were widely \n     praised, perhaps his greatest achievement as a writer was his \n     lone and daring venture into fiction, his 1970 novel ``Dana: \n     The Irrelevant Man.''\n       There have been many excellent factual accounts of \n     Washington, of course, but in his review in The Times, \n     Christopher Lehmann-Haupt suggested that Mr. Cater had pulled \n     off something of a miracle in a well-abused genre, proving \n     ``That wise reporters can write fiction after all.''\n       In addition to his wife, Mr. Cater is survived by two sons, \n     Silas 3d, of San Rafael, Calif., and Ben, of Baltimore; two \n     daughters, Sage, of Montgomery and Morrow Scheer, of San \n     Rafael; a brother, William, of Millburn, N.J., and four \n     grandchildren.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 16, 1995]\n\n        S. Douglass Cater Dies at 72; LBJ Aide, Writer, Educator\n\n                            (By Bart Barnes)\n\n       S. Douglass Cater, 72, a top aide to President Lyndon B. \n     Johnson, a Washington journalist and author and the former \n     president of Washington College in Chestertown, Md., died \n     Sept. 15 at his quarters on the college campus. He had \n     pulmonary fibrosis.\n       Mr. Cater served as special assistant to Johnson from 1964 \n     to 1968. In that period, he was a principal draftsman for \n     much of the Great Society legislation, including programs on \n     education, health and medical care, labor and welfare. He \n     also wrote speeches for Johnson and was instrumental in the \n     formation of the Public Broadcasting Corp. and the Teacher \n     Corps.\n       As a journalist, he was Washington editor and national \n     affairs editor for the Reporter magazine in the 1950s and \n     early 1960s, then in the late 1979s was vice chairman of The \n     Observer in London. He wrote occasional political commentary \n     on the op-ed pages of The Washington Post.\n       From 1982 until 1990, Mr. Cater was president of Washington \n     College, a small liberal arts institution on Maryland's \n     Eastern Shore. He was said by friends to have had a deep and \n     abiding belief in the value of education, and a conviction \n     that an educated citizenry could be sensible and responsible \n     in matters of public policy. He also was a senior fellow, \n     funding member and trustee of the Aspen Institute for \n     Humanistic Studies.\n       He was the author of ``Power in Washington,'' a 1964 book \n     that he described as an attempt ``to define what was \n     happening to the political process as America moved toward \n     its bicentennial.'' In a 1958 book, ``The Fourth Branch of \n     Government,'' Mr. Cater criticized the media, observing that \n     the presence of television cameras at White House press \n     conferences ``make unpaid actors of the entire Washington \n     press corps.''\n       He also wrote a political novel, ``Dana, the Irrelevant \n     Man,'' which was published in 1970.\n       After stepping down as president of Washington College, Mr. \n     Cater returned to his native Montgomery, Ala. He died while \n     on a visit back to the college.\n       During World War II, Mr. Cater served in the Office of \n     Strategic Services. He graduated from Harvard University and \n     came to Washington in 1950 as Washington editor for the \n     Reporter.\n       Not until he retired from Washington College did Mr. Cater \n     return to live in the South, but he retained his Southern \n     identity all his life and sometimes came across as the \n     epitome of the cultivated Southerner.\n       He was inventive--with a seemingly endless stream of \n     ideas--humorous, warm and sometimes crotchety.\n       ``He had an acute sense of history, a gift for clear prose \n     and excellent contacts in the universities, medical schools, \n     foundations and education associations. He helped to draw up \n     and put through most of Johnson's programs for aid to \n     education and better medical care,'' said Harry C. McPherson \n     Jr., who also served in the Johnson White House, in his book, \n     ``A Political Education.''\n       For 13 years, Mr. Cater was Washington editor of the \n     Reporter. He then served two years as national affairs editor \n     before joining the Johnson White House in the spring of 1964. \n     On Election Day 1964, Mr. Cater wrote a one-page memorandum \n     to the president suggesting that Johnson seize the \n     opportunity in what was beginning to look like a major \n     electoral victory to become the ``education president.'' \n     Among the measures stemming from this suggestion were the \n     Elementary \n\n[[Page S 14131]]\n     and Secondary Education Act, the Higher Education Act and the \n     International Education Act.\n       Mr. Cater left the Johnson administration in October 1968 \n     to work as a domestic adviser on the unsuccessful \n     presidential campaign of Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey.\n       Later, he did writing and consulting and in 1970 became a \n     founding fellow of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic \n     Studies. He was a principal planner in designing the \n     Institute's Center for Governance at Wye Plantation on the \n     Eastern Shore.\n       In the late 1970s, he became vice chairman of the Observer, \n     England's oldest weekly newspaper.\n       He took the job as president of Washington College in 1982, \n     he said, ``because I wanted to do something to make my own \n     mark. In the White House, one could feel many heady things, \n     but you were just part of a process. It didn't really matter \n     if it was you or someone else. Although I was a high level \n     staff man, I had never been in a job where the buck stopped \n     with me.''\n       During his years at the college, Mr. Cater raised more than \n     $43 million to revitalize the academic program and add major \n     new facilities. He also became a national champion of \n     independent liberal arts colleges, waging a running verbal \n     battle on the op ed pages of The Post and the New York Times \n     with then-Education Secretary William J. Bennett, who had \n     accused private colleges of being too greedy.\n       Mr. Cater's books also included ``Ethics in a Business \n     Society'' (1953); ``Politics of Health'' (1972); and ``TV \n     Violence and the Child'' (1975).\n       Survivors include his wife, Libby Anderson Cater of \n     Montgomery; four children, S. Douglas Cater III and Libby \n     Morrow Cater Sheer, both of San Francisco, Rebecca Sage Cater \n     of Montgomery, and Benjamin Winston Cater of Baltimore; a \n     brother, William B.

Yoder, Jr.)\n\n       Even perceptive newspaper obituaries rarely capture the \n     flavor of a man. The notices of Douglass Cater's death at 72 \n     conveyed only a hint of what made him an original.\n       I knew of Cater, and had read a good bit of his writing \n     (mainly in the old Reporter magazine), long before our paths \n     crossed in the mid-1980s. By then, he was assailed by \n     excruciating physical debilities, including chronic back pain \n     that he managed by a curious regimen of flexing exercises, \n     rhythmically twisting his torso in a way vaguely suggestive \n     of an exotic dance. But far from complaining, he observed his \n     frailties as a journalist and wrote about them--\n     interestingly.\n       Meeting him one could see how he had by then accumulated a \n     larger stock of interesting firsthand institutional memory \n     than just about anyone you ever met, beginning with World War \n     II service in the legendary Office of Strategic Services. \n     That was just the beginning. When communists took control of \n     the world student movement, he and others organized the U.S. \n     National Student Association. Later, he was a Washington \n     magazine correspondent and editor, a White House aide to \n     Lyndon Johnson, the editor of a venerable English newspaper \n     (the Observer of London, which with the help of Robert \n     Anderson's philanthropy, he rescued from the brink of \n     oblivion), a writer, philosopher of higher education, \n     godfather to public broadcasting and president of an old \n     liberal arts college on Maryland's eastern shore (Washington, \n     in Chestertown), which he also helped rescue and was visiting \n     when he died.\n       Cater's old friends knew him as a man of dramatic \n     loyalties, reinforced by a sharp tongue.\n       After we had seen Cater take someone's hide off at a forum \n     one summer night, an old friend told me a story. It happened \n     when Cater was working for Lyndon Johnson in the White House, \n     at the height of the national quarrel over Vietnam.\n       His friend had flown to Washington on business and planned \n     to stay with the Caters. Cater picked him up at National \n     Airport. As they drove south on the GW Parkway, Cater asked, \n     in his Alabama drawl: ``John, are you one of those goddam \n     academics who're always carping at the president about the \n     war?'' His friend admitted that he was. ``I'm sorry,'' Cater \n     announced, ``but we will have to stop speaking.'' Cater \n     withdrew to this study, skipping dinner, and it was years \n     before friendly relations were restored. He took his \n     loyalties seriously.\n       Douglass Cater's monument, however, apart from many \n     inventive good works, is a small book he wrote in the late \n     1950s called ``The Fourth Branch of Government,'' one of \n     those seminal books that say all that needs saying about a \n     subject. Cater wrote the book when many journalists were \n     uncomfortably reviewing the press's dubious performance in \n     the rise and fall of the 20th century's most disruptive \n     American demagogue, Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin.\n       McCarthy's dark ascendancy was in part an expression of the \n     anxiety generated by the Cold War. Cater's analysis focused, \n     however, on one of its proximate sustaining causes: the cult \n     of reportorial ``objectivity.'' By the rules of objectivity, \n     if an official of note made a sensational charge, even one \n     that seemed patently bizarre, the press's duty was to report \n     it straight, put it out unspun for public consumption. If it \n     proved to be a lie, it would presumably be answered; and the \n     answer would be duly reported.\n       Cater demonstrated that this rosy theory took inadequate \n     account of McCarthy's unscrupulousness, or of the speed with \n     which a resounding lie tends to outrun humdrum truth. Whether \n     as an original perception or as the articulation of a \n     consensus, Cater's book helped kill the cult of journalistic \n     ``objectivity''; and it was good riddance. If, today, a U.S. \n     senator asserts that the sky was blue on Labor Day, a \n     diligent reporter will check the back weather reports. And if \n     it was actually gray, you can bet that fact will be reported \n     early in the story, under the convention that Stephen Hess of \n     the Brookings Institution calls ``corrective journalism.'' \n     And even the excesses of corrective journalism are a vast \n     improvement over the abuses of the rules of ``objectivity.''\n       In short, it was Douglass Cater, more than anyone else, who \n     changed the rules of American journalism, and very much for \n     the better. And that was only one of perhaps a dozen \n     distinctions that made him one of the best of a fine \n     generation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14129-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14131-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14131-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1461.

A bill to require the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System to focus on price stability in establishing monetary \npolicy to ensure the stable, long-term purchasing power of the \ncurrency, to repeal the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of \n1978, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\n\n          THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND PRICE STABILITY ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Economic \nGrowth and Price Stability Act of 1995. This legislation aims to \naccomplish two major goals. First, it focuses the Federal Reserve on \nachieving price stability. Second, it repeals the Full Employment and \nBalanced Growth Act of 1978--the \n\n[[Page S 14133]]\nHumphrey-Hawkins Act--which codified the Keynesian principles that \nadvocate government fine-tuning of the economy.\n  Based on the fundamentally flawed premise that government can manage \nthe economy, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act set targets for the economy to \nreach an unemployment rate of 3 percent for individuals over 20 and 4 \npercent for individuals over 16 and an inflation rate of 3 percent \neventually moving to zero. Almost 20 years later, we know that this law \nhas never achieved any of its intentions. This law proves that \ngovernment cannot legislate prosperity--the reality is that individuals \ncreate jobs and free markets lead to prosperity.\n  By codifying unrealistic goals, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act gives the \nFed an unachievable mission to artificially boost growth and employment \nwhile keeping inflation and interest rates low. This promotes fine-\ntuning of monetary policy by the Fed in response to current economic \ntrends. While this may lead to short-term economic boosts, over the \nlong term such intervention by the Fed leads to higher inflation, \nhigher interest rates, and more frequent recessions. The Economic \nGrowth and Price Stability Act corrects this problem by focusing the \nFed on the only goal it can effectively achieve: price stability. \nFocusing the Fed on price stability will lead to a sounder dollar, more \nstable financial markets, increased employment, and greater long-term \neconomic growth.\n  The Economic Growth and Price Stability Act gives the Fed the \nresponsibilities of defining price stability, charting its own course \ntoward achieving and maintaining it, and setting its own timeframe for \naccomplishing the price stability goal. By allowing the Fed to create \nits own timetable, we can rest assured that transitional effects on \nemployment and output will not occur.\n  Under my legislation, the Fed will still be required to report to \nCongress on a semiannual basis, but it will additionally be required to \nexplain, in verbal and numerical terms, its definition of and its \nmethods for attaining price stability. By not mandating inflation \ntargets, this legislation places the burden on the Fed to appropriately \ndefine price stability. As we all know, the market is a harsh task \nmaster, and I believe it will be the best judge of the Fed's progress.\n  The Fed will have a strong incentive to make correct decisions about \nits definition of price stability and its method for achieving it, \nbecause the markets will be quick to express their views. The Fed will \npursue price stability honestly and openly, because if it does not, \nlong term interest rates will rise.\n  Instead of countercyclical, command and control, government \ninterventionist economics, the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act \nsets in place a free market paradigm. Under the Economic Growth and \nPrice Stability Act the principal economic responsibilities of \ngovernment are to establish and ensure an environment conducive to \nlong-term economic growth and increases in living standards by \nmaintaining free markets, low taxes, respect for private property, and \nthe stable long-term purchasing power of the U.S. currency.\n  If the elections in November 1994 taught us anything, they taught us \nthat the American people want less government, not more. The Economic \nGrowth and Price Stability Act recognizes that the American people know \nwhat is best for them and directly responds to their demands. I hope \nyou will join me in this vital effort to free our economy from \ngovernment mishandling.\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor with \nSenator Mack, the Economic Growth and Stability Act. As chairman of the \nJoint Economic Committee and a member of the Banking Committee, Senator \nMack has studied economic issues studiously. I commend him for this \ninitiative.\n  This bill would repeal the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, which sets the \ncurrent guidelines for the Federal Reserve's conduct of monetary \npolicy. The multiple goals of Humphrey-Hawkins, however laudable, are \nconflicting and unattainable. In the long term the Fed can only address \ninflation. Unemployment and other such matters are the responsibility \nof the administration and Congress--which we control through our \nspending and tax decisions. Under this bill, we could no longer lay the \nblame of failed fiscal policy at the foot of the Federal Reserve.\n  Senator Mack's bill would recognize that the appropriate goal for the \nFederal Reserve is maintaining price stability in the long term. The \nEconomic Growth and Price Stability Act recognizes that a key factor in \nencouraging growth is a stable environment in which to make decisions \nabout the future. In an atmosphere of assured price stability, American \nfamilies and corporations would be better able to budget and plan for \nthe future. Assuring this steady level of capital investment and growth \nwill create the jobs necessary to keep Americans' working.\n  The policies and school of thought behind this legislation are sound. \nFederal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has testified that ``a \nkey ingredient in achieving the highest possible levels of \nproductivity, real income, and living standards is the achievement of \nprice stability.'' The Economic Growth and Stability Act is a critical \nstep in this direction.\n  Working together, the Federal Reserve can tackle inflation while the \nCongress, with the right fiscal policy, can stimulate long-term growth. \nWe must return to a period of strong growth for our country to prosper \nand remain globally competitive. We owe it to ourselves and our \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Frist, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1268. A bill to provide assistance for the establishment of \ncommunity rural health networks in chronically undeserved areas, to \nprovide incentives for providers of health care services to furnish \nservices in such areas, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                    the rural health development act\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health \nDevelopment Act, an act that I have worked on for some time, to help \nrural communities design a delivery system that fits their unique \nhealth care needs. It has been a project, in fact, that I have worked \non since the day I arrived in the House, more than 5 years ago. This \nissue and these items continue to be a top priority for me here in the \nSenate. I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators Grassley, Jeffords, \nSimpson, Burns and Frist, have joined me in this effort. They, too, \nhave worked feverishly on behalf of the rural communities in their \nStates.\n\n  Rural health care, Mr. President, as you know from your State, is at \na crossroads. My bill provides for an infrastructure needed to create a \nsystem of quality health care for rural families. There are a number of \nproblems that are unique to rural areas--the lack of physicians, \nnurses, health care extenders, nurse practitioners, and physician \nassistants. We are troubled by the closure of small hospitals where the \nutilization has been relatively low, and leaves a community without \nsome kind of emergency medical service.\n  Inadequate and unequal Medicare reimbursement is a problem today. So \nwe have what we think is a solution. It helps communities develop their \nown health care delivery system. It assists in recruiting and retaining \nphysicians. It improves educational opportunities for nurses, \nphysicians, physician extenders, and other kinds of health \nprofessionals. It allows hospitals to downsize without losing their \nemergency room capacity. In short, it is a long-term solution tailored \nto the needs of rural areas.\n  Specifically, it provides technical assistance. Small grant funds are \nprovided to help communities to design their own network, not one \ndesigned by outside consultants who are only familiar with the \ncharacteristics of larger places. Second, these funds can be used for \ntwo purposes--to build telemedicine systems to assist rural areas, and \ncoordinate arrangements between primary care clinics, emergency medical \ncenters, and tertiary care facilities.\n  Finally, the result to rural individuals, families and employers is \nthe ability to take advantage of cost savings that occur elsewhere, \nwhich has not been able to occur in rural America.\n  We equalize the Medicare reimbursement rates. Rural counties receive \nsignificantly less reimbursement from \n\n[[Page S 14134]]\nMedicare managed care programs. For example, Fall River County in South \nDakota, receives $177 per month, per beneficiary versus $678 for Bronx \nCounty in New York--a 367 percent difference.\n  My bill reduces this variation and reimburses rural providers \nrelative to their metropolitan counterparts. The result, of course, is \nthat Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas will have the opportunity to \nparticipate in managed care plans.\n  Third, it improves the educational opportunities for nurses. Nurses \nare a critical component to rural health care. My bill guarantees that \n20 percent of all scholarships offered through the National Health \nService Corps go to nurses in rural areas. Since 1972, over 70 health \ncare providers have served in Wyoming through the services of the \nNational Health Service Corps Program. So we put greater emphasis \nthere.\n  Regarding recruiting and retaining physicians, Medicare currently \nprovides a 10 percent bonus in rural areas. Ten percent is not much of \nan incentive. So it is increased to 20. To compensate for the increase, \nthe bonus is restricted to primary care physicians in rural areas.\n  In addition, the bill guarantees 24-hour emergency care. Medicare \ncurrently restricts States from establishing limited-service hospitals. \nAs a result, many facilities either have to operate as full-service \nhospitals, with very low utilization, or close. We are suggesting they \nbe recategorized as a rural emergency access care hospital so that \nindeed they can be reimbursed from HCFA for these emergency services.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, as we search for solutions to deliver \nhealth care throughout the country, the Rural Development Health Care \nAct is one proposal that should be added to the list. Many of the \nprovisions have received a favorable response--so much so that they are \nlikely to be folded into the reconciliation package.\n  More important, the Rural Development Health Care Act provides the \nanswer to rural communities that are looking to keep up with the \nrapidly changing health care environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14132-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 216\n\n  At the request of Mr. Inouye, the name of the Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig] was added as a cosponsor of S. 216, a bill to repeal the \nreduction in the deductible portion of expenses for business meals and \nentertainment.\n\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n  At the request of Mr. Santorum, the name of the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Grams] was added as a cosponsor of S. 304, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the transportation \nfuels tax applicable to commercial aviation.\n\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Breaux] was added as a cosponsor of S. 910, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an election to exclude from \nthe gross estate of a decedent the value of certain land subject to a \nqualified conservation easement, and to make technical changes to \nalternative valuation rules.\n\n\n                                S. 1137\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina [Mr. Helms] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1137, a bill to \namend title 17, United States Code, with respect to the licensing of \nmusic, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2711\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reid the names of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun], the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], the \nSenator from Illinois [Mr. Simon], and the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nSimpson] were added as cosponsors of amendment No. 2711 proposed to \nH.R. 1868, a bill making appropriations for foreign operations, export \nfinancing, and related programs for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 1996, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14134-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14134-S14135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n    THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1996\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                        BYRD AMENDMENT NO. 2768\n\n  Mr. BYRD proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1244) making \nappropriations for the government of the District of Columbia and other \nactivities chargeable in whole or in part against the revenues of said \nDistrict for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 53, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       (H) The Chief of the National Guard Bureau who shall be an \n     ex officio member.\n       On page 66, strike line 15 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 211.

While the Budget \nCommittee has the discretion to report the reconciliation bill at any \ntime after that date, the Budget Committee's obligation to report the \nbill to the Senate arises upon receipt of all of the committee's \nsubmissions.

Because the Finance Committee's submission will carry a great \nportion of the outlays reductions necessary to achieve balance and to \nobtain certification by CBO, the Senate Budget Committee will exercise \nits discretion and wait to receive Finance's submissions on September \n29 before initiating \n\n[[Page S 14136]]\nthe certification process.

Mr. President, our country is a remarkable \nmosaic--a mixture of races, languages, ethnicities, and religions--that \ngrows increasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this \nincredible diversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In \nNew Jersey, schoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different \nlanguages at home. These different languages are used in over 1.4 \nmillion homes in my State. I have always believed that one of the \nUnited States greatest strengths is the diversity of the people that \nmake up its citizenry and I am proud to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to an event in New Jersey that celebrates the importance of \nthe diversity that is a part of America's collective heritage.\n  On Saturday, September 23, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in \nHolmdel, NJ, will celebrate the next in its series of 1995 Fall \nHeritage Festivals. The Heritage Festival Program salutes some of the \ndifferent ethnic communities that contribute so greatly to New Jersey's \ndiverse makeup. Highlighting old country customs and culture, the \nfestival programs are an opportunity to express pride in the ethnic \nbackgrounds that are a part of our collective heritage. Additionally, \nthe Fall Heritage Festivals contribute proceeds from their programs to \nthe Garden State Arts Center's Cultural Center Fund which presents \ntheater productions free-of-charge to New Jersey's schoolchildren, \nseniors, and other deserving residents. The Heritage Festival thus not \nonly pays tribute to the cultural influences from our past, it also \nmakes a significant contribution to our present day cultural \nactivities.\n  On Saturday, September 23, 1995, the Heritage Festival Series will \ncelebrate the 21st Annual Ukrainian Heritage Festival. Chaired by \nOksana Korduba, this year's event focuses on the road to democracy and \neconomic reform for the Ukraine. It is fitting that the Ukrainian \nHeritage Festival follows so closely on the heels of the fourth \nanniversary of Ukrainian independence. Upon gaining independence, \nUkraine has worked diligently for both economic reform and democracy. \nIn particular, Ukraine has taken significant steps to reform its \neconomy by working to stabilize inflation, liberalize prices, and \nprivatize industries. Further, through the creation and continued \nimprovement of a constitutional framework, Ukraine is developing its \nown strong democratic tradition.\n  I am delighted to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the \nUkrainian-American community. During the long years when Ukraine \nsuffered under foreign control, Ukrainian-Americans helped keep alive \nUkraine's culture and traditions. The Garden State Arts Center's \nUkrainian Heritage Festival, with its celebration of food, crafts, \nmusic, sports, and traditional folk dancing, preserves Ukrainian \nculture for all generations.\n  On behalf of all New Jerseyans of Ukrainian descent I offer my \ncongratulations on the occasion of the 21st Ukrainian Heritage \nFestival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14136-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GRATITUDE TO ELLEN SHAFFER\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

You \n     worked diligently with the organizations supporting the bill, \n     and, as a result, they became important participants in \n     advancing our proposal. As a result of your expertise and \n     writing skills, we were able to propose and have published in \n     the New England Journal of Medicine an outstanding piece on \n     the merits of a single payer approach to national health care \n     reform\n       I, along with Senator Domenici, was able to lead \n     effectively the Senate's Working Group on Mental Health as a \n     direct result of your strategic skills and your ability to \n     establish a coalition among those parties having diverse \n     views. Similarly, you were instrumental in working with the \n     American Medical Association to develop the legislation known \n     as the Patient Protection Act, a measure which enabled me to \n     fulfill my role as an advocate for health care consumers.\n       I greatly valued your skills at financial analysis and your \n     ability to expand quickly those skills, which were so \n     critical to our work on health care legislation, and your \n     successful efforts to communicate the merits of our \n     legislative work through the media to the public at large.\n       Ellen, I have often said in public that your brilliance and \n     dedication led people to believe that I had a health care \n     staff of ten. I consider myself enormously fortunate that you \n     have been my health care staff of one--supplemented, \n     certainly, by the excellent contributions of talented fellows \n     with whom you collaborated in our office. I wish you well in \n     your future endeavors, and I look forward to continuing to \n     see the positive results of the work we have done together.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Wellstone \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14136-2", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNATIONAL CHILDREN'S WISH WEEK\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

I cannot think of a more meritorious undertaking; this \norganization is focused on bringing the wonders of life to those whose \ndaily living is in question. The efforts of the Children's Wish \nFoundation have well earned this special recognition.\n  Therefore, I hope the people of Michigan will join me in recognizing \nNovember 26-December 2, 1995 as International Children's Wish Week in \nour State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14136-3", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14136-S14137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE 20TH ANNUAL SLOVAK HERITAGE FESTIVAL\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, our country is a remarkable mosaic--a \nmixture of races, languages, ethnicities and religions--that grows \nincreasingly diverse with each passing year. Nowhere is this incredible \ndiversity more evident than in the State of New Jersey. In New Jersey, \nschoolchildren come from families that speak 120 different languages at \nhome. These different languages are used in over 1.4 million homes in \nmy State. I have always believed that one of the United States greatest \nstrengths is the diversity of the people that make up its citizenry and \nI am proud to call the attention of my colleagues to an event in New \nJersey that celebrates the importance of the diversity that is a part \nof America's collective heritage.\n  On September 24, 1995, the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ \nwill celebrate its 20th Annual Slovak Heritage Festival. The heritage \nfestival program will salute one of the many different ethnic \ncommunities that contributes so greatly to New Jersey's diverse makeup. \nHighlighting old country customs and culture, the festival programs are \nan opportunity to express pride in the ethnic backgrounds that are a \npart of our collective heritage. The Slovak Heritage Festival will \nhighlight many aspects of the Slovak culture ranging from business to \nreligion. Additionally, the 20th Annual \n\n[[Page S 14137]]\nSlovak Heritage Festival will contribute proceeds from their programs \nto the Garden State Arts Center's cultural center fund which presents \ntheater productions free-of-charge to New Jersey's school children, \nseniors, and other deserving residents. The Heritage Festival thus not \nonly pays tribute to the cultural influences from our past, it also \nmakes a significant contribution to our present day cultural \nactivities.\n  The Slovak Heritage Festival will open with a business trade show \nwith a number of different exhibits. Chaired by Joseph J. Talafous, \nthis year's event will focus on free trade and economic development. At \nnoon the festival will honor his excellency, the Most Reverend Michael \nJ. Dudick, D.D., Bishop of Passaic, NJ, for his 15th anniversary of \ndedicated service to the Byzantine Catholic community. A mass will be \nperformed by Bishop Frantisek Tondra, of Spis Kapitula, Slovakia. \nFollowing the Mass, the opening ceremony which includes the Slovak \nfashion show, will take place on the mall. The festival will also \nfeature food, crafts, music, a soccer tournament, and traditional \nSlovak dancing.\n  Congratulations once again on the occasion of the 20th Annual Slovak \nHeritage Festival. I offer my best wishes to all who are celebrating a \nday of pride in their ethnicity by attending the festival.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14136-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MR. THOMAS L. AYRES ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                            VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like for the Senate to \nrecognize the retirement of Thomas L. Ayres from the Department of \nVeterans Affairs after more than 41 years of exemplary service in \nproviding health care to the armed service members and veterans of our \nNation. On September 30, 1995, Mr. Ayres will retire from his position \nas the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in \nAugusta, GA.\n  Tom began providing health care during his service with the United \nStates Army from 1995 until 1959 at the 279th Station Hospital in \nBerlin. After his service in the Army, he started his career with the \nVeterans' Administration by becoming a nursing assistant at the \nVeterans Administration Hospital in Marion, IN. From 1962 until 1969, \nTom worked as a supervisory recreation specialist at the Veterans \nHospital in Brecksville, OH. From 1969 until 1972, he served as a \nvoluntary services officer at Veterans Administration Hospitals in both \nMadison, WI and Gainesville, FL. In 1972, Tom Ayres became a medical \nadministration assistant at the Veterans Hospital in Madison, WI.\n  Since 1972, Tom Ayres has earned appointments to positions of \nincreased responsibility within the Department of Veterans Affairs. In \n1976, he became a hospital administration specialist and soon \nthereafter was transferred to the Veterans Affairs central office and \nserved as the executive assistant to the Associate Chief Medical \nDirector for Operations.\n  Tom Ayres received an appointment to the position of Medical Center \nDirector of the Veterans Administration Hospital in Salisbury, NC in \n1981. Nine years later, he became the director of the two-division \nVeterans Administration Medical Center in Augusta, GA. He also serves \nas the associate administrator for Veterans Affairs at the Medical \nCollege of Georgia and as a member of the Medical College of Georgia's \nClinical Enterprise Executive Committee.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career in providing health \nservices for U.S. veterans throughout our great Nation, Tom has \nreceived numerous awards based on the exemplary performance of his \nduties. His awards include the National Daughters of American Veterans \nCommander Award, the Award for Valor from the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, three Superior Performance Awards, and five consecutive \nExecutive Performance awards. In 1990, he received the Presidential \nRank Award from the President of the United States.\n  It is important to note that his compassion and sense of civic \nresponsibility does not start and end with his job. Tom is an active \nparticipant with the local United Way, Kiwanis Club, American Legion, \nSenior Executive Association, and the American College of Hospital \nAdministrators. In addition, he serves on the Administrative Board of \nTrinity on the Hill Church and is a life member of the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Thomas L. \nAyres for his outstanding career spent in service to our Nation's \nveterans. He is a model citizen in every sense of the term. We wish \nhim, his wife Christa, and their children and grandchildren Godspeed \nand every success for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14137-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN HONOR OF JOSEPH E.

Budd, will be appointed the grand \nmarshall of the Middlesex County Pulaski Day Parade Committee. This \nappointment is based on Joseph Budd's lifelong commitment to his \ncommunity and country.\n  Joseph Budd, born in Sayreville, NJ, has lived a life of exemplary \ncitizenship. As a youth, he graduated from South River High School, \nwhere he was an all-State baseball player. He than went on to play \nsemiprofessional baseball with Holy Trinity and Saint Mary's of South \nRiver, N.J.\n  After completing his education, Joseph joined the U.S. 77th Infantry \nDivision in the Pacific theater. Joseph distinguished himself as a \nSergeant of reconnaissance, receiving five battle stars and a Bronze \nStar in the Battle of Guam, for his outstanding bravery and superior \nleadership abilities.\n  After leaving the military, Joseph continued to play an active role \nin the veteran community by serving as the past commander of Veterans \nof Foreign War Post 8025 in Somerset, NJ, and as a member of the \nAmerican Legion Post 478. In addition, Joseph is also a member of the \nCatholic War Veterans Post 405 in New Brunswick, NJ.\n  Employed by the Public Service and Gas Co. for 36 years, Joe retired \nas an office manager in the customer service center in 1987. Joseph \nBudd's strong work ethic carried over into his commitment to community \nservice. Throughout his life, Joseph has been a committed member of a \nnumber of organizations.

Mr. President, next week the Senate Finance Committee \nwill begin to mark up a piece of legislation dealing with Medicare and \nMedicaid, essentially comporting to the budget that was enacted by the \nU.S. Senate. The issue, as anyone who has been watching television or \nreading the newspaper recently knows, is Medicare, tax cuts, \npriorities. I would like to talk about that a little bit today.\n  This morning I was watching a bit of the morning shows on television \nand I saw the Speaker of the House and a number of others engaging in a \ndebate about what these issues mean. There are a substantial amount of \ncharges and countercharges going back and forth on the issue of \nMedicare and the tax cuts. These are important issues, there is no \nquestion about that. I do not think anyone denies the consequences of \nwhat we do will have a \n\n[[Page S 14138]]\nsubstantial impact on people in this country. What I want to do today \nis discuss a little about the kinds of debate that we have heard in \nrecent days on the effect or impact of both the Medicare Program and \ntax cuts. I thought I would do it by beginning with some comments, not \nfrom a Democrat, but from a Republican.\n  This is from Kevin Phillips, a Republican conservative political \nanalyst. I want to go through some of the things he says, and the \nreason I do this is because the Speaker and others say this is all \nbeing distorted; it is a bunch of Democrats who want to distort what \nthe Republicans are doing on Medicare and tax cuts. Here is what Kevin \nPhillips says. He says, speaking of the Republican approach, the \nbudget, and so on:\n\n       It is senior citizens, the poor, students, and ordinary \n     Americans who will see programs they depend on gutted, while \n     business, finance, and the richest 1 or 2 percent, far from \n     making sacrifices, actually get new benefits and tax \n     reductions.\n\n  That is an analysis by a Republican of the Republican plan.\n  Further, from Kevin Phillips, he says:\n\n       If the U.S. budget deficit problem does represent the \n     fiscal equivalent of war--and maybe it does--then what we are \n     really looking at is one of the most flagrant examples of war \n     profiteering this century has seen.\n\n  Again, talking about the budget initiative.\n  Further, Kevin Phillips, a Republican, says:\n\n       . . . if the deficit is substantially reduced under a \n     program like this, there'll be a second stage of further \n     upward income redistribution from upper bracket profits in \n     the stock and bond markets.\n\n  Two additional comments from, again, a Republican political analyst \nabout this approach:\n\n       Spending on Government programs from Medicare and education \n     to home heating oil assistance is to be reduced in ways that \n     principally burden the poor and the middle class while \n     simultaneously taxes are to be cut in ways that predominantly \n     benefit the top 1 or 2 percent of Americans.\n\n  This is not some wild-eyed radical liberal saying this. This is an \nobservation from Kevin Phillips, a conservative Republican political \nanalyst.\n  Finally, from Mr. Kevin Phillips, ``In short,'' he says, again \nspeaking of the Republican budget which is now in place:\n\n       In short, aid to dependent grandmothers, children, college \n     students, and city dwellers is to be slashed while aid to \n     dependent corporations, stock brokers, generals, and assorted \n     James Bond imitators survives or even grows worse.\n\n  Those are the comments, not from someone who is partisan on this side \nof the aisle. Those are comments I have read from a political analyst \nwho is a Republican.\n  What of this debate about Medicare? The proposal in the budget to cut \nthe Medicare Program $270 billion below what is needed to finance the \nMedicare Program is a proposal to cut $270 billion. The analysis is \nthat $89 billion is needed for the trust fund. So the question is, if \nyou are going to cut $181 billion more than is necessary in Medicare to \nmake it solvent, where does that money go? How is that money used?\n  The answer to that is, of course, the extra money being cut in \nMedicare is to finance a tax cut. From the Department of Treasury, \nOffice of Tax Analysis, this pie chart shows what Kevin Phillips said \nin the earlier comments.\n  Who is going to get the benefits of the tax cut? This says that the \ntop 12 percent of the income earners in this country will get over 50 \npercent of the tax benefits. Families with over $100,000 of income will \nreceive 51.5 percent of the tax benefits.\n  We just had a vote on an amendment I offered, a-sense-of-the Senate \nresolution saying let us limit the tax cut to those who earn less than \n$100,000 a year. To the extent we save money by limiting the tax cut to \nthose who have $100,000 or less, let us then be able to use that \nsavings to reduce the cut in Medicare.\n  The vote was, predictably I think, 43 to 54. The amendment was \ndefeated.\n  The point is that over half the tax cut is going to go to families \nwith over $100,000 in income. This at a time when we are up to our \nnecks in debt, when we are told the deficit is such a serious problem \nthat we have to take a big hunk out of Medicare, $270 billion.\n  It turns out we have to take a big hunk out of Medicare, according to \nsome, in order to finance this half of the tax cut, and that is the \ndilemma and that is the political debate.\n  Is it just pure partisan politics? No. It is a debate about \npriorities. We only have the tax bill that the House of Representatives \npassed to go on, but if you take a look at what was passed by the House \nof Representatives, what you will see is that if you are a household \nbetween 0 and $30,000, or in other words a household with less than \n$30,000 in income, you will get a tax cut for the year of $124. If your \nincome is $200,000 or more, you will get a tax cut of $11,200.\n  Whenever one points this out--this comes from the Department of \nTreasury information--whenever someone points this out someone else \njumps up and says, ``Class warfare. Class warfare. You are trying to \ndivide people.''\n  I am not trying to divide anybody. I am just trying to figure out who \ngets what from these proposals. This is a classic cake and crumbs \napproach to a legislative profile. You give the cake to the big shots--\nif you have a lot of money you get to eat a big piece of this cake--and \nif you do not have much, they will wipe a few crumbs off the table for \nyou and say, ``By the way, everybody gets something here. This is a \nwonderful deal for everybody.''\n  Well, this graph shows it is not a wonderful deal for everybody. The \nfact is the bulk of the tax cut is going to inure to the benefit of the \nwealthiest Americans.\n  The interesting discussion about Medicare is this: Medicare was a \nvery controversial program when first conceived. When first proposed in \nthe U.S. Senate, 95 percent of the Republicans voted against the \nMedicare Program. ``Socialism,'' they said. ``We do not like it. We do \nnot want anything to do with it. It is bad public policy.'' I \nunderstand that. The old definition of a conservative is someone who \nnever wants to do anything for the first time. I understand all of \nthat.\n  The fact is, despite the fact that most all in their party opposed it \n30 years ago, I would guess, if you had a vote on the very simple \nproposition, ``Is Medicare good and should we keep Medicare?'' I would \nguess now 95 percent in the Republican Party would probably vote yes. \nThey have changed their mind. I think most of them would say that they \nwere wrong to oppose Medicare initially because Medicare has proven to \nbe an enormously important program.\n  Over half of the senior citizens in this country had no health care \ncoverage before we adopted Medicare. Then in the fifties, the forties, \nand in the thirties, back in the days when we had no Medicare coverage \nfor senior citizens, when getting sick when you were a senior citizen \nwas a circumstance where you feared that you would be held hostage by \nvirtue of being unable to pay for a medical bill or get medical help \nwhen you were critically ill. Half of the senior citizens in this \ncountry had no health care coverage.\n  We passed Medicare, and I am proud that I am part of a group whose \nheritage is to fight for things that are progressive. Ninety-nine \npercent of the senior citizens in this country now no longer have to \nlive in fear that they may not be able to get treatment for health care \nneeds because they now have the Medicare Program.\n  Is it a perfect program? Gosh, no. We have lots of problems with it. \nWe have had hearings about fraud. We have had hearings about waste. But \nthe fact is that most senior citizens and others who have used Medicare \nwould tell us that the Medicare Program has been a wonderful boon to \nthem.\n  It has cost us a lot more than we expected, for a couple of reasons. \nSenior citizens are living a lot longer. Senior citizens are living an \nenormous amount of time. Prior to the 1960's they did not have that \nkind of lifespan. Now they do.\n  What happened in addition to the fact that people are living longer \nis that medical technology has made breathtaking breakthroughs. Now \nwhen someone's knee gives out, they can get a new knee. When their hip \ngives out and they need a new hip, or when they eat food that plugs up \nthe heart muscle, somebody can open up their chest, give them an \noperation, unplug the heart muscle and the arteries, and they are back \nout. \n\n[[Page S 14139]]\n\n  So it is not unusual to run into a senior citizen that just had open \nheart surgery, or has a new knee, or has a new hip, or cataract \nsurgery, is 75 years old, and feels like a million dollars. It is all \nvery expensive, but it is wonderful. It is a condition of success in \nmany respects. But it has been an expensive program, there is no \nquestion about that.\n  The question before the Congress is, What kind of adjustments are \nnecessary to make it solvent? It is interesting that the trustees of \nthe Medicare commission say, well, the Medicare Program is going to be \ninsolvent by the year 2002 unless some adjustments are made.\n  The majority party wants to get some money out of Medicare. They \ncalled all of the trustees up to the Capitol Building and made a big \nshow. And they said, ``Medicare is going broke.'' In 23 of the last 25 \nyears when the trustees made their report, they said, ``Here is the \ndate by which Medicare will be insolvent.'' This was not the first time \nthat happened. This happens every year. But it is the first time that \nanybody has called the trustees up to make a big show out of it. In \nevery year, 23 out of 25 years, what has happened is the trustees say, \n``Here is the date by which Medicare will be insolvent.'' Every year \nthe Congress has made adjustments to make it solvent. This year we are \ngoing to do that. We are going to make an adjustment that deals with \nabout $89 billion over a long period of time to make the Medicare \nsystem solvent.\n  But we are not going, on this side of the aisle at least, to agree \nwith those who believe you ought to cut $270 billion rather than the \n$89 billion and take the extra $170 billion or so and use it to provide \na tax cut, half of which will go to people or families with incomes \nover $100,000 a year. That is how this boils down.\n  When you finally condense all of the crowd noise and all of the \nbellicose debates, when you finally condense it down to the simple \npoint, the point is this: We believe that adjustments to Medicare ought \nto be made to make the Medicare system solvent. That takes about $89 \nbillion to do. We do not believe, we do not support, and we will not \naccept notions that we ought to cut the Medicare Program an extra $170 \nbillion below what is necessary to serve the senior citizens who will \nbe eligible in the next 7 years in order to provide a tax cut, the bulk \nof which will go to upper-income people.\n  There is ample room for disagreement on priorities and policies. The \ndebate about priorities ought to be thoughtful, not thoughtless. It \nought not be a circumstance whenever someone stands up to talk about \nthis difference in priorities that someone says, ``Well, this is just \nraw politics. It is all nonsense.'' It is not raw politics, and it is \nnot nonsense. It is about priorities, what we believe in, what we fight \nfor, and what we think is important for the future of this country. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  I see the Senator from West Virginia just came to the floor. He has \nserved in this Chamber for a good long while and in a very \ndistinguished way. He has seen these policies and programs come and go. \nHe, perhaps more than any other, understands that some programs are \ngood and they make this country better. They make this a better place \nin which to live. Some were not so good and did not work out, and we \nhave changed programs. We have repealed programs. But the Medicare \nProgram, I think, has been an enormously beneficial program for this \ncountry. And those who had the courage to stand up when so many others \nsaid no, those who had the courage to do that and help develop this \nprogram for this country, have my unending gratitude.\n  There was an old saying around here a long time ago that, ``Any \njackass can kick a barn door down, but it takes a carpenter to build \none.'' It may be even an old West Virginia saying. I do not know. But I \nunderstand what that difference is. The talent to build is a \nsubstantially different talent than the talent to destroy.\n  Someone asked a foreman of a crew that was putting up a building, \n``What kind of people do you have to hire to put up a building?'' Well, \n``You have to hire skilled workers.'' ``What kind of people would you \nhire if you were tearing down a building?'' He said, ``Oh, that is not \na problem to get those kind of workers. That does not require any \nskill.''\n  It is the builders, in my judgment, of this country, who have done \nthe things to make this a better place in which to live that we must \npay tribute to. One way to pay tribute to them is to take a look at a \nprogram like Medicare and say, ``This is an enormous contribution to \nthis country.'' Let us fix it. Let us make sure it works. But let us \nnot do anything in any way that pulls out the foundation or the \nstructure that supports this wonderful program.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is going to be a tough one. \nThere are going to be a lot of charges flying back and forth. But when \nyou condense it all down to its rudimentary elements, it is very \nsimple: We support the $89 billion adjustment necessary to make this \nMedicare Program solvent for the long term. We do not support taking \nextra money out of Medicare to provide a very substantial tax cut, most \nof which will go to the affluent of this country. That is bad public \npolicy, and it is a wrong priority for the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nto speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. I thank him also for the \nconsistency with which he is fighting this battle, for his support of \nthe programs that are needed to help the elderly and, in helping the \nelderly, they help the young as well.\n  My thoughts go back to a time when the elderly did not have any \nsafety net, nor did anyone else. There were no welfare checks, no \nSocial Security checks, no Federal aid to education, no student loans. \nAnd when people became too old to work, they had nowhere else to go \nexcept over the hill to the poorhouse or stand at the gates of their \nchildren with their hats in their hands and hope to be taken in by \ntheir children.\n  Mr. President, the Senator is doing a great service to the country \nand for the Senate in calling attention to the arguments that are being \nmade here and the threats that are directed toward the Medicare \nProgram. And for what reason? To pay for a tax cut. It is folly, f-o-l-\nl-y, pure folly to talk about giving a tax cut, with the kind of \ndeficits we now have in this country, and it is going to be a tax cut \nfor the wealthy. I am opposed to that. I am opposed to any tax cut at \nthis time for anybody--wealthy, middle class, or anybody else. That \nmoney ought to be applied against the deficit or applied against the \ncost of the Medicare Program.\n  It is easy to tear down, as the Senator very aptly said, easy to tear \ndown. Anybody can tear down. It is hard to build. What he said brought \nto mind a bit of verse:\n\n     I saw them tearing a building down,\n     A group of men in a busy town;\n     With a ho-heave-ho and a lusty yell,\n     They swung a beam and a sidewall fell.\n\n     I asked the foreman, ``Are these men skilled,\n     The type you would hire if you had to build?''\n     He laughed, and then he said, ``No, indeed;\n     Just common labor is all you need.\n     I can easily wreck in a day or two,\n     That which takes builders years to do.''\n\n     I thought to myself as I walked away,\n     Which of these roles am I trying to play?\n     Am I a builder who works with care,\n     Building my life by the rule and square?\n\n     Am I shaping my deeds by a well-laid plan,\n     Patiently building the best I can?\n     Or am I a wrecker who walks the town,\n     Content with the labor of tearing down?\n\n  I am afraid that is what we see at play here. The wreckers are busy.\n  It is late September and the Senate is entering the season of fiscal \n``sound and fury.'' Political leaders in Washington will have to come \nto grips with all of the rhetorical promises made to reduce the deficit \nto zero in 7 years, and actually legislate the details which will \nachieve that end. In this fiscal year, that means substantial savings \nwill have to be made in many important domestic programs, but clearly \nthe most sensitive of these are the third-rail issues of American \npolitics--Social Security and Medicare.\n  Substantial savings must be found in Medicare in order to meet the \ndeficit reduction targets called for in the budget resolution. The \nmajority party has attempted to justify a very large cut in the \nmedicare program--some \n\n[[Page S 14140]]\n$270 billion dollars, I believe--by claiming that the medicare trust \nfund is in danger of collapse.\n  In the first place, $270 billion is more than triple what is actually \nneeded to stabilize the fund. In the second place, the savings will not \nbe applied to the ``trust fund'' part of Medicare. The savings proposed \nto allegedly salvage the trust fund are actually going to be given away \nin the form of tax cuts--some $245 billion dollars worth of them--that \nmainly will benefit the well-to-do in our society.\n  It is true that steps will need to be taken to make sure that \nMedicare remains solvent for future generations. Both political parties \nneed to explain that to the people. There is no getting around it. \nMedicare must undergo changes if it is to continue to be a viable \npublic health care program. But, we poison the water for acceptance by \nthe public of the changes that must come to make the Medicare system \nhealthy if we obfuscate, hype, and over-simplify this issue. On the one \nhand, if we leave the impression with senior citizens that no changes \nare necessary, we close off the avenue for large-scale acceptance of \nreasonable change. In fact, the status quo cannot prevail. The program \nis growing too fast, and with the baby boomers headed for eligibility \nin the next decade, the Medicare Program has to be altered to \naccommodate larger numbers of recipients. We must not leave the \nimpression that the status quo can be protected by any political party \nor any President. A reality check has to come.\n  On the other hand, to falsely claim that huge savings are needed \nright now, and then to further claim, falsely, that those savings will \ngo toward the salvation of Medicare, when, in fact, those savings will \nonly be used to hand out tax cuts to special interests and the most \ncomfortable in our society is an outrage, a breaking of faith with the \nelderly, and a sure way to lay the groundwork for the utter failure of \nany reasonable and real fix of Medicare when it has to be enacted.\n  The $270 billion worth of cuts mandated by the writers of the budget \nresolution is a bogus number. It was picked for no other reason, I \nbelieve, than the convenience of allowing room for the promised tax \ncuts while making the budget arithmetic come out balanced.\n  That number is a fabrication by the ``powers that be'' in the current \nCongress. It reflects nothing more than a policy decision here in \nWashington to raise monthly premiums on seniors for Part B Medicare \nbenefits so that there will be dollars enough to hand around in tax \ncuts. I deplore the hype and the scare tactics about collapsing funds \nand vanishing Medicare programs and the absolute necessity of making \n$270 billion dollars worth of cuts in Medicare. While it is true we \nwill have to eventually make some savings in the fund, nothing but a \npolitical decision to make room for tax cuts, in my judgment, is \ndriving cuts in the Medicare Program of this magnitude.\n  To make matters worse, the details of the plan to cut Medicare will \nbe wrapped in a reconciliation bill, under a 20-hour time limit, with \nlittle opportunity to debate or amend the proposal. After weeks of \nmisinformation, claims, counter claims, hype, scare tactics, media \nmanipulation, general confusion, and false premises, this extremely \nsensitive and crucial program important to millions of our elderly \npopulation will be dispatched on the Senate floor under the tightest of \ntime limits in a massive deficit reduction package.\n  Now, I turned down the President of the United States when he urged \nme to go along with putting health care reform into the reconciliation \nbill. I also turned down that request on the part of the then majority \nleader, Mr. Mitchell. I am opposed to putting huge Medicare cuts and \ntax cuts into the reconciliation bill for the same reason that I \nopposed including health care reform on that occasion. I said it was a \nmatter so complex, so costly it ought to be debated fully by the \nSenate. That is why we are here--to debate such matters. To put massive \nbills of that nature into a reconciliation bill is to deny the American \npeople the information and to deny Senators the information to which \nthey are entitled if they are to make sound judgments. But apparently \nthat is what is going to be done.\n  The details will be obscured by the smoke of the rhetoric and, in \nshort the American people will never know what hit them until it is too \nlate, as usual.\n  As if there has not already been enough confusion and \nmisrepresentation over reforming medicare, now we hear reports of \nfurther chicanery in the budget wars over the issue.\n  Apparently some in the other body have gotten ``cold feet'' over \ntrading cuts in medicare for cuts in taxes and have opted to play the \n``magic asterisk'' game in the reconciliation process. The \nCongressional Budget Office apparently has told the Republican \nleadership that, even with a substantial rise in medicare payments by \nbeneficiaries, the $270 billion in medicare budget savings the \nRepublicans need to get from medicare in order to pay for their tax \ncut, has still not materialized. So, the Republicans are reviving an \nold canard called a ``look-back'' sequester in the House--the ``look-\nback'' sequester--in order to achieve the additional cuts needed.\n  Beware, America's seniors! Beware! A ``look-back'' sequester is the \ngimmick of all gimmicks in the arcane language of Federal Budgetese.\n  The ``look-back'' says in plain English--we need more of that these \ndays, plain English. I am for making English the national language.\n  I realize I may be politically incorrect in making such a statement, \nbut I studied Muzzey when I was in grade school. Muzzey's ``History of \nthe American People.'' And the very first sentence in Muzzey's history \nbook said, ``America is the child of Europe.''\n  Mr. President, that is true. Muzzey did not care much about being \npolitically correct. He would have been hooted out of town these days. \nBut he believed in giving the historical facts. So do I. I do not give \na hoot about political correctness. I will take my stand with Muzzey! \nAmerica was the child of Europe. And I will take my stand with making \nEnglish the national language.\n  The ``look-back'' says in plain English, if our savings plan does not \nachieve $270 billion in medicare savings, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services is instructed to identify the shortfall each year and \nthen to arbitrarily make sufficient cuts in the succeeding year to \neliminate the previous year's shortfall. That is legislative and \npolitical ``kick the can'' at its worst.\n  Members of Congress were elected to make these choices and to make \nthem in ways that are understandable and acceptable to the public they \nrepresent. Gimmicks like ``look-back'' sequesters deny the American \npublic the opportunity to hear a reasoned debate and to weigh in on \ndecisions they elected us to make. It is a totally spineless way to \nmake cuts in vital programs and it is painless only for the shaky-kneed \nlegislators who employ it.\n  I urge the Majority Party in the Senate to reject this return to \nbudget gimmickry, David Stockman type magic asterisks, process fixes, \nand responsibility-shirking convolutions, and engage instead in an \nhonest debate, utilizing plain English language, with the American \npeople about what needs to be done to balance the budget and also \nassure the solvency of medicare for future users.\n  I further urge the Senate Finance Committee not to unduly tax \nMedicare recipients in order to parcel out generous tax breaks for \nthose who do not have to worry about how to pay their doctor bills and \nafford their medications.\n  We will never keep deficit reduction on track if we begin the effort \nby failing to come clean with the people about how hard it will be to \ncarry out the plan. It really comes down, Mr. President, to a matter of \ntrust. If we trust the intelligence and reasonableness of the American \npeople by telling them the truth, they just may--they just may--begin \nto trust us and give us their support in crafting the hard solutions to \nour budget and deficit problems.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n[[Page S 14141]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. My friend, who is presiding in the chair, the distinguished \nSenator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], was interested in the remarks I \nmade a few minutes earlier, and he asked me about Muzzey, whether or \nnot he was the author of the book on American history. He was. He was \nthe author. As I recall, the book was copyrighted, I believe, around \n1927, 1928, 1929, or 1930.\n  I used to memorize the chapters in that history book at night by the \nlight of a kerosene lamp. I told my fellow classmates in the early \ngrades about Nathaniel Greene, Francis Marion the ``Swamp Fox,'' Daniel \nMorgan, and about Nathan Hale.\n  I often carry on conversations with the young pages here. And as each \nnew page group comes to the Senate, I generally ask them several \nquestions. And I will stop to tell them stories. When I walk into that \nCloakroam, they will gang up around me like a bunch of little birds \nwith their mouths open wanting to be fed, and they ask, ``Can you tell \nus a story today?''\n  Well, generally my first question of these new young pages is ``Have \nyou ever heard of Nathan Hale?'' And normally they have never heard of \nNathan Hale. I was pleased that this year--I believe there were as many \nas three in the group who had heard of Nathan Hale.\n  Mr. DODD. Would my friend and colleague yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course. With great pleasure.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I walked on the floor here. Coincidentally, \nthe distinguished former leader and senior Senator from West Virginia \nmentions Nathan Hale. I live in the town in the State of Connecticut \nwhere Nathan Hale taught in East Haddam, CT.\n  Coincidentally, in approximately 30 minutes the high school choral \ngroup from the Nathan Hale High School of East Haddam, CT, will be \nmeeting with me on the steps of the Capitol here and later will be \nperforming at the Kennedy Center.\n  I chose them as a choral group from my State. Each State gets to name \na choral group. So it is serendipity that as I walked onto the floor, \nmy wonderful friend of so many years mentions Nathan Hale.\n  In fact, I say to my colleague, I live in a renovated schoolhouse on \nthe banks of the Connecticut River. It was the successor school to the \none-room schoolhouse in which Nathan Hale taught in East Haddam, CT.\n  So I appreciate immensely my colleague's reference to a Connecticut \nson of whom we are deeply proud for his steadfastness, his loyalty, his \npatriotism, and his regret that he had but only one life to give to his \ncountry. I thank my colleague for referencing him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend, Senator Dodd. Plato thanked the gods for \nhaving been born a man, he thanked the gods for having been born a \nGreek, and he thanked the gods for having been born in the age of \nSophocles.\n  Mr. President, I thank the benign hand of destiny for allowing me to \nlive in an age in which the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nChristopher Dodd, is a Member of this body. I am glad that he chanced \nto come by the floor just as I was talking about the patriot Nathan \nHale.\n  Nathan Hale was a young schoolteacher, 21 years of age, and when \nGeorge Washington called for a volunteer to go behind the British lines \nto draw pictures of the British fortifications, Nathan Hale volunteered \nto go on this dangerous mission. He disguised himself as a Dutch \nschoolmaster.\n  He went behind the British lines. He was successful in drawing \npictures of the fortifications and accumulating information that would \nbe of benefit to General George Washington. But upon the evening before \nHale was to return, he was discovered carrying the documents, and was \narrested. The next morning, he was brought up before the scaffold. His \nrequest for a Bible was denied.\n  There he stood in full view of the stark, wooden coffin in which his \nbody was soon to be placed. The British officer, whose name was \nCunningham, said, ``Have you anything to say?''\n  Hale, whose hands were tied behind him, said, ``I only regret that I \nhave but one life to lose for my country.''\n  The British commander said, ``String the rebel up.''\n  I do not find that great story in history books anymore. What I used \nto call history is, I think, probably today more aptly designated \n``social studies.'' There is nothing wrong with social studies, of \ncourse, but we also need history. Young people need heroes to emulate, \nand we used to have such heroes in American history.\n  Well, I just tell that story for the benefit of those who may be a \nlittle startled at my looking askance at so-called ``political \ncorrectness.'' Take it away. Give me history. Give me Muzzey!\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend our colleague \nfrom West Virginia, not only because he made reference to our favorite \nson of East Haddam, CT, a schoolteacher. In fact, the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia has, over the years, enjoyed my \nChristmas greetings card which, on numerous occasions, has the \nschoolhouse in East Haddam as the cover.\n  I appreciate his reference to Nathan Hale, of whom we are very proud \nin Connecticut and the Nation. I also appreciate, once again, his \nreminding the Members of this body and the Nation at large of the \nimportance of history and social studies and people who have sacrificed \ngreat things, who have given us the opportunity to enjoy this Nation \ntoday.\n  Too often, those stories are minimized or scorned or treated lightly. \nIt is the lives of heroes, the lives of great individuals which have \nmade the difference. Events do not happen without great individuals, \nand we do not pay enough attention to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14137-4", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14141-S14144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today if I can, \nand talk about our upcoming proposal on Medicare, which is a subject of \ngreat interest, and ought to be, in the country. I think it is \nimportant to place into context this debate.\n  Regardless of where one stands on the specifics of these issues as \nthey come out, it is important that we all understand that we are \ntalking about the single largest transfer of wealth in the history of \nour country with this proposal, some $270 billion that will have to be \nmoved from the Medicare Program. We are talking simultaneously about a \n$245 billion tax cut. There is nothing quite like this in the annals of \nthis country's history.\n  I say that, not to in any way suggest that in and of itself one ought \nto oppose this, but rather to raise what I hope will be the interests \nof the American public as we engage in this discussion, because they \nare the ones who will be affected. Not the Members of this body \nbecause, frankly, most of us have health care programs and have income \nlevels which will basically make us immune from the kind of potential \ntragedies and difficulties that most Americans will face if they lose a \nsafety net of health care.\n  It is in their interest, and it is certainly a program that has been \ntremendously successful in assisting millions of people over the last \n30 years to avoid the catastrophic problems associated with the \npredictable health problems that people face.\n  What disturbs me is the fact that we are going to have almost no \nhearings on this at all. In fact, only 1 day of hearings have been \nscheduled in the entire Congress on an issue that I think is certainly \nas important as any that this body will debate or discuss this year, \nonly 1 day of hearings on the single largest transfer of wealth in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  Mr. President, the world looks on this body, and we often refer to it \nourselves, as the greatest deliberative body in the world. Yet, I say \nwith all due respect to those in the majority that to hold only 1 day \nof discussions on legislation that will affect today 37 million direct \nbeneficiaries of Medicare, not to mention the families of these \nMedicare recipients and, frankly, \n\n[[Page S 14142]]\nthose who will move into the age categories that would allow them to \nreceive some Medicare assistance, I find hard to justify, to put it \nmildly.\n  We are not talking about an Intelligence Committee issue here. We are \nnot even talking about a defense issue in which the secrecy of our \nproceedings has legitimacy. But to come forward with an idea that only \nhas 1 day of hearings and will affect many millions of people I find \nvery, very disturbing.\n  I can only conclude, Mr. President, that some people are deeply \nworried that more people may find out about what we are likely to \ndo. And so some think, do it fast, do it quickly, get it over with. \nHopefully, they will not notice, and we can achieve the kind of results \nthat some are seeking to adopt when it comes to this program.\n\n  Mr. President, this plan, as I mentioned at the outset of these \nremarks, will cut Medicare by $270 billion. Let me quickly point out \nthat that number is three times what the Health Care Finance \nAdministration says is necessary to extend the solvency of Medicare \nuntil the year 2006--three times, Mr. President.\n  I am not sure that the Health Care Finance Administration is \nabsolutely correct. They are saying about $89 billion. There are those \nwho would tell you that you could do this with $45 billion if you can \ndeal with some of the waste and fraud, which CBO and others will not \nscore. A GAO study that was done said you could basically achieve the \nsavings if we would just make this program run more efficiently. \nWhether you believe the $45 billion or $60 billion or $89 billion, no \none will tell you--no one--that $270 billion in cuts in the Medicare \nProgram is necessary. Yet, that is exactly the plan being put together \nas we sit here. It is not a plan done in the light of day, but done \nwith one day of hearings, with a bunch of people writing this gathered \nin rooms where you cannot find them. They are leaking this out bit by \nbit with vagaries and never getting into the details.\n  I do not think people ought to stand for that. Whether you agree or \ndisagree, it is fundamental that we have a full-blown discussion of \nwhat we are likely to do here with a plan that is going to affect that \nmany millions of people--people who are not in a great position to \ndefend themselves.\n  Let me share with my colleagues what we are talking about here and \nwho these beneficiaries are. The vast majority of our beneficiaries are \nnot well-off people. I, for instance, have long supported the idea of \nmeans testing Medicare. I do not find that to be any great \nrevolutionary idea. I am talking about incomes of $75,000 or $150,000.\n  I quickly point out, Mr. President, that the savings there are \nrelatively modest when you look at the overall amount of cuts that are \nbeing talked about. Lest anyone thinks that the money could be saved by \nexcluding the wealthy, let us take a quick look at the numbers. Ninety-\nseven percent of Medicare expenditures go to individuals with incomes \nof $50,000 or less; 97 percent go to people with $50,000 or less. \nSeventy-eight percent of Medicare beneficiaries have an income of less \nthan $25,000 a year. The median income for a woman of 65 years of age \nor over is $8,500 a year. In fact, the median income is $17,000. And \nalmost 9 million of the 37 million of Medicare recipients have incomes \nof less than $10,000 a year.\n  So when we start talking about $270 billion in cuts and premium \nincreases, and the like, remember who we are talking about here. We are \nnot talking about affluent Americans. We are talking about people who, \nin some cases, are in the most difficult positions, financially, in the \ncountry. If not just them, we are talking about their families, who \nwill have to bear the burden of handling these costs.\n  It has been a very successful program. Yes, it has problems and you \nhave to treat and work on some of the costs associated with it. But it \nhas been a tremendously successful program. If you look here on the \nchart, Mr. President, in 1959, only 46 percent of our seniors have \nhealth care coverage. That was before Medicare. Since 1965, seniors \nwith health care has now risen to 99 percent.\n  I do not think we can underestimate the value of that to people, not \njust in terms of their health--as everybody knows, when you get older, \nyou will face medical problems--but financially what it means to people \nand their families as well.\n  There was significant opposition to this program. This did not go \nthrough like some of the issues around here. It was debated and voted \non three different times in 1965 before it became the law of the land. \nAnd 93 percent of those now in the majority at that time voted against \nthis program in 1965. I think most of those people today would agree \nthat this has been a very good program, indeed, and it has made a \nsubstantial difference in people's lives.\n  So I think it is in our critical interest that we at least--when you \nare talking about a $270 billion cut in this program over 7 years--\nunderstand what the implications are, what happens--not those who make \n$75,000 for an individual or $125,000 a year for couples--but for the \nwoman making $8,500 a year, as so many are, or the 9 million who make \nless than $10,000 a year, or 50 percent of the entire population of \nMedicare recipients who make less than $17,000 a year. Today, they are \npaying about $3,000 in out-of-pocket of expenses. We are looking at a \nproposal--and, again, we do not have the details of all of this yet. \nBut according to those who have seen the numbers, we are talking about \nan increase of maybe $2,700.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have 5 additional minutes on this. I see \nmy colleague from Rhode Island here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are talking here about people in that \nincome category. The estimates are that we could be looking at an \nincrease in Medicare out-of-pocket costs of some $2,700. Now, you can \ncut that down on a daily figure, and so forth. But if you are in that \n$17,000 or $20,000 range, putting aside the $8,500, that is a \ntremendous additional cost to people in that particular income \ncategory.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Quickly, if I can. I only have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I am the only one here. If you want to have more time, as \nfar as I am concerned, you can add my question time on. Where did you \nget this figure about a $1,700 increase?\n  Mr. DODD. Those are the figures that have been in the House \nproposals.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let us not talk about the House. We are in the Senate. \nThe Senate bill was announced today. The part B premium of 31.5 percent \nis going to stay at 31.5 percent. Is it going to go up with inflation? \nYes. Thirty-one and a half percent of the cost will remain at 31.5. Is \nit going to stay exactly the same dollar figure as last year or 2 years \nago? No. But under any administration, Democrat or Republican, it will \nincrease.\n  Now, the second part is about the deductible. There is no increase in \nthe copayments. They remain exactly the same, at the 20 percent. On the \nincrease in the deductibles, over the years with inflation, the \ndeductibles have gone up. Under this program, they would go from $100 \nto $150. That is certainly no $1,700.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, not $1,700, but $2,700, which in the \nHouse plan.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Then that is even more inaccurate.\n  Mr. DODD. No it is not.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. If you want to talk about the persons in the upper \ncategories--\n  Mr. DODD. I am not the guy you want to ask. The person you want to \nask the question to is the Speaker of the House and members of the Ways \nand Means Committee, who are putting the plan together. The Senate may \ndecide it wants to go to something else. I have not seen the Senate \nproposals. I know what the Speaker and Ways and Means Committee are \nsaying.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We happen to be in the Senate, and they announced a plan \ntoday. We do not have to debate on the floor of the Senate what the \nHouse plan is. We have a Senate plan. I happen to know what the Senate \nplan is, and it is not $2,700. Now, if you are talking Jack Kent Cooke, \none of the richest men in America, and if he continues taking the part \nB, yes, he will pay more and he jolly well ought to pay more; 75 \npercent of Jack Kent Cooke's medical bills are being paid by the \ntaxpayer.\n\n[[Page S 14143]]\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this is not a question and answer.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It is not right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut have another 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator from Connecticut yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am going through the Chair, as we should. \nWill the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. FORD. Now, as I understand it, in the plan as we operate it \ntoday, the premium goes up only based on a COLA. So instead of being 31 \npercent, it is only at 28 percent. Therefore, as the COLA is increased, \nthe other amount is increased, but it is basically at 28 percent \ninstead of 31 percent, as our friend from Rhode Island has indicated.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to our colleague that he is absolutely \ncorrect. That is part of it.\n  We are talking about $270 billion in savings, Mr. President. And to \nsuggest that somehow you can achieve that number, and not talk about \nthe beneficiaries being affected, is exactly the kind of problem we get \ninto here. Of course, it is going to cost. What I find even more \ndisturbing about this, Mr. President, is the fact that we are looking \nhere at a $245 billion tax break occurring simultaneously.\n  By the way, this tax break was higher originally. We were talking \nabout $260 billion to $270 billion in a tax break earlier. They pared \nit back to $245 billion.\n  Is it not coincidental that the size of the Medicare cut and the size \nof the tax break almost match up dollar for dollar?\n  Now the tax break has been reduced a bit here, but nonetheless it \nseems quite obvious to this Senator how we pay for that tax break. That \ntax break is paid for, it seems to me, by the cut in Medicare.\n  In the cuts, and again watching this plan dribble out, not a single \npenny in the proposals being proposed in the House of Representatives \nactually go to the trust fund. Not a penny of it.\n  Here we are talking about this great problem with the trust fund and \ninstead of dedicating the resources to the trust fund to put it in \nbetter shape we talk about dollars going here.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator would yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I will complete my 5 minutes and my colleague can ask for 5 \nminutes to proceed.\n  Mr. President, 51.5 percent of the tax break proposed by the \nRepublican plan goes to people making over $100,000 a year. Mr. \nPresident, that is a fact. Cut that any way you want, but that is the \nincome level.\n  Watch down here in the zero to $30,000 category, they get 4.8 \npercent; people making 30,000 to $50,000, 11.6 percent; and it breaks \ndown to 16 and 15 percent.\n  I am not objecting even to the idea of having some tax proposals. My \nview is to postpone these. I put them aside because I think deficit \nreduction is a completely legitimate issue and we ought to focus on it.\n  If you want a deficit reduction, take this idea, put it on the table \nfor a couple of years and then look at the Medicare issue for really \nwhat it is, instead of coming up with a phony number here that \nbasically in my view, and as it appears to those who have looked at \nthis, satisfies the needs of a tax break proposal.\n  That is what this amounts to. There will be squawking, a lot of \nhemming and hawing, but if this were truly a decent and fair plan we \nwould have more than 1 day of hearings. We would not try and have a \nstealth program that comes in and all of a sudden is sprung on this \nbody.\n  I know what will happen. We will have one vote under the \nreconciliation that will be lumped together. We will have little or no \nchance to amend it, change it or offer different ideas, in the single \nlargest transfer of wealth in the history of the United States.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I do not think people will stand for it. I \nbelieve when people know more about this, and they will want to know \nmore about it, they will not be satisfied with one day of hearings, \nwith an idea of wrapping this all together, minimize the kind of \npolitical confrontation people will have to deal with here if they are \ngoing to address this issue.\n  As I said at the outset of these remarks, I am more than happy to \ntake a look at what needs to be done with Medicare, more than happy. I \nhave advocated means testing for more than a decade on this program. I \nwill not take a back seat to anyone in that area.\n  The suggestion that $270 billion is necessary here when none of the \nresources go to that trust fund I find less than genuine when it comes \nto trying to deal with the issue of the Nation's health care needs.\n  Let me go back and remind our colleagues here. Consider where we \nwere, and consider the history of this. In 1959 only 46 percent, less \nthan half the population of seniors had health care. Today we are \ngetting almost universal coverage.\n  There are those that have been hostile to this program from day one \nand have disagreed with it. I am not opposed to the idea of coming up \nwith ways in which people can participate in their own financial and \nhealth security down the road. I think that is a good idea. That is not \ngoing to work for everyone.\n  To say you will have that as a substitute for Medicare is to be \nterribly naive, in my view, about what needs to be done to satisfy the \nneeds of people in this category.\n  While we are talking about the 37 million who are the Medicare \nrecipients, remember it is their children and their families who also \nare affected. There are people out there today who are trying to meet \nthe needs of two generations, their own children as well as their \nparents, so this burden just does not fall on those in the category of \nretirement age. These people are trying to plan for educational needs, \ntheir children, their mortgages, rent, and food. While some say $1,700 \nor $2,700 does not amount to much--$21 a week, that is part of the \nproblem here. We are so out of touch in terms of the economic realities \nof what millions of Americans face every day, we do not think it is \nmuch anymore. Go home and listen to your people. They will tell you \nthat it is. They ought to at least be given the common decency of a \nreview of what is about to be done to them, more than one day of \nhearings. I hope that will be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to correct a few inaccuracies that \nwere in the statement of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. I \nam confident that these were unintentional, but they were delivered \nwith considerable vigor so I think I might take this opportunity to \nrebut then.\n  The Senator from Connecticut said not one penny from these savings in \nMedicare go into the trust fund. That just plain is not so.\n  Every single nickel, every single penny saved under the part A, the \nreduction in the payments to the hospitals, the reductions in the \npayments to the other providers, the providers dealing with the \nhospitals' side, all go into what is known as the hospital insurance \nfund, or part A.\n  Every single penny--I am not sure of the exact amount in billions of \ndollars, but of the total $270 billion, a very substantial, I will not \nsay half, but I suspect close to half will go into that part A hospital \ninsurance trust fund.\n  When the Senator says with all the vigor he can muster that none of \nthat is going into the trust fund, that just plain is not right.\n  Now, second, the Senator says 51 percent of the tax cuts are going to \nthe rich. That is a very interesting statement because in the Senate we \ndo not have any idea what the tax cuts are going to be.\n  All that we have done in the Senate is to say that up to $240 billion \nof tax cuts can take place. That means there could be zero, there could \nbe $1 or there could be $240 billion. No one has said so far--the \nFinance Committee that deals with the tax cuts has not come up with any \nproposals dealing with what the tax cuts will be.\n  Some say they want $500 credit for every child. Now, if that is \nadopted, no one is suggesting that 51 percent of that is going to the \nrich people. Every taxpayer, even taxpayers who pay $501 will get a \n$500 credit, so they pay $1 in taxes. \n\n[[Page S 14144]]\n\n  Indeed, the person who pays less than that, I presume would not only \nget a refund but get some kind of an income tax credit in addition to \nthe regular $500 credit.\n  Who knows what we will adopt? Knowing how legislative bodies are, I \nsuspect that we will go right up to the $240 billion. No one has \ndecided that yet. No meetings of the Finance Committee have taken place \nin connection with taxes. No decisions have been made. It is total \nnonsense to say that 51 percent of the tax cut is going to the rich \nunder any Senate plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/09/22/senate-section/article/S14141-1", "month": "09", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 1995\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Now, Mr. President, we have the opportunity to hear the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee] for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I want to be very observant of the rules of comity \nthat exist between the Senate and the House. And, so, I seek never to \ncall the name of a Member of the other body. I think the rules of \ncomity are very important and I hope never to violate them.\n  However, Mr. President, I cannot allow the recent comments made by a \nMember of the other body, regarding a possible government-wide default, \nto go unanswered. Both the Washington Post and the New York Times today \ncontain articles that suggest that a leading Member of the other body \nis willing to put the United States into default in order to coerce the \nPresident of the United States into swallowing a set of budget \nproposals that large segments of the public and the Congress consider \nto be extreme.\n  A Member of the other body has reportedly stated, ``I don't care what \nthe price is,'' and is also quoted as saying that he does ``not care if \nwe have no executive offices and no bonds for 60 days--not this time.'' \nHe has further stated that he would use his office to prevent a vote to \nincrease the debt limit until the President agrees to his proposals for \nbalancing the budget.\n  That Member may not care, Mr. President, but I do. I care very deeply \nabout the welfare of the United States and the people of the United \nStates. This kind of arrogant brinkmanship can do irreparable damage to \nthe United States, to its creditworthiness, and to its international \nstanding. It could have long-lasting effects on the world stock and \nbond markets, with unseen ramifications for U.S. interests around the \nworld. That is very careless--careless talk, Mr. President.\n  With each passing day, we climb ever closer to the $4.9 trillion \nceiling on Federal debt imposed by Congress in 1993. We may hit that \nceiling as early as the end of October, or as late as mid-November, but \nhit it we will, as sure as I am standing here today, unless action is \ntaken soon to increase that limit. In the first 5 days of November, the \nGovernment must pay $50 billion in Social Security benefits, Medicare, \nand active-duty military pay. On November 15, some $25 billion in \ninterest payments will be due on interest payments on the debt. Without \nan increase of the debt ceiling, the Government may be able to limp \nalong until these payments are due, but no amount of accounting \nlegerdemain will cover these large payments. Without an increase in the \nGovernment's ability to borrow, Government checks would not be honored. \nFor the first time in history--we have been talking about history here \ntoday--the United States would default. It is almost inconceivable for \nme to imagine the Government of the United States bouncing a check, but \nthat stark possibility looks us right in the face.\n  A Government default is not something to be taken lightly, as the \nauthor of the reported remarks seems to feel. This is a very, very \nserious issue. It does not just mean that ``executive offices'' might \nbe shut for 60 days. It does not just mean that there will be ``no \nbonds'' for 60 days. It is far more devastating than that glib picture \nwould imply. The Congressional Research Service paints a far darker \nscenario. Let me quote the CRS report:\n\n       It is difficult to describe the extent of the problems the \n     Government would face if the debt limit were not increased \n     when needed. Under current Federal borrowing needs (for \n     1996), the effect would be similar to a 10 percent reduction \n     in spending with no preplanning and uncertain authority to \n     rank activities by importance. From past experience, most \n     non-essential operations of the Government could be shut \n     down. Most Federal employees might be sent home. National \n     parks and monuments could close. Regulatory activities could \n     cease. Discretionary Federal activities would probably be cut \n     back as much as possible so that mandatory activities could \n     be paid for. Depending on how long the situation lasted, \n     employees, and eventually beneficiaries, could stop receiving \n     checks from the Government. Government bondholders might not \n     receive their interest payments. Federal construction \n     projects could stop. Payments to State and local governments \n     could stop. Federal contractors could find their payments \n     delayed or missed. Through its reach into all parts of \n     society, the disruption of Federal activities could spread \n     over the entire country.\n\n  Mr. President, this comes from the CRS Issue Brief entitled ``The \nDebt Limit,'' updated August 10, 1995, by Philip D. Winters, Economics \nDivision.\n  So, Mr. President:\n\n       Payments to State and local governments could stop. Federal \n     contractors could find \n\n[[Page S 14145]]\n     their payments delayed or missed. Through its reach into all parts of \n     society--\n\n  Not just here within the beltway; but in all parts of society.\n\n     the disruption of Federal activities could spread over the \n     entire country.\n\n  Mr. President, if that is not enough to rattle your teeth and curl \nyour hair, it will certainly send a shiver of fear down the spine of \nevery single American.\n  But let us further consider the international consequences of a \nfailure to increase the debt limit and subsequent default. Perhaps the \ndistinguished--and he is a very distinguished Member of the other body \nfor whom I have a great deal of respect--perhaps he does not care about \nthe dire consequences that his words threaten for the individual \nAmerican who helped to put him into office. After all, he will continue \nto be paid, as I will continue to be paid, and as every Member of this \nbody and every Member of the other body, and the Chief Executive at the \nother end of the avenue will be paid, even if the Government shuts \ndown--down, down.\n  A failure to raise the debt limit in a timely manner could turn the \ninternational economy into a sea of quicksand. The U.S. dollar has been \nthe backbone of international trade for most of this century. A default \nby the United States, that solid pillar of fiscal sobriety, would cause \ninvestor confidence in the dollar and U.S. government securities to \nplummet--plummet like Lucifer's fall into the lake of fire--affecting \nboth domestic and international stock markets.\n  But the glib threats made by that distinguished Member of the other \nbody reportedly have already shaken the confidence of the investors \nthat the United States depends upon to finance our debt, through \nTreasury bond sales. Already, in partial reaction to his words, the \nvalue of the dollar dropped by five percent before recovering somewhat. \nThat drop in the value of the dollar will be insignificant in \ncomparison to the effects of an actual default. Only 11 percent of the \ntotal value of publicly held U.S. Government debt securities are held \ndirectly by U.S. individuals. Some 22 percent are held by individuals \nand entities residing abroad. These foreign investors cannot be \nexpected to understand the U.S. political system, and will simply \ninvest elsewhere until this whole crisis blows over. But if the United \nStates defaults, these investors will not be quick to come back. \nIndeed, domestic investors will be hard to win back, even if lured with \nhigher interest rates, which cost the Government more. What used to be \ncalled ``government securities'' will become ``government \ninsecurities'' for a long time to come. Is this what we want? Is this \nwhat you, the American people, want? I cannot believe that we do, or \nthat you do. This is not in the best interests of the United States.\n  This political brinkmanship--that is precisely what it is, political \nbrinkmanship--this political brinkmanship which could so easily \nbackfire can only result in the United States being the loser in the \nlong term.\n  A default would result in the United States facing permanently \nincreased borrowing costs when the time comes to roll over our debt. \nInterest rates on those loans, which are secured with government bonds, \nwould be raised, increasing the costs to the taxpayer. The Treasury \nDepartment estimates that every increase of one percentage point in \ninterest rates would swell the deficit by $4.9 billion this year. So \nthis political extortion game being perpetrated by a single member of \nthe other body on the President and the American people could cost a \nminimum of $4.9 billion this year alone. And those interest rates would \nnot be lowered again for some time. Is this any way to balance the \nbudget? I thought that was the point of this painful process that we \nhave been engaged in this year, balancing the budget. But with a few \nfoolish, ill-considered, and arrogant words, this whole painful year of \ncuts to one important program after another can be wiped out, erased in \none fell swoop. This is an outrage being perpetrated on the long-\nsuffering American public in order to satisfy the political ambitions \nand hubris of a single individual. For one party to put its own agenda \nahead of the best interests of the American people is a complete \nabrogation of the trust of the American people.\n  Mr. President, the sooner we all stop playing this game of chicken, \nthe better off we will be. The sooner we stop talking about a ``train \nwreck'' on both ends of the avenue, the better off we will all be.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, Mr. President, \narticles from the New York Times and the Washington Post to which I \nhave referred today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 22, 1995]\n\n    Gingrich Threatens U.S. Default If Clinton Won't Bend on Budget\n\n                          (By David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington, Sept. 21.--House Speaker Newt Gingrich \n     threatened today to send the United States into default on \n     its debt for the first time in the nation's history, to force \n     the Clinton Administration to balance the budget on \n     Republican terms.\n       His comments, a more extreme version of the hardball stance \n     frequently used in past budget showdowns, raised the specter \n     that the looming standoff may begin to rattle financial \n     markets around the world. Mr. Gingrich's remarks came in the \n     middle of a day in which the dollar plunged as much as 5 \n     percent against major currencies before recovering slightly, \n     sending interest rates up sharply. [Page D13.] The Speaker's \n     statement appeared to be one of several factors that added to \n     the markets' unsettled condition.\n       More broadly, Mr. Gingrich's speech to the Public \n     Securities Association, which represents traders in \n     Government debt, underscored the growing agitation and sense \n     of imminent collision in official Washington as both \n     Democrats and Republicans move toward a confrontation that \n     could shut the Government down this fall.\n       Throughout the capital, there was a sense that the current \n     had quickened and the rumble of a great waterfall could be \n     heard close ahead. Angry disputes broke out on wildly varying \n     issues. Republicans threatened to block sending American \n     ground troops to enforce the Bosnia peace plan, agreed to \n     vast reductions in the protection for endangered species and \n     Federal lands, and pushed ahead with plans for radical \n     changes in Medicare and Medicaid. Democrats fumed and vowed \n     to do what they could to slow the legislation's breakneck \n     pace.\n       Clearly part of Mr. Gingrich's autumn end-game strategy is \n     to force the White House to accept much of this agenda--many \n     parts of which President Clinton has vowed to veto--by \n     holding an increase in the Federal debt limit hostage. \n     Without an increase in the limit, the Government will be \n     unable to meet many of the payments due in November for \n     Social Security, military pay and interest on the Federal \n     Government's $4.9 trillion in debt.\n       Such confrontation techniques have been used in the past. \n     But it was highly unusual for a high Government leader to \n     suggest, as Mr. Gingrich did today, that default on \n     Government payments was not beyond the pale.\n       ``I don't care what the price is,'' he said in his speech. \n     ``I don't care if we have no executive offices and no bonds \n     for 60 days--not this time.''\n       Without concessions from the White House across the board, \n     he said, there will not be any increase in the debt ceiling. \n     ``And we'll see how long they will last,'' he added.\n       Administration officials were still trying tonight to \n     figure out how seriously to take Mr. Gingrich's comments. A \n     few months ago, the Speaker was forced to back away from his \n     off-the-cuff suggestions that the United States should \n     recognize Taiwan as an independent country, a step that would \n     lead to a breach with China.\n       But Congress has little direct influence over foreign \n     policy. By contrast, its control of the Government's purse \n     strings gave added force to Mr. Gingrich's remarks. Indeed, \n     the Speaker's comments drew a quick and harshly worded \n     response from Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. ``The \n     President won't be blackmailed by the use of the debt limit \n     as a negotiating lever,'' he said in a telephone interview \n     from Miami, where he was giving a speech tonight.\n       ``It would be unprecedented and unwise for anyone in a \n     position of authority to dismiss the consequences of default \n     on the debt of the United States of America for the first \n     time in our history,'' he added. ``Even the appearance of a \n     risk of default can have adverse consequences, and a default \n     itself would increase the cost of debt for the United States \n     Government for many, many years to come. A sovereign \n     country's credit-worthiness is a precious asset not to be \n     sacrificed under any circumstances.''\n       Mr. Rubin said he did not expect the United States to \n     default on any debt payment, a step that he has repeatedly \n     called ``unthinkable.'' But even a serious threat of a \n     disruption in payments can move the markets, and may send \n     borrowing costs soaring for the United States.\n       The Treasury Department estimates that every increase of \n     one percentage point in interest rates would swell the budget \n     deficit by $4.9 billion this year. Republicans, however, \n     argued that interest rates should decline if the ultimate \n     outcome of the dispute between the parties is a big cut in \n     spending. They contend that any short-term blips in the \n     market--because of conflicts with the White House--would be \n     washed away by long-term benefits.\n\n[[Page S 14146]]\n\n       Aside from all the Sturm und Drang in Washington, the debt \n     limit debate has not yet had much effect, traders said. ``The \n     markets have not yet focused on it,'' said David M. Jones, \n     vice chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, which trades \n     Government bonds. ``One of the risks is that foreign \n     investors will not understand what is happening here. And if \n     they get nervous, they will just flee until it all sorts \n     out.''\n       The issue will take on added urgency in the first five days \n     of November, when the Government must pay $50 billion in \n     Social Security benefits, Medicare and pay for active-duty \n     members of the military. On Nov. 15, about $25 billion of \n     interest payments are due.\n       As Treasury officials concede, a number of financial tricks \n     are available to keep the Government afloat even if the \n     ceiling on debt is not raised. There are temporary debt \n     limits, emergency ``cash management sales'' to keep money \n     flowing in the coffers as short-term loans, and borrowing \n     against other Government reserves. But all of the steps come \n     with a cost, and none can go on for too long. Though the \n     overall Government debt is $4.9 trillion, the Treasury sells \n     about $2 trillion of debt securities every year because so \n     much of the Government's borrowings are ``rolled over'' into \n     new bonds.\n       The debt limit exists as an institution in Washington \n     because the Constitution mandates that only Congress can \n     authorize borrowing. Before World War I, every bond issued by \n     the United States required separate Congressional approval. \n     Today, the raising of the debt ceiling essentially permits \n     the Treasury Secretary to make the day-to-day decisions \n     required to meet the Government's obligations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 1995)\n\n Gingrich Vows No Retreat on Debt Ceiling Increase--I Don't Care What \n                       the Price Is, Speaker Says\n\n                           (By Clay Chandler)\n\n       House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) threatened yesterday to \n     take the government into default for the first time in \n     history unless President Clinton bows to Republican demands \n     for a balanced budget.\n       ``I don't care what the price is,'' Gingrich declared in a \n     speech to the Public Securities Association, which represents \n     the nation's bond dealers. ``I don't care if we have no \n     executive offices and no bonds for 60 days--not this time.''\n       Gingrich said that if Clinton refuses to sign a package of \n     tax and spending proposals reflecting Republican priorities, \n     he would block attempts to raise the government's credit \n     limit.\n       ``I, the speaker, will not schedule'' a vote on an increase \n     in the debt limit' ``it will not come to the floor until we \n     have an agreement'' on balancing the budget according to the \n     Republican proposals, Gingrich told the securities group.\n       Gingrich's pledge provoked sharp criticism from Clinton \n     administration officials. ``It would be unprecedented and \n     unwise for anyone in a position of authority to dismiss the \n     consequences of default,'' Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin \n     said last night. ``Even the appearance of a default can have \n     adverse consequences, and a default itself would increase the \n     cost of debt to the U.S. government for many, many years to \n     come.''\n       ``The U.S. has never defaulted on its obligations and it is \n     extremely irresponsible to suggest that that might happen,'' \n     said White House budget director Alice M. Rivlin.\n       The government is rapidly nearing the $4.9 trillion ceiling \n     on federal debt imposed by Congress in 1993. The government \n     will have difficulty paying $25 billion in interest \n     obligations due Nov. 15 unless Congress agrees to raise the \n     government's credit line so that it can borrow more money to \n     pay the bill, financial analysts estimate. Treasury officials \n     have warned that the government's cash crunch might come as \n     early as the end of October.\n       The prospect that action to raise the debt limit could be \n     held hostage while Clinton and Congress slug it out over the \n     budget may have made some investors in global financial \n     markets nervous. Some administration officials suggested that \n     Gingrich's comments were responsible for yesterday's drop in \n     the value of the dollar and declines in stock and bond \n     prices, although Rubin would not draw that connection.\n       On Wall Street, though, some analysts questioned the \n     significance of Gingrich's statements.\n       Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers Inc, \n     said the prospect of fiscal deadlock was cause for concern \n     among foreign investors, who ``don't completely understand \n     our ways and the pressures of the election year.'' But he \n     said U.S. analysts were likely to shrug off Gingrich's \n     remarks as political posturing.\n       The prevailing view on Wall Street is that the two sides \n     eventually will strike a deal, said Carl Steen, an analyst at \n     the global economic consulting firm of Maria Fiorini Ramirez \n     Inc.: ``Somebody's going to blink. . . . They'll have to.''\n       Steen said it is ``much more likely that the Senate \n     Republicans will say, `Okay, look, we're winning anyway. \n     Let's not push this thing too far.' ''\n       Rubin also said, ``I do not believe there will be a \n     default.''\n       But Gingrich warned against underestimating the commitment \n     of House Republicans: ``What we are saying to Clinton is; `Do \n     not assume that we will flinch, because we won't.' ''\n       Gingrich's comments appeared to conflict with remarks made \n     on Sunday by House Budget Committee Chairman John R. Kasich \n     (R-Ohio). In an appearance on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' \n     Kasich said House Republicans would not agree to a long-term \n     extension of the debt limit ``until we can show that there's \n     light at the end of the tunnel.\n       But he also said, ``What we want to do is avoid a default \n     by the government of the United States. So if we can do a \n     short-term, temporary raising of the debt ceiling, that's not \n     inconsistent with the fact that on a long-term basis, we will \n     not raise it.''\n       The prospect of breaching the debt ceiling is distinct from \n     a looming government shutdown, which could happen unless \n     Clinton and Congress come to terms on 13 separate spending \n     bills making their way through the legislature before Sept. \n     30, the end of this fiscal year. On Wednesday, Republican \n     leaders offered a temporary spending plan to carry the \n     government through until Nov. 13, but the White House said \n     many aspects of the resolution were unacceptable.\n       Regarding the debt ceiling, Republicans argue that \n     temporary disruption in financial markets is a small price to \n     pay to ensure a balanced budget.\n       But Rubin warned that ``a sovereign country's \n     creditworthiness is a precious asset that should not be \n     sacrificed under any circumstances.'' Clinton, he said, could \n     not be ``blackmailed'' into signing a budget deal.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.
