Madam President, I am very pleased to join my \ndistinguished friend from Florida today on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto talk about the Race for the Cure which will take place this \nSaturday, and the issue of breast cancer generally. Breast cancer is a \ndreaded and devastating disease which has reached epidemic proportions \nin America. During 1995 an estimated 183,000 new cases of breast cancer \nwill be detected in women, and 46,000 lives will be lost to this \ndisease--46,000 lives. The number is staggering.\n  For this reason I am deeply committed to finding a cure for breast \ncancer, as much as a Senator can be committed. The real action is in \nscience. But we cannot allow our wives, daughters, friends, and \ncoworkers to be claimed by this disease. We must continue to battle for \ntheir well-being.\n  Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. It is the leading cause of \ndeath among African-American women and it is the leading cause of death \namong all women between ages 35 and 54. Although the incidence of \nbreast cancer increases sharply after age 40, younger women, even women \nin their twenties, are also diagnosed with and die of breast cancer.\n  As a nation, we cannot afford to wait any longer to eradicate the \nleading killer of women in this country. Although we still do not know \nwhat causes breast cancer or how to cure it, we have begun to make \nsignificant strides. Federal funding for breast cancer research has \nquadrupled since 1990. [[Page S8294]] The discovery of breast cancer \ngenes has made headlines around the world and restored hope that one \nday a scientific breakthrough will provide a cure. However, we cannot \nsimply sit back and wait for the cure. Each and every one of us has a \nrole and we can play it and we should play it. One way to help in this \nfight is to participate in something like the sixth annual National \nRace for the Cure this Saturday, on June 17. The purpose of this race \nis to both raise money and public awareness about how early detection \nand mammograms save lives. The Race for the Cure, and others like it \nacross the Nation, has raised $27.5 million since it began, making the \nrace's foundation the largest private funder of research dedicated \nsolely to breast cancer.\n  The Race For The Cure is a unique opportunity to bring together the \nmany people whose lives have been touched by breast cancer. This year, \n25,000 people are expected to participate in this special event. The \nsize of this event clearly demonstrates the far-reaching impact this \ndisease has had on American life. Since 1960, more than 950,000 U.S. \nwomen, nearly 1 million American women, have died from breast cancer. \nThis is more than two times the number of all Americans who died in \nWorld Wars I and II, the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars. The \nfight against breast cancer is a continuing battle because breast \ncancer is the leading killer among women.\n  I will join the estimated 5,000 runners, walkers, and wheelchair \nparticipants who will turn out in force on Saturday. I will probably be \na walker, not a runner, but I will be there. And I will join with my \nfamily, my staff, and I will join all those who have triumphed over \nbreast cancer.\n  That is how my wife likes to refer to it, having had breast cancer in \n1992 and gone through the agony of chemotherapy and all of the other \nassorted traumas that are associated with it. She does not like the \nword, ``survivor.'' She likes to say that she triumphed over breast \ncancer. So I will be joining all those who triumphed over breast cancer \nas well as the relatives of those who have lost loved ones.\n  I will race or walk for a cure. I am very proud of my own office. We \nwill be bringing about 56 people to race for a cure on Saturday. I will \nrace with my staff and hope that one day, when a new generation of \nAmerican women grow old, their children will learn about breast cancer \nin history books and not in hospitals or in college or at bedside.\n  I encourage all my colleagues in the Senate to enter the race and \nurge them to help find a cure for breast cancer. With all of our help \nand the help of the American people, this race will be a tremendous \nsuccess. Race for the Cure is, indeed, a race for life.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Madam President, thank you.\n  I want to, first of all, express my appreciation to Senator Bradley \nfor getting the Senate focused on the Race for the Cure. He came up to \nme yesterday afternoon and asked if I would be willing to come over and \ntalk for a few minutes this morning.\n  I appreciate, again, in this busy schedule and busy arena in which we \nfind ourselves, a situation where we can focus our attention and our \ninterest on an issue that is of deep concern, frankly, to all \nAmericans, but for some of us there is a very personal aspect to it.\n  I like the word the Senator's wife uses with respect to triumph. \nMaybe we should begin to change the language that we refer to because, \nas I have become involved in the discussion of this disease, one of the \nthings that I have found is that the spirit of the individual, the \ndetermination of the individual to overcome the disease plays a \nsignificant role in the cure. I do not mean to downplay the \nsignificance, obviously, of the traditional medical approaches, but I \nthink we are beginning to find out that the human spirit plays a \ngreater and greater role in this battle against cancer.\n  Another person that I would like to thank is Nancy Brinker, who is \nthe individual who started the Race for the Cure. The Susan Komen \nFoundation was established by Nancy Brinker in memory of her sister who \ndied of breast cancer. Nancy has just done an outstanding job, and she \nhas written a book that is called ``The Race Is Run One Step at a \nTime,'' and why we will be out on the streets of Washington, DC, and on \nThe Mall this weekend putting one foot in front of the other maybe a \nlittle bit faster than we normally do trying to focus attention on the \nimportance of early detection with respect to breast cancer.\n  I just recommend to any individual or any family that is dealing with \nthe disease of breast cancer that you pick up this book that Nancy has \nwritten. It will change your life, and it will give you a sense about \nhow you can triumph over the disease.\n  So, again, I thank Nancy Brinker. I thank Senator Bradley for his \nleadership, and I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a few \ncomments of my own this morning. As I was trying to think how would I \nfocus my comments this morning on this issue, I decided that I would \nlike to spend a couple of moments anyway speaking on a personal basis \nabout my wife, Priscilla. It has been almost 4 years since that day \nwhen Priscilla sat me down. She said, ``Connie, you had better sit down \nfor a moment. I've got something I need to tell you.'' I had just come \nback from a week's trip. She said that while I was gone she had \ndiscovered a lump in her breast and that she was fearful that it was \ncancer.\n  Again, on a personal basis of having experienced this in my family, \nas many of you have heard, I have spoken out here on the floor before \nabout my family's experience. At a young age, when I was in my \ntwenties, my younger brother in essence said the same thing to me \nexcept that he had discovered a melanoma on his head. Unfortunately, \nbecause it was on his head and covered by hair, it had not been \ndiscovered until it was way too late. And the doctors told him he \nprobably had 6 months to live. Michael ended up living 12 years and \nlived most of those 12 years in a very useful and beneficial and, for \nhim, a comfortable way. It was just at the end that it became very, \nvery difficult for him.\n  But the thoughts that went through my mind when Priscilla told me she \ndiscovered the lump--I went through all of those experiences again that \nI had with my brother Mike.\n  The fundamental difference, though, between the two was early \ndetection. Priscilla had not been active in the fight against cancer, \nbut because our family had been dealing with the cancer issue, she had \nbecome sensitized. She had heard the messages, frankly the messages \nthat will come from our comments here on the floor today.\n  I will guarantee you there will be someone out there watching and \nobserving today that will hear what Senator Bradley had to say about \nearly detection, hear what Senator Rockefeller will have to say about \nearly detection, hear what I have to say about early detection, and the \nrealization that if you detect the disease early, you can survive, you \ncan triumph. In fact, it has been shown that with most breast cancers, \nif detected and treated early, there is a 94 percent triumphant rate; \n94 percent cure rate. That is a dramatic statistic. The point that the \nRace for the Cure is all about is we can race there to get the message \nout that early detection saves lives.\n  So, again, if I can go back on a fairly personal basis, it, frankly, \nis hard for me to believe that I am standing on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate talking about breast cancer. I mean not too many years ago most \nmales would have said this is not something we can talk about in \npublic. Most women would have said that not too long ago. Most of our \nsociety said we cannot even talk about cancer. The importance of what \nwe are doing is saying that you can come out in a very public way and \ntalk about the disease and it is OK for men and women to talk about \nearly detection with respect to breast cancer.\n  Again, in Priscilla's case, she did all of the things that one is \nsupposed to do. She had a mammogram in November prior to the discovery \nof the disease. It did not pick up the lump at that time. She had her \nannual gynecological exam in June of the following year. Nothing showed \nup. But there was a message about self breast exams that somehow \nsomebody got through to Priscilla. That is the way she discovered the \ndisease. Because of that early discovery, Priscilla is going to \nsurvive. She is going to triumph. She has won. She is so excited about \nhaving [[Page S8295]] gone through that victory, if you will, that she \nis out right now--she left yesterday morning--she is in Florida this \nweek, and she is working with other survivors of cancer, other people \nwho are engaged in getting the message out about early detection.\n  I will say on a personal basis that I do not think Priscilla has ever \nfelt better in her life, both physically and emotionally, to be \ninvolved in something she believes in so deeply and the realization \nthat by getting up and saying to people--by the way, let me back up for \na moment.\n  When I said to Priscilla that I had decided that I was going to run \nfor the Congress back in 1982, she in essence said, ``Great. Go for it. \nBut there are two things I do not do.'' She said, ``One is I do not \nspeak to the media, and the other is I do not give speeches.'' Well, I \ntell you something. Priscilla is out speaking to the media, and she is \nout giving speeches because she is absolutely convinced that the more \nshe does, the more opportunities there are for people to survive, to \ntriumph over the disease. And she had not been doing this.\n  I think most of us recognize that there is nothing more satisfying in \nlife than to be pursuing something that you believe in, that you are \ncommitted to, that you are dedicated to.\n  So, while I am out here today to talk about the significance of the \nRace for the Cure and the 20,000 to 25,000 people that may join us--and \nI, too, will be participating in the race on Saturday, as I did last \nyear--the real message in all of this is that early detection saves \nlives. One of the comments that the American Cancer Society has stated \nover and over again is we can increase the cure rate of cancer from the \n50 percent roughly where it is today, to 75 percent without a single \nadditional technological breakthrough.\n  I get very excited about the things that are happening out at the \nNational Cancer Institute with gene therapy, and with the therapy work \nthat is going on, and we are going to get tremendous breakthroughs. But \nif we did not get one more, we could increase the cure rate from 50 to \n75 percent if we could just convince people to take advantage of the \nearly detection procedures that are already available through our \nhealth care system in America today.\n From 50 to 75 percent, that is dramatic, absolutely dramatic.\n\n  The other comment that I would make, and I have to be careful here \nnot to use too many statistics, but as I understand it, only roughly \n35, 37 percent of women that are covered by Medicare take advantage of \nreimbursement for mammography--only 37 percent. And I would make this \npoint, that as an individual gets older and older and older and the \nchances of being diagnosed with breast cancer go up and up and up, \nthere is more need to take advantage of what is offered through the \nMedicare system, and only 37 percent of American women are in fact \ntaking advantage of that at this time. So we need to get that message \nout to the older women of our society.\n  The last point that I would make here this morning, Madam President, \nhas to do with fear. Priscilla talks about this all the time, and we \nhave all heard it. People say, well, gee, I think I would rather not \nknow. And that is a rationalization on the one hand, but yet it is a \nrecognition of fear, because we are still dealing with a situation \nwhere we are convinced that if we are told we have cancer, we are going \nto die, that people do not survive. That is just fundamentally wrong. \nSo we have to get the message out that you do not have to address this \nwith the level of fear that so many do; that you have to break through \nthat fear and let us detect the disease early and let us provide then \nfor the treatment of the disease so that we can see more of our loved \nones triumph over this dreaded disease.\n  So, again, I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Bradley for getting us \nthis opportunity to get together to talk about this. I look forward to \nbeing out there on Saturday with him and with the other 20,000, 25,000 \nas we raise more money to add to the coffers to do the research and get \nthe message out that early detection saves lives. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n\n             Early Detection and Public Awareness of Cancer\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise also to support the Race for \nthe Cure. I do not have the same personal experience that Senator \nBradley and Senator Mack have, but I am profoundly moved by the \nexperiences they have gone through. As they communicated to all of us \nabout much more devastating experiences that their wives have been \nthrough and to some extent are still going through, it is interesting \nthat both men, in my judgment, both Senators are reticent about \npersonal matters. That is their nature. But when it comes to something \nlike this, where there is so much that they can do to help so many \npeople, and where they know that as Senators people will at least from \ntime to time listen to what they have to say, they know they have a \nduty, and I think we all do, to make people aware of what can happen \nthrough early detection and through public awareness.\n  America is a very interesting country. We battle about whether we are \ngoing to reform health care or whether we are going to increase or \ndecrease Government spending on research, but Americans are very unique \nin the way that they sometimes can just galvanize themselves to make \nthings known, and this Race for the Cure is a very dramatic example. \nThe numbers have grown over the years. This year the international \ncommunity will be involved for the first time on Saturday, June 17.\n  I really was interested in what Senator Mack had to say about fear. I \nthink that is true. I have seen that in my own work as a Senator, even \ngoing back to the time I was a VISTA volunteer in West Virginia, the \nfear that people sometimes have either because there is enough that is \ngoing to be wrong in their lives they do not want to take a test to \nfind out something which might tell them there is something much more \nseriously going wrong in their lives or simply because Americans often \nare generically optimistic; they figure ``it will not happen to me.'' \nOf course, it does. And the figures about how you can cut down through \nmammograms, through self-testing, the spread of this disease and \nmortality of this disease are really just staggering.\n  I am impressed by the difference between the 95 percent cure rate \nupon early detection and then over a 5-year period, that a 5-year \nsurvival rate goes all the way down to 18 percent.\n  If there has not been early detection and there has been such a \nspread on a more general basis, that argues so totally for prevention, \nfor self-examination, for mammograms, for doing everything we possibly \ncan.\n  So I think it is very important; the statement that more women die \nfrom this disease than any other is something that we have to \nunderstand and something that we have to talk about so that people will \nbe strong in their response and that a husband and wife and friend, all \nof us feel a responsibility to each other about problems with diseases \nlike this which are difficult for women in this case and others for men \nin other cases; that we have to be able to talk openly, publicly, \nfreely, and instructively about this to each other and to the American \npublic. It is one of our roles I think as public officials.\n  So that I congratulate Senator Bradley and Senator Mack, both for \ntheir own combination of privacy in the way they handled this \nordinarily but, on the other hand, when it comes to helping others, the \nway they are determined to be more public so as to broaden public \neducation and thus increase the possibility for a better cure rate. And \nsymbolically, here we come to the Race for the Cure on Saturday, and I \nhope that it is the largest one ever.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida controls the time.\n  Mr. MACK. I inquire as to how much time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 11 seconds.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield that 1 minute 11 seconds to my colleague from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  [[Page S8296]]\n  \n                     Breast Cancer Awareness Stamp\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank my colleague and friend. Let me commend Senator \nMack and Senator Bradley for their extraordinary efforts in this area \nof education, of bringing about public awareness of not only the \ndisease but the horrible impact it has not only on women but the \nfamilies of America.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Susan G. Komen Breast \nCancer Foundation for sponsoring the sixth annual national Race for the \nCure, which will take place this coming Saturday, June 17, here in our \nNation's Capital.\n  This annual event raises critically needed funds to combat breast \ncancer--a horrible disease that, unthinkably, has become the most \ncommon form of cancer in women, and the leading cause of cancer death \nfor all women between the ages of 35 and 54. It is a disease that--with \nno known cure and no known cause--can only be understood, and \neventually conquered, through increased research.\n  In addition to raising funds for research, this race helps raise the \nlevel of public awareness of this disease, while bringing needed public \nattention to the importance of early detection.\n  We must continue to seek new and creative ways to promote breast \ncancer awareness. I want to take a moment to recognize the efforts of \none of my Long Island constituents, Diane Sackett Nannery, who has \nproposed the creation of a special pink ribbon postage stamp to help \nbolster breast cancer awareness in our Nation. Such a stamp would serve \nas a strong reminder of the magnitude of this disease, while \nreinforcing public health officials' efforts to promote the benefits of \nearly detection.\n  I believe this stamp deserves the strong and immediate support of the \nUnited States Postmaster General. Today I am forwarding a letter to the \nPostmaster General--signed by all 100 U.S. Senators--urging his support \nfor the prompt approval of the important breast cancer awareness stamp. \nI am hopeful that the voice of our Nations' women will be heard through \nthis unanimous statement by their elected officials, and that this \nstamp will soon become a reality.\n  Just as I am heartened by the overwhelming support for this stamp, I \nam likewise encouraged by the tremendous public response the Race for \nthe Cure has received over its short history. In just 6 years, the \nnational Race for the Cure has grown to become the largest 5K race in \nthe country, with close to 20,000 participants expected in 1995. True \nto its name, those who enter run not to win the race to the finish \nline, but to help our Nation win the race against the clock to discover \na cure for this devastating disease.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend all those involved in planning, \norganizing, supporting, and, not least of all, running in this \nimportant event. I hope that it will exceed all expectations, and that \nit will bring us closer to the day when the horrible ravages of breast \ncancer are a thing of the past.\n  Madam President, this great race, Race for the Cure, which is going \nto take place Saturday here in our Nation's capital, is just a small \npart of what my colleagues are attempting to do, and I am proud to be \nassociated with them in this endeavor.\n  Let me also say that yesterday I was able to obtain the signature of \nevery single Member of this body, 100 Senators, within a matter of \nseveral hours that would ask of the Postmaster General that a stamp be \ncommemorated to bring about breast cancer awareness.\n  One of my constituents, Diane Sackett Nannery, proposed that there be \nthe creation of a special pink ribbon postage stamp to help bolster \nbreast cancer awareness in our Nation. And as I said I am very proud of \nmy colleagues for the manner in which all of them were so supportive of \nthis attempt to create a greater awareness in our Nation so that we can \ndo more in our efforts to find not only the cure but also to do more in \ndetection and prevention.\n  I can say to you that there has probably been no area in our Nation \nthat has been harder hit than Long Island, my hometown, Nassau County, \nwhere we have the highest rate of breast cancer in the United States, a \nsad distinction to have.\n  So I want to commend my colleagues for their leadership, and I want \nto say that I am tremendously encouraged by the tremendous public \nresponse for the Race for the Cure, not only here but I think \nnationwide. We have brought people together with this magnificent \nendeavor.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute fifty-five seconds.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. I yield all my time to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n\n               Breast Cancer--A Threat to Women's Health\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nexpressing support for research on breast cancer and the Race for the \nCure. This frightening disease has taken the lives of far too many \nwomen, and the long list of those who have died include many of my own \nfriends.\n  As has been stated, breast cancer is a growing public health problem \nin this Nation and a great threat to women's health. Many women are \nvery confused about the mixed messages being sent to us today about \nbreast cancer. One year we are told to have annual mammograms beginning \nat the age of 40. The next year, after we faithfully comply with that, \nwe are told something else. We remain worried and confused, and it is \ntime for better research on the issue.\n  Clearly, research has to be done. More needs to be done in prevention \nand treatment of breast cancer, and the Race for the Cure is a way for \nall of us to express our desire to do better in this and to bring this \nto the public's attention.\n  I think it is an opportune time also for this Senate to recognize \nthat it has been 6 months without a Surgeon General. Dr. Foster has the \nability, if appointed, to bring this issue to the forefront of this \nNation, and I hope that the majority leader brings Dr. Foster's \nnomination to the Senate expeditiously so that we can, again, have \nanother way of making sure that women's health diseases are brought to \nthe Nation's forefront.\n  I will be joining my husband and my children this weekend in the Race \nfor the Cure. I urge all of my colleagues to not only walk the walk but \ntalk the talk and get some good research done on this issue.\n  I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Madam President, as we conclude this morning business on \nthe Race for the Cure, I simply pay tribute to a member of my staff, \nKatie Konnorton, who has coordinated the 56 people who will come from \nmy office, associated with it, family members and staff members, to \nmake the race on Saturday. She deserves a lot of credit.\n  I think because of her and because of the commitment of other people \non the staff, we will have a tremendous turnout, and I hope that other \nSenators' offices--I am very pleased the Senator from Washington is \ngoing to be there with her family, I respect that--I hope other \nSenators might check off that Saturday is the day for them to be \ncounted for the cure for breast cancer: The Race for the Cure, \nSaturday, Senators' offices here in Washington. It sends the message of \nearly detection and fight for a cure. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8293-7", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8296-S8297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    COMMENDING JACKSON HOLE SKI AREA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I would like to take a minute to commend \nthe Jackson Hole ski area in my State of Wyoming. Recently this ski \narea received the prestigious Golden Eagle Award, sponsored by the \nSkiing Co. which is part of Times Mirror Magazines and publisher of \nSki, Skiing, and TransWorld Snowboarding magazines. The Golden Eagle \nAward was established by the Skiing Co. and Times Mirror to recognize \nexceptional environmental excellence in ski area management by North \nAmerican ski areas. It was presented at the annual meeting of the \nNational Ski Areas Association in Palm Springs, CA, last month.\n  The Jackson Hole Ski Corp. won the top award for overall \nenvironmental excellence. The resort was commended by a panel of judges \nfor downsizing its mountain master plan by a third, in order to provide \na better ski experience [[Page S8297]] while adhering to environmental \nvalues. It was also recognized for its vehicle maintenance shop \nmanagement program, for a sensitive revegetation plan, an aggressive \nrecycling program, and for establishing a land trust to preserve the \nresort's scenic and natural character. Three years ago, at a series of \ntraining seminars, employees of Jackson Hole Ski Corp. chose ``Respect \nfor the Environment'' as their highest corporate value. Jim Gill, vice \npresident of the area, believes that economic growth and environmental \nprotection can complement each other, because most resort guests \nconsider themselves environmentalists who enjoy the outdoors and \nappreciate its natural beauty. According to Francis Pandolfi, president \nand CEO of Times Mirror Magazines and who presented the award,\n\n       Our judges called Jackson Hole's initiative very broad-\n     based and far-reaching--from its downsizing of the mountain \n     to its outreach programs, its educational accomplishments and \n     the preservation of the area's character through its land \n     trust. The area has done superb environmental work on \n     virtually every front.\n\n  In addition to Jackson Hole, five other ski areas won Silver Eagle \nAwards for environmental excellence in the following categories:\n  Snowbird, UT, for water conservation and wastewater management;\n  Heavenly, CA, for fish and wildlife habitat protection;\n  Sierra-at-Tahoe, CA, for environmental education;\n  Winter Park, CO, for community outreach; and\n  Beaver Creek, CO, for area design.\n  Madam President, too often we only hear from critics about how ski \nareas destroy the wilderness. Skiing is a wonderful sport which \nmillions of people from around the world enjoy, and the Golden Eagle \nAward program confirms what we all know; that it can coexist with \nenvironmental protection of the highest degree. Industry surveys show \nthat skiers are very environmentally aware and involved, and that any \nperception of skiing as being antienvironmental exists only in the \nminds of a few. These success stories not only educate the American \npublic about what a good job many ski areas are doing to conserve and \nprotect the environment, but they also serve as excellent examples for \nother ski areas to emulate.\n  Congratulations to Jackson Hole Ski Corp. and to all the other \nwinners.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8296-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8297-S8302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        FLAG DAY--JUNE 14, 1995\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today is Flag Day. Utahns, and indeed \nAmericans all across our great country revere the flag as a unique \nsymbol of the United States and of the principles, ideals, and values \nfor which our country stands.\n  Congress has, over the years, reflected the devotion our diverse \npeople have for Old Glory. During the Civil War, for example, Congress \nawarded the Medal of Honor to Union soldiers who rescued the flag from \nfalling into rebel hands.\n  In 1931, Congress declared the Star Spangled Banner to be our \nnational anthem. In 1949, Congress established June 14 as Flag Day. \nCongress has established ``The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag'' and \nthe manner of its recitation. Congress designated John Philip Sousa's \n``The Stars and Stripes Forever'' as the national march in 1987.\n  Congress has also established detailed rules for the design of the \nflag and the manner of its proper display. Congress, along with 48 \nStates, had regulated misuse of the American flag until the Supreme \nCourt's 1989 decision in Texas versus Johnson.\n  As I say, these congressional actions reflect the people's devotion \nto the flag; Congress did not create these feelings and deep regard for \nthe flag among our people.\n  The 104th Congress will have a chance to do its part to reflect our \npeople's devotion to Old Glory by sending to the States for \nratification Senate Joint Resolution 31, a constitutional amendment \ngiving Congress and the States power to prohibit physical desecration \nof the flag of the United States.\n  I recognize that, in good faith, some of my colleagues oppose this \nconstitutional amendment. They love the flag no less than supporters of \nthe amendment.\n  I do hope those who have opposed the amendment in the past will \nreconsider their position. We can protect the flag without jeopardizing \nfreedom of expression. Freedom of expression was extremely robust when \nthe 49 flag desecration statutes were enforceable. And there is no \ndanger of a slippery slope here because there is no other symbol of our \ncountry like the flag. We do not salute the Constitution or the \nDeclaration of Independence, and no one has ever suggested a ban on \nburning copies of these hallowed documents. Numerous other methods of \nprotest, including marches, rallies, use of placards, posters, \nleaflets, and much more clearly remain available. I hope we will send \nthis amendment to the States for ratification.\n  On June 6, Senator Hank Brown, chairman of the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution, Federalism, and Property Rights held a hearing on the \nflag amendment. The subcommittee heard from 11 witnesses, including \nopponents of the amendment. I hope those of my colleagues inclined to \nvote against Senate Joint Resolution 31 will review the very fine \ntestimony of its supporters. I ask unanimous consent that two of the \nstatements, that of Prof. Richard Parker and former Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Legal Counsel, Charles J. Cooper, be printed in the \nCongressional Record following my remarks, along with my opening \nstatement from that hearing.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Richard D. Parker, Professor of Law, Harvard Law School\n       I am a civil libertarian. I believe that, in a democracy, \n     freedom of speech must be ``robust and wide-open''. Indeed I \n     believe it ought to be more robust and wide-open than, in \n     some respects, it is now and than the Supreme Court has been \n     willing, on some occasions, to grant. It's because of that \n     belief that I urge the Congress to propose to the states a \n     new constitutional amendment, one that would permit the \n     people--if, through the democratic process, they so choose--\n     to protect the flag of the United States against physical \n     desecration.\n\n\n                                   i\n\n       Let me begin with general principles. It is, after all, at \n     the level of fundamental value that discussion of \n     constitutional provisions--meant ``to endure for ages to \n     come''--should be (and has traditionally been) conducted.\n       My basic proposition is this: Whether freedom of speech is, \n     in fact, robust and wide-open does not depend solely, or even \n     primarily, on case-by-case adjudication by the courts. It \n     depends most of all on conditions of culture. First, it \n     depends on the willingness and capacity of people--in our \n     democracy, that means ordinary people--to express themselves \n     energetically and effectively in public. Second, it depends \n     on acceptance as well as tolerance, official and unofficial, \n     of an extremely wide range of viewpoints and modes of \n     expression. And, third, it depends on adherence to very basic \n     parameters that, like constitutional provisions in general, \n     help structure democratic life the better to release its \n     energies.\n       This last condition is the one that concerns us now. \n     Everyone agrees that there must be ``procedural'' parameters \n     of free speech--involving, for example, places and times at \n     which certain modes of expression are permitted. Practically \n     everyone accepts some explicitly ``substantive'' parameters \n     of speech content as well. Indeed, despite talk of ``content-\n     neutrality,'' the following principle of constitutional law \n     is very clear: Government sometimes may sanction you for \n     speaking because of the way the content of what you say \n     affects other people.\n       What is less clear is the shape of this principle. There \n     are few bright lines to define it. The Supreme Court \n     understands the principle to rule out speech that threatens \n     to cause imminent tangible harm: face-to-face fighting words, \n     incitement to violation of law, shouting ``fire'' in a \n     crowded theater. And it does not stop there. It understands \n     the principle, also, to rule out speech that threatens \n     certain intangible, even diffuse, harms. It has, for \n     instance, described obscenity as pollution of the moral \n     ``environment.'' But what about ``political'' speech critical \n     of the government? Isn't there a bright line protecting that, \n     at least so long as no imminent physical harm is threatened? \n     The answer is: No. The Court has made clear, for instance, \n     that statements criticizing official conduct of a public \n     official may be sanctioned if they are known to be false and \n     damage the reputation of the official. There has been no \n     outcry against this rule. It was set forth by the Warren \n     Court--in an opinion by Justice Brennan, the very opinion \n     that established freedom of speech as ``robust and wide-\n     open.''\\1\\ It has been reaffirmed ever since. Our \n     constitutional tradition, therefore, leaves plenty of room \n     for debate about the necessary and proper scope of the \n     ``substantive'' parameters of the content of free speech.\n     Footnotes at end of article. [[Page S8298]] \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the past couple of decades, a consensus has been growing \n     around the following\n      proposition: Important ``substantive'' parameters of public \n     expression, parameters that have long been taken for \n     granted, now need to be restored. The bonds that hold us \n     together--and so make it possible, as in a healthy family, \n     for us to engage in ``robust'' disagreement with one \n     another--appear to be disintegrating. On the right, on the \n     left and in the center, it is widely agreed that certain \n     parameters must be reestablished if free speech, in \n     general, is to flourish.\n       On the right, it's believed that ``uncivil'' and \n     ``unreasoned'' speech content needs to be checked. The \n     Supreme Court, on occasion, has interpreted the First \n     Amendment in light of that belief. The problem, of course, is \n     that this tends to invite regulation of speech content that \n     is very broad and vague, suffocating free, spontaneous \n     participation in the marketplace of ideas. On the left, it's \n     believed that ``hate'' speech--beyond face-to-face harassment \n     or fighting words--that denigrates disadvantaged groups (and \n     so pollutes the ideological ``environment'') needs to be \n     checked. On occasion, the Court has read the First Amendment \n     in light of that belief as well. The problem, again, is that \n     this tends to invite broad and vague regulations suffocating \n     freedom and spontaneity in public speech. What's more, both \n     these prescriptions--by drawing blunt distinctions among \n     ``types'' of speech and speakers--may, unintentionally, tend \n     to set us apart from each other, even further \n     disintegrating--instead of reaffirming--the bonds that unite \n     us even in disagreement.\n       In the center, however, there is widespread support for \n     restoration of a much narrower, more focused parameter: \n     protection of the U.S. flag from physical desecration. This \n     proposal, first of all, avoids the vices of the broader, \n     vaguer alternatives. Its virtue, moreover, is that--by means \n     of an extremely minimal constraint on freedom, taken for \n     granted until recently--it affirms the most basic condition \n     of our freedom: our bond to one another in our aspiration to \n     national unity. It leaves it to individuals, in a thousand \n     other ways, to criticize government and even that aspiration \n     to unity, if they want. But it affirms that there is some \n     commitment to others,\n      beyond mere obedience to the formal rule of law, that must \n     be respected. It affirms that, without some aspiration to \n     national unity--call it patriotism if you choose--there \n     might be no law, no constitution, no freedom.\n       Still, we know, objections abound. Is this ``important'' \n     enough? Is it ``needed?'' Is it likely to be ``effective?'' \n     Aren't there ``less drastic alternatives?'' These questions \n     deserve answers. Yet the truth is that they practically \n     answer themselves.\n       A common objection goes like this: True, the aspiration to \n     national unity is vital but, as embodied in the flag, it is \n     just symbolic. What place does symbolism have in the \n     Constitution? The answer is that the framers of the \n     Constitution put symbolism of our unity at the very beginning \n     of the document, invoking ``We the People of the United \n     States''. And, very near the end, they required that all \n     officials, high and low, be ``bound by Oath or Affirmation, \n     to support this Constitution''--a provision that, surely, is \n     less functional than symbolic, yet whose symbolism fulfills, \n     nonetheless, an important function. Animating the whole \n     Constitution of 1787, after all, was the aspiration to call \n     into being a new sense of commitment, a commitment to a broad \n     and deep national unity-despite-difference. What was it, at \n     the beginning, but a bold symbolic effort?\n       But, we hear, that's all over now. The nation exists. What \n     need is there to revisit old ideals? Yet the framers knew \n     that nothing, on its own, lasts forever. Every institution \n     must be reenergized by every generation to meet new \n     challenges. Can we deny that our generation is now challenged \n     to renew our commitment to unity-despite-difference? The \n     aspiration to even a minimal unity is, once more, commonly \n     put in question. We hear that the freedom the flag symbolizes \n     is the freedom to burn it, that our unity consists simply in \n     a celebration of disunity. These claims go to the heart of \n     our Constitution. It is in the Constitution that we must \n     answer them.\n       We hear that flag desecrators are like a few ``naughty, \n     nasty children'' trying to ``provoke their parents.'' The \n     rest of the family, we hear, need only ``count to ten.''\\2\\ \n     What's the harm? Take the analogy seriously for a moment. How \n     healthy is a family in which there are no limits to \n     expressive abuse, in which everything can be trashed and will \n     be tolerated? Desecration of mutual bonds may be rate. But so \n     are other wrongs we believe it important to sanction. What is \n     at stake is a principle, a minimal one. It deserves minimal \n     respect--as a matter of principle.\n       Still, we are told that the aspiration to unity-despite-\n     difference cannot be instituted by law, that it can flourish \n     only in the ``voluntary'' feelings of the people. This \n     argument may, of course, be made, in specific contexts, \n     against using the narrow authority to be restored by the \n     proposed constitutional amendment. But such an argument ought \n     not short-circuit the process, denying the people the right \n     to find it invalid in certain circumstances. For who can \n     doubt that, in some circumstances, legal proscriptions do in \n     fact influence the ``voluntary feelings of the people?'' \n     Those who invoke these feelings should, in any event, be the \n     last to denigrate the people's expression of them, through \n     the processes of democracy.\n       Finally, we hear there are other ways to do the job. If we \n     don't like physical desecration of the flag, we should \n     criticize the desecrators or fly the flag ourselves. \n     Ordinarily, I agree, ``counter-speech'' is the best response. \n     But this situation is unique, just as the flag is unique. If \n     it is permissible not just to heap verbal contempt on the \n     flag, but also to burn it, rip it and smear it with \n     excrement--if such behavior is not only permitted in \n     practice, but protected in law by the Supreme Court--then the \n     flag is already decaying as the symbol of our aspiration to \n     the unity underlying freedom. The flag we fly in response is \n     no longer the same thing. We are told, again and again, that \n     someone can desecrate ``a'' flag but not ``the'' flag. To \n     that, I simply say:\n      Untrue. This is precisely the way that general symbols like \n     general values are trashed, particular step by particular \n     step. This is the way, imperceptibly, that commitments and \n     ideals are lost.\n       To boil down the fundamental value at stake here: Recall \n     the civil rights movement. Recall not only its invocation of \n     national ideals, but also its evocation of nationhood. Recall \n     the famous photograph of the Selma marchers carrying flags of \n     the United States. The question is: Will the next Martin \n     Luther King have available to him or her a basic means of \n     identification with all the rest of us--an embracive appeal \n     to the bonds that, in aspiration and potential, make us one?\n\n\n                                   ii\n\n       What are the costs, if any, of proposing to amend the \n     Constitution this way? All kinds of fears have been stirred \n     up in opposition to the proposal. I'll comment on two kinds. \n     First, I'll address some rather specific fears: Would the \n     proposal ``amend''--or ``desecrate''--the First Amendment? \n     Then, I'll turn to more generic fears: Would it upset the \n     ``delicate balance'' of the Constitution as a whole?\n       The proposal would not ``amend the First Amendment.'' \n     Rather, each amendment would be interpreted in light of the \n     other--much as is the case with the guarantees of Freedom of \n     Speech and Equal Protection of the Laws. When the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was proposed, the argument could have been made \n     that congressional power to enforce the Equal Protection \n     Clause might be used to undermine the First Amendment. The \n     courts have seemed able, however, to harmonize the two. The \n     same would be true here. Courts would interpret \n     ``desecration'' and ``flag of the United States'' in light of \n     general values of free speech. They would simply restore one \n     narrow democratic authority. Experience justifies this much \n     confidence in our judicial system.\n       But, we're asked, is ``harmonization'' possible? If the \n     Johnson and Eichman decisions protecting flag desecration \n     were rooted in established strains of free speech law--as \n     they were--how could an amendment countering those decisions \n     coexist with the First Amendment?\n       First, it's important to keep in mind that free speech law \n     has within it multiple, often competing strains. The \n     dissenting opinions in Johnson and Eichman were also rooted \n     in established arguments about the meaning of freedom of \n     speech. Second, even if the general principles invoked by the \n     five Justices in the majority are admirable in general--as I \n     believe they are\\3\\--that doesn't mean that the proposed \n     amendment would tend to undermine them, so long as it is \n     confined, as it is intended, to mandating a unique exception \n     for a unique symbol of nationhood. Indeed, carving out the \n     exception in a new amendment--rather than through \n     interpretation of the First Amendment itself--best ensures \n     that it will be so confined. Even opponents of the new \n     amendment agree on this point.\\4\\ Third, it's vital to \n     recognize that the proposed amendment is not in general \n     tension with the free speech principle forbidding \n     discrimination against specific ``messages'' in regulation of \n     speech content. Those who desecrate the flag may be doing so \n     to communicate any number of messages. They may be saying \n     that government is doing too much--or too little--about a \n     particular problem. In fact, they may be burning the flag to \n     protest the behavior of non-governmental, ``patriotic'' \n     groups and and to support efforts of the government to squash \n     those groups. Laws enacted under the proposed amendment would \n     have to apply to all\n      such activity, whatever the specific ``point of view.'' One, \n     and only one, generalized message could be regulated: \n     ``desecration'' of the flag itself. And regulation could \n     extend no farther than a ban on one, and only one, mode of \n     doing it: ``physical'' desecration.\\5\\ Finally, and \n     perhaps most importantly, we mustn't lose sight of the \n     fundamental purpose of the proposed amendment. That \n     purpose is to restore democratic authority to protect the \n     unique symbol of our aspiration to national unity, an \n     aspiration that, I've said, nurtures--rather than \n     undermines--freedom of speech that is ``robust and wide-\n     open.''\n       One objection remains. It involves ``desecration.'' Would \n     this word, evoking sacredness, itself ``desecrate'' the \n     Constitution? Those who make the objection this way defeat \n     themselves, of course. If the Constitution as a whole is \n     ``sacred,'' as they proclaim it is, then there is no text in \n     which a reference to ``desecration'' of the symbol of the \n     nationhood that undergirds it could be more at home. Beyond \n     the play on words, however, it's useful to keep in mind that \n     this word-- [[Page S8299]] like any number of others in the \n     constitutional text--is a term of art. It has no religious \n     connotation. The Constitution of Massachusetts, for instance, \n     provides that the right to jury trial ``must be held \n     sacred,''\\6\\ and no one reads that as a theological mandate. \n     The question for courts interpreting the proposed amendment \n     would be: What sorts of physical treatment of the flag are so \n     grossly contemptuous of it as to count as ``desecration?'' \n     This is the type of question--raising\n      issues of fact and degree, context and purpose--that they \n     resolve year in and year out under other constitutional \n     provisions. Thus there is nothing radical or extreme about \n     the flag amendment--unless it is the rhetoric, igniting \n     and fueling all kinds of fears, purveyed by some of its \n     opponents.\n\n\n                                  iii\n\n       What hides its moderation, I think, is a generic fear of \n     any proposed constitutional amendment--or, at least, of any \n     that is driven by wide public support. Opponents of a flag \n     amendment evoke this fear, suggesting the ``delicate \n     balance'' of the Constitution is in jeopardy. In the ways \n     they make the suggestion, however, they reveal it to be \n     misleading, even perverse.\n       They tell us that the Constitution is perfect. Or they talk \n     of its fragility. The document, they imply, is too fine or \n     too delicate to amend. But a part of its ``perfection'' must \n     be Article V, which provides for its amendment. It has, after \n     all, been amended many times. (The framers' generation added \n     ten amendments in one swoop.) And, far from proving fragile, \n     it has proved to have extraordinary tensile strength, \n     enduring by adapting to circumstances--changing and \n     unforeseen--just as, long ago, Chief Justice John Marshall \n     promised it would.\\7\\\n       Yet, they tell us, any proposed constitutional language \n     will have unintended consequences--unless we pin down, right \n     now and forever, every jot and title of its meaning. This is \n     sometimes an effective strategy of opposition. It was \n     deployed, for example, against the Equal Rights Amendment, \n     nickled and dimed to death in disputes over hypothetical \n     details.\\8\\ The proposed flag amendment is far narrower and, \n     so, far less vulnerable to such opposition. But\n      those who supported the ERA--and deplored the strategy \n     then--should be loath to use it now. It is, in any event, \n     deeply misguided. For if (as John Marshall taught us) the \n     genius of our Constitution is to endure through \n     adaptation, then any pretense to fix its precise meaning, \n     once and for all, is futile. Few constitutional \n     provisions--few of those in the Bill of Rights, for \n     instance--could pass such a test. Hence, the lesson of our \n     history is: Leave future details of application to the \n     future; trust our judicial system; and stick, for the \n     moment, to issues of fundamental principle.\n       When all is said, opponents are left with one line of \n     argument. You ought not, they say, ``fool with'' the \n     Constitution. You should not ``tinker'' or ``fiddle'' with \n     it. You must not ``trivialize'' it. Here is what's \n     fascinating: Such verbs are rarely used to describe judicial \n     interpretations or lawyers' interpretations or academic \n     interpretations of the Constitution. They're reserved, \n     instead, for the process of amendment prescribed by Article \n     V. They're reserved, especially, for amendments proposed not \n     by ``experts'' but by large numbers of ordinary citizens and \n     their representatives. The disdain in such language is clear. \n     It is, I believe, a disdain for the processes of democracy \n     and for the ordinary people who take part in them. The \n     implication is that the Constitution--which establishes \n     processes for its own amendment--is too elevated, too \n     refined, to be touched by those very processes.\n       In the end, that's what is at stake here: Our flag \n     symbolizes our nation. It is a nation defined not by any \n     ethnicity, but by a political practice, the practice of \n     popular sovereignty, of democracy. It is through democracy \n     that our law, including constitutional law, is made. It is \n     through democracy that our liberties are nurtured and \n     exercised and guaranteed. It is through democracy that we are \n     bonded to one another. Shouldn't the people be authorized, if \n     they choose, to require a very minimal respect for that one \n     symbol, that one value, that one aspiration?\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\New York Times v.

Cooper\n       Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. \n     My name is Charles J. Cooper, and I am a partner in the law \n     firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge. I appreciate this \n     opportunity to testify before this distinguished Subcommittee \n     on the proposed Flag Protection Amendment.\n       Almost six years have passed since the Supreme Court \n     decided the case that the Flag Protection Amendment was \n     specifically designed to overturn. In Texas v. Johnson the \n     Court held that the First Amendment's guaranty extends not \n     only to a protester's expression of anti-American sentiments \n     (``America, the Red, White, and Blue, we spit on you.''), but \n     also to his act of burning an American flag to dramatize his \n     views. In so ruling, the Court in effect overturned the flag \n     desecration statutes of 48 States, as well as the Federal \n     Flag Desecration Statute, which prohibited knowingly and \n     publicly ``cast[ing] contempt upon any flag of the United \n     States'' by burning or otherwise physically mistreating it. \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 700.\n       The reaction of the American people to the Johnson decision \n     was swift, loud, and overwhelmingly hostile. President Bush \n     and several Members of Congress called for swift passage and \n     ratification of the Flag Protection Amendment, while other \n     Members of Congress supported a statutory response to the \n     decision--the Flag Protection Act. The purpose of the \n     legislation was to harmonize federal law with the Johnson \n     decision by establishing a ``neutral'' flag desecration \n     statute--\n      that is, one that punished any impairment of the physical \n     integrity of the flag, whether performed in public or in \n     private, and regardless of any message that might be \n     intended or conveyed by the act of physical impairment.\n       Several witnesses, I among them, testified before the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee that the proposed legislation, \n     even if cast in ``neutral'' language, could not be squared \n     with the reasoning of the Johnson decision and would \n     therefore almost certainly be invalidated by the Supreme \n     Court. The point was simply this: clothing the federal Flag \n     Desecration Statute in ``neutral'' language would not \n     disguise the undeniable fact that the central purpose of the \n     proposed measure was to preserve the flag's unique status as \n     ``the Nation's most revered and profound symbol, representing \n     what this Country stands for'' (the words are Senator \n     Biden's, the bill's chief sponsor). The governmental interest \n     in preserving the flag's unique status as a national symbol \n     simply cannot be divorced from expression, for only messages \n     concerning the flag can either advance or diminish its \n     symbolic value.\n       Congress enacted the Flag Protection Act of 1989 (``Act'') \n     by overwhelming majorities in both Houses, and the Supreme \n     Court promptly struck it down in United States v. Eichman. \n     Noting that ``[t]he Government's interest in protecting the \n     `physical integrity' of a privately owned flag rests upon a \n     perceived need to preserve the flag's status as a symbol of \n     our Nation and certain national ideals,'' the Court held that \n     the federal\n      statute, like the Texas statute invalidated in Johnson, \n     ``still suffers from the same fundamental flaw: It \n     suppresses expression out of concern for its likely \n     communicative impact.''\n       The six-year period that has elapsed since the Johnson case \n     has provided time for tempers to cool. The anger and sadness \n     that consumed most Americans when the decision was announced \n     has had time, if not to abate, at least to be moderated by \n     reflection and thought. And yet it still appears that the \n     vast majority of Americans so revere their flag that they are \n     willing to undertake the arduous task of amending their \n     Constitution to authorize Congress and the States to protect \n     it from physical desecration. Congress has received \n     resolutions calling for passage of a flag desecration \n     amendment from the legislatures of 49 States. As a citizen, \n     my own support for the Flag Protection Amendment has not \n     weakened since Johnson was decided, for I remain convinced \n     that the policies underlying the Flag Protection Amendment \n     are sufficiently important to warrant its passage by Congress \n     and ratification by the States.\n       But I have been invited to appear before this Subcommittee \n     as a constitutional lawyer, to provide my views on the legal \n     issues, as opposed to the policy issues, raised by the \n     proposed amendment. I make this point because policy \n     objections have dominated the arguments of constitutional \n     scholars who have testified thus far before congressional \n     committees in opposition to the Flag Protection Amendment. \n     These policy objections--for\n      example, that the proposed amendment would ``trivialize'' \n     the Constitution, that flag desecration laws are popular \n     in Communist regimes, and that the best response to flag \n     desecration is to wave one's own flag--are important and \n     should be considered seriously by Members of Congress, as \n     well as by all Americans, in assessing the merits of the \n     proposed amendment. But they are entitled to no additional \n     weight when voiced by law professors (or Supreme Court \n     Justices for that matter) rather than by any other \n     citizen. I therefore will attempt to confine my testimony \n     insofar as possible to the legal objections that have been \n     advanced in opposition to the Flag Protection Amendment.\n     [[Page S8300]]\n     \n       1. Some constitutional scholars have objected to the \n     wording of the proposed Flag Protection Amendment, which \n     provides simply that ``the Congress and the States shall have \n     power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States.'' These constitutional scholars object \n     particularly to the use of the word ``desecration'' because \n     it makes clear that the amendment would authorize Congress \n     and the States to prohibit only physical mistreatment of the \n     flag that conveys a political protest.\\1\\ Arguing that the \n     Constitution should protect the flag in a ``neutral'' manner, \n     they propose that the amendment be worded to authorize \n     Congress ``to prohibit any physical impairment of the \n     integrity of the flag.'' Such an amendment would ensure that \n     any statutory restrictions would apply across the board, \n     regardless of the purpose or circumstances of the conduct at \n     issue.\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n       The threshold question that must be answered by proponents \n     of this suggestion is whether anyone really wants a \n     ``neutral'' flag protection statue. Does anyone really want \n     to protect the physical integrity of all American flags, \n     regardless of the circumstances surrounding the prohibited \n     conduct? Certainly the constitutional scholars suggesting a \n     ``neutral'' flag protection amendment do not, for they \n     advance the idea only as a lesser evil than the Flag \n     Protection Amendment. Nor are supporters of the proposed Flag \n     Protection Amendment likely to be persuaded that a \n     ``neutral'' alternative would be preferable. The problem is \n     that a genuinely ``neutral'' flag protection measure simply \n     doesn't make sense.\n       The act of burning an American Flag is not inherently evil. \n     Indeed, the Boy Scouts of America have long held that an \n     American flag, ``when worn beyond repair'' should be \n     destroyed ``in a dignified way by burning.'' Boy Scout \n     Handbook at 422 (9th ed.) Similarly, Congress has prescribed \n     that ``[t]he flag, when it is in such condition that it is no \n     longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a \n     dignified way, preferably by burning.'' 36 U.S.C. 176(k). Nor \n     is the respectful disposition of an old or worn flag the only \n     occasion on which burning a flag might be entirely proper. \n     The old soldier whose last wish is to be cremated with a \n     prized American flag fast against his breast\n      would be deserving of respect and admiration, rather than \n     condemnation.\n       In contrast, Gregory Lee Johnson's conduct was offensive--\n     indeed, reprehensible--not simply because he burned an \n     American flag, but because of the manner in which he burned \n     it. Yet, a truly neutral flag protection statute would \n     require us to be blind to the distinction between the conduct \n     of Gregory Lee Johnson and his comrades and the conduct of a \n     Boy Scout troop reverently burning an old and worn American \n     flag. It would also reach other forms of conduct that honor, \n     rather than desecrate, the flag. If, rather than burning an \n     American flag, Gregory Lee Johnson and his colleagues had \n     heaped dirt upon it in some sort of anti-American burial \n     ritual, their conduct would undoubtedly have violated not \n     only the Texas flag desecration statute, but a ``neutral'' \n     flag protection statute as well. A ``neutral'' statute, \n     however, would also have reached and punished the conduct of \n     the unidentified patriot who gathered up Johnson's charred \n     flag and buried it in his back yard.\n       Moreover, not only would a ``neutral'' flag protection \n     statute prohibit conduct that should be praised rather than \n     punished, it would fail to prohibit an infinite variety of \n     public conduct that casts contempt upon the flag. Such a \n     statute would prohibit only conduct that comprises the \n     physical integrity of the flag. Conduct that is not \n     physically destructive of the flag, no matter how openly \n     offensive and disrespectful it may be, would\n      presumably not be reached. Thus, affixing an American flag \n     to the seat of one's pants or simulating vulgar acts with \n     a flag would not come within such a prohibition.\n       Thus, a ``neutral'' flag protection statute is at once too \n     broad, since it would prohibit conduct that no one wants to \n     prohibit, and too narrow, since it would permit conduct that \n     few people want to permit. The proposal therefore simply does \n     not mesh with the public sentiment that animated the passage \n     of 48 state flag desecration statutes and a similar measure \n     by the federal government, that led to the prosecution of \n     Gregory Lee Johnson under the Texas flag desecration law, \n     that provoked the extraordinary public outcry at the Supreme \n     Court's reversal of Johnson's conviction, and that inspired \n     this hearing. I submit that that public sentiment is not \n     ``neutral''; it is not indifferent to the circumstances \n     surrounding conduct relating to the flag. If such conduct is \n     dignified and respectful, I daresay that the American people \n     and their elected representatives do not want to prohibit it; \n     if such conduct is disrespectful and contemptuous of the \n     flag, I believe that they do.\n       The simple truth is that no one really wants a genuinely \n     ``neutral'' flag protection statute. Accordingly, amending \n     the Constitution to authorize enactment of such a statute \n     obviously makes no sense.\n       2. Some opponents of the Flag Protection Amendment objects \n     to the fact that its language does not explicitly state that \n     it overrides the First Amendment. They make two principle \n     points.\n       First, they argue that the proposed amendment, as written, \n     does nothing more than confer upon Congress and the States a \n     legislative power that they already possess. And because the \n     proposed amendment does not expressly override the \n     limitations of the First Amendment, any exercise of that \n     legislative power would be subject to the same First \n     Amendment challenge upheld in Johnson and Eichman. In other \n     words, the Flag Protection Amendment, as written, would not \n     alter the result of the Supreme Court's decisions in Eichman \n     and Johnson.\\2\\\n       The first point to be made in response to this argument is \n     that the proposed Flag Protection Amendment contains no \n     statement that it overrides the First Amendment because such \n     a statement is wholly unnecessary. The First Amendment is the \n     only constitutional provision that has been construed, or \n     could have been construed, by the Supreme Court to prohibit \n     Congress and the States from criminalizing the physical \n     desecration of an American flag. The proposed amendment \n     clearly and directly grants (many would say restores) that \n     legislative power to Congress and the States. A couple of \n     examples will suffice to illustrate this point. If the \n     Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment\n      forbids capital punishment in all cases, a constitutional \n     amendment empowering Congress and the States to impose the \n     death penalty would not also have to contain the entirely \n     redundant statement that it overrides the Eighth Amendment \n     in order to be effective. Similarly, a constitutional \n     amendment granting the States power to require a moment of \n     silence at the beginning of each school day would plainly \n     overrule the Supreme Court's contrary Establishment Clause \n     cases, and it would be far-fetched, to put it mildly, to \n     suggest that the purpose and effect of such an amendment \n     would be unclear in the absence of express language \n     overriding the First Amendment.\n       Beyond this point, I must confess that I am perplexed by \n     the claim that the claim that the States and Congress \n     currently possess, notwithstanding Johnson and Eichman, the \n     legislative power that the Supreme Court so decisively and \n     permanently prevented them from exercising in Johnson and \n     Eichman. In those cases, the Court held that neither the \n     States nor the Congress have constitutional power to prohibit \n     the physical desecration of the American flag. In both cases, \n     the Court overturned convictions for conduct that plainly \n     constituted the physical desecration of American flags. The \n     sole purpose of the proposed Flag Protection Amendment is to \n     overturn the Eichman and Johnson decisions and thus to return \n     to the States and to Congress the legislative power that they \n     thought they had to prohibit the physical desecration of the \n     American flag.\n       I am even more perplexed, however, by the suggestion that \n     passage and ratification of the Flag Protection Amendment \n     would not alter the outcome of a future Johnson or Eichman \n     case. Suffice it to say that there is no reasonable \n     possibility that the Supreme Court, in some future Johnson or \n     Eichman case, would interpret the Flag Protection Amendment \n     as being utterly meaningless.\n       The second point made by these opponents of the proposed \n     amendment is that because its language does not expressly \n     override the First Amendment, ``it leaves entirely unclear \n     how much of the Bill of Rights it would dump.''\\3\\ Apparently \n     the argument is that the omission from the Flag Protection \n     Amendment of any statement that it overrides the First \n     Amendment may be construed to mean that the legislative power \n     granted by the proposed amendment is exempt from or otherwise \n     overrides all constitutional restrictions, such as the Due \n     Process Clause and the Eighth Amendment.\\4\\\n       Before assessing this argument on its own merits, it is \n     important to note first the paradoxical nature of the dual \n     conclusions that these opponents draw from the absence of \n     language in the Flag Protection Amendment expressly \n     overriding the First Amendment. In one breath, they argue \n     that the omission of such language leaves the Supreme Court's \n     interpretations in\n      Johnson and Eichman undisturbed and, thus, renders the \n     proposed amendment ineffective in accomplishing its \n     acknowledged purpose. In the next breath, they argue that \n     the omission of such language from the Flag Protection \n     Amendment presents a serious risk that all other \n     protections in the Bill of Rights will be ``trumped'' when \n     confronted with an exercise of the power to prohibit the \n     physical desecration of the flag. In other words, they \n     argue that by failing to include language explicitly \n     overriding the First Amendment, the authors of the Flag \n     Protection Amendment may have unwittingly overridden every \n     constitutional provision except the First Amendment. This \n     line of reasoning, frankly, is specious, and nothing more \n     need be said to dismiss the notion that the express terms \n     of the proposed amendment must contain a reference to the \n     First Amendment.\n       In any event, there is no reasonable basis for concern that \n     the proposed Flag Protection Amendment will ``trump'' any \n     constitutional protections other than the constitutional \n     right to physically desecrate the American flag. To be sure, \n     the proposed amendment's grant of legislative power to \n     prohibit the physical desecration of the flag comprehends, \n     for example, the power to investigate and to punish \n     violations. But nothing in the language or history of the \n     proposed amendment even remotely suggests that federal or \n     state authorities would be free to enforce a flag desecration \n     statute by randomly invading and searching homes to \n     [[Page S8301]] ferret out violations or by summarily\n      torturing or executing violators without a trial. Nor would \n     the proposed amendment authorize state or local \n     governments, for example, to punish Gregory Lee Johnson, \n     ex post facto, for his violation, to prosecute only black \n     people for violating a flag desecration statute, or to \n     prohibit the press from reporting on incidents of flag \n     desecration. There are simply no plausible arguments \n     supporting an interpretation of the proposed Flag \n     Protection Amendment that would yield these results.\n       In short, the only constitutional right that will be \n     ``trumped'' by the proposed Flag Protection Amendment is the \n     one recognized by the Supreme Court in Johnson and Eichman--\n     the right to physically desecrate an American flag.\n       3. A particularly popular argument among opponents of the \n     Flag Protection Amendment is the concern that prohibiting \n     physical flag desecration will compromise the sacred values \n     reflected in the First Amendment and lead inevitably to \n     further compromises of our Constitution's protection ``for \n     the thought we hate.'' But if prohibiting flag desecration \n     would place us on this sort of slippery slope, we have been \n     on it for a long time. The sole purpose of the Flag \n     Protection Amendment is to restore the constitutional status \n     quo ante pre-Johnson, a time when 48 States, the Congress, \n     and four Justices of the Supreme Court believed that \n     legislation prohibiting flag desecration was entirely \n     consistent with the First Amendment. And that widespread \n     constitutional judgment was not of recent origin; it\n      stretched back about 100 years in some States. During that \n     long period before Johnson, when flag desecration was \n     universally criminalized, we did not descend on this \n     purported slippery slope into governmental suppression of \n     unpopular speech. The constitutional calm that preceded \n     the Johnson case would not have been interrupted, I \n     submit, if a single vote in the majority had been cast the \n     other way, and flag desecration statutes had been upheld. \n     Nor will it be interrupted, in my view, if the Flag \n     Protection Amendment is passed and ratified.\n       4. Finally, I should like to conclude my testimony with the \n     point that the Supreme Court is not the final word on the \n     content or meaning of our Constitution. The American people \n     are. And the idea that the act of desecrating an American \n     flag is ``speech,'' and that the people are therefore \n     powerless to intervene through law to prevent or punish such \n     a tragic spectacle, falls uneasily on the ears of most \n     ordinary Americans. When the Court errs in its constitutional \n     judgment on a matter of surpassing importance to the people, \n     it is entirely appropriate for them to correct that error \n     through the amendment process prescribed by Article V of the \n     Constitution. Indeed, I believe it is their responsibility to \n     do so.\n       Again, thank you for inviting me to participate in this \n     important hearing.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\See Testimony of Henry Paul Monaghan before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee (June 21, 1990); testimony of Cass R. \n     Sunstein before the Senate Judiciary Committee (June 21, \n     1990).\n     \\2\\Testimony of Walter Dellinger before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee at 2 (June 21, 1990) (hereinafter ``Dellinger \n     Testimony'').\n     \\3\\Id.\n     \\4\\See id. at 3, n. 2.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                    Statement of Senator Orrin Hatch\n\n       The American people revere the flag as a unique symbol of \n     our country. It is the symbol that unites a very diverse \n     people in a way nothing else can. Despite our differences of \n     politics, philosophy, religion, race, ethnic background, \n     socio-economic status, or geographic origin, the flag is an \n     incomparable common bond among us.\n       Moreover, Justice John Paul Stevens, dissenting in Texas v. \n     Johnson, aptly stated, ``A country's flag is a symbol of more \n     than `nationhood and national unity.' It also signifies the \n     ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that \n     emblem as well as the special history that has animated the \n     growth and power of those ideas . . .'' [491 U.S. at 436, \n     Stevens, J. dissenting] The flag itself represents no \n     political party or political ideology.\n       I wish we did not have to resort to a constitutional \n     amendment. I believe the Supreme Court was wrong in Texas v. \n     Johnson. But the Supreme Court has given us no choice: if we \n     believe the flag is important enough to protect from physical \n     desecration, an amendment is necessary.\n       Let me set the record straight about the origin of this \n     bipartisan movement. A grassroots coalition, the Citizens \n     Flag Alliance, has been working for some time in support of a \n     constitutional amendment regarding flag desecration. The \n     Citizens Flag Alliance, led by the American Legion, consists \n     of over 100 organizations, ranging from the Knights of \n     Columbus; Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police; and the \n     National Grange to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society \n     of the USA and the African-American Women's Clergy \n     Association. Forty-nine state legislatures have called for a \n     constitutional amendment on flag desecration.\n       The Citizens Flag Alliance approached Senator Heflin and me \n     last year, well before the November elections, and asked us \n     to lead a bipartisan effort in the Senate. They told us they \n     had reasonable hopes that President Clinton would support \n     this amendment. We were pleased to introduce this resolution \n     here. But, before we were asked to do so by the Citizens Flag \n     Alliance, we had no plans to reintroduce this amendment.\n       This is an effort originating entirely among the American \n     people, over 75 percent of whom both favor protecting the \n     flag and sensibly believe that freedom of speech is not \n     jeopardized by so doing.\n       There is more wisdom, judgment, and understanding on this \n     matter in the hearts and minds of the American people than \n     one will find on most editorial boards, law faculties, and, \n     regrettably, in the Clinton Administration.\n       I believe the opponents of the amendment, including \n     President Clinton, have, in good faith, posed a false choice \n     to the American people. In effect, they say that if we wish \n     to protect the flag from physical desecration, we have to \n     trample on the First Amendment. If we want to safeguard the \n     First Amendment, they say, we have to let desecrators trample \n     on the flag.\n       In my view, this amendment, granting Congress and states \n     power to prohibit physical desecration of the flag, does not \n     amend the First Amendment or infringe upon freedom of speech. \n     I believe the flag amendment overturns two Supreme Court \n     decisions which have misconstrued the First Amendment.\n       The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech has \n     never been deemed absolute. Libel is not protected under the \n     First Amendment. Obscenity is not protected under the First \n     Amendment. A person cannot blare out his or her political \n     views at two o'clock in the morning in a residential \n     neighborhood and claim First Amendment protection. Fighting \n     words which provoke violence or breaches of the peace are not \n     protected under the First Amendment. I might add that \n     legislative bodies are able to regulate conduct which people \n     might seek to use as part of a political message.\n       Protecting the flag from physical desecration does not \n     interfere with the numerous ways of conveying an idea \n     whatsoever--through speech, use of placards, signs, \n     bullhorns, leaflets, handbills, newspapers, and more. A \n     protestor can burn or mutilate other symbols of our country \n     or government, or even effigies of political figures. This \n     amendment authorizes legislative bodies to prevent \n     disrespectful conduct with regard to one object, and one \n     object only, our flag. We can withdraw this one unique object \n     from physical desecration and our freedom of speech will \n     remain intact.\n       The parade of horribles some opponents conjure up is a \n     diversion.\n       Indeed, for many years before the 1989 Texas v. Johnson \n     decision invalidating flag desecration statutes, 48 states \n     and the federal government prohibited flag desecration. Was \n     freedom of speech impaired in this country all that time? To \n     ask that question is to answer it--of course not. The First \n     Amendment seemed to have survived these 49 statutes \n     remarkably well.\n       Many academics have appeared before the Committee to tell \n     us the Johnson decision was correctly decided and that it is \n     just a natural development of the Supreme Court's previous \n     First Amendment jurisprudence.\n       Yet, distinguished jurists regarded as great First \n     Amendment champions have agreed that flag desecration does \n     not fall within the ambit of the First Amendment. Chief \n     Justice Earl Warren wrote, ``I believe that the States and \n     the Federal government do have the power to protect the flag \n     from acts of desecration and disgrace . . .'' [Street v. New \n     York, 394 U.S. 576, 605 (Warren, C.J., dissenting)]. Justice \n     Hugo Black--generally regarded as a First Amendment \n     absolutist--stated, ``It passes my belief that anything in \n     the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the \n     deliberate burning of the American Flag an offense.'' [Id. at \n     610 (Black, J. dissenting)]. Justice Abe Fortas wrote: \n     ``[T]he States and the Federal Government have the power to \n     protect the flag from acts of desecration committed in public \n     . . .'' [Id. at 615 (Fortas, J., dissenting)].\n       As Justice Stevens said in his Johnson dissent: ``Even if \n     flag burning could be considered just another species of \n     symbolic speech under the logical application of the rules \n     that the Court has developed in its interpretation of the \n     First Amendment in other contexts, this case has an \n     intangible dimension that makes those rules inapplicable.'' \n     [496 U.S. at 436, Stevens, J., dissenting].\n       Even if, on the other hand, one agreed that the Johnson and \n     1990 U.S. v. Eichman cases were correctly decided under prior \n     precedents, one could still support this amendment--if one \n     views protection of the flag from physical desecration as an \n     important enough value. I am sorry that President Clinton \n     could not see his way clear to supporting protection of the \n     flag against physical desecration, apparently deferring to \n     the determinations made by his lawyers within the narrow \n     confines of a legal memorandum or brief. This is terribly \n     disappointing.\n       And there is no slippery slope here. The amendment relates \n     only to the flag. The uniqueness of the flag renders the \n     amendment no precedent for any other amendment or \n     legislation. Most Americans understand this. Moreover, \n     neither the amendment, nor any legislation it authorizes, \n     compels any conduct or any profession of respect for any idea \n     or symbol, nor prescribes what is orthodox in any matter of \n     opinion.\n       Johnson was a 5-4 decision of the Supreme Court. Had the \n     Court gone 5-4 the other way, and upheld flag desecration \n     statutes, would there have been an uproar by editorial \n     writers, law professors, and members of Congress to repeal \n     these flag desecration statutes? I think not. In effect, one \n     vote on the Supreme Court compels us to go the amendment \n     [[Page S8302]] route, we have no choice--if we think the flag \n     is important enough to protect.\n       Our acquiescence in the Supreme Court's misguided 5-4 \n     decisions itself devalues the flag. I hope Congress will not \n     stand idly by and tacitly accept the Court's wrongheaded \n     notion that the flag is of no more value than a common \n     object. As Justice Stevens wisely noted in his Johnson \n     dissent: ``sanctioning the public desecration of the flag \n     will tarnish its value . . . That tarnish is not justified by \n     the trivial burden on free expression occasioned by requiring \n     that an available alternative mode of expression including \n     uttering words critical of the flag . . . be employed.'' [436 \n     U.S. at 437]\n       I urge support for the amendment.\n               race for the cure--breast cancer awareness\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nenthusiastically supporting the efforts of our Vice President and Mrs. \nGore in bringing breast cancer awareness to the attention of our \nNation's women. their participation in the Race for the Cure \ndemonstrates their on-going commitment and dedication to finding a cure \nfor breast cancer and for early detection.\n  I am proud to have been an advocate for breast cancer research and \nearly detection. When we passed the breast and cervical cancer \namendments of 1993, it showed that we can build a preventive health \ncare system using the community-level, public/private partnerships \nwhich are critical to success. This legislation saved women's lives.\n  But our job is not over. There are many States that have no screening \nprogram for breast cancer and many other States are just getting \nstarted. Screenings are absolutely necessary if we are to prevent this \ndreaded health risk for America's women.\n  All women in America are at risk. In fact, 50,000 mothers, daughters, \nrelatives, and friends will die from breast cancer alone. but the women \nmost at risk are also those who are our most defenseless--older women, \nwomen of color, and women of limited income.\n  Over the past few years, we have made significant strides in breast \ncancer research--focused through the National Institutes of Health's \nOffice of Women's Research. We know what it takes to save many of these \nlives.\n  It takes regular screening for women over 40 using mammograms and \nself-exams. All women need to hear this message. All women should think \nof getting a mammogram as once a year for a lifetime. For the fortunate \nmajority of America's women, following through on that message is not \ntoo much to ask.\n  That is why I take pride in joining my colleagues today in urging \nparticipation in the Race for the Cure to be held this Saturday, June \n16. Events like this get the message out. The message of ``breast \ncancer is preventable'' and ``Once a Year for a Lifetime'' in getting \nthat mammogram.\n  I welcome the day when no woman turns away from the decision to have \na mammogram for lack of funds, access to services, or lack of \nawareness. This is the noble cause I am dedicated to. America's women \ndeserve no less. Join Race for the Cure.\n\n\n                           race for the cure\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would like to take a few moments to \nunderscore the comments many of my colleagues made earlier today in \nsupport of the upcoming Race for the Cure, which will be held this \nSaturday in Washington. This weekend's race marks the 6th year that \nWashingtonians have participated in this important event. it is a time \nwhen policymakers, civil servants, media representatives, and other put \ntheir ideological differences aside and show their solidarity in \nsupport of the effort to find a cure for breast cancer.\n  In the past, the Race for the Cure has helped raise critical funding \nfor medical research and for mammograms. Much of this money remains in \nthe local area to support research institutions and provide mammograms \nfor women who could not otherwise afford them. The Race for the Cure \nhas also done an exceptional job of raising the public's awareness \nabout breast cancer, and of alerting women to the importance of early \ndetection measures.\n  As in the past, many of Saturday's race participants will be breast \ncancer survivors. Many more will be the spouses, children, siblings, \nand friends of both breast cancer survivors and, I am sad to say, the \nmany women who have not survived their battle with this disease. It is \nfor all these individuals that we race. And it is for them that we \ncontinue our efforts to support research and public awareness in the \nhope that one day all women who face this disease will be survivors.\n  Although we have made significant strides in combating breast cancer, \nwe are far from the finish line. Medical research into the causes, \ncure, and prevention of breast cancer is critical to this effort. \nPublic awareness and prevention efforts are also critical components of \nour battle against breast cancer. Today doctors strongly recommend \nmonthly self-examinations to check for the early warning signs of \nbreast cancer. Sometimes these early warning signs are not early \nenough, however, and that is why it is so important for women at risk \nof breast cancer to have mammograms. I am hopeful that one day we will \nbe able to detect all breast cancers at an early stage.\n  I am even more hopeful, however, that we will someday have a cure for \nthis disease. Over 70 percent of all women who have breast cancer do \nnot exhibit any of the known risk factors. This year 182,000 women will \nbe diagnosed with breast cancer, and 46,000 women will die from this \nterrible disease. Whether the answer to this disease is around the \ncorner, or it takes years to discover, we cannot give up the fight. We \nmust find a cure.\n  Sometimes the most effective movements are born of tragedy, and the \nRace for the Cure is one of those movements. this race is a tribute to \nall women who have not survived their battle with breast cancer. It is \nin their memory that we continue our efforts to increase support for \nmedical research and raise public awareness about this issue.\n  This race is also a tribute to all those women who are surviving \ntheir battle with breast cancer. It is in their honor that we stand \nwith them, walk with them, and run with them. It is in humble respect \nthat we race with them--to find a cure for breast cancer.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8302-S8303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n        VARIOUS ISSUES REGARDING THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I would like to speak this morning on \ntwo issues concerning the People's Republic of China; specifically, \nHong Kong and our embassy in Beijing.\n  First, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten contacted me last Friday to \ninform me that his government and the government of the People's \nRepublic of China had finally reached an agreement on establishing the \nCourt of Final Appeal [CFA]. He was kind enough to send me a copy of \nthe agreement, as well as a copy of his statement to the Hong Kong \nLegislative Council.\n  As my colleagues know, the establishment of the CFA has been one of \nthe major sticking points in the negotiations over the transition of \nHong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Hong Kong \npresently operates under a British legal system based on statute and \ncommon law, and the judiciary is a separate, independent branch of \ngovernment. These legal traditions provide substantial and effective \nprotections against arbitrary arrest or detention, and ensure the right \nto a fair and public trial. Aside from the legal protections \nindividuals enjoy under this system, Hong Kong's transparent and \npredictable legal system and regulatory scheme has been a major draw to \nbusinesses. They know ahead of time what statutes govern their actions, \nand that their contracts will be enforced. The continuance of these \nlaws after 1997 will be a key factor in the territory's ability to \nmaintain its promised high degree of local autonomy and its attraction \nto business.\n  Final trial court decisions in Hong Kong are now appealable to the \nSupreme Court, and then to the Privy Council in London. There is a \nwell-founded concern that, upon retrocession, the protections offered \nby the present legal and appellate systems might disappear to be \nreplaced by a more ``indigenous'' system where the courts are \ninstruments of the Party, contracts are honored only as long as they \nare useful, and final decisions are handed down from Beijing according \nto the whims of the leadership.\n  In an attempt to ally these fears, in the Joint Declaration and \nsubsequent [[Page S8303]] discussions the People's Republic of China \nand United Kingdom agreed to establish a local CFA before 1997 to \nreplace the Privy Council. Protracted negotiations between the parties, \nhowever, failed to produce a mutually agreeable plan for the Court's \nimplementation. With 1997 looming and fears about the consequences of \nthe lack of a court at the time of retrocession, the Hong Kong \nGovernment unilaterally prepared a draft bill for introduction in the \nLegco.\n  Beijing refused to endorse the draft, and both sides spent time \npointing the finger at the other, while it languished. In March, in \nresponse to statements by Governor Patten that the Legco might \nunilaterally establish the CFA without waiting for Chinese approval, \nthe People's Republic of China stated that it would dismantle any court \nestablished without its OK. This left the Hong Kong Government with the \nHobson's choice: either leave it to China to decide when and how the \ncourt would be established after 1997, or go ahead with the draft bill \nand create a serious dispute with the People's Republic of China that \nwould have damaged investor and citizen confidence and left doubts \nabout whether China would eventually just dismantle it.\n  On June 1, however, the two sides began a new round of spirited \nnegotiations which led to the June 9 agreement. The basic gist of the \nagreement is that the Hong Kong Government will procede to introduce \nits draft bill in the Legco, and that preparations for the Court should \nbe made on the basis of the resulting legislation and completed in time \nfor the Court to begin operating on July 1, 1997. It will not, however, \nbegin operating before that date. Governor Patten noted on Friday that:\n\n       What is vital is that we know now what kind of court will \n     be in place on 1 July 1997. That is what the Hong Kong \n     community and US and other foreign businessmen have been \n     calling for and I believe that the Chinese have come to \n     realise that it is vital to the maintenance of confidence in \n     Hong Kong. There will be dissentient voices, of course, but I \n     believe that the majority of the Hong Kong community and \n     international investors will welcome the agreement, and that \n     the Legislative Council will accept it.\n       The bottom line is that, although it is not ideal, this \n     agreement does more to strengthen the rule of law after 1997 \n     than any alternative course of action, and for that reason I \n     am convinced that it is the right way forward.\n\n  While I find myself in some agreement with Governor Patten, as an \noutside observer I have four concerns with the agreement: the timing, \njurisdiction, finality, and judicial independence issues. First, I \nregret that the Court will not begin to function until the day \njurisdiction is transferred in 1997. If the Chinese had agreed to allow \nthe Court to begin functioning as soon as enabling legislation could be \npassed, then the two sides would have had more than a year in which to \nsee how the court operates and to work out through a consensus any \nkinks or shortcomings that became apparent. As it stands now, the Court \nwill be jumpstarted cold in 2 years on July 1 without a ``test run.''\n  My second concern involves the Court's jurisdiction. In the \npreliminary talks about the Court, the Chinese side was rather adamant \nthat the jurisdiction of the CFA would not extend to acts of state. \nWhat Beijing sought to forestall by this provision was the spectre of a \njudicial branch based on English common law declaring void some tennet \nof the central government vital to the continuation of the Communist \nsystem. Unfortunately, the new agreement adopts the definition of ``act \nof state'' set out in Article 19 of the Basic Law, which has been seen \nby some as vague and thus capable of an overly expansive \ninterpretation. The worry is that after 1997 the Chinese will simply \nqualify politically uncomfortable cases as touching on ``acts of \nstate'' and therefore remove them from judicial review.\n  Third, the provisions regarding judicial appointments raise some \nconcerns. Under the Joint Declaration, judges appointed to the CFA were \nto be confirmed by the Legco. Moreover, the Court would be allowed to \ninvite judges from other English common law jurisdictions to sit on the \nCourt. These two provisions have fallen somewhat by the wayside under \nthe new agreement. Now, it appears that the confirmation provision by \nthe Legco has been removed. In addition, the parties adopted the \nlimitation of foreign judges to one set out in what are known as the \nsecret documents. Both of these are violative of the Joint Declaration.\n  Finally, the parties appear to have largely glossed over what is \nknown as the finality issue. The idea behind the CFA is that the Hong \nKong citizens will have the final say about judicial decisions that \neffect them, and not some party cadre in Beijing. The reason is easily \nillustrated by a simple analogy: Wyoming citizens would not want \ndecisions of their State supreme court on State laws to be subject to \nreview by a bureaucrat in Washington. Yet, the finality of CFA \ndecisions is still somewhat up in the air.\n  Having made these observations, Madam President, as I have pointed \nout before decisions such as these are principally a bilateral issue \nbetween the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom. If both \nsides have agreed to the new provisions, who are we to gainsay their \ndecision? This is one area where, I believe, overly active moves on our \npart would for once justify the usual Chinese observation that we were \nmeddling in their internal affairs. I would just hope, though, that the \nparties would note our concerns and perhaps work with each other to \nremove some of the remaining ambiguities and departures from the Joint \nDeclaration.\n  Madam President, I would also like to address another topic \nconcerning the People's Republic of China today. It has come to my \nattention that our representative in the People's Republic of China, \nAmbassador J. Stapleton Roy, will be permanently leaving his present \npost next week to return to Washington and then move on to our Embassy \nin Jakarta, Indonesia. Yet, inexplicably, the Clinton administration \nhas failed to even name a replacement, let alone forward his or her \nname to the Senate for confirmation, and has simply decided to leave \nthe post vacant for an undeterminant period of time.\n  Madam President, I am amazed and dismayed that the Clinton \nadministration has decided to take such an ill-advised step--whatever \nthe impetus. Leaving a post vacant in a small, relatively non-strategic \ncountry is one thing; but to do so in the world's most populous \ncountry, a country that is emerging as the economic engine that will \ndrive Asia into the 21st century, is quite another.\n  This is especially true at this time when our bilateral relationship \nis somewhat less than perfect.\n  The Chinese are extremely displeased with our decision this month to \nadmit President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, and have stated that the \ndecision has seriously soured their view of our relationship. While \nthey have cancelled and postponed several meetings as a sign of their \ndispleasure, I am sure that we have not seen seen the full extent of \ntheir reaction.\n  More importantly, the Chinese Government is itself in a state of \nflux. The move to replace the ailing Deng Xiaoping is, contrary to the \nbeliefs of some, well under way. Jiang Zemin and his Shanghai \ncompatriots are already moving to consolidate their positions, and \nother factions have begun their jockeying in turn. Under these \ncircumstances, each and every move we make in relation to our Chinese \nfriends--large, small, overt, or subtle--takes on a special importance.\n  To allow our Ambassador to depart from Beijing at this time and leave \nour embassy floating without anyone at the helm seems to me to be the \nheight of misjudgment. I hope that President Clinton will forward the \nname of Ambassador Roy's intended replacement in the very near future \nso we can get the nomination process rolling and fill this vitally \nimportant position.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8302-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8303-S8304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              KATHY JORDAN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to salute Kathy Jordan, who \ntoday is being inducted in the Stanford University Athletic Hall of \nFame.\n  My northern California field representative for over 2 years, Kathy \njoined my staff after an incredibly successful career in women's \ntennis.\n  While at Stanford, she won four AIAW Collegiate titles, including \nboth the singles and doubles championships in 1979. She still is \nconsidered the best women's tennis player who ever went to \nStanford. [[Page S8304]] \n  She then turned professional and in her first year reached the final \n16 at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.\n  During her professional tennis career that spanned a decade, Kathy \nwon seven Grand Slam titles.\n  Kathy earned a reputation as a tough and tenacious competitor. And, \nas she defeated one challenger after another, Kathy proved she was one \nof the best players in the world and climbed to a ranking of No. 5. In \njust 1 year, she went from being No. 23 in the world to being No. 5.\n  During that time, Kathy beat Chris Evert in straight sets at \nWimbledon in 1983, reached the finals of the 1983 Australian Open, and \nthen went on to knock off Pam Shriver in the quarterfinal of the 1984 \nWimbledon singles championship to reach the semifinals.\n  Kathy would later be described as Chris Evert's top nemesis, beating \nher three times.\n  Martina Navratilova, too, felt the sting of Kathy Jordan's passing \nshots. Not only did Kathy beat her in singles, but it was the team of \nKathy Jordan and Liz Smylie that pulled a huge doubles upset and ended \nthe 109-match winning streak of Navratilova and partner Pam Shriver in \nthe Wimbledon final of 1985. Jordan and Smylie won by a score of 5-7, \n6-3, 6-4. It was sweet victory for Kathy, who had lost 3 of the last 4 \nyears to Navratilova and Shriver after winning the Wimbledon \nchampionship in 1980 with partner Anne Smith.\n  Looking back on the match, Kathy recounted how she and her partner, \nSmylie, were serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set. Kathy \ngambled, lunged across to Smylie's side of the court for a volley. They \nwon the point, with Navratilova and Shriver looking stunned as the shot \nwhipped by.\n  ``Pam and Martina were standing there looking at each other. I'm \nkinda like a roving linebacker and Liz is like a defensive back who \nsometimes has to cover behind me in case a ball gets over my head,'' \nKathy said in 1991.\n  That roving linebacker attitude is exactly what made Kathy Jordan a \nlegend on the tennis courts.\n  But, in the 1987 Virginia Slims of New England, Kathy's career was \njeopardized with one of the most serious injuries an athlete can \nsuffer--a tear of the right anterior cruciate ligament.\n  ``That's the Bernard King injury. The Danny Manning injury. You get \nscared. You never really know. A lot of people don't make it back,'' \nKathy told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1990.\n  But, once again Kathy's determination paved the way and she once \nagain became a potent threat in women's tennis. She reunited with her \npartner, Liz Smylie, and once again knocked off the expected winners to \nclimb their way into the Wimbledon doubles final in 1990.\n  I've had the pleasure of getting to know Kathy over the course of the \nlast 2 years.\n  After retiring from women's tennis, Kathy finished her undergraduate \nwork at Stanford University and chose to direct her talents to public \nservice. She worked on Lynn Yeakel's campaign for the U.S. Senate in \nher native Pennsylvania and then returned to California, where Palo \nAlto had become home.\n  Kathy joined my staff in 1993 as field representative for the \nnorthern California region of the State.\n  She has been one of the most outstanding staff persons I've worked \nwith over the last 2 years.\n  Kathy assumed her field responsibilities with an incomparable level \nof compassion, intelligence, and diligence. And just as she did on the \ntennis court, Kathy has shown a fierce determination to fight for what \nis right.\n  She redefined the title ``field representative'' and was quickly \npromoted to the role of field director, overseeing projects for me \nstatewide.\n  As a representative of over 20 counties, she was my eyes and ears for \nnorthern California. She identifies a problem and--more importantly--\nhelps figure out how to solve a problem.\n  She has been a tireless advocate for the issues and concerns of the \nresidents and elected officials in her jurisdiction.\n  I frequently have county supervisors and others approach and thank me \nfor the work she has done and the results accomplished.\n  At a time when many feel alienated and are looking to the \ngovernment's representatives to help them and respond to their needs \nand problems, I feel proud that I have a staff person who heeds the \ncall and gets things done.\n  Kathy is a remarkable person whose compassion, respect, and talent \nfor her work serves as a model for others.\n  I am grateful to have worked with her and benefited from her service \nto the U.S. Senate.\n  Madam President, I stand here to congratulate Kathy on all her \naccomplishments, and for the honor being bestowed her by Stanford \nUniversity.\n  For all she has accomplished in both the world of tennis and in \ngovernment service, it is an honor well deserved.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8303-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             LANE KIRKLAND\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN.

It's safe to say, in \n     fact, that no one in the United States--apart from President \n     Reagan himself--did more to hasten the demise of the Soviet \n     empire than did Lane Kirkland.\n\n  Lane Kirkland's presence at the helm of American labor will be sorely \nmissed. As the New York Post concluded:\n\n       His retirement marks the departure from the public arena of \n     a larger-than-life figure--an able, courageous and principled \n     individual whose shoes will be difficult to fill.\n\n  I extend my thanks to Lane Kirkland for his dedication to working men \nand women, and I wish him the best of luck in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8304-1", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?

Madam President, exactly 220 years ago today, a proud \nAmerican institution was born, the U.S. Army. I rise today to not only \nrecognize this important milestone in the history of the Army, but to \npay tribute to all soldiers who have served their Nation, both in the \npast and in the present.\n  For more than two centuries, America's soldiers have selflessly and \nsuccessfully protected the freedoms and ideals of the United States, \nand America's soldiers have stood tall and fast wherever they have been \ndeployed. From the Minuteman at Lexington with his trusty musket who \nstarted the fight for the independence of our Nation, to the G.I. \nequipped with night vision goggles, a Kevlar helmet, and the battle-\nproven M16A2 rifle on patrol along the DMZ in Korea, our soldiers have \nalways distinguished themselves. The battle streamers of the Army flag \nstand as testament to the courage, fortitude, and abilities of those \nwho have fought under this banner: Valley [[Page S8305]] Forge; New \nOrleans; Mexico City; Gettysburg; Havana; the Philippines; Verdun; \nBataan; North Africa; Monte Cassino; Normandy; Arnhem; the ``Bulge''; \nPusan; Seoul; the Ia Drang Valley; Grenada, Panama; Kuwait, and, Iraq \nrepresent just a partial list of the places where ordinary men brought \ndistinction to themselves, the Army, and the United States by their \nactions.\n  We must also not forget the many other campaigns and operations the \nArmy has undertaken in its history, which have included: surveying the \nuncharted west coast; protecting western settlers; guarding our \nborders; assisting in disaster relief; providing humanitarian aid to \nother nations; and conducting medical research that benefits soldiers \nand civilians alike. There is simply no question that the U.S. Army has \nhad a tremendous impact, in many different ways, on the history of our \nNation and the world.\n  Soon we on the Senate Armed Services Committee will begin our mark up \nof the fiscal year 1996 defense authorization budget, including the \nmoney needed to support the Army. Often our focus is on what weapon \nsystems we need to fund, how many new tanks, field guns, or rifles we \nshould purchase, but our chief concern is always providing for the \nsoldier. We work to ensure that the young E-3 has a quality of life \nthat is not beneath him, and that the soldier who dedicated his or her \ncareer to the Army and Nation is not forgotten. Each of us on the \ncommittee, and I am sure in the Senate as well, understands that it is \nthe people--the newest recruit and the most senior general--who make up \nthe Army and guarantee the security and defense of the United States. \nWe may have an arsenal of smart bombs at our disposal, but it is the \nsoldier who must face and defeat our enemies. Ensuring they have the \nbest equipment, training, and quality of life possible are our highest \npriorities.\n  This investment in our men and women in uniform pays a handsome \ndividend beyond the security of the United States. Countless numbers of \npeople who have served in the Army have gone on to hold important \npositions in both the public and private sectors. Our first President, \nGeorge Washington, was a general in the Army, as were Ulysses Grant, \nZachary Taylor, and Dwight Eisenhower. Additionally, many former \nsoldiers have gone on to serve in the Halls of Congress. In the House, \nthere are some 87 individuals who served in the Army and in the Senate, \n27 of our colleagues have worn the Army green. I know that each of us \nis proud of our association with the Army and that we have been able to \nserve our Nation as both soldiers and statesmen.\n  Madam President, over the past 220 years, more than 42 million of our \nfellow citizens have raised their right hand and sworn to defend our \nNation as soldiers. In each instance we have asked our soldiers to \ncarry out a mission, they have done so with a sense of purpose, \nprofessionalism, and patriotism. We are grateful for the sacrifices \nthese individuals have made and the example they have set for future \nsoldiers. With a heritage as proud as the one established by our \nNation's soldiers over the past 220 years, we know that the U.S. Army \nwill always remain the finest fighting force that history has ever \nknown.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8304-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 652, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 652) to provide for a procompetitive, \n     deregulatory national policy framework designed to accelerate \n     rapidly private sector deployment of advanced \n     telecommunications and information technologies, and services \n     to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to \n     competition, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\n       Pending:\n       Feinstein/Kempthorne amendment No. 1270, to strike the \n     authority of the Federal Communications Commission to preempt \n     State or local regulations that establish barriers to entry \n     for interstate or intrastate telecommunications services.\n       Gorton amendment No. 1277 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 1270), to limit, rather than \n     strike, the preemption language.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 20 minutes debate on the \nFeinstein amendment No. 1270, to be equally divided in the usual form, \nwith the vote on or in relation to the amendment to follow immediately.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, the amendment that is the subject of \ndiscussion is one presented by Senator Kempthorne and me. There is a \nsection in this bill entitled ``Removal of Entry to Barriers.'' It is a \nsection about which the cities, the counties and the States are very \nconcerned because it is a section that giveth and a section that taketh \naway.\n  Why do I say that? I say it because in section 254, the States and \nlocal governments are given certain authority to maintain their \njurisdiction and their control over what are called rights-of-way.\n  Rights-of-way are streets and roads under which cable television \ncompanies put lines. How they do it, where they do it and with what \nthey do it is all a matter for local jurisdiction. Both subsections (b) \nand (c) maintain this regulatory authority of local jurisdictions, but \nsubsection (d) preempts that authority, and this is what is of vital \nconcern to the cities, the counties and the States.\n  Senator Kempthorne and I have a simple amendment. That amendment, \nquite simply stated, strikes the preemption and takes away the part of \nthis bill that takes away local government and State governments' \njurisdiction and authority over the rights-of-way.\n  We are very grateful to Senator Gorton who has presented a \nsubstitute, which will be voted on following our amendment. However, we \nmust, quite frankly, say this substitute is inadequate.\n  Why is it inadequate? It is inadequate because cities and counties \nwill continue to face preemption if they take actions which a cable \noperator asserts constitutes a barrier to entry and is prohibited under \nsection (a) of the bill. As city attorneys state, is a city insurance \nor bonding requirement a barrier to entry? Is a city requirement that a \ncompany pay fees prior to installing any facilities to cover the costs \nof reviewing plans and inspecting excavation work a barrier to entry? \nIs the city requirement that a company use a particular type of \nexcavation equipment or a different and specific technique suited to \ncertain local circumstances to minimize the risk of major public health \nand safety hazards a barrier to entry? Is a city requirement that a \ncable operator move a cable trunk line away from a public park or place \ncables underground rather than overhead in order to protect public \nhealth a barrier to entry?\n  These are, we contend, intensely local decisions which could be \nbrought before the FCC in Washington. The Gorton substitute continues \nto permit cable operators to challenge local government decisions \nbefore the FCC.\n  Why is this objectionable to local jurisdictions? It is objectionable \nto local jurisdictions because they believe if they are a small city, \nfor example, they would be faced with bringing a team back to \nWashington, going before a highly specialized telecommunications-\noriented Federal Communications Commission and plighting their troth. \nThen they would be forced to go to court in Washington, DC, rather than \nFederal district court back where they live.\n  This constitutes a major financial impediment for small cities. For \nbig cities also, they would much prefer to have the issue settled in \ntheir district court rather than having to come back to Washington.\n  The cable operators are big time in this country. They maintain \nWashington offices, they maintain special staff, they maintain a bevy \nof skilled telecommunications attorneys. Cities do not. Cities have a \ncity attorney, period. It is a very different subject.\n  Suppose a city makes a determination in the case that they wish to \nhave [[Page S8306]] wiring done evenly throughout their city--I know, \nand I said this on the floor before, when I was mayor, the local cable \noperator wanted only to wire the affluent areas of our city.\n  We wanted some of the less affluent areas wired; we demanded it, and \nwe were able to achieve it. Is this a barrier to entry? Could the cable \ncompany then appeal this and bring it back to Washington, meaning that \na bevy of attorneys would have to come back, appear before the FCC, go \nto Federal court here or with the local jurisdiction, and maintain its \nauthority, as it would under the Kempthorne-Feinstein amendment. And \nthen the cable operators, if they did not like it, could take the item \nto Federal court.\n  We believe to leave in the preemption is, in effect, to create a \nFederal mandate without funding. So we ask that subsection (d) be \nstruck and have put forward this amendment to do so.\n  I yield now to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes 21 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I will reserve my time and ask if \nthe Senator from Washington would like to speak at this point.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, the section at issue here is a section \nentitled ``Removal of Barriers to Entry.'' And the substance of that \nsection is that ``No State or local statute or regulation may prohibit \nor have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide \nany interstate or intrastate telecommunications services.''\n  Madam President, this is not about cable companies, although cable \ncompanies are one of the subjects of the section. This is about all of \nthe telecommunications providers that are the subject of this bill. And \nit is the goal of this bill to see to it that the maximum degree of \ncompetition is available. And in doing so, these fundamental decisions \nabout whether or not an action of the State or local government is an \ninhibition or a barrier to entry almost certainly must be decided in \none central place.\n  The amendment to strike the preemption section does not change the \nsubstance. What it does change is the forum in which any disputes will \nbe conducted. And if this amendment--the Feinstein amendment--in its \noriginal form is adopted, that will be some 150 or 160 different \ndistrict courts with different attitudes. We will have no national \nuniformity with respect to the very goals of this bill, what \nconstitutes a serious barrier to entry.\n  This will say that if a State or some local community decides that it \ndoes not like the bill and that there should be only one telephone \ncompany in its jurisdiction or one cable television provider in its \njurisdiction, no national organization, no Federal Communications \nCommission will have the right to preempt and to frustrate that \nmonopolistic purpose. It will have to be done in a local district \ncourt. And then if another community in another part of the country \ndoes the same thing, that will be decided in that district court.\n  So, Madam President, this amendment--the Feinstein amendment--goes \nfar beyond its legitimate scope. But it does have a legitimate scope. I \njoin with the two sponsors of the Feinstein amendment in agreeing that \nthe rules that a city or a county imposes on how its street rights of \nway are going to be utilized, whether there are above-ground wires or \nunderground wires, what kind of equipment ought to be used in \nexcavations, what hours the excavations should take place, are a matter \nof primarily local concern and, of course, they are exempted by \nsubsection (c) of this section.\n  So my modification to the Feinstein amendment says that in the case \nof these purely local matters dealing with rights of way, there will \nnot be a jurisdiction on the part of the FCC immediately to enjoin the \nenforcement of those local ordinances. But if, under section (b), a \ncity or county makes quite different rules relating to universal \nservice or the quality of telecommunications services--the very heart \nof this bill--then there should be a central agency at Washington, DC, \nwhich determines whether or not that inhibits the competition and the \nvery goals of this bill.\n  So, Madam President, I am convinced that Senators Feinstein and \nKempthorne are right in the examples that they give, the examples that \nhave to do with local rights of way. And the amendment that I propose \nto substitute for their amendment will leave that where it is at the \npresent time and will leave disputes in Federal courts in the \njurisdictions which are affected.\n  But if we adopt their amendment, we have destroyed the ability of the \nvery commission which has been in existence for decades to seek \nuniformity, to promote competition, effectively to do so; and we will \nhave a balkanized situation in every Federal judicial district in the \nUnited States. So their amendment simply goes too far.\n  Now, Madam President, I can see some, including some of the sponsors \nof the bill, who feel that this preemption ought to be total. And those \nwho feel it ought to be total should vote ``no'' on the Feinstein \namendment and ``no'' on mine as well. Those who feel that there should \nbe no national policy, that local control and State control of \ntelecommunications is so important that the national policy should not \nbe enforced by any central agency, should vote for the Feinstein \namendment. But those who believe in balance, those who believe that \nthere should be one central entity to make these decisions, subject to \njudicial review when they have to do with whether or not there is going \nto be competition, when they have to do with the nature of universal \nservice, when they have to do with the quality of telecommunications \nservice or the protection of consumers, but believe that local \ngovernment should retain their traditional local control over their \nrights of way, should vote against the Feinstein amendment and should \nvote for mine. It is the balance. It meets the goals that they propose \ntheir amendment to meet without being overly broad and without \ndestroying the national system of telecommunications competition, which \nis the goal of this bill.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, I am proud to join Senator Feinstein \nin this amendment. I also wish to acknowledge the efforts of the \nSenator from Washington, Senator Gorton, because all of us are trying \nto correct what is a flaw in this bill. I find it ironic that the title \nof this bill, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act \nof 1995, this flaw that is in this bill smacks right at this whole \naspect of deregulation, which this Congress has been very good about \nreestablishing the rights of States and local units of government.\n  Madam President, this amendment is not about guaranteeing access to \nthe public right of way. As the Senator from Washington just pointed \nout, that language is in there. That is section (a). This amendment is \nnot about preserving the ability of a State to advance universal \nservice and to ensure quality in telecommunications services, because, \nMadam President, that is right here in section (b) of the bill. This \namendment is not about ensuring that local governments manage their \nrights of way in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, \nbecause that is in section (c) of this bill.\n  In fact, the Senator from Texas, the Presiding Officer, was \ninstrumental in having section (c) put into this act. It was very \nhelpful. The whole problem is, Madam President, section (d) then \npreempts all of that. In section (d), it states--and I will summarize--\nthat the commission shall immediately preempt the enforcement of such \nstatute, regulation, or legal requirement to the extent necessary to \ncorrect such violation or inconsistency.\n  I think it is a shame that your good, hard work, Madam President, now \nhas section (d) that preempts it and pulls the plug on that. There are \nthose that would say the reason you have to have that particular \nsection is because there may be instances in local government that may \ncompel a cable company to give what they call extractions. We asked our \ncable company in Idaho: Can you give us some examples of where a local \ncommunity has sought extractions, where you might have to go in trees \nand do something special? We do not have any examples. I find it ironic \n[[Page S8307]] that because there are some who believe that these \nextractions could take place, the remedy is to say that we will now \nhave a Federal commission of nonelected people preempt what local or \nState governments do.\n That is backsliding from what we have been trying to do with this \nCongress.\n\n  The Senator from Washington said that we must decide these cases in \none place. That message is very clear, Madam President. If there is a \nproblem, then we are now going to say with this legislation, if we \nleave section (d) in there, they must come to Washington, DC. You must \ncome to Washington, DC.\n  What has happened to federalism, to States rights and local rights? \nIt was brought to my attention that in the State of Arizona they have \npointed out that this, in fact, could preempt the Constitution of the \nState of Arizona.\n  This is a flaw in this legislation, Madam President, that, again, a \nnonelected Commission--which I have a great respect for that \nCommission--could, in essence, preempt the Constitution of the State.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe National Governors' Association, National Conference of State \nLegislatures, National Association of Counties, National League of \nCities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, all in support of this amendment. \nThey point out that this will not be the impediment to the barrier, but \nit is the right amendment to correct this flaw.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Governors' Association, National Conference of \n           State Legislatures, National Association of Counties, \n           National League of Cities, and United States Conference \n           of Mayors,\n                                                     June 6, 1995.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole and Senator Daschle: On behalf of state \n     and local governments throughout the nation, we are writing \n     to strongly urge your support for two amendments to S. 652, \n     the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995. Together these amendments would prevent an unwarranted \n     preemption of state and local government authority and speed \n     the transition to a competitive telecommunications \n     environment. The first amendment achieves the appropriate \n     balance between the needed preemption of barriers to entry \n     and the legitimate authority of states and localities, and \n     the second permits states to continue efforts already \n     underway to promote competition.\n       First, Senator Feinstein will offer an amendment to delete \n     a broad and ambiguous preemption section (section 254(d) of \n     Title II). The Senate's bill's proposal under Section 254(d) \n     for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) review and \n     preemption of state and local government authority is totally \n     inappropriate. Section 254 (a) and (c) provide the necessary \n     safeguard against any possible entry barriers or impediments \n     by state and local governments in the development of the \n     information superhighway. In particular we are concerned that \n     Section 254(d) would preempt local government authority over \n     the management of public rights-of-way and local government's \n     ability to receive fair and reasonable compensation for use \n     of the right-of-way. We strongly opposed any preemption which \n     would have the impact of imposing new unfunded costs upon our \n     states, local governments, and taxpayers.\n       Second, Senator Leahy will offer an amendment to strike \n     language preempting states from requiring intraLATA toll \n     dialing parity. Ten states have already established this \n     requirement as a means of increasing competition; thirteen \n     more states are considering its adoption. If the goal of S. \n     652 is to increase competition, the legislation should not \n     take existing authority from states that is already being \n     used to further compensation. We strongly oppose this \n     preemption and urge your support for Senator Leahy's \n     amendment.\n       Again, we urge you to join Senator Feinstein and Senator \n     Leahy in their efforts to eliminate these two provisions from \n     the bill and avoid unwarranted preemption of state and local \n     government in this critical area.\n           Sincerely,\n     Terry Branstad,\n         Co-Lead Governor on Telecommunications.\n     Jane L. Campbell,\n         President, National Conference of State Legislatures.\n     Randall Franke,\n         President, National Association of Counties.\n     Carolyn Long Banks,\n         President, National League of Cities.\n     Victor Ashe,\n         President, U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.\n\nState Preemption in Federal Telecommunications Deregulation Legislation\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The U.S. Senate has begun consideration of S. 652, a bill \n     to rewrite the Federal Communications Act of 1934 to promote \n     competition. Several provisions in the bill and certain \n     proposed amendments would adversely affect states, and \n     Governors need to communicate their concerns to their \n     senators to:\n       Support the Feinstein/Kempthorne amendment to strike \n     section 254(d) on FCC preemption;\n       Support the Leahy/Simpson amendment to protect the state \n     option to require intraLATA toll dialing parity (open, \n     competitive markets for regional phone service); and\n       Oppose the Packwood/McCain amendment to preempt local and \n     state authority to tax direct broadcast satellite services \n     (DBS).\n\n\n                               background\n\n       Both the House and the Senate have reported legislation to \n     reform the Federal Communications Act of 1934. The Senate \n     bill, S. 652, would require local phone companies to open \n     their networks to competitors while also permitting those \n     companies to offer video services in competition with local \n     cable television franchises. Once the regional Bell telephone \n     companies open their networks, they can apply to the Federal \n     Communications Commission (FCC) for permission to offer long-\n     distance service.\n       During the debate over telecommunications in 1994, states \n     and localities banded together to promote three principles \n     for inclusion in federal legislation: strong universal \n     service protections, regulatory flexibility that would retain \n     an effective role for states to manage the transition to a \n     procompetitive environment rather than federal agency \n     preemption, and authority for states and localities to manage \n     the public rights-of-way. At a June 6 meeting of the State \n     and Local Coalition, chaired by Governor George V. Voinovich, \n     the attached letter was signed by local officials and Iowa \n     Governor Terry E. Branstad, NGA co-lead Governor on \n     Telecommunications. The letter calls for the support of two \n     amendments.\n       Feinstein/Kempthorne Amendment: Deleting Section 254(d). \n     Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Senator Dirk \n     Kempthorne (R-Idaho) are offering an amendment that would \n     strip broad and\n      ambiguous FCC preemption language from section 254(d) of the \n     bill. Section 254(a) preempts states and localities from \n     erecting barriers to entry, and this preemption is \n     supported by NGA policy. Section 254(b) permits states to \n     set terms and conditions for doing business within a \n     state, including consumer protections and quality of \n     services; section 254(c) ensures the authority of states \n     and local government to manage the public rights-of-way.\n       Paragraph (c) was inserted in the bill in committee by \n     Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.), and includes a \n     requirement that any such fees and charges be \n     nondiscriminatory. Paragraph (d) states that if the FCC \n     ``determines that a state or local government has permitted \n     or imposed any statute, regulation, or legal requirement that \n     violates or is inconsistent with this section, the FCC shall \n     immediately preempt the enforcement of such statute, \n     regulation, or legal requirement to the extent necessary to \n     correct such violation or inconsistency.'' Because small \n     telephone or cable companies are unlikely to have a presence \n     in Washington, D.C., this provision would result in a bias \n     toward major competitors. Striking paragraph (d) leaves \n     adequate protections for a competitive market.\n       Leahy/Simpson Amendment: Deleting Preemption of State \n     Authority to Require IntraLATA Toll Dialing Parity. One major \n     reason that competition in long distance service has \n     increased is the requirement that local phone companies \n     permit long-distance carriers dialing parity (i.e., consumers \n     no longer have to dial additional numbers to utilize an \n     alternative long-distance carrier service). Customers choose \n     a carrier, and all interLATA calls are billed through that \n     company. However, calls within a local access and transport \n     area (intraLATA), or so-called short-haul or regional long-\n     distance calls, are under state jurisdiction and not subject \n     to this FCC rule. To date, ten states have required toll \n     dialing parity, and twelve states are currently considering \n     its adoption. Paragraph 255(B)(ii) of S. 652 would preempt \n     the authority of states to order intraLATA toll dialing \n     parity; Senator Patrick S. Leahy (D-Vt.) and Senator Alan K. \n     Simpson (R-Wyo.) are offering an amendment that would remove \n     this preemptive language.\n       State and Local Taxing Authority. As reported by the Senate \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, S. 652 \n     includes language ensuring that state and local government \n     taxation authority is not affected by the bill. Senator Bob \n     Packwood (R-Ore.) and Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) may offer \n     an amendment exempting the DBS industry from any local \n     taxation, even taxes administered by states. This language is \n     taken from H.R. 1555, recently approved by the House Commerce \n     Committee. States must ensure that the Senate bill avoids the \n     preemption of state and local taxing authority.\n\n\n                             Actions Needed\n\n       Governors need to contact their senator to urge support for \n     both the Feinstein/ [[Page S8308]] Kempthorne amendment and \n     the Leahy/Simpson amendment, and to urge opposition to the \n     Packwood/McCain amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I support the Feinstein amendment to \nremove the provision in S. 652 which would preempt local control of the \npublic rights-of-way.\n  The Feinstein amendment would remove section 254(d) of the \ntelecommunications bill currently being considered by the Senate which \ndirects the FCC to examine and preempt any State and local laws or \nregulations which might prohibit a company from providing \ntelecommunications services.\n  As a former local official I have always felt it was important that \nwe in Congress pay proper recognition to the rights of local \ngovernment.\n  Section 254(d) is the type of legislating that we in Washington \nshould not be doing--preempting State and local decisions in areas \nwhere local government has the responsibility and specified knowledge \nto act in the best interest of their local communities. Washington \nshould not micromanage how local government administers its streets, \nhighways, and other public rights-of-way.\n  I will vote in favor of the Feinstein amendment and in favor of the \nright of local governments to retain control over their streets, \nhighways, and rights-of-way.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes, 38 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, once again, the alternative proposal, \nwhich will be voted on only if this amendment is defeated, retains not \nonly the right of local communities to deal with their rights of way, \nbut their right to meet any challenge on home ground in their local \ndistrict courts.\n  The Feinstein amendment itself, Madam President, would deprive the \nFCC of any jurisdiction over a State law which deliberately prohibited \nor frustrated the ability of any telecommunications entity to provide \ncompetitive service.\n  It would simply take that right away from the FCC, and each such \nchallenge would have to be decided in each of the various Federal \ndistrict courts around the country.\n  The States retain the right under subsection (d) to pass all kinds of \nlegislation that deals with telecommunications providers, subject to \nthe provision that they cannot impede competition.\n  The determination of whether they have impeded competition, not by \nthe way they manage trees or rights of way, but by the way they deal \nwith substantive law dealing with telecommunications entities. That \nconflict should be decided in one central place, by the FCC.\n  The appropriate balance is to leave purely local concerns to local \nentities, but to make decisions on the natural concerns which are at \nthe heart of this bill in one central place so they can be consistent \nacross the country.\n  Madam President, the purposes of this bill will be best served by \ndefeating this amendment and adopting the subsequent amendment. I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Is there a sufficient second? \nThere is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Feinstein \namendment No. 1270.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment is identical to S. \n792, legislation designed to connect public schools and public \nlibraries to the information superhighway, which I introduced earlier \nthis year.\n  If there is any objective that should command complete American \nconsensus, it is to ensure that every American has a chance to succeed. \nThat is the core concept of the American dream--the chance to achieve \nas much and to go as far as your ability and talent will take you. \nPublic education has always been a part of that core concept. In this \ncountry, the chance to be educated has always gone hand in hand with \nthe chance to succeed.\n\n\n                               technology\n\n  Nonetheless, I am convinced that it will be difficult if not \nimpossible for us to prepare all of our children to compete in the \nemerging global economy \n[[Page S8310]] unless they all have access to the technology available \non the information superhighway. Technology can help teachers and \nstudents play the new roles that are being required of them in the \nemerging global economy. It can help teachers use resources from across \nthe globe or across the street to create different learning \nenvironments for their students without ever leaving the classroom. \nTechnology can also allow students to access the vast array of \nmaterial, available electronically, necessary to engage in the analysis \nof real world problems and questions.\n\n\n                              gao reports\n\n  Last year, I asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a \ncomprehensive, nationwide study of our Nation's education \ninfrastructure. The GAO decided to meet my request with five separate \nreports. The first report entitled--``The Condition of America's \nSchools''--concluded that our Nation's public schools need $112 billion \nto restore their facilities to good overall condition.\n  The most recent GAO report entitled--``America's Schools Not Designed \nor Equipped for the 21st Century''--concluded that more than half of \nour Nation's public schools lack six or more of the technology elements \nnecessary to reform the way teachers teach and students learn \nincluding: computers, printers, modems, cable TV, laser disc players, \nVCR's, and TV's. The report states that: 86.8 percent of all public \nschools lack fiber-optic cable; 46.1 percent lack sufficient electrical \nwiring; 34.6 percent lack sufficient electrical power for computers; \n51.8 percent lack sufficient computer networks; 61.2 percent lack \nsufficient phone lines for instructional use; 60.6 percent lack \nsufficient conduits and raceways; and 55.5 percent lack sufficient \nphone lines for modems.\n\n\n                          local property taxes\n\n  The most recent GAO report did find that students in some schools are \ntaking advantage of the benefits associated with education technology. \nThe bottom line, however, is that we are still failing to provide all \nof our Nation's children with the best technology resources in the \nworld because the American system of public education has forced local \nschool districts to maintain our public schools primarily with local \nproperty taxes.\n  In Illinois, the local share of public education funding increased \nfrom 48 percent during the 1980-81 school year to 58 percent during the \n1992-93 school year, while the State share fell from 43 to 34 percent \nduring this same period. The Federal Government's share of public \neducation funding has also fallen from 9.1 percent during the 1980-81 \nschool year to 5.6 percent during the 1993-94 school year.\n                        information superhighway\n\n  These statistics as well as the results of the second GAO report \nsuggest to me that the Federal Government must do more to help build \nthe education portion of the information superhighway. Federal support \nfor the acquisition and use of technology in elementary and secondary \nschools is currently fragmented, coming from a diverse group of \nprograms and departments. Although the full extent to which the Federal \nGovernment currently supports investments in education technology at \nthe precollegiate level is not known, the Office of Technology \nAssessment estimated in its report--``Power On!''--that the programs \nadministered by the Department of Education provided $208 million for \neducation technology in 1988.\n  There is little doubt that substantial costs will accompany efforts \nto bring education technologies into public schools in any \ncomprehensive fashion. In his written testimony before the House \nTelecommunications and Finance Subcommittee on September 30, 1994, \nSecretary of Education Richard Riley estimated that it will cost \nanywhere from $3 to $8 billion annually to build the education portion \nof the national information infrastructure.\n\n\n           National Education Technology Funding Corporation\n\n  Mr. President, three leaders in the areas of education and finance \ncame together recently to help public schools and public libraries meet \nthese costs. On April 4, John Danforth, former U.S. Senator from \nMissouri, Jim Murray, former president of Fannie Mae, and Dr. Mary \nHatwood Futrell, former president of the National Education \nAssociation, created the National Education Technology Funding Corp.\n  As outlined in its articles of incorporation, the National Education \nTechnology Funding Corp. will stimulate public and private investment \nin our Nation's education technology infrastructure by providing States \nwith loans, loan guarantees, grants, and other forms of assistance.\n\n\n                               amendment\n\n  Mr. President, I introduced S. 792, the National Education Technology \nFunding Corporation Act, on May 11, 1995, to help provide the seed \nmoney necessary to get this exciting private sector initiative off the \nground. Rather than supporting our Nation's education technology \ninfrastructure by creating another Federal program, this legislation \nwould simply authorize Federal departments and agencies to make grants \nto the NETFC.\n  The amendment I am introducing today would not create the NETFC or \nrecognize it as an agency or establishment of the U.S. Government; it \nwould only recognize its incorporation as a private, nonprofit \norganization by private citizens. However, since NETFC would be using \npublic funds to connect public schools and public libraries to the \ninformation superhighway, my amendment would require the corporation to \nsubmit itself and its grantees to appropriate congressional oversight \nprocedures and annual audits.\n  This amendment will not infringe on local control over public \neducation in any way. Rather, it will supplement, augment, and assist \nlocal efforts to support education technology in the least intrusive \nway possible by helping local school districts build their own on-ramps \nto the information superhighway.\n  S. 792 has been cosponsored by Senators Burns, Campbell, Kerry, and \nRobb and endorsed by the National Education Association, the National \nSchool Boards Association, the American Library Association, the \nCouncil for Education Development and Research, and organizations \nconcerned about rural education.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take this important step to \nhelp connect public schools and public libraries to the information \nsuperhighway by quickly enacting my amendment into law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 1282 and 1284), as modified, were agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8305-2", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to thank all Senators for that \noutstanding cloture vote and to say that now in this postcloture \nperiod, I hope Senators will bring their amendments to the floor. We \nare ready to proceed. Senator Dole has indicated a desire of possibly \nfinishing the bill today or tonight. We hope we can do that.\n  I think we are on the way to passing a deregulatory, procompetitive \ntelecommunications bill. I thank all Senators for their cooperation. We \nhope that Senators who have speeches or amendments will bring them to \nthe floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1306\n\n(Purpose: To protect ratepayers from having to pay civil penalties for \n  violations by local exchange carriers of interconnection and other \n                                duties)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1306.\n       On page 107, after line 23, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Payment of Civil Penalties.--No civil penalties \n     assessed against a local exchange carrier as a result of a \n     violation of this section will be charged directly or \n     indirectly to that company's ratepayers.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have discussed this with the managers of \nthe bill, and I have a modification that I would like to get unanimous \nconsent to be included which does not change the substance of the bill; \nit merely clarifies to what civil penalties it refers. It says ``civil \npenalties, damages or interests,'' as opposed to just ``civil \npenalties.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be modified in that \nfashion.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object until we can get a copy \nof it over here. We are trying to be cooperative and move the process \nforward. Some of these amendments have been modified at the very last \nminute. We have a system of reading these over here, and we would like \nto get a copy of it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield. I understand, Mr. President, \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska has a one-line amendment. ``No \ncivil penalties assessed against the local exchange carrier as a result \nof a violation of the section will be charged directly or indirectly to \nthat company's ratepayers.''\n  Trying that amendment on for size, let us assume I ran a public \nutility, whether it be, say, a telephone company, cellular or \notherwise. I am running a public company and I am trying to comply. Let \nus say I am president. Unless I take the money out of my pocket, how \nelse am I going to avoid paying the penalty against the company \ndirectly or indirectly? How do I do it? It is bound to come out one way \nor the other. My company, Hollings Communications, has been assessed a \n$5,000 fine.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have an easy answer for that. For example, when the \ncompanies get into providing ancillary services, they will always say, \nno, this is not coming from the ratepayers, it is coming from the \nshareholders. They do this all the time. When the company is offering a \ndefense of something, or when we are identifying something that we are \nconcerned may be billed to the ratepayer, they will provide information \nto the FCC saying that it is being charged to the shareholders, not the \nratepayers.\n  The bill provides, in section 224, civil penalties and damages if the \ncompany violates the interconnection requirements. But my concern is \nthat there is uncertainty as to whether these are going to be imposed, \nand even if they are, what the level is going to be. And what the \namendment attempts to do is protect the ratepayer from having to \nshoulder the burden of any civil penalty that might end up being \nimposed, damage or interest, assessed against the local exchange \ncarrier for violating the interconnection duties imposed on them by the \nlegislation.\n  It seems to me----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am willing to be educated and go along. In my mind, \nlike Government, we do not have anything to give that we do not take. \nYou and I have the same idea in mind. If that is what the Senator says \nand that is what they do, I am not the head of the company, but I think \nI could make it appear that the ratepayers were not paying for it. But \ncome what may, I am afraid they would be.\n  Mr. KERREY. What the Senator from South Carolina is saying is exactly \nright. It has always been a dispute with consumers who object to things \na certain company is doing, as to whether or not a charge is being \nassessed to the shareholder or the ratepayer. That has always been in \ndispute. At both the FCC and the State public service commissions, they \nhave attempted to answer this, and they have mechanisms that allow them \nto do this kind of separation.\n  This is an attempt to protect the ratepayer in the event that the \nlocal exchange company is fined. As I said, there is considerable \nuncertainty. The fines are rather substantial--in some cases, a million \ndollars a day, and in one case $500 million, which could potentially be \nassessed against a local exchange company if they violated the terms \nand conditions of this new law. If you presume that a $5 million fine \nis levied against a local exchange company, it seems to me the \nratepayer should not be penalized as a consequence of a mistake being \nmade by a company that is trying to move from a monopoly situation to a \ncompetitive environment.\n  This amendment says that, if civil penalties are imposed or damages \nor interests are imposed according to the law, we just merely make sure \nthat they are not going to pass it in particular to a captive ratepayer \nthat has no other option.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This could make the head of a corporation at least far \nmore careful. Perhaps it could be allocated against him individually.\n  I hearken back, in the past, when I was talking with the former \ndistinguished Attorney General of the United States, Robert Kennedy, \nand we had the Mississippi case down at Oxford. He was asking me about \nthe enforcement of these decisions of the Court.\n  I met Senator Kennedy long before being Senators, otherwise we were \nvery close. I said, ``You know our distinguished friend Governor \nBarnett has a building right across the street from the capital. If you \nhad a $10,000 a day civil fine imposed, I think you would get his \nattention.''\n  We public officials act and the public will have to pick up, but when \nwe are individually responsible, that is a different thing.\n  I am confident that the Attorney General Kennedy communicated that \nwith Governor Barnett, and thus the admission of James Meredith to \nOxford. The idea is a good idea. It is one I used some years back. I do \nnot see any objection to it. I will have to listen to our distinguished \nchairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the modification of \nthe amendment?\n[[Page S8312]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object, I do not think my \ncolleague from South Carolina has a copy of the modified amendment with \nthe handwritten changes.\n  This is a problem procedurally that we have here with these \nmodifications. Amendments must be modified, sometimes.\n  Let me ask, this is written in longhand. I cannot see, ``damages or \ninterest'' is inserted where?\n  Mr. KERREY. With civil penalty damages.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. It should read ``payment of civil penalties, damages or \ninterest,'' and then no civil penalties?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct, and no civil penalty damages.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. ``Damages or interest, no civil penalties;'' and then \ndoes ``damages or interest'' occur again? We have damages and interest \nwritten again.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I gave the desk the only copy of the \nmodification I have. I am not even able to look at my own copy.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Even the modification, I cannot tell----\n  Mr. KERREY. It should be both in the heading and the text. The change \nneeds to be in the heading and the text.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I think we need a clean copy.\n  Mr. KERREY. Would you like block letters?\n  Let me have staff work on this while I talk about the amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I do not think we have an objection to the basic idea.\n  Are damages and interest different from civil penalties?\n  Mr. KERREY. Civil penalties is not clear. That is the interpretation \nthat I was given. I was attempting to clarify this thing. I was told \ncivil penalties is not clear.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Is the Senator taking ``civil penalties'' out and \nputting ``damages or interest'' in?\n  Mr. KERREY. No, I am putting ``interest'' and ``damages'' in.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me say, generally speaking, I agree with the thrust \nof the amendment. But if we could get a clean copy of the amendment, \nthis is a very confusing, the way it is written. It is confusing to me \nat least.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will ask the Senator from Nebraska \nif he would like to temporarily lay this aside?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it takes almost no time at all. I would \nlike to get staff to clear this up. It is a single-line amendment. It \nshould not be that difficult to have staff write this up in block \nletters.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I am not trying to be difficult.\n  Mr. KERREY. I understand. I put insertions in this thing, and I need \nit written out in a single line. I do not need to lay the amendment \naside.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that my request for modification \nof this amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we have no problem with the amendment \nand we are prepared to accept it.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nmodification of my amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment being accepted?\n  Mr. KERREY. I earlier withdrew it, but I heard the Senator from South \nDakota say----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from South Dakota was accepting the \namendment once the modification had been withdrawn.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That is right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Is that correct, Senator?\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me withdraw the modification, and I would like to \nhave the modification sent to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  I, personally, would prefer not to have the amendment without this \nclarification. I would like to have the manager of the bill look at the \nmodification before it is accepted, and I would like to talk about the \nbill or the amendment for a little while, so we can look at a clean \ncopy.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We are prepared to accept the amendment as it is \nwritten and drafted.\n  Mr. KERREY. Without modification?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Without modifications.\n  Mr. KERREY. You are saying you object to modifications?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. No, no, I did not say that. I thought you had withdrawn \nyour modification.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am withdrawing the modification so I can get the \nlanguage clear enough so that the Senator from South Dakota can \nevaluate the modification itself. Then I can proceed and discuss the \namendment while the modification is being sent to the Senator. I can \nredo it here so it is a cleaner copy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to temporarily \nwithdrawing the modification?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1306, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask the modification that I have now \nreviewed with the distinguished manager of the bill be included as part \nof this amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We have no problem with the amendment and we are \nprepared to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, No. 1306, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 107, after line 23, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Payment of Civil Penalties, Damages, or Interest.--No \n     civil penalties, damages, or interest assessed against any \n     local exchange carrier as a result of a violation referred to \n     in this section will be charged directly or indirectly to \n     that company's rate-payers.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1306), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERREY. While I understand the Senator has some additional \namendments--I have some other ones I would send down--let me describe a \nlittle bit what was in this amendment so colleagues understand how this \nbill has been modified.\n  I think it is an important amendment because we are moving from a \nsystem of assessing rates for your local telephone service, based upon \na rate base. That typically is calculated, presented to the public \nservice commission or the public utility commission of the State, and \nthe public service commission or public utility commission makes a \ndetermination about local telephone charges based upon that rate.\n  There are a number of States that have moved to a more competitive \ntype of situation. I think there are seven, eight, or nine States that \nhave done so--I believe Colorado just recently passed legislation. This \nlegislation, S. 652 preempts the States and says we are going to go to \na price cap system of regulation as opposed to rate base.\n  So, all 50 State public utility commissions or public service \ncommissions would be required to use a price cap system under this \nlegislation.\n  I think it is going to be important, as you move to this widespread \nuse of price cap regulation, to say very clearly, given the rather \nsubstantial penalties for failure to provide interconnection--and they \nare rather substantial; as I said, I believe it is $1 million a day and \nup to $5 million a day-- that you will not tap the ratepayer. I believe \nit is important, if penalties or damages get assessed, it does not get \npassed on to that individual ratepayer.\n  Regulators are inevitably going to be asked by local telephone \ncompanies or local providers of service, as new competitors come on \nline, to adjust these caps. When they do, it is going to be very \ndifficult if not impossible to exclude consideration of costs in making \nthat adjustment. In making that adjustment they may not be able to \nidentify and exclude penalties effectively. [[Page S8313]] This \namendment will, as a consequence, protect ratepayers.\n  Mr. President, I am proposing an amendment designed to protect \nratepayers from having to shoulder the burden of any civil penalties, \ndamages or interest assessed against local exchange carriers for \nviolating the interconnection and other duties imposed on them by this \nlegislation.\n  Section 224 of the bill contains enforcement provisions. Under these \nprovisions, a telecommunications carrier that fails to implement the \nrequirements of sections 251 and 255 can be punished by a civil penalty \nof up to $1 million for each offense. A Bell company that repeatedly, \nknowingly, and without reasonable cause fails to implement an \ninterconnection agreement, to live up to the agreement after \nimplementing it, or to comply with the bill's separate subsidiary \nrequirements can be fined up to $500 million. These penalties are \nintended to deter companies from evading their responsibilities to \nprovide effective interconnection. The section also provides that \nprivate parties injured by such conduct can recover damages and \ninterest.\n  I have very serious doubts, Mr. President, about the efficacy of the \ncivil penalties and the prospect of damages. I think there will be a \nlot of uncertainty as to whether sanctions will be imposed. This \nuncertainty is inherent in the nature of the interconnection \nrequirements in the bill. For example, the very first duty under \nsection 251 is the duty to enter into good faith negotiations with any \ntelecommunications carrier requesting interconnection. The lawyers \ncould litigate until kingdom come about whether a company has failed to \nnegotiate in good faith.\n  A similar example is found under the minimum standards of \ninterconnection. The local exchange carrier must take whatever action \nunder its control is necessary, as soon as it is technically feasible, \nto provide telecommunications number portability and local dialing \nparity. Now these two things--number portability and local dialing \nparity--sound a little arcane, but they are both essential to having \nany kind of meaningful local competition.\n  Number portability means that customers can keep their telephone \nnumbers when they switch phone companies. Quite simply, telephone \ncustomers--both business and residential--are not as willing to switch \nphone companies if they also have to switch phone numbers. If I'm a \nsmall company in Omaha, NE, I can't afford to change telephone \ncompanies if it means that I have to change phone numbers, even if the \ncompetitor offers an otherwise better deal. My customers wouldn't know \nhow to get a hold of me. All my listings, stationery, and business \ncards would have to be redone.\n  So new phone companies who want to compete with the established \ncarrier will be at a tremendous competitive disadvantage if there is \nnot number portability.\n  But the local exchange carrier doesn't have to take any action until \nnumber portability is technically feasible. Who is going to decide that \nissue? You can bet the lawyers will have something to say about it, as \nwell as platoons of experts.\n  Same situation with local dialing parity. Local dialing parity means \nthat a customer who subscribes to a competitor can make calls by \ndialing the same number of digits as they would if they were customers \nof the established phone company. That's a big deal. People don't like \nto dial any more numbers than they have to. Back in the days of the old \nBell system, that was one of the ways the monopoly disadvantaged MCI \nand other long distance competitors. You had to dial access codes if \nyou wanted to use MCI. That discouraged people from switching.\n  So the bill says that a local exchange carrier has to provide number \nportability and local dialing parity as soon as it is technically \nfeasible, or there will be penalties. Well, it could be years before \nthe lawyers and the experts and the FCC and the courts figure out what \nis technically feasible. By that time, the penalties or a private \naction to recover damages may not mean too much.\n  Which brings me to my next point, Mr. President. Even if penalties \neventually are imposed, we don't know how significant the penalties \nactually would be. The bill sets upper limits on the amount of \npenalties. But it doesn't offer any assurance that a penalty would ever \napproach those figures. Actual penalties, if they are imposed at all, \ncould be a fraction of the possible amount.\n  A private party seeking damages would also face daunting prospects in \nproving the level of those damages, since in many cases the injured \nparty might never have gotten its business going because of the very \nviolation complained of. The speculative nature of damages might be a \nserious barrier to recovery for the injured party.\n  This balance of uncertain high penalties or damages against the \ncertain and enormous financial benefit to local exchange carriers--\nespecially the Bell companies--of not providing effective \ninterconnection to would-be competitors suggests that the deterrence \neffect of this penalty scheme will be minimal.\n  So I have my doubts, Mr. President, that this enforcement approach is \ngoing to provide much encouragement to local telephone monopolies to \ncooperate in opening up the local market to competition.\n  But if civil penalties are imposed or damages assessed, one thing we \nneed to make sure of is that they are not passed on to local \nratepayers. That is what my amendment does, Mr. President. It states \nthat--\n       . . . [n]o civil penalties, damages, or interest assessed \n     against any local exchange carrier as a result of a violation \n     referred to in this section will be charged directly or \n     indirectly to that company's ratepayers.\n\n  This amendment is necessary, because the ratepayers are captive to \nthe local exchange carriers. They don't have any choice. Without this \namendment, the carrier could just pass the penalty or damages along to \nratepayers--who would have to pay, because of that lack of choice. And, \nin that case, the carrier would have succeeded in evading the \nrequirements of the bill twice--first by not meeting its \ninterconnection obligations and second by making captive ratepayers \nfoot the bill for the penalty or damages.\n  Moving to a price cap form of regulation will not solve this problem. \nIn fact, a price cap system may increase the chances that ratepayers \nwill end up paying the local exchange carrier's civil penalties and \ndamage judgments if this amendment is not adopted. Under traditional \nrate of return regulation, at least, the State regulators can conduct a \nrate case and scrutinize the claim and tell the carrier, No, that's a \npenalty, you can't pass that along.\n  Under price cap regulation, regulators will inevitably be asked to \nadjust the caps. And when they do adjust them, it will be impossible \nfor them to exclude consideration of costs in making that adjustment. \nBut in making that adjustment, they may not be able effectively to \nexclude penalties and damages from the adjustment.\n  This amendment will put the burden on the local exchange carrier to \nmake sure that penalties, damages and interest don't end up burdening \nratepayers. It makes sure that the penalties penalize the local \nexchange carrier, not the captive ratepayers.\n                           Amendment No. 1344\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for the representation of consumers on the \n            Federal-State Joint Board on universal service)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for \nits immediate consideration. It is amendment No. 1344.\n  Mr. President, there is under provision of this amendment creation of \na new Federal-State joint board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold. The clerk has not \nyet reported the amendment. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1344.\n       On page 37, line 7, insert after ``service,'' the \n     following: ``In addition to the members of the Joint Board \n     required under such section 410(c), one member of the Joint \n     Board shall be an appointed utility consumer advocate of a \n     State who is nominated by a national organization of State \n     utility consumer advocates.''.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the amendment is very straightforward. It \nmerely asks for a consumer advocate to be appointed to be a member of \nthis joint Federal-State board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nSouth Dakota.\n[[Page S8314]]\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am going to have to question this \namendment. I want to confer here. Do we have a copy of this amendment \nhere?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, as I \nunderstand the idea here it is to add a consumer representative to the \njoint board, which is now comprised of four State commissioners and \nthree Federal commissioners. They have the general overall concern of \nconsumers as well as industry.\n  What you have suggested now, by the amendment, is that a consumer \nrepresentative be added on. The industry friends, then, will say ``We \nwant an industry friend.'' If there is one thing that sort the rankles \nthis particular Senator--and it is not the Senator from Nebraska; \nHeavens above, I have the greatest admiration for him--but it is this \nidea of classifications around this town: middle class and lower class \nand upper class and rich class and poor.\n  I represent the high, the low, the rich, the poor and all classes. I \nreally look upon our public utility commission at the several States to \nbe very much attuned to the interests of consumers as well as the \nindustry, and similarly with respect to the FCC Members. Mr. Coelho and \nthe Federal Communications Commission were just commended by the U.S. \nCircuit Court of Appeals here in the District of Columbia last week for \nthe outstanding job in measuring competition in the market and how they \nbalance the interests of consumers versus the needs of the industry and \notherwise.\n  So I really am not enthused about this amendment but I yield to my \ndistinguished chairman.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I must oppose this amendment \nreluctantly. I am all for consumers. But to have a person appointed who \nis nominated by the National Organization of State Utility Consumer \nAdvocates, then we would say we need a corporate advocate. We need a \nracial minority advocate. We need this and that.\n  So I feel strongly this would not be an appropriate amendment. It is \nmy present intention to move to table it and to ask for the yeas and \nnays. I think we would have serious problems that this would create, \nserious problems. I just do not believe in legislating, appointing one \ntype or one group having access to the board.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nNebraska [Mr. Kerrey].\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I acknowledge those are reasonable \nobjections. I suspect the Senator from South Carolina in particular has \nhad experience as a Governor. Very often a statute ends up saying you \nhave to have one from this legislative district, four Republicans, \nthree Democrats, or vice versa. Very often in the legislative process \nyou get quite detailed in trying to narrow down or debate who is going \nto be on this board. I am not doing that.\n  Indeed, this provision is in H.R. 1555. It is in the House bill. So I \nam not asking we come in and designate that you have ``x'' number of \ncorporate members and this number of Democrats and this number of \nRepublicans. I am merely saying there should at least be one consumer \nadvocate. As I said, it is consistent with what is already in the House \nbill.\n  Philosophically I am with both the Senator from South Dakota and \nSouth Carolina. I think any amendment that would come in and say with \nspecific language here how each one of these board members have to look \nbefore you can appoint them would complicate the matter and not likely \nresult in the kind of board that is going to be needed. I merely argue, \nwith respect, that this conforms with the language of the House bill. I \nwould have loved to have a situation where I was appointing boards \nwhere this is all I had to worry about, only appointing one consumer \nadvocate as opposed to all the typical balancing requirements that are \nspecified in legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings].\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the interests of all parties, as I \nunderstand it, should we have a motion and a rollcall ordered, I hope \nthese rollcalls could be stacked beginning at 2 o'clock. We have a \nmeeting of the leadership at the White House. We have Members down, \nbipartisanly, at a luncheon for the President of France, President \nChirac.\n  With that in mind, we can facilitate and move right along with any \nparticular votes. I hope we can start at 2 o'clock, if the chairman \ngives us permission to do so.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, is the current business my previous \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside temporarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have an amendment numbered 1313.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n            (Purpose: Clarifies state rate-making authority)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1313.\n       On page 116, between lines 2 and 3 insert the following:\n       (D) Nothing in this section shall prohibit the Commission, \n     for interstate services, and the States, for interstate \n     services, from considering the profitability of \n     telecommunications carriers when using alternative forms of \n     regulation other than rate of return regulation (including \n     price regulation and incentive regulation) to ensure that \n     regulated rates are just and reasonable.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am told by leadership that they are \nnow prepared to vote. If we could lay aside this amendment and come \nback to the Kerrey amendment No. 1344, I will move to table at that \ntime, if that is agreeable with my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I just sent to \nthe desk be laid aside and that the previous amendment be the order of \nbusiness. And I will speak a little bit further on that before a \ntabling motion is made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1344\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a motion by the \nSenator from South Dakota to table an amendment that provides for a \nsingle consumer on the joint Federal-State board. This provision is in \nthe House bill. I call to my colleagues' attention, who are trying to \nfigure out exactly whether or not to support an amendment that will \nprovide one consumer representative on this board, that it references \nthe universal services section. As we move from this monopoly that has \nbeen established to provide universal service--understand, that is the \npurpose of the monopoly. The monopoly is put together to provide \nuniversal telephone service. It has gotten the job done. Now we are \ngoing to move from a monopoly situation to a competitive situation.\n  I support changing the law to get that done. But as we make the \ntransition, Members should understand that we are putting universal \nservice at risk because we are basically moving over time so that these \ncompanies--currently monopolies, currently pricing in the vast majority \nbased upon a system of rate-based rate of return--are going to move to \na system of price caps, and eventually they are going to price based on \ncost.\n  Currently, you will have situations in a metropolitan area, say \nOmaha, [[Page S8315]] NE, where residential rates are about $14 a \nmonth, and business rates are $30 a month. It does not cost the company \nany difference. There is no difference in running a line to a business \nand running a line to a resident. The law as set up gives the monopoly \nthe authority to earn a rate of return. But it is also given the \nability to subsidize the residential rates, to shift costs; in other \nwords, so we can keep the residential rates lower than they otherwise \nmight be.\n  I do not know whether the rates are going to go from $14 to $18, or \nwhether in a competitive environment they are going to go down. I do \nnot know. We are going to allow them to price differently.\n  In transition, one of the biggest questions is, How do we continue to \nprovide universal service to these residential consumers? These are the \nconsumers. There is already in place a Federal-State joint board.\n  It is going to be entitled for 1 year at least ``Federal-State Joint \nBoard on Universal Service.''\n  The statute says that:\n\n       Within one month after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Commission shall institute and refer to a Federal-State \n     Joint Board under section 410(c) of the Communications Act of \n     1934 a proceeding to recommend rules regarding the \n     implementation of section 253 of that Act----\n\n  Which is the Universal Provisions Act.\n\n     including the definition of universal service. The Joint \n     Board shall, after notice and public comment, make its \n     recommendations to the Commission no later than 9 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  In other words, this joint board is going to make the recommendations \nabout universal service to the FCC.\n  The FCC then:\n\n       . . . may periodically, but no less than once every 4 \n     years, institute and refer to the Joint Board a proceeding to \n     review the implementation of section 253 of that act and to \n     make new recommendations, as necessary, with respect to any \n     modifications or additions that may be needed. As part of any \n     such proceeding, the Joint Board shall review the definition \n     of, and adequacy of support for, universal service and shall \n     evaluate the extent to which universal service has been \n     protected and advanced.\n\n  In paragraph (b), the Commission then is told to act.\n\n       The Commission shall initiate a single proceeding to \n     implement recommendations from the initial Joint Board \n     required by subsection (a) . . .\n\n  And then it is supposed to complete this proceeding within a year \nafter the date of enactment of this act.\n  So this joint board is going to be making a very important \nrecommendation about how we maintain this universal service that our \nconsumers, our taxpayers, ratepayers, voters out there have grown \naccustomed to.\n  All this amendment does is say that the joint board should have on it \na single consumer representative. It is something that I understand is \na philosophical problem of specifying what each one of these members \nare going to look like and which political parties and how many \ncorporations.\n  This merely says one individual. It is the same language that is in \n1555, the House bill. If there is going to be a tabling motion, I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against tabling. This is a proconsumer vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the motion to table \namendment 1344 offered by the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey]. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 45, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 260 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n  So the motion to table the amendment (No. 1344) was agreed to.\n                           Amendment No. 1313\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Kerrey amendment \nNo. 1313.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment would go into the bill, for \ncolleagues who are checking the language out, on page 116. And it \nrefers to the duty to subscriber. Well, it would add to the rate-of-\nreturn regulation elimination. In the third title of this bill, we are \nat the end of the transition. I do not know when that is going to be--\n3, 4 years, it could be sooner, depending upon the local area.\n  This amendment goes after those areas where you may still have some \nmonopoly constraint. We are going to move, again, for emphasis, so that \nSenators understand what this bill does. This bill preempts State \nlegislatures, State Governors, regulatory commissions that say you can \nno longer have rate-based return regulation. We are going to move to a \nprice cap system of regulation.\n  I happen to think price cap in almost all situations can be better \nthan rate-based. But there are some, Mr. President, where we could have \ntrouble. This amendment tries to address those situations by saying \nthat ``Nothing in this section shall prohibit the commission for \ninterstate services and States for interstate services from considering \nthe profitability or earnings of telecommunications carriers when using \nalternative forms of regulation other than the rate of return \nregulation.'' It does not say they have to. It says nothing in this law \nshall prohibit them from considering the profitability of the \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, residential and business consumer representatives and \ntelecommunications competitors alike support this legislation's goal of \nencouraging effective competition in the local telephone service \nmarket. However, what I am calling the monopoly telephone rate \namendment is necessary to protect ratepayers of noncompetitive \ntelecommunications services from experiencing multibillion dollar rate \nincreases for these services during the transition to effective local \ncompetition.\n  State regulators--that is to say, the National Association of \nRegulatory Commissioners; consumer representatives, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, the Consumer Federation of America, \nConsumers Union, the National Association of State Utility Consumer \nAdvocates, as well as business telephone users--that is to say, the \ncustomers of telephone companies, business users, the International \nTelecommunications Association--all are concerned about section 301 of \nthis bill.\n  In mandating price flexibility and prohibiting rate of return \nregulation, section 301 also prohibits State and Federal regulators \nfrom considering earnings when determining whether prices for \nnoncompetitive services are just reasonable and affordable, while the \nFCC and many State commissions have instituted various price \nflexibility plans, typically based upon the principles of price cap \nregulation. Almost all of those plans involve some consideration of \nearnings.\n  If regulators are prohibited from considering the earnings factor \nwhen determining the appropriateness of prices for noncompetitive \nservices, then the captive ratepayers of these services will be subject \nto billions of dollars in rate increases that regulators could \notherwise prevent.\n  The monopoly telephone rates amendment does not change the bill's \nprohibition on rate-of-return regulation, but would merely allow State \nand [[Page S8316]] Federal commissions to consider earnings when \nauthorizing the prices of those noncompetitive services.\n  The ratepayer stake in the monopoly telephone rates amendment is \ndramatically demonstrated by reviewing the role of earnings within the \nregulatory structure for the 4-year period from 1991 to 1994. During \nthat period, if the regulators of both interstate and intrastate \noperations of the local telephone companies had been prohibited from \nconsidering earnings when approving rates under their price cap plans, \nthe excess revenue over existing authorized rate levels could have \neasily exceeded $18 billion. In other words, if S. 652 had become law \nin 1991, telephone ratepayers of noncompetitive services--and I keep \nemphasizing that where you have competition, there is no problem--but \nratepayers in noncompetitive areas and services would have had to pay \n$18 billion more in telephone rates than they did between 1991 and \n1994. Future pocketbook hits will be even higher unless this \nlegislation is amended.\n The monopoly telephone rates amendment provides a safeguard against a \nrate impact for the future.\n\n  A recent study by Montgomery Associates, located in Massachusetts, \nestimated the rate impact over the next 4 years of S. 652, if its \ncurrent form were enacted. Based upon an examination of regulatory and \nindustry data, the study conservatively estimates that local rates \nwould increase by $6 per month over the next 4 years.\n  The monopoly telephone rates amendment recognizes it is highly \nappropriate that State regulators continue to have a role in \ndetermining the appropriate price of noncompetitive services in their \nStates, and in so doing, have the discretion to consider the earnings \nof the local telephone company. Approximately 75 cents of every dollar \nconsumers spend on their overall telephone bills is for calls made \nwithin their State. As we learned when deregulating other industries, \nthe legislative goal of local telephone competition advanced in this \nlegislation will not be achieved overnight. In the interim, State \nregulators and legislatures will continue to be responsible for \nensuring quality service and fair rates for noncompetitive telephone \nservices. Their hands will be tied if Congress strips them of the \nauthority to even look at the company's earnings before considering the \nprice level of noncompetitive services.\n  At a time when the Federal Government is committed to better \nrecognize the appropriate role of local government in assessing and \nprotecting the citizens of its State, it makes no sense to handicap the \nStates as they promote the emergence of competition in local telephone \nmarkets.\n  As the chairman of the Vermont Public Service Board recently \ndescribed in testimony before the Judiciary Committee on antitrust \nbusiness rights and property rights:\n\n       In truly competitive markets, prices are the result of the \n     forces of supply and demand and don't need to be regulated at \n     all. However, because local exchange, ancillary services, and \n     interLATA toll markets are at best partially competitive, \n     regulatory oversight is still needed and--no one expects this \n     situation to be remedied within the next 12 months.\n       How are prices in these markets to be set? They necessarily \n     involve the careful consideration of each provider's rate of \n     return on noncompetitive services. A judgment about that rate \n     of return must underlie the initial determination of the \n     starting prices allowed. How else can regulators determine \n     whether the prices charged for their noncompetitive services \n     are ``just and reasonable,'' or whether excessive revenues \n     from such services will be available to subsidize competitive \n     service and keep out potential competitors?\n\n  The monopoly telephone rates amendment, Mr. President, recognizes \nthat the earnings of local telephone companies are formidable. Each of \nthe 7 Baby Bells is among the Fortune Top 50, with most in or \napproaching to the Fortune Top 20 list.\n  According to the most recently available statistics from the FCC, \nStatistics of Common Carriers, 1993-94 edition, those local telephone \ncompanies required to report their earnings to the FCC billed $90 \nbillion in rates for 1993 and had net earnings of more than $5 billion.\n  Since the competition we strive for in this legislation will not \nbecome an instant reality, the monopoly telephone rates amendment \nrecognizes the need to provide State and Federal officials with the \ntools necessary to ensure that the noncompetitive service of the local \ntelephone companies are not priced at excessive levels. Accordingly, I \nurge my colleagues to support the monopoly telephone rates amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank my colleague \nfrom Nebraska for his very eloquent and strong voice on the floor of \nthe Senate for the past several days, especially in behalf of consumers \nin this country; especially in behalf of making sure there is, in fact, \nreal competition.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today to address what I consider \nthe merits and the faults of what may be one of the most important \neconomic development bills this session of Congress will consider, \nnamely, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act.\n  Mr. President, we have had some enlightening discussions and some \nsolid disagreements on this bill. But this much, I think, all of my \ncolleagues could agree on: The debate we have had on this bill has \nopened all our eyes to the dazzling world of possibilities provided by \nour emerging information technologies.\n  It is a world that, at least from my perspective, appears to have \nvirtually no limits in terms of the potential for bettering the health, \neducation, and economy of the residents of my State of Minnesota.\n  I can imagine workers in rural Minnesota telecommuting to and from \nwork as far away as New York or Washington without ever having to leave \ntheir homes or families. Or schoolchildren in a distressed Minneapolis \nschool district reading the latest publications at the Library of \nCongress via thin glowing fiber cables. That excites me as a teacher.\n  Or rural health care providers on the Iron Range, consulting with the \ntop medical researchers at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester to better treat \ntheir patients.\n  I can imagine, Mr. President, things like these, but I do not have \nto. Already, communication miracles like these are occurring with \ngreater frequency across our Nation. It is fascinating to live in such \nexciting times. I think there is a consensus among Senators on both \nsides of the aisle on this question.\n  Mr. President, this bill presents the elected representatives of our \nStates with a particularly exciting and at times daunting \nresponsibility. How do we help dissolve the current artificially \ndivided and fragmented telecommunications industry to nurture the rapid \ndevelopment of these types of communications, while ensuring that these \nservices remain available, and I think the Senator from Nebraska has \nsaid this over and over again, and affordable to everyone in the \nNation, not merely the most privileged and wealthy.\n  How do we ensure that this bill benefits not just the multibillion-\ndollar alphabet soup of corporations--IBM, MCI, AT, TCI, GTE, ABC, \nand the rest--but the consumers of St. Paul, and Mankato, Fergus Falls, \nand Duluth, MN. How do we guarantee, Mr. President, fairness, access, \nand affordability in the telecommunications industry?\n  We have had several opportunities already. For example, last week the \nSenate, to its great credit, refused to strip away provisions to keep \ntelecommunication rates low for schools and hospitals. I am proud to \nsay that I and a majority of my distinguished colleagues voted to \ndefend those protections.\n  With that vote I believe we took a major step toward keeping our \ncommunication technologies affordable for future generations, as well \nas reaffirming the primacy of the consumer in this debate.\n  Monday night the Senate voted to approve an amendment that I believe \nwill help keep adult-oriented cable video programs away from children. \nAgain, I am proud to say I cast my vote in support of a measure to \nensure that such programming be fully scrambled before entering the \nconsumer's household, giving those who know best, the parents, the \nability to control the flow of new services into the home.\n  I am saddened, however, Mr. President, that the Senate has chosen now \nto table a measure that I and many of my colleagues believe is central, \nabsolutely central, to this entire debate of [[Page S8317]] competition \nand consumer protection: Providing a role for the Department of Justice \nto keep telephone monopolies from reassembling themselves.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to the debate on this issue and I \nthank my colleagues for some stimulating and insightful comments on \nthis subject. Some of my colleagues say that these protections, such as \nproviding consumers a voice in the process through the Department of \nJustice, or other amendments that my colleague from Nebraska has \nintroduced over and over again to make sure that the consumers are at \nthe table and that there is a voice for consumers, some of my \ncolleagues have said that this is too much, too bureaucratic, too \ninefficient to enable businesses to compete.\n  I ask these same colleagues, after you remove the protections against \nhuge rate increases, against monopoly, against service just for the \nprivileged, what would you replace them with? Words, Mr. President. \nPromises, guarantees, reassurances that this time, although many of \nthese companies have misbehaved in the past, and have been fined \nrepeatedly for violating promises to protect consumers, this time the \ncorporations promise to behave themselves and to conduct themselves in \nthe consumer's best interest.\n  Mr. President, I have said it before, and I will say it again. I do \nnot buy it. I would rather put my trust in solid protections, written \nin law, to make sure that rates remain affordable, services are \navailable for everyone, and no one is left behind in the stampede for \ncorporate profits.\n This extends across the board: Let me make it clear that I intend to \nfight efforts to strip out of this bill any consumer protections that \nensure affordability, fairness, and access in local and long distance \nphone service and cable TV. Unfortunately, many of the strongest \nconsumer protection amendments have been defeated to date.\n\n  I have noticed a lot of lobbyists out in the halls these days; \nlobbyists that as my colleagues know too well are just outside those \ndoors. For the benefit of the Record, Mr. President, let me take a \nmoment and tell America who is out there: NYNEX is out there, Mr. \nPresident, and so is Time-Warner, and Ameritech, and Northern Telecomm, \nBell South and Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell, Sprint and General \nElectric and Gannett--they are all out there, Mr. President. It has \nbeen called Gucci Gulch in the past, maybe this time we should call it \nCell-Phone Canyon. There can be no mistaking it; there are billions and \nbillions and billions of dollars at stake in this bill.\n  But there is something else at stake here--something much more \nimportant than all the billions and billions and billions of dollars. \nThe fate of the American consumer is at stake here, I urge my \ncolleagues to remember their needs, and their voice, in the coming \ndebate and amendments.\n  For this reason I support this Kerrey amendment, as I have past \nKerrey amendments. I believe that what is lacking is where do the \nconsumers fit in? Where is their voice? Where are their advocates? Do \nthey get an opportunity to sit down at the table? And will, in fact, we \nhave true competition as opposed to monopoly?\n  I hope the Cell-Phone Canyon out there does not dominate the final \nvote on these key amendments and the final vote on this piece of \nlegislation. I hope the vast majority of consumers who are not out in \nthese halls are the ones who in the last analysis we listen to.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We are prepared to endorse this, to accept this \namendment. Let me say to our friends that our bill has been endorsed by \nthe White House Conference on Small Business--by small businessmen \nacross the country--and consumers are interested in this bill. I have \npredicted that consumer prices will drop dramatically for telephone \ncalls and cable television, just as they dropped when we deregulated \nnatural gas, just as they dropped when cellular phones were \nderegulated.\n  In any event, we are prepared to accept this amendment. Mr. \nPresident, I urge the adoption of the Kerrey amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1313) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, now the Senate is open for business. Do \nwe have Senators who wish to offer amendments?\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation. Senator Kerrey has \nanother one? Great. I have been waiting eagerly for his amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I say to the chairman and ranking member \nof the committee, I have some amendments filed. I am not sure I am \ngoing to bring them all up. I filed them under the cloture rules. Some \nI am not quite sure I want to bring up. My understanding is under the \ncloture rules, each Member has an hour to talk. At some point, I am \ngoing to want to make a closing statement.\n  I know I control some time. I just want to make sure I reserve about \n30 minutes so I can make a final statement.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend would be willing, perhaps he can begin to \nstate them now and if he were in the proper mood, then when an \namendment came to the floor we could set the speech aside and hear the \namendment?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is an unusual request. I will take a different \ncourse. I will take the road less traveled.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let me observe each Member should not feel \nobligated to take their hour.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I think the bill is moving very nicely. But we do have \na number of amendments filed, I think particularly in certain areas. We \nare eager for Senators to bring their amendments. I do not see any \nSenator on the floor. We are open for business and are going to try to \nstack votes at 2 o'clock, now. Any Senator having an amendment, please \nbring it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1310\n\n(Purpose: Clarifies that pricing flexibility should not have the effect \n   of shifting revenues form competitive services to noncompetitive \n                               services)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1310.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 112, at the end of line 17, insert the following \n     sentence: ``Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this \n     section shall be for the purpose of allowing a regulated \n     telecommunications provider to respond fairly to competition \n     by repricing services subject to competition but shall not \n     have the effect of shifting revenues from competitive \n     services to non-competitive services.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Once \nagain, it references title III. Title III is a section where we \ndescribe how we are going to end regulation. It is a section where we \ncome in very directly, and make the transition to a competitive pricing \nsituation.\n  For citizens, consumers, taxpayers, voters and everyone else trying \nto figure out what this bill is all about, we currently allow local \ntelephone companies to set prices based upon a rate-of- return \nmethodology. Most of the States are set up that way. We are moving to \nprice caps. States are beginning to experiment with price caps, even \nwith restrictions on them.\n  We are going to make a transition to a different method of pricing, \neventually allowing the price to be set upon the cost of the service \nthat is being provided. The language of title III lays out a framework \nfor transition from a rate-based-rate-of-return system to a price cap \nsystem.\n  This amendment simply adds to the description under ``in general''--a \nparagraph that makes certain that:\n\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\n       Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this section \n     shall be for the purpose of allowing a regulated \n     telecommunications provider to respond fairly to competition \n     by repricing services subject to competition but shall not \n     have the effect of shifting revenues from competitive \n     services to non-competitive services.\n\n  Mr. President, this is merely language under the general section of \nsection 301, that attempts to say let us make certain that we do not \nhave any language in this bill that permits the pricing and the \nshifting of revenues from a competitive situation to a noncompetitive \nsituation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, looking at this amendment with respect \nto the phrasing in the purpose whereby in pricing flexibility and \nresponding to competition by repricing services the intent as I \nunderstand it is that you not raise the noncompetitive services. When \nyou say shifting revenues or raising costs, then you get into the \nconcern about cost-based operations whereby I think the intent here is \nwhen you say shifting revenues--that is what is disturbing to this \nSenator.\n  Is it the case that what the Senator is trying to say is that as you \nrespond to that pricing flexibility, and you are responding to the \nrepricing services competition that you do not raise competitive rates?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I mean noncompetitive.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is correct; that we do not end up with \nnoncompetitive rates.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1310, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I failed to ask unanimous consent to \nmodify this amendment. It says page 112 and it should be page 113.\n  So I ask unanimous consent for that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1310), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, at the end of line 17, insert the following \n     sentence: ``Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this \n     section shall be for the purpose of allowing a regulated \n     telecommunications provider to respond fairly to competition \n     by repricing services subject to competition but shall not \n     have the effect of shifting revenues from competitive \n     services to non-competitive services.''\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if I may ask the author of the amendment \na couple of questions about the amendment, as I understand it, \n``Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this section shall be for \nthe purpose of allowing a regulated telecommunications provider to \nrespond fairly to competition by repricing services subject to \ncompetition but shall not have the effect of shifting revenues from \ncompetitive services to non-competitive services.''\n  Why would the Senator want to prevent a company from shifting from \ncompetitive services to noncompetitive? First of all, what does the \nSenator mean?\n  Mr. KERREY. Generally speaking, what I am trying to do with the \nlanguage, I say to the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. President, is to \nprevent a continuation of a pricing scheme that allows a shifting of \nrevenue and in a noncompetitive environment prices to be higher than \nthey otherwise would be. That is the intent.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. What does the Senator consider competitive services to \nbe?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I consider this to be one of the most \nimportant questions that should be asked repeatedly on the floor. I \nconsider competitive service to mean a choice. When I as a consumer--\nwhether I am a business person, whether I am in my household, \nregardless of where I am--I have choice.\n  I do not like the service that the company is providing. I do not \nlike the price. So I am going to shift and go someplace else. I have \nalternatives to what I have right now. Right now, I have very few \nalternatives at the local level.\n  It is a very important question. What will happen, I suspect, \ninitially is that you are going to get competition at the higher end, \nas we currently do, in fact. We have, as the Senator knows, all kinds \nof competition coming into the local level, a relatively small percent \nof the overall pie, but we are starting to get competition at the local \nlevel at that higher end.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. What would be an example of a problem with a company \nshifting revenues from competitive services to noncompetitive services? \nGive me an example.\n  Mr. KERREY. The concern I have is that I can keep my noncompetitive \nprices higher than I otherwise would, that I could keep the prices in a \nnoncompetitive environment higher. If I am a company with, let us say, \n$1 billion of cash flow a year and the law now allows me at the local \nlevel to meet a competitive alternative and price in order to be able \nto get the business, and now I have that business, what I am concerned \nabout is shifting that revenue in a fashion that enables me to keep my \nnoncompetitive prices higher than I otherwise would. That is the intent \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. But the way the amendment reads, it would have the \neffect of shifting revenues from competitive services to noncompetitive \nservices. Was the intent of that----\n  Mr. KERREY. Right. That is exactly right. Let us say I am the Acme \nTelephone Co., and I am currently given a regulatory monopoly at the \nlocal level. If I am the CEO of that company and I am performing for my \nshareowners, I am sitting there right now saying I have all kinds of \ncompanies that are coming into my local market. They are trying to get \nmy high-end users. So I go to that high-end business user and say I \nwill meet that price. I am now liberated in a competitive environment. \nI will meet that price.\n  What I am trying to do with this language is to prevent the use of \nthat kind of revenue to keep, in an artificial fashion, the price for \nthat noncompetitive service higher.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Does my colleague mean shifting cost or shifting \nrevenues? Because it would seem that it would be logical you were \nshifting costs.\n  Mr. KERREY. I mean shifting the cost of the service, the revenue that \nwould be required to be paid in that noncompetitive environment. So the \nnoncompetitive guy ends up paying a higher rate as a consequence of my \nbeing able now to go out and say I will meet the competition; I will \nlower the price; I will give you a lower price. This amendment attempts \nto prevent the use of that revenue in a noncompetitive environment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. On this amendment, I will have to oppose it because we \ndo not feel it does what the Senator seems to be saying it does. I am \nnot questioning the draftsmanship. But I wonder if our staffs could \ndiscuss it a little bit and see if we cannot--very frankly, we cannot--\n--\n  Mr. KERREY. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Quite understand because we think it means you are \ntrying to shift costs and also it would be very rare that a company \nwould want to shift competitive services revenues to noncompetitive \nservices revenues as far as we can see. But I would have to oppose this \namendment as it is presently drafted.\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be glad, Mr. President, in a quorum call to sit \ndown and look at the language in here. I understand there may be some \npotential confusion over precisely what it is doing.\n  I will say again for emphasis, the intent here is to make certain \nwhen we open up competition, we are basically saying to a company that \nright now is trying--I have heard the Senator from South Dakota talk \nabout it as well, so I think we are basically on the same wavelength. \nIf there is some confusion, it may be that in drafting this I have \n[[Page S8319]] created it. If the Senator is willing to identify a \nproblem, I am perfectly willing to modify the amendment to make the \nlanguage clear.\n  But my intent is to create a situation where we say to a local \ncompany, as I think we should by the way, OK, meet the competitive \nalternative. Go ahead and price your service and meet that competitive \nalternative. I just want to make certain in a noncompetitive \nenvironment the revenue stream does not end up being higher as a \nconsequence of liberating, allowing that competition to be met.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I would say before we go into a quorum call that we \nwelcome other amendments and speeches by Senators. The Senate is open \nfor business, and we will conceivably lay this aside if somebody else \ncomes with an amendment. And with that I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to address the Senate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 133 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, while it appears we do not have an \nimmediate amendment, we are reconciling differences, including one on \nuniversal services and otherwise.\n  While we are engaged in that negotiation, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Kerrey amendment \nNo. 1310.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 1310.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1310) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1307\n\n (Purpose: To require more than ``an'' interconnection agreement prior \n          to long distance entry by a Bell operating company)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1307.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 83, strike out line 12 and all that follows through \n     line 20 and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(b) Specific InterLATA Interconnection Requirements--\n       ``(1) In general.--A Bell operating company may provide \n     InterLATA services in accordance with this section only if \n     that company has reached interconnection agreements under \n     section 251 with telecommunications carriers that have \n     requested interconnection for the purpose of providing \n     telephone exchange service or exchange access service, \n     including telecommunications carriers capable of providing a \n     substantial number of business and residential customers with \n     telephone exchange or exchange access service. Those \n     agreements shall provide, at a minimum, for interconnection \n     that meets the competitive checklist requirements of \n     paragraph (2).\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this is an amendment to section 255 of the \nCommunications Act of 1934. I discussed it with the managers of the \nbill. I will briefly describe it.\n  The requirement of the current provision is an attempt to deal with \nactually section 251 as well by saying that my concern with 255 is that \nit might allow a local telephone company to get into interLATA after \nhaving satisfied in a very minimal fashion the interconnection \nrequirement either of the competitive checklist or of 251. The \nrequirement of the current provision should be satisfied as a local \ntelephone company reached an interconnection agreement with only a \nsingle telecommunications carrier, although in many markets a \nsubstantial number of carriers will request interconnection. Under the \ncurrent provision, a Bell company needs only a single entity requesting \ninterconnection without regard to whether the requesting company is \nweak, undercapitalized, or lacking in other expertise or business \nplanning.\n  This amendment would ensure that a local telephone company which \nenters into more than one interconnection agreement, that the agreement \nincludes telecommunications carriers capable of serving a substantial \nportion of the business in a residential local telephone market. \nAlthough it could not ensure that competition will develop, it ensures \nthe interconnection agreements are reached before the long distance \nentry of the company capable of providing local services to both \nbusiness and residential customers.\n  This amendment would remedy a provision in the bill which concerns \nme, a provision which I believe is very dangerous and susceptible to \ninterpretation in a manner counter to the overall intentions of S. 652. \nUnder the current provision, a Bell operating company could gain entry \ninto the long distance market on the basis of one interconnection \nagreement with a competitor. It would not matter whether that \ncompetitor was weak, undercapitalized, or lacking either \nexpertise or a business plan--that one competitor could facilitate Bell \nentry into markets which at that time may, or may not, be competitive.\n  One of the goals of this bill is to open the door, to provide \nincentives to facilitate local competition. Unless amended, this \nprovision may counter that intended goal, in fact removing incentives \nfor the Bells to reach agreement quickly with their strongest potential \ncompetitors. If the Bells think that they can gain entry without having \nto complete more than one agreement, we are in fact inviting them to \ngame the process. Instead of helping to facilitate local competition, \nthey might gain entry at a time when they still monopolize their local \nmarkets, perhaps both stunting the development of local competition and \nendangering the gains that have been made over the past decade in the \nincreasingly competitive long distance industry.\n  This amendment would clarify the current provision and move it into \nline with the bill's overall intentions by ensuring that a BOC enters \ninto more than one interconnection agreement and by ensuring that those \nagreements are reached with telecommunications carriers capable of \nserving a substantial portion of the business and residential loop \ntelephone markets. This clarification strengthens the incentives and \nthe conditions for competition to develop.\n  The requirement in the current provision could be satisfied after a \nBOC reached an interconnection agreement with only a single \ntelecommunications carrier, although in many markets it is probable \nthat a substantial number of carriers will request interconnection. \nUnder the current provision, a BOC need reach agreement with only a \nsingle entity requesting interconnection, without regard to whether the \nrequesting company is weak, undercapitalized, and lacking either \nexpertise or a business plan.\n  The amendment would ensure that a BOC enters into more than one \ninterconnection agreement and that the agreements include \ntelecommunications carriers capable of serving a substantial portion of \nthe business and residential local telephone markets. Although this \ndoes not ensure that competition will develop, it does ensure that \ninterconnection agreements are reached before long distance entry with \ncompanies capable of providing local service to a substantial number of \nboth business and residential customers.\n  Mr. President, it is a pretty straightforward, clarifying amendment. \nAs I have said on a number of occasions, as the managers have as well, \nthis piece of legislation is unprecedented. We are \n[[Page S8320]] trying to manage a transition from a current regulated \nmonopoly into a competitive arena. It is very difficult to do. What we \nhave established is in section 251, be it a long distance company or \nother carrier, it can be anybody who wants to get into local business, \nthey can either negotiate an agreement or satisfy, I believe, 10 things \nin section 251; that is to say, the Communications Act of 1934, section \n251. Once they have satisfied those agreements--they have to satisfy \nthose agreements in order to satisfy the law--251 describes what they \nhave to do when somebody comes and says, ``I want to get into local \nservice, I want to approach your customers.'' Section 251 says what \nthey have to do.\n  In addition, in 255, there is a 14-part competitive checklist before \nthe local Bell company can get into interLATA to provide long distance \nservice. This amendment provides language to make certain that we do \nnot end up with an application occurring after having satisfied a \nminimal requirement. In other words, I have competition but it is a \nrelatively small company. They really are not effective competition. \nThis attempts to strengthen the competitive requirement prior to the \nFCC giving interLATA approval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I request that the clerk read the \ncurrent provision on line 12, most specifically the interLATA \ninterconnection requirement, just the first paragraph as it appears in \nthe bill as it appears now. I believe there is one change in it. I want \nto make sure that is the case.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, which page are you going to read?\n  Mr. STEVENS. This is page 83, which is the current specific \nrequirement pertaining to section 251. I just want to see if the bill I \nhave is the same as the one that is before the clerk. Are there any \nchanges?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There have been no changes to the bill on that \npage.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on that page is the requirement, \nspecifically the interLATA interconnection requirement, which \nspecifically states that a Bell operating company may provide interLATA \nservices in accordance with the section only if that company has \nreached an interconnection agreement under section 251 and that \nagreement provides at a minimum for interconnection that meets the \ncompetitive checklist requirements of paragraph 2. Paragraph 2 is the \ncompetitive checklist. I am certain that the Senator from Nebraska and \nthe Senators involved in this debate know what is in that checklist.\n  What the Senator attempts to do with his amendment is to expand that \nagreement in a way that, in effect, as I understand his intent, will \npreclude any small company not capable of providing substantial \ncoverage for both business and residential customers in the exchange \naccess areas.\n  Under the circumstances, what that would do is really prevent the \ntransition from taking place as we envision it.\n  There is no question, as the Senator from Nebraska stated, we are \ngoing from a period of regulation both under the courts and under the \nFCC to a new type of regulation in which this checklist is one of the \npredominant features. Under the circumstances of the bill as it stands, \nsize is not material but compliance is. And it will take some time in \nthe transition period for that to happen.\n  This is one reason why we have opposed changes in the public interest \nsection of the bill, because it may well be that in this transition \nperiod there is going to be several different entities trying to get \nthrough the gate at the same time, so to speak. And the question of \npublic interest is going to weigh in terms of which of those entities \nshould be approved under this section of having met with the \nrequirement of the competitive checklist.\n  I think the Senator's amendment narrows that group that can be at the \ngate to be reviewed by the FCC and as such it would be restrictive of \ncompetition in the very essence, in the beginning, and therefore we \nwould oppose the Senator's amendment as changing the concept which is, \nagain I read, compliance under the bill is that the agreement provides \nat a minimum for interconnection, it meets the requirements of the \nchecklist, the competitive checklist. This adds to the minimum, saying, \nin effect, that you have to have size, a large enough carrier that is \ncapable of providing a substantial number of business and residential \ncustomers within the telephone exchange or exchange access service. \nUnder the circumstances, the Senator from Nebraska limits those who can \nget to the gate first. It says the only ones that can get to the gate \nfirst are the large carriers.\n  Mr. KERREY. No.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is my contention. Until the Senator disabuses me of \nthat, I intend to move to table his amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me read the language. Certainly I \nbelieve the language is clear on that point. I am not trying to \npreclude at all. You can still have a small carrier, a very small \ncompany come in and be given the interconnection requirement at the \nlocal level. It would be less likely to happen. This amendment does not \nsay that that company is precluded. It does not use the language \n``preclude'' at all. It says interconnection for the purpose of \nproviding--only if that company reaches ``interconnection agreements \nunder section 251 with telecommunications carriers that have requested \ninterconnection for the purpose of providing telephone exchange service \nor exchange access service, including telecommunications carriers \ncapable of providing a substantial number of business and residential \ncustomers.''\n  What it is attempting to do--and I left the language relatively \ngeneral, in fact, because what I am trying to do, I say to the Senator \nfrom Alaska, what I am trying to do is to make sure--we tried earlier \nunsuccessfully. In fact, I have a couple other amendments that I do not \nbelieve I am going to send to the desk refighting the battle over \nwhether or not the Justice Department should be the arbiter of whether \nor not there is competition.\n  In S. 1822, last year's bill, what we said was that once the \nDepartment of Justice has determined there is local competition, the \nlocal company then can do long distance. That was the method by which \nwe made certain that there was local competition prior to the company \ngetting into long distance. That was the idea.\n  Well, now what we have done is replaced the Department of Justice \ndetermination with a checklist so that we have this checklist and we \nhave language in 251 that allows for these interconnections.\n  Well, what this simply does is it tries to make sure we get a little \nmore certainty of competition because the FCC does not make any \njudgment about competition other than the connection. The FCC takes the \n14-point checklist. The FCC has to certify that the checklist has been \nsatisfied and that the company has reached an interconnection agreement \nunder section 251 that provides at a minimum for interconnection that \nmeets the competitive checklist requirements.\n  I understand that it says at a minimum, and there needs to be more. \nWhat this attempts to do is bulk that up and describe something a bit \nmore than what is required currently under 251.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator is finished, let me state \nthat as it is, as I see it and my adviser, Earl Comstock, sees it, we \nagree that the impact of this could be that a Bell operating company \ncould not enter the service area, interLATA, if there was a carrier \nseeking to provide service and had met the minimum requirements of the \nchecklist, the competitive checklist but was a small carrier. As a \nmatter of fact, as I said, I think there could well be several small \ncarriers at the gate, plus there could be a larger carrier at the gate \nand the question would be in terms of the public interest who would be \ninvolved in getting approval under section 251. But as a practical \nmatter the Bell company cannot come in until someone provides that \nservice. The Senator's amendment raises the threshold on the level of \nthat service and as such will say the Bell companies cannot come in \nuntil there is a substantial competitor there to provide the service.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I tried to explain that before but I apparently did not \nget the [[Page S8321]] communication correctly as far as the Senator \nfrom Nebraska is concerned. That is precisely what we are trying to \navoid. We want to make sure that the checklist is met at a minimum and \nthe public interest provision comes in at that point. The FCC might \ndelay a smaller company if there is another one coming through the \nprocess that would provide a greater service in the area involved. I \nthink that the Senator would understand that. But as a practical matter \nwe do not look at size as being determinative of whether or not the \nBell company could enter the area and provide service in the interLATA \narea.\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY. What the bill does not do, as I read it, is give me at \nleast confidence in the 14-point checklist. What it says is--Mr. \nPresident, 255 is the new section. It is actually called section 221 in \nthe bill, but it creates a new section 255 in the 1934 act, and it is \ncalled interexchange telecommunications services, but it is the point \nwhere we were removing the restrictions that are currently in place.\n  Currently, a local company cannot do long distance. What this does is \nsays here are the terms and circumstances under which it can do long \ndistance.\n  We fought the battle yesterday saying that I thought that the test \nthat was in last year's legislation, S. 1822, and I think it was H.R. \n3626, the House bill, that the test there was the right one; it had the \nDepartment of Justice determine the competition, and when there is no \nsubstantial possibility that the monopoly could use their power to \nimpede competition, have at it. Go to it. Let the Department of Justice \nmake that determination.\n  We lost that battle. Now what I am attempting to do is to say that \nthe language, as I read the current language in the bill it sets \nspecific interLATA interconnection requirements under, whatever it is, \n(b) of section 255, specific interLATA interconnection requirements. \nThere are two sections, two paragraphs in there that are important. The \nfirst one is the general paragraph which this amendment replaces, and \nthe second one is the competitive checklist.\n  The current general paragraph says a Bell operating company may \nprovide interLATA, do long-distance service, in accordance with this \nsection only if that company has reached an interconnection agreement \nunder section 251 and that agreement provides at a minimum for \ninterconnection that meets the competitive checklist requirements of \nparagraph 2.\n  As I read this, what I can do, if I am a Bell company, and let us say \nI have 50 people applying to go into interconnection, all I have to do \nis get one of them on line. I could have relatively stable competition. \nI just do not get into an agreement with them. I wish to get into long \ndistance.\n  What I am trying to do is to make sure that I have that competitive \nchoice at the local level before permission is granted. And so I do not \nsay in my substitute paragraph that any company is precluded from an \ninterconnection agreement under section 251. It says instead that ``a \nBell operating company may provide interLATA service in accordance with \nthis section only if that company has reached''--which is in the \nlanguage here--``only if that company has reached an interconnection \nagreement under section 251''--all that is the same as the paragraph I \nam replacing--``with telecommunications carriers.'' And here is where \nit differs: ``Telecommunications carriers that have requested \ninterconnection for the purpose of providing telephone exchange service \nor exchange access service, including telecommunications carriers \ncapable''--it does not say it is going to preclude anybody. It just has \nto include ``carriers capable of providing a substantial number of \nbusiness and residential customers with telephone exchange or exchange \naccess service.''\n  It says these agreements shall provide at a minimum the competitive \nchecklist which is also in this other language. It does not say any \ncompany is precluded. It does not in fact say it has to be x percent of \nthe market or anything like that.\n  It just says that it has to be more than a relatively small company \nthat does not really provide that competitive alternative for that \nconsumer, that customer, that household at the local level.\n  The Senator from Alaska may still move to table. I hope not, based \nupon the language precluding a small company from still coming--a small \ncompany could still come and be allowed under the interconnection \nagreements of 251 to interconnect at the local level. This means I need \na little bit more than a small company before the interLATA approval is \ngranted.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's intent. I call \nhis attention to the provision of subsection (g) of 251 on page 25:\n\n       A local exchange carrier shall make available any service, \n     facility, or function provided under an interconnection \n     agreement to which it is a party to any other \n     telecommunications carrier that requests such interconnection \n     upon the same terms and conditions as those provided in the \n     agreement.\n\n  We interpret that section to mean if there is a small carrier \ninvolved and it comes into the area, which means the Bell carrier can \nthen enter long distance, that other carriers can come in easily; as a \nmatter of fact, they would not have to comply with 251.\n  The problem is that as we see it in rural areas where only a small \ncarrier may seek the interconnection to provide competing local service \nin the beginning, it means that that small carrier cannot enter this \npicture until there is a larger carrier that would be able to handle \nthe substantial test of the Senator's amendment. The Senator's \namendment would require that you have a carrier capable of providing \nservice to a substantial number of businesses and residential \ncustomers. Obviously, the small carrier cannot do that.\n  One is looking at the test for the Bell companies; the other is \nlooking at the test for entry. We believe the predominant issue in \nregard to 251 is that there be no requirement other than the minimum \ncompliance with the competitive checklist, as provided in subparagraph \n(2) of subsection (b) that I read from section 251.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I understand the concern, but the larger \nconcern, I believe, still remains, which is expressed by the findings \nin the bill and the description of the bill of what it is attempting to \ndo, which is: We want to make sure we have competition before we get \ninto long distance. That is the idea.\n  Currently, if I am a consumer, a household in Omaha, NE, I have one \nchoice. That is what I have. My telephone company wants to get into \nlong distance. The intent here is before you get into long distance, \nyou get some competitive choice at the local level. If all I have to do \nis sign an interconnection agreement with one small company before that \noccurs, that hardly provides the kind of competitive choice, as I \nunderstand the intent of the bill.\n  I understand the Senator's concern about rural carriers, but I do not \nbelieve, at least as I read it, that the amendment precludes the \npossibility of a rural carrier, a smaller carrier interconnecting.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is, in our judgment, that the language \nof the bill, as it stands, provides an incentive to the long-distance \ncompanies, who are worried about Bell companies' entry into long \ndistance, to come forward and use the provisions of section 251 to \nnegotiate the interconnection agreements.\n  If they do not do that and a small carrier does come forward, it \nstill meets the requirements of this section and, therefore, it is sort \nof an incentive to the other long distance companies to come forward \nand get involved in the negotiations regarding section 251, in our \njudgment.\n  In any event, it adds a level to the threshold. It increases the \nminimum requirements that we have associated with compliance with the \nchecklist and, as such, it adds another burden to future competition, \nwhich is something that we disagree with the Senator on.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it unquestionably asks for a minimum \nrequirement. That is unquestionably true. I believe if this amendment \nwere adopted, it would be a reasonable substitute for the Department of \nJustice role. It makes sure you have competition. The concern ought not \nto be for most of these companies trying to figure out whether you have \ncompetition; [[Page S8322]] the concern really ought to be is there a \ncompetitive choice: Do I have in my residence in Omaha, NE, or do I \nhave in my residence in any other area a competitive choice?\n  It does not insert ``no substantial possibility'' language. It does \nnot insert any specific language. It just says that it has to be more \nthan a single, small interconnection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not my desire to limit in any way \nthe Senator's debate on this amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. I conclude my debate. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, again I say what the Senator from \nNebraska is looking for is something to increase the effective \ncompetition tests that are in this bill. The section we have been \ndebating, section 255(b)(1), sets a minimum requirement for the Bell \noperating companies to enter into interLATA services. We think that is \nsufficient, in view of the requirements of the checklist itself.\n  Unless the Senator wishes to make additional comments, I intend to \nmove to table his amendment, but I will be happy to let him have the \nlast word, if he wishes to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the last word merely is that the Senator \nfrom Alaska is right, I am not worried about the minimum requirement in \n255. I think it needs to be strengthened. This amendment does precisely \nthat, it attempts to strengthen the requirements of 255 prior to being \ngiven permission for interLATA service.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senators's definition is the difference between us.\n  I move to table Kerrey amendment No. 1307, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote on this motion to table occur at 2:30 p.m. today \nand that there be no second-degree amendments in order to the amendment \nprior to the vote on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in view of the fact that there is \napproximately an hour left, I ask unanimous consent to lay this \namendment aside until the time established for the vote on my motion to \ntable, in the hope someone might come forward with another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how long?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from California has two amendments. One is \nan amendment to the other. We have no objection to the motion she is \ngoing to make to consolidate those amendments.\n  If she wishes to take it up at this time, we would be happy to do so \non the basis of a time agreement, 30 minutes to be divided, 20 minutes \non the side of the proponent, 10 minutes over here, with no second-\ndegree or other amendments in order.\n  We will have a vote on or in relation to the amendment following the \nvote on the motion to table that has already been agreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be the agreement under which the \nSenator takes up this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Nebraska and I, Mr. President, have a \ncouple of amendments regarding the Internet that I think we can do in a \nrelatively short period of time.\n  I wonder if it might be possible for these two Senators to then \nfollow the amendment we just discussed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to my friend that we have \namendments already scheduled to come up for a vote at 2:30. It is our \nhope we will have this vote on Senator Boxer's amendment right after \nthat, and we would be pleased to take up your amendments following \nthat, if the Senator would like to do so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1340 and Amendment No. 1354\n\n        (Purpose: To preserve the basic tier of cable services)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor his courtesy he extended to this Senator and to the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Levin.\n  We are anxious to put our amendment forward. It is very \nstraightforward. I ask that my amendment numbered 1340 be modified by \nmy second-degree amendment, which is also at the desk, amendment No. \n1354.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I yield \nmyself, out of the 20 minutes, 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President there has been a lot of debate on this bill, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995. A lot of \nit is quite technical. A lot of it is difficult to follow.\n  I do believe that the amendment that the Senator from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, and I are proposing is quite straightforward.\n  What we want to do with this amendment is to protect--protect--the \npeople who currently have cable service from losing channels that they \nhave grown used to that are in their basic service.\n  We are very fearful that because of the changes made in this bill, \ncable companies will move certain channels out of their basic tier of \nservice, and the public that has grown used to this basic service will \nnow be forced to pay for these channels on a second tier.\n  For example, there are many viewers that in their basic service get \nstations like CNN or TNT. What we are fearful of--if we do not pass the \nBoxer-Levin amendment--is that cable companies will jettison stations \nlike CNN or TNT and tell the customers who have been receiving those \nprograms in their basic service that they will have to pay extra. Now \nCNN and TNT will go into another tier, and the people who have been \nwatching them will have to now pay more.\n  It is very straightforward. What we are saying is, if you want to \nreduce the level of service that you currently have as a cable \noperator, you first need to get approval from the local franchise \nauthority, which is usually the board of supervisors or the county \ncommissioners or the city council or the mayor.\n  So we are taking, I think, in this amendment, some commonsense steps. \nWe are saying before the competition fully comes in, and we look \nforward to that day, before the competition really comes in, for a \nperiod of 3 years--we have sunsetted this at 3 years--we want to \nprotect the people who rely on cable. We want to protect them so they \ndo not suddenly find themselves without channels that they have grown \nto rely on and, in addition, they would have to spend more money to \norder these channels in another tier of service.\n  I am very hopeful we will get broad bipartisan support for this \namendment. Because, whether Mrs. Smith or Mr. Smith lives in Washington \nor California or Michigan or South Dakota or Ohio, wherever they may \nlive, they [[Page S8323]] may be finding out that they will suddenly \nhave to pay more for programming they had on their basic rate.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what is going to happen to Senators. \nWhether they are from California or Michigan or South Dakota or Ohio--\nwherever they are from--they are going to get the call from that senior \ncitizen who has come to rely on that programming. They will say, \n``Senator, why did you not protect me? Why do I now have to pay extra \nmoney for CNN?'' Then, if you voted against Boxer-Levin, you will have \nto explain it. You will say, ``Well, Mrs. Smith, I thought competition \nwould come in and you would not get stuck.''\n  Mrs. Smith will say, ``Well, good, I will send you my bill. You pay \nit. Because you should have protected me at least in a transition \nperiod and I deserve that protection. By voting against the Boxer-Levin \namendment you left me exposed to a situation where I lose programming \nand suddenly have to pay more for it.''\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield 7 minutes \nto my friend from Michigan, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from California for \ntaking the initiative on this bill.\n  The amendment she is offering really, I believe, is intended to carry \nout the purpose of the bill. What the bill intends to do is deregulate \nthe rates on upper tiers. But as part of this compromise, it is \nintended that the basic rate--the basic tier continue to be subject to \nregulation by the local franchise authority. That is the structure of \nthis bill. Basic tier is going to continue to be regulated. The upper \ntiers are going to be deregulated. That, it seems to me, is quite an \nimportant decision on the part of the sponsors of this bill, and one \nthat is a very reasonable decision.\n  But the problem then becomes, since the upper tiers are deregulated, \nthe cable operator who currently shows, for instance, ESPN as part of \nthe basic tier and provides it as part of the basic rate would then \nhave an incentive to move ESPN to a higher tier and out of the basic \ntier, unless this amendment is adopted.\n  I believe the sponsors of the language in the bill would say it is \ntheir intent that the basic tier remain and that it remain regulated. I \nthink that is the intent of this bill. But there is a loophole which we \nshould close with this amendment. That loophole is that, since the \nupper tiers are deregulated and therefore price is deregulated and \ncable companies then can raise prices on upper tier, there would be an \nincentive to move channels that are currently provided as part of the \nbasic cable out of basic cable into the upper tier, unless there is at \nleast a period of a couple of years until competition comes in, which \nwill take care of this problem.\n  Competition is the answer. We all know that. The problem is there is \ngoing to be an interim period here, and that is why the Boxer amendment \nin its second-degree portion which is now part of the principal \namendment has a 3-year statute of limitations on this provision. We \nrecognize that competition is intended to correct this problem. But we \nalso recognize it is going to be a period of time before competition \neffectively can do that.\n  So, in order to avoid the, I believe, unintended consequence of \nsomeone who currently is given basic cable at a certain rate suddenly \nfinding the channels, that were previously part of that basic cable, \nstill subject to price regulation, are now shifted out of that basic \ncable into the unregulated upper tiers, this amendment is essential.\n  That is the heart of it. It is a fairly straightforward amendment. It \nis a very proconsumer amendment, but it is not only proconsumer. I \nthink it is also a way of our carrying out our commitment to our \nconstituents. And that commitment is we are going to continue to \nregulate the basic cable. Yes, the upper tiers are going to be \nderegulated but there is not going to be a surprise.\n  If you have been getting--and I emphasize ``if'' you have been \ngetting--ESPN, or CNN or whatever on your basic cable, you are not \ngoing to find suddenly that rug is pulled out from under you, those \nchannels are suddenly removed to a higher tier.\n  Unless we adopt something like this we are going to find our \nconstituents coming to us and saying, ``Wait a minute, I thought you \nsaid basic cable was going to continue to be regulated by the local \nfranchising authority. That was the representation you made. The local \nfranchise authority was going to continue to regulate basic cable. I \nhave been watching ESPN every night and all of a sudden, ESPN is not on \nmy basic cable anymore. What happened? That was supposed to continue \nregulated and now we find it is in the higher tier. My basic cable, \nwhich is all I get, does not have channels which I am accustomed to and \nwhich you folks said would continue to be regulated.''\n  So I think, in order for us to carry out what is the intention of \nthis bill, that it is necessary to have this transition amendment that \nthe Senator from California and I are offering to the Senate. Again, it \nis a way I truly believe that carries out the intent of the sponsors of \nthis bill and the basic compromise which they have reached, which is \nthat we are going to continue to regulate or allow the local franchise, \nmore accurately, to regulate the basic cable while we are deregulating \nthe upper tiers.\n  So, Mr. President, again, with the sunset provision, I think that \nwould address any concerns that regulation is going to continue after \nit is needed. It is not going to be needed when competition takes over \nbut there is this period we all know when competition cannot quite yet \ndo the job. It has been recognized in a number of ways in this bill. \nThis amendment would be, if adopted, another recognition of the reality \nthat, until competition comes in, we should have an interim period \nwhere we are going to protect consumers against the unintended \nconsequences which otherwise might occur.\n  I congratulate my friend from California. This is a straightforward \namendment. We hope the managers of the bill would accept this amendment \nbut, if not, we hope the Senate then would adopt it on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I yield the remainder of my time, if I have any, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, would the Chair inform the Senator how \nmuch time she has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask the Senator from South Dakota if he is going to \nspeak either in favor of or opposing the amendment of the Senator?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will be opposing the amendment. I ask the Chair, how \nmuch time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the 10 minutes that was \nallocated.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The parliamentary situation is that there is a vote \nscheduled at 2:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a vote scheduled at 2:30 p.m., \ntabling the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, I will be speaking against the amendment and I \nwill offer a motion to table at some appropriate time. I could do that \nnow and stack the vote, this next vote, if that would be agreeable to \nmy friend?\n  Mrs. BOXER. As long as the Senator from California has 9 minutes to \ncomplete a presentation, we have no objection and will be happy for the \nyeas and nays on the motion.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous-consent that it be in order at this \ntime, and may I ask unanimous consent that at 2:45, at the conclusion \nof the first vote, the Senate then proceed immediately, and I will make \na motion to table at that time, but that we continue to debate?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator repeat the unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. First of all, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the \nfirst vote, it be in order to move to table the Boxer-Levin amendment. \nSo we can have two back-to-back votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, there is no objection. \n[[Page S8324]] \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will speak against this amendment, if I may do so \nnow.\n  I yield myself, Mr. President, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote ``no'' on the \nBoxer-Levin amendment. The business of cable TV has been much debated, \nand we have settled on a bipartisan approach in the committee bill and \nit has been settled by the Dole and Daschle subsequent amendments and \nby leadership amendments. The cable TV issue should be left as it is in \nthe bill.\n  This amendment forbids a cable operator from taking any program \nservice off basic service without approval of the local franchising \nauthority. We feel strongly that would violate the spirit of the \nagreement that has been reached on a bipartisan basis regarding cable \ntelevision pricing and cable television servicing throughout the United \nStates.\n  The Cable Act of 1984 specifically forbids authorities from \nspecifying particular services to be carried. I am very touchy about \ngiving any authority the power to pick programming or the power of the \nmayor of the city, for example, to decide what is going to be in the \nlocal newspaper or what columns are going to be carried, and which \nnewspapers are going to operate in that city, or what comic strip \ncharacters are going to be allowed in that particular city, or what \neditorial writers are going to operate in that particular area.\n  The Cable Act of 1984 did so to protect the first amendment. It \nspecifically prohibited franchising authorities, and it did so to \nprotect the first amendment right to decide what to carry. This \namendment would take that away. It is a major reversal of longstanding \ncable policy that carefully balances the rights of cities and \noperators.\n  For instance, if a cable operator wanted to replace a home shopping \nservice with a news service, it could not do so without getting \napproval or, if it wanted to replace one classic movie channel with \nanother, it would be forbidden unless the city agreed.\n  The amendment is not needed to protect the channel location of local \nbroadcasters. They cannot be removed, in any case. The cable operator \nmust already carry local TV stations on the basic tier. It is not \nneeded to protect access channels on basic, either. The Cable Act \nrequires them to be carried on basic along with broadcast signals, and \ncities already can require these channels as a part of any franchise \nthat is granted.\n  This amendment would freeze certain programming lineups on smaller \nsystems for no good reason except to give cities editorial power over a \ncable operator's programming.\n  Mr. President, the cable agreement, or the agreements in relationship \nto pricing of cable television, have been worked out very laboriously \nin the committee, and again in the manager's amendment, and again in \nthe leadership amendment. I think we have the cable thing settled down, \nor at least I hope so.\n  The Boxer-Levin amendment supposedly prevents an operator from moving \na popular service from a regulated basic tier and offering it on a less \nregulated cable programming service--CPS--tier. But most such migration \nhas already occurred off the basic tier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair wishes to inform the Senator that he \nhas used 5 minutes of the 10 minutes.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Thank you very much.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand my friend has reserved 4 or 5 \nminutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 5 minutes left.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to at this time ask for 5 minutes so I may \nclose the debate on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate that very much, Mr. President.\n  I want to say to my friend from South Dakota that I thought he had a \nvery thoughtful response to the Boxer-Levin amendment. But I want to \ntake these issues one at a time in my hope that my colleagues are \nlistening to this debate because I am putting up a warning flag to my \ncolleagues that the first time a cable company moves CNN or TNT or ESPN \noff basic service, your phones are going to be lighting up. You are \ngoing to have to explain why you did not protect your people.\n  The answer that my friend from South Dakota puts forward is one that \nI take issue with. He says we have had a bipartisan approach to the \ncable part of this bill. It has been settled. With all due respect, I \nsay to my friend, it may well be that there are Senators who are not on \nthe committee of jurisdiction who may have thought of the problem that \nSenators on both sides of the aisle did not think about.\n  This amendment does no violence at all. I would characterize it as a \ntransitional ratepayer protection amendment. Why do I say transitional? \nIt only lasts for 3 years. If a cable company wants to rip off a cable \nchannel that you have been watching and you have been getting in your \nbasic tier, you have the ability to say to the local franchising \nauthority, please, take a look at this and see if it is fair.\n  I say to my friend from South Dakota, if he has a farming family in \nSouth Dakota and they are used to getting a certain program on their \nbasic tier, and they are not extremely wealthy, and they are paying $20 \na month for their basic service, and they love the channels in their \nbasic service and those channels are ripped away, then they have to pay \nanother say $l5 or $10 a month for those channels they were getting. I \nsay to my friend, the committee probably did not deal with that issue \nbecause I cannot imagine Senators want to have a situation where their \nphones are ringing off the hook.\n  Look, the Boxer-Levin amendment is supported by the Consumer \nFederation of America and it is supported by the Consumers Union. And I \nam saying that for the 3 years that this bill is working its way \nthrough, let us protect our consumers. Let us protect our ratepayers, \nwhatever State they happen to be in. It is a very simple process. It is \na very simple amendment. Yes, when we have real competition in the \ncable industry, there will not be any need for the Boxer-Levin \namendment. That is why we have sunsetted that amendment.\n  My friend is concerned about giving local government too much power. \nOn the one hand, I have my colleagues on the Republican side saying \nthat is where the power ought to be; not here in Washington but with \nthe local mayors, city councils, boards of commissioners, \nboards of supervisors because they are close to the people. And this \namendment, the Boxer-Levin approach, gives them the ability to protect \nthe people in their communities from being ripped off by a cable \ncompany, and having to pay more for something they always got in their \nbasic tier.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I yield myself my remaining 5 minutes. \nThat will give the Senator from California a chance to finish.\n  Let me say that I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Boxer-\nLevin amendment because we have resolved the cable television issue, we \nhave achieved a good compromise and a good settlement. But let me go on \nand say that the amendment supposedly prevents an operator from moving \na popular service in a regulated basic tier and offering it on a less \nregulated cable programming service, a CPS tier. But most such \nmigration has already occurred off the basic tier. Only a few mostly \nsmaller systems have large basic tiers. The Senate bill already \nprovides protection against higher prices on the CPS tier should an \noperator migrate services and seek a steep rate increase. I think that \nis called the bad actor provision that is in the legislation.\n  The amendment is not needed to protect the channel location of local \nbroadcasters. I have already pointed out that they are already there \nand under the must-carry provisions. It is not needed to protect access \nchannels on basic tier, either. The Cable Act requires them to be \ncarried on basic along with broadcast signals, and cities already can \nrequire these channels as part of any franchise that is granted.\n  The amendment freezes certain program lineups on smaller systems for \nno [[Page S8325]] good reason except it gives cities editorial power \nover a cable operator's programming.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I think the Boxer-Levin amendment is \nnot a good idea.\n  It is a regulatory idea. This is supposed to be a deregulatory bill. \nIt is said: What will the family do on the farm in South Dakota? I come \nfrom a farm in South Dakota. There is a direct satellite broadcasting \ncompetitive alternative. There is going to be a video dial competitive \nalternative. We are going to have the electric utilities able to get \ninto telecommunications. If we pass this bill, there is going to be so \nmuch competition and so many alternative voices and sources that prices \nare going to collapse. There are going to be more services available, \nand they are going to be competitive. We do not need regulation.\n  For example, if we look at what has shown up in the last few years, \nthe Learning Channel, the History Channel, even ``MacNeil/Lehrer'' has \nbeen sold to a private company and is going to make additional public \naffairs programs for profit.\n  Times are changing. There is more competition out there, more \nalternatives. The thinking of the 1950's and 1960's and 1970's and \n1980's that regulation will bring things to smaller cities and rural \nareas is not necessarily true. My State is a State of smaller cities \nand rural areas, but we will benefit greatly from the \ntelecommunications revolution. This bill will help small business and \nsmall towns. I have with me the signatures of 500 delegates to the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business--meeting this week here in \nWashington--telling about how much this telecommunications bill will \nhelp small business. More than 500 delegates to the White House \nConference on Small Business this week have written to President \nClinton urging him to support our reform bill, S. 652.\n  We have heard a lot in this Chamber about how corporate interests are \ninfluencing this, and so forth. Occurring at this moment over at the \nWhite House is the small business conference, and we have 500 of those \ndelegates who sent a petition urging that President Clinton support \nthis bill and that the Congress pass it quickly and that it not put \nmore regulation in it. But this amendment is for more regulation.\n  Mr. President, I will read into the Record portions of a letter to me \nfrom the small business owners of America:\n\n       . . . strongly urging you to enact legislation that will \n     open all telecommunications markets to full and complete \n     competition, ensuring that all Americans enjoy the lower \n     prices and innovative services that unfettered competition \n     will produce.\n       We are pleased to present you with copies of more than 500 \n     letters to President Clinton from delegates to the White \n     House Conference on Small Business seeking White House \n     support for Senator Pressler's Telecommunications Competition \n     Deregulation Act, S. 652 . . .\n       Of all the solutions offered, S. 652 best achieves the goal \n     of streamlined regulation, enhanced competition and consumer \n     protection. By opening the marketplace to all competitors on \n     equal terms and conditions, you will ensure vigorous \n     competition that will deliver economic growth, improve \n     services and lower prices to all Americans.\n       We urge you to pass this legislation in its present form \n     and without delay.\n\n  So they want this legislation, the small business people of America, \nand self-employed Americans. And I have heard some people talking about \nlobbyists out here. Of course there are lobbyists everywhere. They have \nthe right to petition our Government. But here, signing these letters, \nwe have 500 of the leading small businessmen of America gathered in \nPresident Clinton's offices for a conference. The small business people \nof America are for this bill. They do not support over-regulation such \nas the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of my time.\n  I did not know the small business people took a stand against the \nBoxer amendment, but I have to just say this to my friend. The Consumer \nFederation of America supports it, and there are 60 million cable \nsubscribers. And I say to my friend the minute a cable operator throws \na station off of the basic tier----\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield on the Senator's time. I do not have enough \ntime; I am sorry.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I did not specifically mean they were opposed to the \nBoxer-Levin amendment. They are for the bill and the Boxer-Levin \namendment would change the bill. But I should not say that they are \nagainst the Senator's amendment specifically.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I appreciate my friend clarifying \nthat on his time because I have so little time. I think it is important \nnot to confuse the debate. This is not about the whole bill, I say to \nmy friend from South Dakota. Let us not engage in overstatement. This \nis a small provision, a small provision that deals with one issue. It \nis a transitional amendment. It says let us protect the ratepayers for \n3 years, those people who sit in their homes and pay for cable and get \ncertain channels in their basic tier.\n  Under this bill, a cable company--and by the way, they are not a \n``bad actor'' if they do this because it is totally allowable under the \nbill--can knock out several of those channels, put them on another tier \nand charge you for it, and you are sitting there like a chump. I hope \nyou will call your Senator and ask that Senator if they voted for \nBoxer-Levin, because we will protect you. I think we are doing the \nright thing for the small business people. I think we are doing the \nright thing for the cable companies because they sometimes do not know \nwhat they are up against when they do this--the outrage that will \nfollow.\n  I am a Senator. I have served here for 3 years. I served in the House \nof Representatives for 10 years. I served on a local board of \nsupervisors for 6 years, and I swear when I go to a community meeting \nnow as a Senator people will raise their hand more about cable service \nthan almost anything else. Oh, they are interested in Bosnia. They care \na lot about the big global issues, of course. But nothing impacts their \ndaily life more, it seems to me, than what they bring to a Senator \nregarding their cable rates and the quality of their programming.\n  So I think we have a chance to stand up for the little people out \nthere who look forward to these programs. And, yes, maybe we are \nstepping on a few toes of the cable people. But I am not worried about \nthem. Do you know what they did, the cable companies? From 1984 to \n1992, when they were unregulated, they raised basic cable service rates \nby 40 percent. So at that time the same arguments were heard: Oh, \ncompetition is around the corner.\n  My friend talks about satellite dishes. I say to my friend from South \nDakota, maybe he does not know the numbers. But only one-half of 1 \npercent of consumers receive digital broadacast satellite service. So \nhe can talk about his people in South Dakota getting satellite service, \nbut only one-half of 1 percent can afford it.\n  Will they get it soon? Yes, they will get it soon. Yes, there will be \nmore competition. And I applaud that. I love the thrust of the bill, \nthat we are going to invite people in and have competition. But I have \nto warn my friends. Until that day that there is enough competition, \nthat the satellite dishes are affordable and everyone moves into this \nbusiness, you are going to get the calls from your consumers, whether \nthey are in Kentucky or California or North Carolina, South Carolina, \nIndiana, I do not care, Michigan, whatever.\n  Mr. FORD. Will the Senator yield for just 1 minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator from California used the rate increase of 40 \npercent. That was from GAO sending out a postcard and asking you to \nrespond. And only those responded that had a very low increased rate. \nSome areas went as high as 200 percent. And I can name those to you. So \n40 percent is a low figure. And I think we ought to remember that and \npay attention to the Senator's amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend so much. It means so much to me that he \nsees there is merit in this amendment.\n  Senator Levin and myself thought long and hard, and we decided it was \nimportant to stand up for the consumers, protect the consumers so the \ncable companies, just in this 3-year interim period, cannot pull out \nfrom under you a basic, important channel that you have grown used to, \nthat you have paid for in your basic service, and charge you more for \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  [[Page S8326]]\n  \n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend very much. I yield the floor at this \ntime. I hope Senators will support Boxer-Levin.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1307\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to urge my colleagues on both sides--\nif there are any amendments on this side, too--we want to try to \ncomplete action on this bill today. The chairman has indicated his \nwillingness to stay all night and keep the hours running. Thirty hours \nwill expire tomorrow at 4 p.m. If we stay all night that would be 4 \np.m. Or, if we can get an agreement to vote final passage by 12 noon \ntomorrow, otherwise, I think we may seriously consider the first \noption--staying all night.\n  I believe that most of the amendments will be tabled. I do not know \nof any serious amendments at all. Most of the amendments are on the \nother side. There are still some 50 amendments pending which is sort of \npar for the course, so far. But we hope that if people are serious \nabout their amendments, they will offer them today so that we can \ndispose of this.\n  The managers have been on the floor now for almost a week. They have \ndone an outstanding job on both sides. They are prepared to complete \naction on this bill late, late, late tonight. I urge my colleagues. \nMaybe some amendments will be accepted. I do not know what the status \nof many of these amendments are. But it would be our intention to table \nevery amendment from now on unless the managers indicate otherwise.\n  We are having a Republican conference. I will make that clear to them \nthat, if we are going to finish this bill, we have to have some \ndiscipline on this side to help table amendments for both managers of \nthe bill, not just the manager on this side.\n  So I urge my colleagues to finish today. If you want to agree to an \nagreement, we will have final passage no later than noon tomorrow. \nOtherwise, I will leave it up to the managers. The chairman has \nindicated to me that he prefers to stay here all night and dispose of \namendments between now and 4 o'clock tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nVermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while the distinguished majority leader is \non the floor, I note that many of us have been trying to work out a \ntime agreement. There is cooperation on both sides of the aisle. For \nexample, I am about to call up an amendment which will by \n[[Page S8327]] prearrangement have a second-degree amendment by \nSenators Exon and Coats. We will keep that on a relatively short time \nagreement, and we will wrap that one up. I will also be yielding to \nSenator Kerrey, who has an amendment which I understand is going to be \naccepted. Senator Breaux and I have been trying to work out one of the \nmajor issues, which I think both sides agree is a major issue that must \nbe debated, an intraLATA amendment, to try to see if we can reach an \narea of agreement by which we would speed that one up.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield, if I might, to the Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is there an amendment before the body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n                    Amendment No. 1310, as modified\n\n(Purpose: Clarifies that pricing flexibility should not have the effect \n  of using noncompetitive services to subsidize competitive services)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration, amendment 1310.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify the \namendment in accordance with the agreement of both managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \njust want to explain to the Members of the Senate that it is unusual to \nallow an amendment in this cloture situation, but we view this as \nduplicative; we already have cross-subsidization, but we do not think \nit changes the nature of the bill, and we are prepared to accept this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the \namendment, as modified.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1310, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 113, at the end of line 17, insert the following \n     sentence: ``Pricing flexibility implemented pursuant to this \n     section for the purpose of allowing a regulated \n     telecommunications provider to respond to competition by \n     repricing services subject to competition shall not have the \n     effect of using noncompetitive services to subsidize \n     competitive services.''\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1310), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask in a spirit of moving things along, I think there has \nbeen general agreement among the principals that we could have a time \nagreement on this matter and then a vote, and I would like to ask my \nfriend from Vermont if he is prepared to propose the unanimous consent \nagreement that we all had agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I will soon \npropose--let me just outline what I propose--we agree to have a 2-hour \ntime agreement evenly divided between the Senator from Nebraska and \nmyself on a second-degree amendment, with a 20-minute time agreement \nevenly divided between the Senator from Nebraska and myself on the \nunderlying Leahy, et al amendment, with the understanding, of course, \nthat either or both sides could yield back time.\n  So with that understanding, I ask unanimous consent that there be a \n2-hour time agreement on the Exon amendment evenly divided, at the \nexpiration of which or the yielding back of time there be a vote on or \nin relation to the Exon amendment, and then, if the Exon amendment is \nnot adopted, we go to the underlying Leahy amendment with a 20-minute \ntime agreement evenly divided, with a vote following on or in relation \nto it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. EXON. Merely a matter of clarification. Did I understand the \nSenator from Vermont to include that after we finish the 2 hours \nequally divided or yielded back, we would have a vote at the end of \nthat time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That was part of the unanimous consent, Mr. President; on \nthe understanding that if the Exon amendment was defeated, then, of \ncourse, we would go to the underlying Leahy amendment. If it was not, \nthen obviously the underlying Leahy amendment would be moot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, perhaps \nI should----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Let me add that no other amendments be in order prior to \nthe disposition of these amendments under the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I wonder if I should not try to reserve 10 minutes of \ntime within that in case some Senator, from whom we have not heard, \nfeels an irrepressible urge to make a speech.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Might I suggest this to the Senator from South Dakota, \nthat the two managers each have 5 minutes of that time.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Fine. I do not intend to use it, but someone may feel \nan irrepressible urge to make a speech.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That sometimes happens, Mr. President, in this body. It is \nrare, but it sometimes happens.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. The Senator will accommodate them.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I also reserve the right to object. I wish \nto just clarify that in all of that request the Senator from Indiana \nwill have an opportunity to speak on the contingency that--we are \noffering this together with the Senator from Nebraska, but on the \ncontingency that in the event the amendment, the Exon-Coats amendment \nis defeated, I would like to have 5 minutes or so of that time before a \nvote on the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. EXON. I am happy to agree to that.\n  Mr. COATS. I do not object.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I just want to be sure to protect the rights of \nSenators who may be in committee. They are having two or three markups. \nThis subject is of great concern to our Nation and to a lot of Senators \nwho may be in a markup at this moment who want to speak. I am sure the \nmanagers will work them in for 5 minutes and perhaps the Senator from \nIndiana could help allocate that time.\n  Mr. COATS. It is certainly not unheard of that Senators might have an \nirrepressible urge to speak on this or any other amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope as the time goes on perhaps the points will be made \nand we may be able to yield back time and not use it all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I wish to thank my fine colleague from \nIndiana for all the help he has been and for a lot of work we have put \nin on this. I would be glad to yield to him for whatever time he wants \nto begin debate or, if he wishes me to proceed, I will do so at this \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to start out this debate by reading a \nprayer that was offered by the Chaplain of the Senate on Monday, June \n12, that I hope will guide us once again. It was so much on point to \nwhat this Senator and the Senator from Indiana and others are \nattempting to do that I think it is worthy of repetition:\n\n       Almighty God, Lord of all life, we praise You for the \n     advancements in computerized communications that we enjoy in \n     our time. Sadly, however, there are those who are littering \n     this information superhighway with obscene, indecent, and \n     destructive pornography. Virtual but virtueless reality is \n     projected in the most twisted, sick misuse of sexuality. \n     Violent people with sexual pathology are able to stalk and \n     harass the innocent. Cyber solicitation of teenagers reveals \n     the dark side of online victimization.\n       Lord, we are profoundly concerned about the impact of this \n     on our children. We have learned from careful study how \n     children can become addicted to pornography at an early age. \n     Their understanding and appreciation of Your gift of \n     sexuality can be denigrated and eventually debilitated. \n     Pornography disallowed in print and the mail is now readily \n     available to young children who learn how to use the \n     computer.\n       Oh God, help us care for our children. Give us wisdom to \n     create regulations that will protect the innocent. In times \n     past, You have used the Senate to deal with problems of air \n     and water pollution, and the misuse of our natural resources. \n     Lord, give us courage to balance our reverence for freedom of \n     speech with responsibility for what is said and depicted.\n       Now, guide the Senators when they consider ways of \n     controlling the pollution of computer communications and how \n     to preserve one of our greatest resources: The minds of our \n     children and the future and moral strength of our Nation. \n     Amen.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the end of the quote of the Chaplain of the \nSenate that I referenced earlier.\n  If in any American neighborhood an individual were distributing \npornographic photos, cartoons, videos, and stories to children, or if \nsomeone were posting lewd photographs on lampposts and telephone poles \nfor all to see, or if children were welcome to enter and browse adult \nbook stores and triple X rated video arcades, there would be a public \noutrage. I suspect and I hope that most people, under those \ncircumstances, would immediately call the police to arrest and charge \nany person responsible for such offenses.\n  I regret to report that these very offenses are occurring everyday in \nAmerica's electronic neighborhood. It is not right to permit this type \nof activity in your neighborhoods and it is not right to ignore such \nactivities via a child's computer.\n  Section 402 of the Communications Decency Act, that I have just \noffered on behalf of myself and my colleague from Indiana, Senator \nCoats, a version of that, which has been slightly amended, was approved \nby the Senate Commerce Committee and added to S. 652, the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act that stands for a \nsimple proposition; that is, the laws which already apply to obscene, \nindecent, and harassing telephone use and the use of the mails should \nalso apply to computer communications. That is the heart and soul of \nour amendment.\n  Not only are children being exposed to the most perverted pornography \nand inappropriate communications, but adults are also being \nelectronically stalked and harassed.\n  I have had the opportunity to share with several Members of the \nSenate, on [[Page S8330]] both sides of the aisle, what I refer to as \nthe ``blue book.'' When I have shown this to Members on both sides of \nthe aisle, there has been shock registered, obviously, on the faces of \nmy colleagues, shock because few understand what is going on today with \nregard to the pollution of the Internet. I cannot and would not show \nthese pictures to the Senate. I would not want our cameras to pick them \nup. But I think they probably are best described by some other material \nthat has come to my attention by people who are strongly supporting our \nproposition. It says:\n\n       Warning. Do not open until further instructions. Offensive \n     material enclosed. Keep out of reach of children.\n\n  I hope that all of my colleagues, if they are interested, will come \nby my desk and take a look at this disgusting material, pictures of \nwhich were copied off the free Internet only last week, to give you an \nidea of the depravity on our children, possibly our society, that is \nbeing practiced on the Internet today. This is what the Coats-Exon \namendment is trying to correct.\n  Mr. President, it is no exaggeration to say that the most disgusting, \nrepulsive pornography is only a few clicks away from any child with a \ncomputer. I am not talking just about Playboy and Penthouse magazines. \nBy comparison, those magazines pale in offensiveness with the other \nthings that are readily available. I am talking about the most \nhardcore, perverse types of pornography, photos, and stories featuring \ntorture, child abuse, and bestiality.\n  These images and stories and conversations are all available in \npublic spaces free of charge. If nothing is done now, the pornographers \nmay become the primary beneficiary of the information revolution.\n  I am the first to admit that solutions to this problem are not easy \nones. It requires careful balance which protects legitimate use of this \nexciting new technology, respects the Constitution and, most \nimportantly, provides the maximum protection possible for America's \nfamilies and America's children.\n  After months of discussion, negotiations, and research, I am pleased \nto offer the Exon-Coats refinement of the Communications Decency Act \nprovisions included in the committee-reported bill. This modification \nrepresents a carefully balanced response to growing concerns about \ninappropriate use of telecommunications technologies.\n  In committee, the decency provisions were refined to clarify and to \nfocus on wrongdoers and to avoid imposing vicarious liability on \ninnocent information service and Internet access providers who simply \nact as the mailmen, if you will, for computer messages. The \nmodification now before the Senate further clarifies that the proposed \nlegislation does not breach constitutionally protected speech between \nconsenting adults nor interfere with legitimate privacy rights. The \nrevision also provides strong protection for children.\n  Mr. President, these revisions also make it certain that provisions \nof the Communications Decency Act in no way adversely affect the well-\nlitigated dial-a-porn statutes generally referred to as 47 U.S.C. 223 \n(b) and (c).\n  The Communications Decency Act is not a panacea. What the legislation \nwill do is give law enforcement new tools to prosecute those who would \nuse the computer to make the equivalent of obscene telephone calls, to \nprosecute electronic stalkers who terrorize their victims, to clamp \ndown on the electronic distributors of obscene materials, and to \nenhance the chances of prosecution of those who would provide \npornography to children via the computer.\n  Parents, teachers and law enforcement should not be lulled into a \nfalse sense of security. Their vigilance will still be required even \nafter this much-needed legislation is enacted into law. New voice, \nvideo, data and imaging options will soon enter every home or be \navailable to America's children and neighborhood schools and libraries. \nThis information revolution will give Americans unprecedented \nopportunities to enrich their lives, gain knowledge, and enhance their \nproductivity.\n  This legislation attempts to make the information superhighway a \nlittle bit safer for families and children to travel. The time to act \nis now. Delay only serves those who would endanger the Nation's \nchildren and those who use the new technology to distribute obscene \nmaterials or use the secrecy of the computer medium to harass others.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for families and children and vote \nfor the Communications Decency Act. Let us put politics aside and work \ntogether to protect the children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I may consume.\n  Nobody in here would disagree with the fact that we want to keep \nhardcore pornography away from our children. I am the proud parent of \nthree children, and the proud father-in-law of three others. I cherish \nthe time when those children were growing up.\n  I had the advantage of growing up in a family where we learned to \nread at an early age. My parents had published a weekly newspaper when \nI was a child and owned a printing business throughout the time I was \ngrowing up until my adult life when they retired.\n  They read to us as children and encouraged our reading. By the time I \nwas 4 years old, I was reading books actively. By the time I finished \nthird grade, I had read all of Dickens and most of Robert Louis \nStevenson. I say that not to brag but because it happened with the \nencouragement of my parents. They guided me; they encouraged me to read \nand to read a good deal. They knew that, periodically, I might read \nsomething that they probably wished I would not, but they got me to \nread and read and read. It helped me through college, it helped me \nthrough law school, it helped me through my days as a district \nattorney, and it certainly helped me become a U.S. Senator.\n  I also use Internet. I do town meetings on the Internet. I correspond \nwith people around the world with the Internet. I call up information I \nneed and plan trips to other countries. I call up information and maps, \nand so on. I find it is a most marvelous tool. Somebody raised the \nquestion about something in Australia the other day, and I could click \ninto the Internet and pull up something from a country thousands of \nmiles away, instantaneously.\n  Now, I have not seen the things on the Internet--I do not doubt that \nthey are there--that the Senator from Nebraska speaks of. I am six-\nfoot-four, and I looked over the shoulders of a huddle of Senators \ngoing through the blue book of the Senator from Nebraska. I saw one \npage of it, but I do not care to see that kind of filth. I also know \nthat I use the Internet probably more than most, and I have not been \nable to find some of these things. But I do not question that they are \nthere. I do worry about the universal revulsion for that kind of \npornography--I assume it is universal in this body--and that we not \nunnecessarily destroy in reaction what has been one of the most \nremarkable technological advances, certainly in my lifetime--the \nInternet.\n  It has grown as well as it has, as remarkably as it has, primarily \nbecause it has not had a whole lot of people restricting it, regulating \nit, and touching it and saying, do not do that or do this or the other \nthing. Can you imagine if it had been set up as a Government entity and \nwe all voted on these regulations for it? We would probably be able to \ncorrespond electrically with our next-door neighbor, if we ran a wire \nback and forth, and that would be it. Had we had the Government \ninvolved every step of the way and had us engaged in micromanaging it \nevery step of the way, we would not have the Internet that we have \ntoday.\n  I think there is a better way to reach the goal that the Senator from \nNebraska and I share. The goal is--and I yield to nobody in this body--\nto keep really filthy material out of the hands of children.\n  Maybe we can do it the same way my parents did. They guided me when \nwe read. We have software that can allow parents to know what their \nchildren see on the Internet. Maybe some day we will accept the fact \nthat there is some responsibility on the part of parents, not on the \npart of the U.S. Congress to tell children exactly what they should do \nand read and see and talk about as they are growing up. Maybe mothers \nand fathers ought to do what mine did and what my wife and I did with \nour children. [[Page S8331]] \n  In that regard, Mr. President, I also suggest that if we are going to \nget involved, maybe we should allow the elected Members of this body to \ndo it. I was concerned when I heard the new Chaplain. I have not had a \nchance to meet him. Some day I will. After listening to his prayer, it \nseems like he was part of the debate. It reminds me of his predecessor \nwho gave a long, long prayer here shortly after the arrest of O.J. \nSimpson saying that he worried about poor O.J. Simpson's state of \nbeing, and that we should pray for him and hopefully he would feel OK. \nSome of us suggested that maybe there ought to have also been prayers \nfor the two people that were murdered. I do not mean in any way to \nsuggest who committed the crime. But I recall suggesting that maybe if \nwe are going to have the chaplains interject themselves into public \ndebate, they may want to be evenhanded enough, at least, to pray for \nthose who have died and not just for somebody who may be a wealthy ex-\nfootball star.\n  By the same token, I suggest to the Chaplain--who may be a very fine \nman, for all I know--that perhaps he should allow us to debate these \nissues and determine how they come out and maybe pray for our guidance, \nbut allow us to debate them. He may find that he has enough other \nduties, such as composing a prayer each morning for us, to keep him \nbusy.\n  The concern I had in my amendment--my amendment speaks to the need to \nhave a real study of just how we do this. I suggest one way, of course, \nis to have the kind of software that is now available, where parents \ncan find out exactly who their children have been corresponding with or \nwhat they have been looking at on the Internet. Parents can make it \nvery clear that if you want to use the computer, there are certain \nareas you do not go into.\n  It is the same way we do it today. A parent can say, hey, you are \ngoing to bring books home and there are certain things that are going \nto be off limits--at least at your age. It is not that much different \njust because they might be able to call up the books, or whatever, at \nhome. That is no different than calling up the books from the corner \nbookstore. I suspect that a number of these things are available there.\n  My bill would require the Attorney General, in consultation with the \nNational Telecommunications Information Administration of the \nDepartment of Commerce, to transmit to the Judiciary Committees in the \nSenate and in the House of Representatives a report of evaluating \ncurrent laws and resources for prosecuting online obscenity and child \npornography.\n  If pornographers are out there, prosecute them. I have voted, as most \nof us have, to go after them. As a former prosecutor and as a parent, I \nfind them the most disgusting people.\n  What they do to our children is terrible, allowing authorities to go \ndirectly after them. Let us find out how we do that without destroying \nthe Internet.\n  For example, the first part of the amendment from the Senator from \nNebraska and the Senator from Indiana would make it a felony not only \nto send obscene messages to another person, but apply the same penalty \nto sending an e-mail message with indecent or filthy words that you \nhope will annoy another person.\n  For example, if someone sends you an annoying e-mail message and you \nrespond with a filthy four-letter word, you may land in jail for 2 \nyears with $100,000 fine. If you picked up the phone and did the exact \nsame thing, you are perfectly OK. But if you type it out and send it to \nthe person electronically, no matter how annoyed you might be, tough.\n  I do not think under this amendment a computer user would be able to \nsend a private or public e-mail message with the so-called seven dirty \nwords. Who knows when a recipient would feel annoyed by seeing a four-\nletter word on-line?\n  The second part of the amendment makes it a felony to send or receive \nover computer networks any obscene material. There is no requirement \nthat the person soliciting and receiving the material knew it was \nobscene.\n  In other words, you click on your Internet--and you can go through \nthousands and thousands of words--and find out that something you \ncalled up expecting it to be innocent is not, you could be prosecuted \nfor receiving it under this statute.\n  I think that goes too far. I think that could be far better worded. I \nthink that if we had the Justice Department study the area and make \nrecommendations that we then act upon within a very short period of \ntime, which is also in my amendment, I think it would be far better.\n  What I worry about is not to protect pornographers. Child \npornographers, in my mind, ought to be in prison. The longer the \nbetter. I am trying to protect the Internet, and make sure that when we \nfinally have something that really works in this country, that we do \nnot step in and screw it up, as sometimes happens with Government \nregulation.\n  When it came out that I was looking for an alternative approach, one \nthat would allow the Justice Department to find a way to go after \npornographers but to protect the free use of the Internet, I received \nthese petitions almost immediately.\n  Every page of this stack of documents that I am holding has dozens \nand dozens of names from across the Internet. These are people saying \nyes, that is the way to do it. Find out how to go after the \npornographers, but keep our Internet working. There were 35,000 \npetitions, in a matter of days.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an \narticle in the New York Times magazine this Sunday by James Gleick, \ntitled, ``This Is Sex?'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, June 11, 1995]\n\n                              This Is Sex?\n\n                           (By James Gleick)\n\n       At first glance, there's a lot of sex on the Internet. Or, \n     not at first glance--nobody can find anything on the Internet \n     at first glance. But if you have time on your hands, if \n     you're comfortable with computing, and if you have an \n     unflagging curiosity about sex--in other words, if you're a \n     teen-ager--you may think you've suddenly landed in \n     pornography heaven. Nude pictures! Foul language! Weird \n     bathroom humor! No wonder the Christian Coalition thinks the \n     Internet is turning into a red-light district. There's even a \n     ``Red Light District'' World Wide Web page.\n       So we explore. Some sites make you promise to be a grown-\n     up. (O.K.: you promise.) You try ``Girls,'' a link leading to \n     a computer at the University of Bordeaux, France. The message \n     flashes back: Document Contains No Data. ``Girls'' at Funet, \n     Finland, seems to offer lots of pictures (Dolly Parton! Ivana \n     Trump!)--Connect Timed Out. ``Girls,'' courtesy of Liberac \n     University of Technology, Czech Republic, does finally, with \n     painful slowness, deliver itself of a 112,696-byte image of \n     Madchen Amick. You could watch it spread across your screen, \n     pixel by tantalizing pixel, but instead you go have lunch \n     during the download, and when you return, there she is--in \n     black-and-white and wearing clothes.\n       These pictures, by the way, are obviously scanned from \n     magazines. And magazines are the ideal medium for them. \n     Clearly the battle cry of the on-line voyeur is ``Host \n     Contacted--Waiting for Reply.''\n       With old Internet technology, retrieving and viewing any \n     graphic image on a PC at home could be laborious. New \n     Internet technology, like browsers for the Web, makes all \n     this easier, though it still takes minutes for the typical \n     picture to squeeze its way through your modem. Meanwhile, \n     though, ease of use has killed off the typical purveyor of \n     dirty pictures, capable of serving hundreds of users a day \n     but uninterested in handling hundreds of thousands. The \n     Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers has turned off its \n     ``Femmes femmes femmes je vous aime'' Web page. The good news \n     for erotica fans is that users are redirected to a new site \n     where ``You can find naked women, including topless and total \n     nudity''; the bad news is that this new site is the Louvre.\n       The Internet does offer access to hundreds of sex \n     ``newsgroups,'' forums for discussion encompassing an amazing \n     spectrum of interests. They're easy to find--in the newsgroup \n     hierarchy ``alt.sex'' (``alt'' for alternative) comes right \n     after ``alt.sewing.'' And yes, alt.sex is busier than \n     alt.sewing. But quite a few of them turn out to be sham and \n     self-parody. Look at alt.sex.fish--practically nothing. \n     Alt.sex.bestiality--aha! just what Jesse Helms fears most--\n     gives way to alt.sex.bestiality.hamster.duct-tape, and \n     fascinating as this sounds, when you call it up you find it's \n     empty, presumably the vestige of a short-lived joke. \n     Alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics is followed by \n     alt.sex.sheep.baaa.baaa.baaa.moo--help!\n       Still, if you look hard enough, there is grotesque stuff \n     available. If pornography doesn't bother you, your stomach \n     may be curdled by the vulgar commentary and clinical how-to's \n     in the militia and gun newsgroups. Your local newsstand is a \n     far more user-friendly source of obscenity than the on-line \n     world, [[Page S8332]] but it's also true that, if you work at \n     it, you can find plenty on line that will disgust you, and \n     possibly even disgust your children.\n       This is the justification for an effort in Congress to give \n     the Federal Government tools to control the content available \n     on the Internet. The Communications Decency Act, making its \n     way through Congress, aims to transform the obscene-phone-\n     call laws into a vehicle for prosecuting any Internet user, \n     bulletin-board operator, or on-line service that knowingly \n     makes obscene material available.\n       As originally written, the bill would not only have made it \n     a crime to write lewd E-mail to your lover; it would also \n     have made it a crime for your Internet provider to transmit \n     it. After a round of lobbying from the large on-line \n     services, the bill's authors have added ``defenses'' that \n     could exempt mere unwitting carriers of data, and they say it \n     is children, not consenting adults, they aim to protect. \n     Nevertheless, the legislation is a historically far-reaching \n     attempt at censorship on a national scale.\n       The Senate authors of this language do not use E-mail \n     themselves, or browse the Web, or chat in newsgroups, and \n     their legislation reflects a mental picture of how the on-\n     line world works that does not match the reality. The \n     existing models for Federal regulation of otherwise protected \n     speech--for example, censorship of broadcast television and \n     prohibition of harassing telephone calls--come from a world \n     that is already vanishing over the horizon. There aren't \n     three big television networks now, serving a unified mass \n     market; there are thousands of television broadcasters \n     serving, ever-narrower special interests. And on the \n     Internet, the number of broadcasters is rapidly approaching \n     the number of users: uncountable.\n       With Internet use spreading globally, most live sources of \n     erotic images already seem to be overseas. The sad reality \n     for Federal authorities is that they cannot cut those off \n     without forcing the middlemen--on-line services in the United \n     States--to do the work of censorship, and that work is a \n     practical impossibility. Any teen-ager with an account on \n     Prodigy can use its new Web\n      browser to search for the word ``pornography'' and click his \n     way to ``Femmes femmes femmes'' (oh, well, better luck \n     next time). Policing discussion groups presents the would-\n     be censor with an even more hopeless set of choices. A \n     typical Internet provider carries more than 10,000 groups. \n     As many as 100 million new words flow through them every \n     day. The actual technology of these discussion groups is \n     hard to fathom at first. They are utterly decentralized. \n     Every new message begins on one person's computer and \n     propagates outward in waves, like a chain letter that \n     could eventually reach every mailbox in the world. \n     Legislators would like to cut off a group like \n     alt.sex.bondage.particle-physics at the source, or at its \n     home--but it has no source and no home, or rather, it has \n     as many homes as there are computers carrying newsgroups.\n       This is the town-square speech the First Amendment was for: \n     often rancorous, sometimes harsh and occasionally obscene. \n     Voices do carry farther now. The world has never been this \n     global and this intimate at once. Even seasoned Internet \n     users sometimes forget that, lurking just behind the dozen \n     visible participants in an out-of-the-way newsgroup, tens of \n     millions of potential readers can examine every word they \n     post.\n       If a handful of people wish to share their private \n     experiences with like-minded people in alt.sex.fetish.hair, \n     they can do so, efficiently--the most fervent wishes of \n     Congress notwithstanding--and for better or worse, they'll \n     have to learn that children can listen in. Meanwhile, if gun-\n     wielding extremists wish to discuss the vulnerable points in \n     the anatomy of F.B.I. agents, they too can do so. At least \n     the rest of us can listen in on them, too. Perhaps there is a \n     grain of consolation there--instead of censorship, exposure \n     to the light. Anyway, the only real alternative now would be \n     to unwire the Information Superhighway altogether.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would note a couple things from the article. It points \nout that it is a sad reality for Federal authorities that they cannot \ncut off pornographers without forcing the middleman--the on-line \nservices of the United States--to do the work of censorship. That work \nis a practical impossibility.\n  A typical Internet provider carries more than 10,000 groups. As many \nas 100 million new words go through them every day. Are we going to \nhave a whole new group in the Justice Department checking these 100 \nmillion new words to find out if they are wrong?\n  Some of the words might appear, just looking at their listings, to be \nsomething wild. There may, in fact, be nothing there.\n  The article notes a listing for ``Femmes, Femmes, Femmes'', a French \nword for women. If you call up the listing, it is a catalog to the \nLouvre in Paris. Somebody has a sense of humor. But it gives everyone \nan idea. Is this person suddenly going to be under investigation \nbecause of his or her sense of humor?\n  I am about to yield the floor, Mr. President, and reserve the balance \nof my time. Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a list of groups ranging from the Association of American \nPublishers to the American Library Association, the Newspaper \nAssociation of America, to the Times Mirror, all of whom support my \nidea of a study in finding a better way of doing this.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Supporters of Leahy Study\n\n       Association of American Publishers (AAP).\n       Association of American University Presses (AAUP).\n       The Faculty of the City University of New York.\n       Interactive Working Group.\n       Online Operators Policy Committee of the Interactive.\n       Services Association.\n       American Advertising Federation.\n       American Association of Advertising Agencies.\n       American Library Association.\n       American Society of Newspaper Editors.\n       Association of National Advertisers, Inc.\n       Association of Research Libraries.\n       Business Software Alliance.\n       Center for Democracy and Technology.\n       Computer and Communications Industry Association.\n       Direct Marketing Association.\n       Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n       Feminists For Free Expression.\n       Magazine Publishers of America.\n       Media Access Project.\n       National Public Telecomputing Network.\n       Newspaper Association of America.\n       People for the American Way Action Fund.\n       Recreational Software Advisory Counsel\n       Software Publishers Association.\n       Times Mirror.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking my colleague \nfrom Nebraska for his interest in this subject and for his willingness \nto work with me and our staff in putting together what I think is an \nimportant piece of legislation, and a very effective piece of \nlegislation.\n  Obviously, it is a difficult task, balancing first amendment rights \nwith protections that go toward placing restrictions, in reasonable \nways, so that particularly children are not recipients of obscene or \nindecent material.\n  Mr. President, sometimes our technology races beyond our ability to \nstop and reflect. We are left with a very dangerous gap, a period of \ntime when society is unprepared to deal with the results of such rapid \nchange. That is the situation we face with the Internet. The Internet \nis a tool of great potential.\n  Senator Leahy has said it opens a new world of opportunity. It has \nbecome, without, I believe, anybody specifically planning it or \nanticipating it, it has become one of the largest distributors of \npornography in the world.\n  One study found more than 450,000 pornographic images and text files \nare available to anyone with a modem. This vast library of obscenity \nand indecency was accessed 6.4 million times in just the last year.\n  Now, we need to make sure what we are talking about here. We are not \ntalking about what most people now have images in their mind as to what \nis available off the Internet. I looked at the Senator's blue book, and \nI would urge every Senator to look at that before they make a final \ndecision on what we are doing here. It is important to understand the \nkind of material that is available. Everything imaginable. We are \ntalking about images and text that deal with the sexual abuse of \nchildren. We are talking about images and words and sexual abuse of \ninfants.\n  By one estimate about a quarter of the images available involve the \ntorture of women. We are dealing in many, many cases with perversion \nand brutality beyond normal imagination and beyond the boundaries of a \ncivil society.\n  These facts are clear, because it is available now in the Internet, \nand we have pictures of it if anybody wants to see it, or copies of the \ntext that is available on the Internet.\n  There is one more fact that ought to move the Senate from great and \ndeep concern to immediate action here today. That is the fact that the \nInternet is the one area of communication technology that has no \nprotection at all for children.\n  Now, we face a somewhat unique, disturbing and urgent circumstance, \nbecause it is children who are the computer experts in our Nation's \nfamilies. [[Page S8333]] \n  My generation--I have not figured out how to use the VCR yet. I have \na blinking 12 I do not know how to get rid of. It is the children today \nwho are trained from almost kindergarten on, on how to access the \ncomputer.\n  They have technology available at their fingertips that most adults \ndo not have. Sometimes in the interest of helping with their homework \nor for the development of our children, we place the computer either in \na special room or even in their bedrooms.\n  Of the 6.8 million homes with on-line accounts currently available, \n35 percent have children under the age of 18. The only barriers between \nthose children and the material--the obscene and indecent material on \nthe Internet--are perfunctory onscreen warnings which inform minors \nthey are on their honor not to look at this. The Internet is like \ntaking a porn shop and putting it in the bedroom of your children and \nthen saying ``Do not look.''\n  I think anybody who is a parent understands that is a pretty \ndifficult situation to enforce. That really is a miscarriage of the \nresponsibility that I think adults hold to our society, to our children \nin our society.\n  We have all read the worst abuses of this new technology. Children, \nnot realizing the danger, give out their names, their addresses, their \nphone numbers to people they meet over the Internet. They become easy \ntargets for sexual abuse. Recently, one man, in an attempt to find out \njust how difficult a problem this was, posed--typed in on the \ncomputer--posed himself as a 13-year-old. In the course of one evening \non-line he was approached by more than 20 pedophiles.\n  I suggest that, as difficult and as horrendous as these stories are, \nthe effect of this kind of material, this kind of practice is far \nbroader. It does not turn all who see it into rapists and killers, but \nit does kill something about our spirit, particularly the spirit of our \nchildren. I think we have always felt a special responsibility and \nobligation to defend childhood through parents, through society; to \nmake it, to the best extent we can, a safe harbor of innocence. It is a \nprivileged time to develop values in an environment that is not hostile \nto our children.\n  But the Internet has invaded that protected place and destroys that \ninnocence. It takes the worst excesses of sexual depravity and places \nit directly into the child's bedroom, on the computer that their \nparents purchased in the thought it would help them do their homework \nor develop their intellect. When sexual violence and gross indecency \nare available to anyone at the touch of a button, both an individual or \na culture become desensitized. It is not always that people emulate \nthis material, but often you can become immune to it. The images and \nmessages act like a novocaine on our national conscience. They numb our \ncapacity for outrage.\n  What used to outrage us now becomes almost commonplace. They have \ninvaded our homes. They have invaded the minds of our children. I think \nthey have numbed us to the shock that used to be present when this kind \nof material was exposed.\n  This is an issue beyond partisanship. It is sponsored by a Democrat \nand Republican. I hope our concern will unite people across the \nideological spectrum. A vote for the Exon-Coats amendment is a way to \nside with women endangered by rape and violence, to side with children \nthreatened by abuse, to side with families concerned about the \ninnocence of their children and the decency of our culture.\n  The question, in my mind, is not if we should act but what we should \nwe do. I believe the Exon-Coats amendment is a serious, thoughtful \nanswer to that question. It is carefully crafted to be constitutional, \nto address the constitutional questions. But it is also designed to \nleave pornographers on the Internet, who would provide their material \nto children, with no place to hide.\n  The approach we are taking has been legally upheld in the dial-a-porn \nstatutes. It extends that approach, which has already proven its worth, \nto this new technology.\n  What we are doing here is not new. What we are doing here is not \nsomething that has not been debated before this body. We are taking the \nstandards adopted by the Senate, by the Congress, signed into law, that \napply to the use of these kinds of communications over the phone wires \nand applied it, now, over the computer wires. It is just simply a \ndifferent means of bringing a communication into a home--through the \ncomputer rather than through the phone. We are taking the same \nstandards.\n  This Senate, on November 16, 1989, voted 96 to 4 to adopt these \nstandards; 96 Members of the Senate have already voted to adopt these \nstandards and apply it to the telephone communication of obscenity and \nindecency. All Senator Exon and I are trying to do is apply those same \nstandards now to this new means of reaching into our homes.\n  The bottom line is simple. We are removing indecency from areas of \ncyberspace that are easily accessible to children. If individuals want \nto provide that material, they have to do so with barriers to minors. \nIf adults want access to the material, they have to make an \naffirmative, positive effort to get it.\n  Let me repeat that. That is the critical part of this bill. We are \nsimply saying here if you are in the business of providing this \nmaterial, you have a responsibility, and it is punishable by penalty of \nlaw if you violate that responsibility--I ask the Senator for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. I wish to yield whatever additional time the Senator from \nIndiana requires.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for the additional time.\n  Mr. President, all we are saying is, if you are in the business of \nproviding this material, you have to provide barriers so it does not \nget in the hands of children. If you are an adult who wants to receive \nthis material, you have to call up and get it. You have to subscribe to \nit. You have to prove you are an adult before you receive it.\n  What would our amendment do? It would clean up the Internet. We ban \nobscenity. And we require that indecency be walled off so children \ncannot have access.\n  We also require commercial on-line services to adopt this standard. \nIf they wish to provide indecent material, they have to make what we \ncall an effective, good-faith effort to segregate it from access to \nchildren and, as the Senator from Nebraska has said, we protect women \nand children from sexual predators who use this technology to harass \nand to stalk.\n  Critics of the amendment are going to say it will cripple or close \nthe Internet. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our legislation \nincludes reasonable protections for businesses and service providers \nwho act in good faith to shield children from indecency. We provide \ndefenses for those who do nothing more than merely provide access to \nthe Internet. This means that small businessmen and others who simply \nhave a computer in their office are not going to be subjected to the \npenalties when that computer is misused. It is important to note that \nboth the chamber of commerce, representing business, and a number of \nnational family groups concerned about pornography, have both endorsed \nthis legislation. They have understood we have defined an approach that \nis strong but reasonable and realistic.\n  Critics may also charge the standards we have set are too high and \nthis will force businesses to deny children access to the Internet \nentirely, but that is not true. That is a scare tactic, not an \nargument. Our legislation simply provides the same protections for \nchildren that currently exist in every other sector of our society.\n  Pornographic magazines today cannot be sold to minors. Telephones \ntoday cannot be used to provide indecent messages to minors. But \nmagazine stores and telephone companies are alive and well. They still \nsucceed because the reasonable efforts that we ask in the interests of \nchildren are not crippling demands.\n  Mr. President, one of the most urgent questions in any modern society \nis how we humanize our technology, how we make it serve us instead of \ncorrupt us. America is on the frontier of human knowledge but it is \nincomplete without applying human values.\n  One of our most important values is the protection of our children, \nnot only the protection of their bodies from violence but the \nprotection of their minds and souls from abuse.\n  We cannot and we should not resist change. But our brave new world \nmust [[Page S8334]] not be hostile to the innocence of our children. \nThe Exon-Coats amendment is a reasonable amendment. I hope that Members \nwill support it.\n  I am pleased to join the Senator from Nebraska in offering it to the \nSenate for its consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, unless the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska is seeking recognition, I yield 20 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Vermont, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment because I think that is the right approach. I oppose the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Nebraska.\n  But I first want to applaud the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, \nfor his concern about the need to protect children from obscene and \nindecent material.\n  No one has done more than he to raise the awareness of parents, \neducators, and legislators about the need to address the problem of \nmaterials on computer networks that may not be appropriate for \nchildren. One needs only to ``surf the net'' bulletin boards, read \nnewspapers, periodicals, and listen to broadcast media to know that the \nquestion of obscenity and indecency on computer networks is one of the \nhottest topics around. The Senator for Nebraska is responsible for the \ndebate on this important issue and I applaud his very genuine concern, \nhis good intentions, and hard work to protect children.\n  I have children of my own, and there are materials available through \nthe Internet that would not be appropriate for them. Some of those \nmaterials skirt the boundaries of indecency or obscenity and other \nmaterials, while not indecent, are of an adult nature that my children \nmay not have the maturity to understand at their age.\n  So I, too, want to find methods to allow parents to protect their \nchildren from material on computer networks which they view as \ninappropriate without trampling on first amendment rights of the users \nof interactive telecommunications systems.\n  I regret to say that I do not believe the Senator from Nebraska has \nrevised the language as reflected in this second-degree amendment, \nwhich achieves that end.\n  The Senator from Nebraska has gone a long way to revise the language \nof the Communications Decency Act to allay the concerns of \nantipornography groups, civil liberties organizations, and law \nenforcement officials who raised objections to the bill. His efforts to \naccommodate his colleagues only underscore his commitment to the \nwelfare of our children.\n  The language, as modified, now makes it a criminal offense, \npunishable by up to 2 years in prison and/or a $100,000 fine, to \nknowingly make, create, or solicit and initiate the transmission of, or \npurposefully make available any indecent--I emphasize the word \n``indecent''--communication, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or \nother communication to a person under 18 years of age.\n  That would appear, on its face, to be within the scope of the \nGovernment's authority to regulate indecent speech directed at minors. \nThe Supreme Court in the Pacifica Foundation case and other decisions \nhas made it clear that the State may well have an interest in \nprohibiting indecency to minors.\n  However, I, along with my colleague from Vermont, continue to have \nconcerns about this provision. We share the goal of this provision, but \ndisagree on the means to achieve that end.\n  The crux of the problem, however, is that due to the unique nature of \ninteractive telecommunications systems, attempts to prohibit indecent \nspeech to minors on these networks raises questions of \nconstitutionality.\n  The Supreme Court, in the Sable decision, made it clear that any \nattempts to regulate indecent communications directed at minors must \ntake into account the medium being used and the least restrictive means \nto achieve the goal of prohibiting indecency to minors. Thus, under \nPacifica, offensive works could be banned from radio broadcasts during \ncertain hours because there was, in effect, no other less restrictive \nmeans of preventing minors from being exposed to such materials.\n  In contrast, Sable struck down broad Federal legislation seeking to \nban certain communication via the telephone because there were \nalternative, less restrictive means available. The Federal statute in \nthe Sable case was finally upheld when it was modified to require \nproviders of sexually explicit telephone services, the so-called Dial-\nA-Porn services, to adopt mechanisms such as credit card authorization \nor other means of verifying age to prevent minors from accessing such \nservices.\n  In other words, where alternative means are available to block access \nby minors to these services, those methods must be implemented rather \nthan denying adults their constitutionally protected right to such \nmaterial.\n  The proposed amendment not only adopts an approach that is not the \nleast restrictive, it has the potential to retard significantly the \ndevelopment of this new type of interactive telecommunications.\n\n\n                  chilling effect on cyberspace speech\n\n  I am concerned that this legislation will have a chilling effect on \nconstitutionally protected speech on interactive communication \nnetworks, potentially slowing the rapid technological advances that are \nbeing made in this new technology.\n  Because of the unique nature of interactive telecommunications \nnetworks, prohibiting indecency to minors without impacting \nconstitutionally protected communications between adults must be \ncarefully tailored.\n  One of the most popular services accessed via the Internet is USENET, \na series of interactive bulletin boards, news groups, and other \nparticipatory forums which are dedicated to different topics. They are \nliterally thousands of these groups available on computer networks and \nthey are used widely for discussion of everything from current events \nsuch as the legislation we are discussing today to completely obscure \nsubjects. They are used for recreation, entertainment, business, \nresearch, and many other purposes.\n  Users participating in those newsgroups may simply read the messages \nor they may post their own. There is no way to know who will be reading \nyour message.\n  Since it is possible that any minor whose home computer can access \nthe Internet would also have access to the public bulletin board, one \ncould make the case that the adult posting the so-called indecent \nmessage did so knowing that a minor might see the message.\n  Thus, if this legislation became law, an adult participant on a \nbulletin board who posted a profane message using some of the ``seven \ndirty words'' on any subject could be subject to criminal penalties of \nup to 2 years in prison or a $100,000 fine, if a minor might read the \nmessage posted on that bulletin board.\n  This threat of criminal sanctions could have a dramatic chilling \neffect on free speech on interactive telecommunications systems, and in \nparticular, these newsgroups and bulletin boards accessed through the \nInternet. Quite simply, adults will have to watch what they say on \nthese forums.\n  Let me provide an example of how that might occur. According to an \narticle in the Phoenix Gazette earlier this year, a large computer \nbulletin board was raided by the Arizona State Department of Public \nSafety and the local police for providing obscene material on their \nservice. While months later the operators of that service had not yet \nbeen charged, it was reported that ``The crackdown had a chilling \neffect on providers of on-line services. Within days, operators of \nsimilar boards removed obscene files or eliminated public access to \nthem.''\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no issue raised when the legitimate law \nenforcement efforts to enforce anti-obscenity laws and ordinances have \na chilling effect on the distribution of obscene materials. Under a \nconstitutional interpretation in our country, obscenity does not have \nthe same constitutionally protected status as nonobscene speech.\n  However, Senator Exon's bill would likely have a chilling effect on \nprotected speech--or speech which may be perceived to be indecent, but \nnot obscene.\n  Communication between adults through the Internet would likely be \n[[Page S8335]] reduced to the lowest common denominator--that which is \nappropriate for children. Mr. President, that is not free speech.\n\n\n                indecency defined by community standards\n\n  Second, Mr. President, the threat of criminal sanctions despite a \nuser's lack of control over, or knowledge of, who views his/her \nmessage, is of additional concern given that indecency is defined based \non community standards.\n  The definition of indecency for computer networks hasn't been fully \nexplored. For broadcast media, FCC has defined indecency as ``language \nor material that, in context, depicts or describes in terms patently \noffensive as measured by contemporary community standards for broadcast \nmedium, sexual or excretory activities or organs''--including the so-\ncalled seven dirty words.\n  The nature of interactive telecommunications makes even the \n``community standard'' and entirely different matter. As a bulletin \nboard user you may not even be aware of who will be reading your \ncommunication, let alone where they are located for purposes of \nfiguring out what a community standard might be.\n  It is unclear what would constitute a community standard for \nindecency? Whose community? That of the initiator or that of the \nrecipient? Will all free speech on the Internet be diminished to what \nmight be considered decent in the most conservative community in the \nUnited States?\n  An article in the San Diego Union-Tribune in February of this year \ndocumented a case in which a Tennessee court convicted a California \ncouple of violating obscenity laws with their sexually explicit \nbulletin board based and operated in California. The jury applied the \ncommunity standards of Memphis because the materials from the bulletin \nboard were downloaded there.\n  Again, in the case of obscenity, the community standard is of less \nconcern because obscene speech is not protected. But in S. 652, we are \nprohibiting protected speech, so-called indecent speech. The uncharted \ncommunity standards for indecency pose a risk that few users will be \nwilling to bear.\n\n\n    indecency provisions could make illegal socially valuable forums\n\n  Based on the definition which has been applied to broadcast media, we \ncould declare the content of many bulletin boards indecent--including \nthose containing medical and academic discussions, on-line support \ngroups where users discuss the trauma of sexual and physical abuse, or \nbulletin boards which contain information on sexually transmitted \ndiseases and AIDS and how one might prevent them.\n  Arguably, while the content is of a mature nature, these types of \nforums have tremendous social value. However, if minors gained access \nto these services, those making the indecent comment could be subject \nto 2 years in prison. Many of these bulletin boards for adults would \nsimply cease to exist.\n  Would the threat of criminal sanctions and the unclear nature of an \nindecency standard have a chilling effect on free speech via computer \nnetworks? I say it will. You bet it will.\n  Adults will be forced to self-censor their words, even if they did \nnot intend those words for children and even if they are protected by \nthe first amendment.\n  Mr. President, the use of computer networks holds tremendous \npotential for the expansion of public dialog and discourse advancing \nthe value of the first amendment. It is an industry that is growing by \nleaps and bounds.\n  The business, educational, and social welfare potential of the \ninformation superhighway is almost without limit. It would be \ndevastating to limit the potential of this medium by taking steps that \ncould have the effect of silencing its users.\n\n\n               different standards for the same materials\n\n  An additional concern, Mr. President, is that this legislation will \nestablish different standards for material which appears in print and \non the computer screen. The legislation would make certain individuals \nsubject to criminal penalties if they made their materials and \npublications available on computer networks to which minors had access. \nHowever, that same material, the same message would be perfectly legal, \nand fully protected under the Constitution, in a bookstore, or a \nlibrary. If a minor stumbled across, or purposefully sought, indecent \nmaterials in a bookstore and simply looked at that material, the author \nof that material would not be subject to criminal penalties nor would \nthe bookstore or library that stocked the material.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep in mind that many published works are \navailable over the World Wide Web through the Internet. There is even a \n``Virtual Library'' on the World Wide Web. Therefore it is entirely \nconceivable that we would have two separate standards for legality of \nthe same works published in the print media and on electronic \ncommunications systems.\n  Civil liberties advocates point out that under this bill it is \npossible that an individual who makes available electronically the \nnovels such as ``Lady Chatterley's Lover,'' ``Catcher in the Rye'' by \nJ.D. Salinger, or the many novels of Kurt Vonnegut such that they are \npotentially accessible to minors, could be subject to criminal \npenalties while could be found in any library and bookstore. Why the \ndifferent standard?\n\n\n   interactive media's unique technological characteristics must be \n                               considered\n\n  The fundamental flaw in the language proposed by Senator Exon is that \nit attempts to regulate computer networks as we regulate broadcasting \nand telephones when it has little in common with either of them. \nAlthough the materials transmitted through interactive \ntelecommunications systems often bear a greater resemblance to the \nprint media, the fact remains that these interactive telecommunications \nsystems have some entirely unique characteristics which need to be \nconsidered.\n  It is a unique form of media posing differing challenges and \nopportunities. Unlike broadcast or print media, an individual on the \nInternet can be both a communications recipient and originator \nsimultaneously. Congress needs to understand these differences before \nwe can determine how best to protect children and the constitutional \nrights of Americans.\n\n\n Supreme Court Addresses Constitutionality of Content Regulation Based \n                    on Characteristics of the Medium\n\n  The way in which the Supreme Court has dealt with obscenity and \nindecency questions as they relate to the first amendment has a lot to \ndo with the structural characteristics of the medium in question.\n  The Supreme Court has taken into consideration the scarcity of the \nmedium as a public resource as well as the ability of the user to \ncontrol the material he or she might view over the medium. The print \nmedia has been afforded a greater degree of first amendment protection \nbecause of the decentralized and nonintrusive nature of the medium. \nNewspapers are inexpensive to produce and to purchase, virtually \nunlimited in number, and are noninvasive--that is, it is easy for a \nconsumer to avoid the media if they wish.\n  Broadcasting, which uses the scarce public spectrum and which is more \ndifficult to control from an end-user standpoint, has not enjoyed the \nsame protection as print media. It is easier to come across indecent or \noffensive material while flipping through the channels on your \ntelevision. Broadcast spectrum is also limited so courts have upheld \ncontent regulation to ensure that public resources furthered the public \ninterest.\n  Interactive communications are different, Mr. President. There is a \ngreater ability on computer networks to avoid materials end users do \nnot wish to receive than exists for either broadcast media or \ntelephony, but arguably less than exists in print media.\n  Users of the Internet and other on-line functions typically do not \nstumble across information, but go out surfing for materials on a \nparticular subject. As such, they use search words, message headings, \nand the so-called gopher as their guide. Most newsgroups or bulletin \nboards that have sexually explicit materials are named such that there \ncan be little doubt what types of materials one might encounter if you \ntry to get into that area.\n\n\n     Restriction of Protected Speech Justified To Serve Compelling \n          Government Interest Only For Least Restrictive Means\n\n  In addition to characteristics of scarcity and user control, the \nSupreme Court has allowed the abridgement of [[Page S8336]] protected \nspeech based on certain criteria. Over the years, the Court has \ncarefully examined two factors when determining the extent to which \ncontent shall be subject to government controls without violating the \nfirst amendment:\n  Whether there is a compelling government interest to abridge \nprotected speech;\n  Whether abridgement is accomplished in the least restrictive means.\n  Mr. President, while the Supreme Court has recognized that there may \nbe a compelling government interest in shielding minors from indecent \ncommunications, I do not believe that the provision in the Exon bill \nwill serve that interest in the least restrictive means. The provision, \nwhile appearing to apply only to minors, will in fact restrict the free \nspeech of adults.\n  The interactive electronic communications market is growing and the \ntechnology is evolving rapidly. Contrary to what others might contend, \nit is not clear that there are not adequate technical means available \nto parents and service providers to screen out objectionable material \nfor children.\n  There is currently software available which allows parents and \nemployers to screen out objectionable services or newsgroups on the \nInternet. On-line service providers also have the ability to provide \nparents with a choice of what types of information their children \nshould access. Schools and universities that provide the service of \nconnection to the Internet can also decide which types of news groups \non USENET they will make available. Carnegie-Mellon University recently \nmade offensive-news groups less accessible to students by taking their \nnames off their master list.\n  I want to clarify one other technical matter. The Senator from \nNebraska presented a chart which indicated that one's home computer is \nconnected directly to the Internet.\n  That is not always accurate, Mr. President. In many cases, users need \nto access first a remote computer or connect with an access provider.\n  In some cases, that service provider is an online service, like \nProdigy or America On-Line. Other services merely provide the \nconnection services, much like a common carrier to the home users.\n  Why is this a crucial distinction? Because it makes clear there are \nways to control what one receives on a computer. Because the access \nprovider acts as an intermediary between the user and the Internet, \nthey can also eliminate access to certain services. Many of those \nInternet access providers are already recognizing the market potential \nof providing parents and schools with the opportunity to control the \naccess of children to some services on the network. And I am not just \ntalking about the big ones like Prodigy and CompuServe. I am talking \nabout Siecom, Inc., which is an Internet service provider in Grand \nRapids, MI, which supplies 20 elementary and secondary schools with \nrestricted one-way access to USENET discussion groups through the \nInternet. The company does not make available the news groups on USENET \nwhich may be inappropriate for children. That company is realizing that \nthe simple service of not providing access to all the USENET services \nhas been a marketing advantage for them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has now used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask that I be yielded 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Krol states in his book, when explaining the \ntechnical needs of Internet users:\n\n       No matter what level you're at, Internet access always \n     comes via an access provider; an organization whose job it is \n     to sell Internet access.\n\n  He further indicates that Internet service providers are \nparticipating in a competitive market. That means the opportunity \nexists to solve at least part of the problem through the marketplace \ntoday, not through governmental prohibitions.\n  None of the technical safeguards available, such as blocking software \nand provider screening, are perfect, but the nice thing is they do not \nviolate the first amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print an article in the \nRecord from the Wall Street Journal describing some of these \ntechnologies.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 15, 1995]\n\n    New Software Filters Sexual, Racist Fare Circulated on Internet\n\n\nSurfWatch Program Addresses Renewed Cyberspace Fears Following Oklahoma \n                                 Blast\n\n                          (By Jared Sandberg)\n\n       Think of it as a parental hand shielding children's eyes \n     from the evils of cyberspace.\n       That's the gist of a software program developed by \n     SurfWatch Software Inc., a Los Altos, Calif., start-up. The \n     program, expected to be released today, will allow Internet \n     users to block sexually oriented data transmitted via the \n     global computer network.\n       ``The goal is to allow people to have a choice over what \n     they see on the Internet by allowing them to filter or block \n     sexually explicit material,'' said Jay Friedland, SurfWatch's \n     vice president of marketing. Mr. Friedland said the software \n     will also allow users to filter out files such as bomb-making \n     manuals and neo-Nazi screeds, which have been circulated by \n     hate groups on the Internet.\n       A growing number of firms are racing to provide tools to \n     filter out pornographic and racist fare stored on the \n     Internet before the government takes action itself. The \n     proposed telecommunications-reform bill before the Senate \n     makes it illegal for individuals and corporations to put \n     sexually explicit material on the Internet. Last week, the \n     Senate held hearings in the wake of the Oklahoma bombing \n     regarding the use of computer networks to disseminate hate \n     literature that could incite violence.\n       The government moves concern free-speech advocates, who \n     prefer a technological fix. ``We don't have to rely on the \n     government to attempt to censor everything on the Internet,'' \n     said Daniel Weitzner, deputy director of the Center for \n     Democracy and Technology, a civil-liberties group that \n     testified at last week's hearings. Users have no control of \n     broadcast media, other than to change channels or turn it \n     off. But in cyberspace, ``SurfWatch is a great example of the \n     flexibility and user control that is inherent in interactive \n     media,'' Mr. Weitzner said.\n       On-line services such as Prodigy Services Co. only grant \n     Internet access to children with parental permission. Jostens \n     Inc. recently released software for schools that allows \n     teachers to block electronic bulletin boards that contain \n     pornographic pictures.\n       SurfWatch's Mr. Friedland said the software contains the \n     Internet addresses of computers storing sexually explicit \n     material, blocking a user's attempt to access those \n     computers. But such porno-troves often are a moving target: \n     once users find out about them, those computers tend to get \n     overwhelmed by traffic, shut down and move elsewhere on the \n     network and take a new address.\n       To counter that problem, SurfWatch will charge users a \n     subscription fee for software updates that include new \n     offending Internet addresses. The company is using a database \n     to search the Internet for words such as ``pornography'' and \n     ``pedophilia'' and make a list of Internet sites, which won't \n     be visible to users.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, clearly there are ways parents can exact \ncontrol over what their children can access on their home computers. It \nis clearly preferable to leave this responsibility in the hands of \nparents, rather than have the Government step in and assert control \nover telecommunications. Whenever there is a choice between Government \nintervention and empowering people to make their own decisions, we \nought to try first to use the situation of the approach that involves \nless Government control of our lives.\n  It is also not clear that existing criminal statutes are incapable of \nenforcing laws to protect children on interactive telecommunications. \nThere have been many reports of prosecution of illegal activity related \nto the transmission of obscenity using interactive telecommunications.\n  So, Mr. President, I do not even think it is clear we do not have the \nauthority today to prosecute online obscenity. The truth is we just do \nnot know at this point. We need more information. However, it is \nentirely clear to me that Congress certainly should not abridge \nconstitutionally protected speech if there are less restrictive means \nof serving the compelling Government interest.\n  To conclude, that is why I strongly support, as an alternative, the \nefforts of the Senator from Vermont. This amendment requires an \nexpeditious evaluation by the Department of Justice of the technology \navailable now to allow parents to protect their children \n[[Page S8337]] from objectionable materials while upholding the values \nof the first amendment. The Attorney General must also evaluate whether \nexisting laws are adequate to enforce criminal laws governing \nobscenity.\n  This study, which has to be completed within 5 months, will provide \nCongress with the information we need before we consider legislation. \nGiven the first amendment issues at stake here, I believe the Judiciary \nCommittee of the Senate should also be given an opportunity to review \nthis matter. I do not, in theory, object to some legislation.\n  I simply want to work with my colleagues to determine how best to \nprotect children, while at the same time protecting the rights of \nAmericans to free speech.\n  I will close with these remarks from an article in the Federal \nCommunications Law Journal by Prof. Fred Cate. In the article, he \ndiscussed how electronic communications have changed the way we \ncommunicate and have even greater potential to revolutionize \ncommunications. He stated:\n\n       If 60 years of the Communications Act of 1934 has taught us \n     nothing else, it must caution against excluding \n     communications media from the full protection of the first \n     amendment. To do so with today's electronic information \n     technologies would create an exception that would make the \n     rule of freedom of expression meaningless.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe the Exon amendment, unfortunately, does \ncreate such an exception, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nlanguage and support, as an alternative, the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote accordingly when we vote. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I have been listening with keen interest to my friends and \ncolleagues, the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Wisconsin. I \nhope that they will listen very carefully to some of the things this \nSenator has to say, because everything that they have brought up are \nthings that I considered very long and very hard when I started working \non this difficult situation a year ago. Nothing they said is new. I \njust think they are, without malice aforethought, putting some spin on \nthe Exon-Coats amendment that simply is not there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd and Senator Heflin both be \nadded as original cosponsors to the Exon-Coats amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate very much Senator Byrd and Senator Heflin, two \nvery distinguished lawyers, the latter, Senator Heflin, being the \nformer chief justice of the supreme court of Alabama. I think both of \nthem would not be a cosponsor of this Exon-Coats amendment unless they \nfelt it had adequate constitutional safeguards.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letters in support of the Exon-Coats amendment be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The first is from the Christian Coalition headed: ``Senators Exon and \nCoats Have Joined the Efforts. Support the Exon-Coats Antipornography \nAmendment.'' And we have the support of that organization.\n  Next, a letter from the National Coalition for the Protection of \nChildren and Families that has essentially the same message in \ndifferent words.\n  Next, Mr. President, a reference that Senator Coats made earlier in \nhis excellent presentation. I pause for just a moment to thank him for \nall of his help and cooperation and for the excellent, forthright, \nfactual statement he made in explaining what we are attempting to do \nand how seriously we consider this to be. That is why we are acting. \nSenator Coats mentioned the chamber of commerce supports this \nlegislation. I have a letter from the chamber of commerce that I \nlikewise will include in the unanimous-consent request.\n  Next is the Family Research Council, along the same general line.\n  Next is a news release from the National Law Center for Children and \nFamilies, of Fairfax, VA, that follows the same general category.\n  Last but not least, a news release from Women of America Say ``Enough \nIs Enough.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senators Exon and Coats Have Joined Their Efforts. Support the Exon-\n                    Coats Anti-Pornography Amendment\n\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: You may have received an earlier letter from \n     the Christian Coalition urging your support for the Coats \n     amendment to S. 652, the Telecommunications Reform Act. We \n     are pleased to see that the competing versions of anti-\n     pornography legislation proposed by Senators James Exon and \n     Dan Coats have subsequently been reconciled into a joint \n     amendment. I write you now to urge your support for this \n     bipartisan computer pornography amendment.\n       Pornography on the computer superhighway has become so \n     prevalent and accessible to children that it necessitates \n     congressional action. The comprehensive telecommunications \n     legislation which the Senate is currently debating is an \n     appropriate vehicle to address this critical problem, and we \n     urge the Senate not to let this opportunity go by.\n       Although Senator Patrick Leahy and others may urge that the \n     matter be referred to the U.S. Department of Justice for its \n     review and analysis, we oppose such a course of action. The \n     increasing existence of computer pornography today requires \n     action, not more study.\n       On behalf of the 1.6 million members and supporters of the \n     Christian Coalition, we urge you to support the Exon-Coats \n     amendment when it comes to the Senate floor. Thank you for \n     your attention to our concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Brian C. Lopina,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Governmental Affairs Office.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        National Coalition for the\n\n\n                            Protection of Children & Families,\n\n                                    Cincinnati, OH, June 13, 1995.\n     Hon. James Exon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: I am writing you on behalf of the \n     National Coalition for the Protection of Children & Families \n     to offer our strong support for your willingness to introduce \n     an amendment, along with Senator Coats, to the Telecom \n     legislation dealing with the problem of children's access to \n     pornography on computer networks. We believe that such \n     legislation is vital to the well being of our nation's most \n     important resource, its children.\n       Unless the problem of computer pornography is addressed \n     now, millions of children will have access to the worst and \n     most violent forms of pornography via computer networks and \n     the Internet. Currently, almost any child with access to the \n     Internet can quickly download and view bestiality, torture, \n     rape, mutilation, bondage, necrophilia and other unspeakable \n     acts. The pornography industry has opened up a free store on \n     the Internet and invited our children to get whatever they \n     want. Pornographers have no right to hijack Cyberspace, which \n     offers a host of promising technologies which should be \n     available to children and families without fear of \n     encountering violent, degrading pornography. Our society now \n     faces a fundamental choice of whether we really believe that \n     the Internet is a public network where children will be \n     welcome, or rather, one which belongs just to pornographers \n     and their consumers.\n       We have had the opportunity to review the language of the \n     ``Exon-Coats'' amendment in detail. We believe your careful \n     approach to amending the telecommunications legislation is \n     constitutional, wisely tailored to help protect children from \n     this heinous material, and effective in navigating complex \n     court precedents in this area.\n       Thank you for your willingness to address these critical \n     issues. Your leadership on this issue is a great service to \n     the world's children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Deen Kaplan,\n     Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1995.\n     Members of the United States Senate:\n       On behalf of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Federation of \n     215,000 business members, 3,000 state and local chambers of \n     commerce, 1,200 trade and professional associations, and 72 \n     American Chambers of Commerce abroad, we strongly urge your \n     support for the amendment to be offered by Senators Exon (D-\n     NE) and Coats (R-IN) to S. 652, the ``Telecommunications \n     Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995,'' regarding \n     revisions to the Communications Decency Act.\n       The Exon-Coats amendment firmly protects children against \n     obscene, indecent, and other types of objectionable \n     communications. It also preserves the interests of business \n     users of information systems. The language is rightfully \n     targeted to reach and prosecute the ``bad actors'' who \n     exploit the capabilities of information technologies to reach \n     children and unconsenting adults, [[Page S8338]] which we \n     support fully. Yet adequate defenses and safe harbors are \n     provided to ensure that American businesses can utilize these \n     telecommunications-based products and services to enhance \n     their competitiveness, address major business problems such \n     as employee training and customer service, and reach new \n     domestic and global market shares and suppliers--without \n     fearing unintended or uncertain liabilities flowing from the \n     actions of others.\n       Unlike some previous proposals, this legislation provides \n     the certainty that businesses need to ensure that they can \n     employ online information technologies. The absence of this \n     certainty would create a broad and potent disincentive, \n     especially for small businesses, to the use of online systems \n     and the interconnection of private business systems with the \n     NII. The Chamber membership is calling on Congress to enact \n     telecommunications reform legislation to enhance our \n     children's lives and our business' productivity. This \n     amendment does both.\n       Please vote ``Yes'' for the Exon-Coats amendment to S. 652.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Family Research Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 1995.\n       Dear Senator: I wrote to you last week with my concern \n     about the pending anti-pornography amendments to the \n     Telecommunications Bill and urging your support of the \n     proposed Coats Amendment. Last night, Senator Exon agreed to \n     join Senator Coats in his legislative approach against the \n     obscenity and indecency polluting cyberspace. The Family \n     Research Council commends these Senators for their \n     willingness to take a stand on this unpopular issue. Today or \n     tomorrow, the Exon-Coats Amendment will be offered which will \n     criminalize commercial and non-commercial distribution of \n     hard-core pornography through computers, as well as keep all \n     forms of pornography out of the hands of the most vulnerable \n     ``Net surfers''--our children.\n       I urge you to support the Exon-Coats Amendment to eliminate \n     ``cyberspace'' as a safe haven for pornographers.\n       The Exon-Coats Amendment breaks new legal ground in the \n     fight against porn by criminalizing ``free'' obscenity traded \n     on the Internet, and by making it illegal to make indecent \n     material available to children.\n       Importantly, the Exon-Coats Amendment still addresses the \n     problem of porn on basic cable packages. It will prohibit \n     cable programmers from forcing upon families channels which \n     feature indecent programs when they sign up for cable. The \n     indecent channels will be provided only upon specific \n     request.\n       Computer pornography is the next great threat to our \n     children's hearts and minds. I commend Senator Coats and \n     Senator Exon for fighting an evil which transcends party \n     lines.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Gary L. Bauer,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\nSupport Exon-Coats Computer Porn Amendment Says National Law Center for \n                         Children and Families\n\n       The National Law Center for Children and Families (``NLC'') \n     is a non-profit legal advice organization which supports law \n     enforcement and governmental agencies in the prosecution and \n     improvement of federal and state laws dealing with obscenity \n     and the protection of children. NLC's Chief Counsel, Bruce \n     Taylor, feels that today's version of the ``Exon-Coats'' \n     amendment is both effective and constitutional. It would \n     criminalize the distribution of obscenity on the burgeoning \n     computer service networks, such as the ``Internet'', ``Use \n     Net'', and ``World Wide Web''. The amendment also \n     criminalizes the knowing distribution of ``indecent'' \n     material to minor children. Both provisions cover \n     noncommercial, as well as commercial, transmissions. This is \n     important, since present law does not cover indecency to \n     minors except for commercial dial-porn messages over the \n     phone lines. Also, the Exon-Coats amendment would clearly \n     cover all distributions of hard-core obscenity over the \n     computer networks, whereas existing law has been enforced \n     only against commercial sales of obscenity by common carrier \n     and computer.\n       The vast amount of hard-core pornography on today's \n     computer bulletin boards is placed there indiscriminately by \n     ``porn pirates'' who post freely available pictures of \n     violence, rape, bestiality, torture, excretory functions, \n     group sex, and other forms of hard and soft core pornography \n     which are as available to teenager computer users as to men \n     who\n      are addicted to pornography. A tough federal law is needed \n     to deter such unprotected and viciously harmful activity \n     and the Exon-Coats bill does just that, making such \n     activity a felony punishable by up to two years in prison \n     and $100,000 in fines.\n       Many of the previous provisions of the Exon bill were \n     criticized by pro-family groups as too lenient and providing \n     too many defenses for pornographers, as well as for the on-\n     line computer service access providers, such as Prodigy, \n     CompuServe, NETCOM, and America On Line. The present version \n     of the Exon-Coats amendment would exempt the phone company \n     carriers and computer access providers only to the extent \n     that they provide mere access for users to connect to the \n     services and boards of other companies and individuals beyond \n     their control. To the extent any phone or computer access \n     company would offer obscenity on their own boards, they would \n     be as liable as anyone else. Likewise for making indecent \n     material available to minors under age 18, if they do it--\n     they are liable, but if they don't do it--they aren't liable \n     if someone else does it. This puts the primary criminal \n     liability on those who distribute obscenity to anyone and on \n     those who make indecency available to minors without taking \n     reasonable steps to limit it to adults. Although some people \n     and groups may feel that the phone and computer access \n     providers should bear responsibility for the traffic in \n     obscenity and indecency that is available to minors, there \n     are Constitutional limitations that apply by law to any act \n     of Congress in these regards. One, regulations to protect \n     minors from indecent speech must be the ``least restrictive \n     means'' to protect minors while allowing adults access to \n     non-obscene speech. Second, the law cannot impose strict \n     liability for obscenity. The Exon-Coats amendment is designed \n     to satisfy both constitutional requirements, while still \n     providing a serious criminal deterrent to those who would put \n     obscenity onto the computer nets or who would publicly post \n     indecent materials within easy reach of children.\n       The amendment, therefore, contains ``good faith'' defenses \n     that would allow any company, carrier, internet connector, or \n     private individual to create reasonable and effective ways to \n     screen children out of adult conversations and allow adults \n     to use indecent, nonobscene, speech among adults. This should \n     encourage the access providers to take steps to enforce \n     corporate responsibility and family friendly policies and \n     monitor their systems against abuse. When they do take such \n     steps, the good faith defense would protect them from \n     becoming liable for unfound or unknown abuses by others, and \n     that is all we think the law can ask of them at this point. \n     There is only so much that can be done in a way that is \n     ``technically feasible'' at any point in time, and the Exon-\n     Coats bill would not require anyone to take steps that are \n     not technically feasible and does not, and should not, expect \n     anyone to take all steps that may be technically possible. \n     This bill would also allow the States to enforce their own \n     obscenity and ``harmful to minors'' laws against the \n     pornographers and porn pirates. If the chose to regulate the \n     carriers and connectors, they would be bound by the Supremacy \n     Clause of the Constitution and the First Amendment to using \n     consistent measures. This is not inconsistent with existing \n     requirements for the States to meet under any criminal law. \n     The joint role of federal and state prosecution of those who \n     distribute the obscenity, and indecency to minors, is thus \n     preserved.\n       The good faith defense also allows responsible users and \n     providers to utilize the existing regulations from the F.C.C. \n     for dial-porn systems until such time as the F.C.C. makes new \n     regulations specifically for the computer networks. This \n     means that a company or individual who takes a credit card, \n     pin number, or access code would be protected under present \n     F.C.C. rules if a minor stole his parent's Visa card or dad's \n     porn pin number. In other words, some responsibility still \n     resides with parents to watch what\n      their kids are watching on the computer. This is serious \n     business and there is a lot of very harmful pornography on \n     the ``Internet'', so parents better take an interest in \n     what their children have access to, but cannot expect \n     every one else to solve the entire problem for them. \n     Federal law can make it a crime to post hard-core \n     obscenity on the computer boards, but many people are \n     willing to break that law. The porn pirates are posting \n     the kind of porn that hasn't been sold by the pornography \n     syndicate in their ``adult'' bookstores in nearly 20 \n     years. This law should deter them from doing that any \n     longer and it would allow federal prosecutors to charge \n     them for it now.\n       The defenses to indecency are available to every one, so \n     that every one has a chance to act responsibly as adults in \n     protecting children from indecency. This is what the Supreme \n     Court will require for the indecency provisions to be upheld \n     as ``least restrictive'' under the First Amendment. \n     Conversely, no one has a defense to obscenity when they \n     distribute or make obscenity available. The only exception to \n     this is for the carriers and connectors in their role as mere \n     access connectors, only then would they be exempt from the \n     obscenity traffic of others. However, if the on-line service \n     providers go beyond solely providing access, and attempt to \n     pander or conspire with pornographers, for instance, then \n     they would lose their obscenity exemption and be liable along \n     with every one else. This is a limited remedy to prevent the \n     bill from causing a ``prior restraint'' on First Amendment \n     rights. This bill would be nothing at all if it were struck \n     down or enjoined before it could be used against those who \n     are posting, selling, and disseminating all the pornography \n     on the computer networks.\n       There has been some criticism that this bill in adopting \n     good faith defenses, would make it ineffectual and that this \n     would weaken the bill in the same way that the existing dial-\n     porn law is not completely effective. We disagree. The \n     defenses in the dial-porn law were necessary to having that \n     law upheld by the courts. Without them, it was struck down by \n     the Supreme Court. Only after the F.C.C. provided its \n     technical screening defenses was the law upheld by the \n     federal appeals courts. This law adopts those \n     [[Page S8339]] constitutionally required measures for \n     indecency and for obscenity only for the mere access \n     providers. The dial-porn law has removed the pre-recorded \n     message services from the phone lines. The pornographers have \n     gone to live credit card calls. To the extent they are still \n     obscene, they can and should be prosecuted by the Department \n     of Justice, with the help of the F.B.I. That is what it will \n     take to remove the rest of the illegal dial-porn services. \n     The most ineffective part of the dial-porn law is not the \n     F.C.C. defenses, they are fine. What is broken is the phone \n     company defense in the statute, 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(c)(2)(B), \n     that allows the bell companies to rely on ``the lack of any \n     representation by a provider'' of dial-porn that the provider \n     is offering illegal messages. This means that if the dial-\n     porn company does not tell the phone company that the \n     messages are obscene or going to children as indecency, then \n     the phone company doesn't have to block all the dial-porn \n     lines until an adult subscribes in writing. This is not \n     workable and should be fixed by Congress. The dial-porn law \n     should also be amended to give good faith reliance only on a \n     false representation by a dial-porn provider. If the phone \n     company doesn't know about a dial-porn service, then they \n     should not be responsible. However, the phone company should \n     block all the dial-porn lines and only unblock them on adult \n     request. This is the provision that is causing the phone \n     companies not to act, not the F.C.C. defenses. There is no \n     such provision in the Exon-Coats amendment that would allow \n     the carriers or connectors to wait for the pornographers to \n     confess guilt before they must act. If they know, they must \n     act in good faith. No more, no less. This computer porn law \n     is, therefore, better than the existing dial-porn law in that \n     respect.\n       This amendment would allow federal prosecutions against the \n     pornographers and porn pirates immediately, thus removing \n     much of the hard-core material from the networks that the \n     carriers would be providing access to anyway. This can't wait \n     several months or years. If Congress has to exempt the \n     connectors as long as they merely carry the signal and \n     otherwise act in good faith, then so be it. It they abuse it, \n     then Congress can take that break away when it is shown that \n     they don't deserve it. In the meantime, this law will give \n     federal law enforcement agencies a tool to get at those who \n     are responsible for distributing the obscenity that we all \n     complain of right now. It is a good and constitutional law \n     and arguments that it is not enough are not true, not \n     realistic, and could cause Congress to bypass this \n     opportunity to enact an effective remedy to protect the \n     public and our children from this insidious problem. Senators \n     Exon and Coats have done an admirable and honorable job in \n     forcing this issue to a resolution. They have agreed to a \n     tough and fair law, with reasonable exemptions and defenses \n     for legitimate and good faith interests. The effective role \n     of alternative measures, like that of Senators Grassley and \n     Dole, cannot be overlooked as part of the pressure that \n     brought this matter to a successful point. The efforts to \n     kill all effective action, such as the pornography protection \n     and delay the bill of Senator Leahy of Vermont would offer to \n     forego a criminal bill in favor of more ``study'', must be \n     rejected as unreasonable and Congress should act immediately \n     to criminalize obscenity on the computer networks and forbid \n     indecent material being sent or made available to minors.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               ``Enough Is Enough!''

Mr. President, let me now, if I might, go into some matters \nthat I think are tremendously important.\n  First, I notice that my friend and colleague from Vermont indicated \nhe has some 25,000 signatures that he has piled up on the desk down \nthere from people who support his efforts, and his efforts are \nsupported, of course, by my friend and colleague from Wisconsin.\n  What they propose to do with the underlying amendment is to punt, to \nrecognize there is a problem that they both have, but what they are \nsuggesting we do is just delay a punt.\n  We come from the football State of Nebraska. That is what the \nNebraska football team does, Mr. President. Fourth down and 32 yards to \ngo on their own 3-yard line, they always punt, except when they are \ndown near the end of the game and they recognize the serious situation \nthat they might be in and they might not get the ball back. Then they \ndo not punt. They move aggressively forward, which is what we are \ntrying to do in the thoughtful manner embodied in the Exon-Coats \nproposal.\n  Those people that my friend and colleague from Vermont is supporting \nin carrying the ball would be interested in knowing, I am sure, what \ngenerated many of those letters that have been offered in debate by the \nSenator from Vermont.\n  I happen to have a copy of a letter in this regard, which generated \nmany of those letters, provided to me by my grandson. My grandson is 25 \nyears old, and he is old enough to take care of himself. But he thought \nthat I would be interested in this. This is a letter that has been \nwidely distributed on the e-mail system. It says: ``The obscenity of \ndecency. With the introduction of Senator J.J. Exon's Communications \nDecency Act, the barbarians are really at the gate.''\n  I have been called many things in my life, but never before have I \nbeen called a barbarian. I would hope that the Senator from Vermont \nwould advise the people that he is using here as support for his \nposition that his mutual friend, Jim Exon, is not a barbarian under any \nnormally accepted definition of the term.\n  Let me go into some of the things that I have been hearing and \nlistening to and attempt, as best I can, to maybe straighten out some \nof the concerns that I think are very real and sincere, as stated by my \ncolleague from Vermont and my colleague from the State of Wisconsin.\n  First, let me say that the Exon-Coats amendment does not destroy, \ndoes not retard, does not chill accepted information, pictures, or \nspeech. To the contrary. We are trying to make the Internet system, \nwhich is displayed here on this chart before me, safer, better, and to \nmake it more frequently used.\n  I do not know the authenticity of the statement that I am about to \nmake. But I have read that it has been estimated that up to 75 percent, \nMr. President, of present computer owners have refused to join the \nInternet system with their home computer, precisely because they know \nand they fear--and evidently they have seen or been advised as to what \nI have here in the blue book. Once again, before anyone votes against \nthe Exon-Coats amendment, if they are interested, I am willing to share \nthis information with them. It has pictures in it that were taken \ndirectly off the Internet system last week. So I simply say we are not \ntrying to destroy, we are not trying to retard and we are certainly not \ntrying to chill the great system that is the Internet. Anyone who \nbelieves that is very badly misinformed.\n  I have also heard a great deal today about the parents' \nresponsibilities, which, I guess, means that the parents that have such \nresponsibilities must follow their children around all of the time. \nThis is not simply something that the children have available to them \nat home. More likely, they are going to be introduced to it not at \nhome, but in the schools. We have just made a concession in the \ntelecommunications bill before us to give the schools and libraries a \nbreak, if you will, because we want them involved in this. The schools \nwill be sources of the information that Senator Coats and I have been \ndescribing. The library is a place where they can pick it up. We also \ntalk about some of the software and the off-limits proposition that \nsome of the software may or may not provide.\n  I simply say, Mr. President, that those who know what is going on \nwith the Internet today--those who have seen it firsthand, those who \nare concerned about making the Internet the greatest thing that has \never happened as far as communications exchange is concerned--are the \nones that are supporting the Exon-Coats amendment. We want to make it \neven bigger, and [[Page S8340]] we want to make it even better, but not \nfor raunchy pornography that would turn most people off. And to the \n25,000 people who want to call this Senator a barbarian, I simply say \nthat, evidently, they are so selfish--at least their actions are so \nselfish, that they simply say: We do not want to give up anything. We \nwant to be able to see what we want to see, where we want to see it, \nany time we want to see it.\n  I simply say that what we are trying to do is constructively make \nsome changes that are necessary. Let me review for just a moment, if I \ncan, and make sure that everyone understands what the Internet is all \nabout. The Internet, basically, is in the center of this chart or \ngraph. From listening to many of my colleagues today, those who do not \nsupport the Exon-Coats amendment, I think that they view this as the \nway the Internet is. First, you have a child at home or an adult at \nhome entering the Internet, and they have to buy that service from one \nof the many people who make money charging the entry into the Internet, \nwhere they have special provisions, special facilities which that \nparticular provider might apply.\n  In addition to that, they apply for entry into the massive Internet \nitself. From the Internet, the child or the adult can go worldwide. We \ncan go into all kinds of sources of information--the Library of \nCongress, any of the great universities, and all of the other massive \nsources of information. I think too many people believe that because \nthe pornography bulletin board is sitting out here to the side, that \nyou have to work to get to the pornography bulletin board. Mr. \nPresident, that is simply not the case. The pornographers have invaded \nthe Internet down here, so that it is freely available, without cost--\nall of the outlandish, disgusting, pornographic pictures of the worst \ntype, that some of my colleagues think we can handle by punting. This \nis not a time to punt; this is the time to act.\n  I want to bring reference to the fact that this is the system that \nthe Coats-Exon amendment is trying to create--one that is envisioned as \nthe way the Internet system works. Actually, the way the Internet \nsystem is working today--especially with regard to totally rampant \npornography--is that when the child or adult at home goes into the \nInternet system, all too often he is looking for something other than \nbasic information. He would have to pay if he wants to subscribe to the \npornography bulletin board. But, Mr. President, it goes both ways. \nThese people--the moneymakers on pornography up here--are feeding \ninformation because it can be fed free of charge into the Internet \nsystem. The pictures I have here in the blue book--there are a whole \nseries of them--were taken freely off of the Internet system free of \ncharge and readily available to anyone who has a computer and has the \nbasic knowledge.\n  What these pornographers do is place free-of-charge material on the \nInternet that is designed to lure people over to their bulletin board \nso they can maybe hook them into a monthly charge of some type, to have \navailable whenever they want from their pornography which is a library \nfull of everything you can imagine.\n  What they are doing is taking previews of what they have in here. \nThey are putting them, open and at large, on the Internet system for \nall people to see, not unlike, Mr. President, the previews of coming \nattractions that we see when we go to the movies. This is what we will \nsee next.\n  Obviously, many of the pictures, as evidenced by the blue book, are \nthings that are readily available. They, of course, have a way of \nreferencing back. If you like this picture, come into our porno shop \nover here. For a small fee, we will show you the real thing. The real \nthing is right here when it comes to pornography.\n  Mr. President, I simply say, once again, that while I am sure my \nfriend from Vermont and my friend from Wisconsin are sincere, I \nappreciate very much the very kind things that both have said about the \nefforts of this Senator and Senator Coats because we have brought \nattention to this.\n  It is the intention of the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from \nIndiana, though, now that we have called attention to it, we are going \nto do something about it. We do something about it in a fully \nconstitutional way. We are not going to trample on the constitutional \nrights of anyone.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could the Senator yield for a question, so \nwe can get a sense where we might be with time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not aware of any specific requests for \ntime from anyone on our side. We might be able to yield some time back.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would be happy to. I wanted to respond, \nas I am sure the Senator from Indiana realized I would, to a couple of \npoints.\n  Mr. COATS. We could get the word to Members.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I hope we can vote by 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have spoken before on the floor of my concerns with the \nExon-Coats amendment. Last Friday, my good friend from Nebraska, \nSenator Exon, filed a revised version of the Decency Act as amendment \nNo. 1268. The revisions made by Senator Exon reflect a diligent and \nconsidered effort by him and his staff to correct serious problems that \nthe Department of Justice, I and others have pointed out with this \nsection of the bill.\n  I commend Senator Exon for proposing in his amendment the striking of \nthe provision in the bill that would impose a blanket prohibition on \nwiretapping digital communications. This section would have totally \nundermined the legal authority for law enforcement to use court-\nauthorized wiretaps, one of the most significant tools in law \nenforcement's arsenal for fighting crime.\n  If that particular section were passed as introduced, the FBI would \nnot have been able to use court-ordered wiretaps to listen in on \ndigital calls made by kidnappers, terrorists, mobsters, or other \ncriminals. This is an excellent change that I heartily endorse.\n                 problems with senator exon's amendment\n\n  But, even with this fix, serious constitutional and practical \nproblems remain in Senator Exon's proposed legislation.\n  The first part of the amendment would make it a felony not only to \nsend obscene electronic messages to harass another person, but would \napply the same penalty to sending an e-mail message with an indecent or \nfilthy word that you hope will annoy another person.\n  For example, if someone sends you an annoying e-mail message and you \nrespond with a filthy, four-letter word, you may land in jail for 2 \nyears or with a $100,000 fine.\n  Under this amendment, no computer user will be able to send a private \nor public e-mail message with the seven dirty words in it. Who knows \nwhen any recipient will decide to feel annoyed by seeing a four-letter \nword online?\n  The second part of the amendment would make it a felony to send out \nor receive over computer networks any obscene material. There is no \nrequirement that the person soliciting and receiving the material knew \nit was obscene. This means that a computer user could be guilty of \ncommitting this crime at the moment of clicking to receive material, \nand before the user has looked at the material, let alone knows the \nmaterial to be, obscene.\n  This means that an adult sitting at his computer in the privacy of \nhis own home, who wants to get a copy--consistent with our copyright \nlaws--of a magazine article on stock car racing, could be subject to 2 \nyears in jail and a $100,000 fine for downloading the magazine, which \nunbeknownst to the user also contains obscene material.\n  This also means that if you are part of an online discussion group on \nrape victims, your computer is programmed to automatically download \nmessages sent into the discussion group. If a participant sends into \nthe group a graphic story about a rape, which could be deemed obscene, \nthis story will automatically be downloaded onto your computer, and you \nwould be criminally liable under this amendment, even before you read \nthe story.\n  This may mark the end of online discussion groups on the Internet, \nsince many users do not want to risk 2 years in jail because of what \nthey might receive from online discussion groups. This amendment would \nchill free speech and the free flow of information [[Page S8341]] over \nthe Internet and computer networks.\n  The amendment does give one out to users who meet some government, \nFCC determined standards to take steps to protect themselves from \nreceiving material the government has determined to be obscene or \nindecent.\n This may mean that any user with a connection to the Internet or an \nelectronic communications service may be required to go out and buy \nspecial FCC endorsed and expensive software programs to stop obscene \nmaterials from reaching their computers. That way they could show that \nthey have at least tried to avoid the receipt of obscene materials. \nOtherwise, they may risk criminal liability.\n\n  Take another example. What if a user wants to join a campaign to stop \nobscenity on computer networks, and sends out the message to others on \nthe campaign to send him examples of the obscene materials they are \nfighting to stop. Under this amendment, any receipt of these materials \nwould be a crime. If this amendment had been the law, when my good \nfriend from Nebraska collected the materials in his blue notebook, he \nwould have committed a felony.\n  How will anti-obscenity or pornography groups that now monitor online \nobscenity be able to do so without criminal liability?\n  The third part of Senator Exon's amendment would make it a felony to \npurposefully make available, either privately or publicly, any indecent \nmessage to a minor.\n  We all share my good friend's concern over the kind of material that \nmay be available and harmful to minors on the Internet and other online \ncomputer networks. But this provision is not the way to address the \nproblem.\n  Under this provision, no indecent speech could be used on electronic \nbulletin boards dedicated to political debates, since kids under 18 may \naccess these boards.\n  This will certainly insure that civility is reintroduced into our \npolitical discourse when we are online. But this also means that works \nof fiction, ranging from ``Lady Chatterly's Lover'' to Newt Gingrich's \nscience fiction novel ``1945,'' which contains some steamy scenes, \ncould not be put out on the Internet because of the risk that a minor \nmight download it. Rap music with bad words could not be distributed \nonline.\n This provision would censor the Internet in a way that threatens to \nchill our first amendment rights on electronic communications systems.\n\n  Under the amendment offered by my good friend from Nebraska, those of \nus who are users of computer e-mail and other network systems would \nhave to speak as if we were in Sunday School every time we went on-\nline.\n  I, too, support raising our level of civility in communications in \nthis country, but not with a government sanction and possible prison \nsentence when someone uses an expletive. All users of Internet and \nother information services would have to clean up their language when \nthey go on-line, whether or not they are communicating with children.\n  There is no question that we are now living through a revolution in \ntelecommunications with cheaper, easier to use and faster ways to \ncommunicate electronically with people within our own homes and \ncommunities, and around the globe. A byproduct of this technical \nrevolution is that supervising our children takes on a new dimension of \nresponsibility.\n  Very young children are so adept with computers that they can sit at \na keypad in front of a computer screen at home or at school and connect \nto the outside world through the Internet or some other on-line \nservice. Many of us are justifiably concerned about the accessibility \nof obscene and indecent materials on-line and the ability of parents to \nmonitor and control the materials to which their children are exposed.\n  But government regulation of the content of all computer \ncommunications, even private communications, under the rubric of \nprotecting kids and in violation of the first amendment is not the \nanswer.\n                             existing laws\n\n  One could get the incorrect idea that we in Congress have ignored the \nproblem of protecting kids from harms that could befall them from \nmaterials they get online. This could not be further from the truth. We \nhave a number of laws on the books that the Justice Department has \nsuccessfully used to prosecute child pornography and obscenity \ntransmitted over computer networks.\n  Our criminal laws already prohibit the sale or distribution over \ncomputer networks of obscene or filthy material--18 U.S.C. \nSec. Sec. 1465, 1466, 2252 and 2423(a). We already impose criminal \nliability for transmitting any threatening message over computer \nnetworks--18 U.S.C. Sec. 875(c). Our existing criminal laws also \ncriminalize the solicitation of minors over computers for any sexual \nactivity--18 U.S.C. Sec. 2452--and illegal luring of minors into sexual \nactivity through computer conversations--18 U.S.C. Sec. 2423(b). Just \nthis weekend, there were reports of two instances in which the FBI \nsuccessfully tracked down teenagers who were solicited online.\n  Congress took action 2 months ago to pass the Sexual Crimes Against \nChildren Prevention Act of 1995 to increase the penalties and make \nthese various laws even tougher.\n  Congress has not been ignoring this problem. This does not mean we \ncannot or should not do better. But, the problem of policing the \nInternet is complex and involves many important constitutional issues.\n\n\n                   leahy amendment requiring a study\n\n  The amendment I am offering with Senators Kerrey, Feingold, and \nMoseley-Braun would require a study by the Department of Justice, in \nconsultation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, on how we can \nempower parents and users of interactive telecommunications systems.\n  We should examine the recommendations of these experts before we \nstart imposing liability in ways that could severely damage electronic \ncommunications systems, sweep away important constitutional rights, and \npossibly undercut law enforcement at the same time.\n  We should avoid quick fixes today that would interrupt and limit the \nrapid evolution of electronic information systems--for the public \nbenefit far exceeds the problems it invariably creates by the force of \nits momentum.\n  A number of groups support the approach of the Leahy study, including \ncivil liberties groups, librarians, online providers, newspaper \neditors, and others. I ask that a list of the supporters of the Leahy \nstudy be placed in the Record.\n  An electronic petition has been circulated on the Internet for the \npast few weeks. Over 35,000 people have signed on in support of the \nLeahy study, as an alternative to the proposed Communications Decency \nAct.\n  A number of organizations have signed onto the electronic petition to \nsupport the Leahy study as an alternative to Government content \nregulation of electronic communications. These organizations, including \nthe American Council for the Arts, Center for Democracy and Technology, \nVoters Telecommunications Watch, and others are helping to circulate \nthe petition. Anyone is allowed to sign it or circulate it--this is a \nfree country. Since May 19, when the petition was launched, over 35,000 \npeople have signed on.\n  The Leahy study approach is supported by civil liberties groups, \nlibrarians, online service providers and newspaper groups, including: \nAssociation of American Publishers [AAP]; Association of American \nUniversity Presses [AAUP]; The faculty of the City University of New \nYork; Interactive Working Group; Online Operators Policy Committee of \nthe Interactive Services Association; American Advertising Federation; \nAmerican Association of Advertising Agencies; and American Library \nAssociation.\n  Also American Society of Newspaper Editors; Association of National \nAdvertisers, Inc.; Association of Research Libraries; Business Software \nAlliance; Center for Democracy and Technology; Computer and \nCommunications Industry Association; Direct Marketing Association; \nElectronic Frontier Foundation; Feminists For Free Expression; Magazine \nPublishers of America; Media Access Project; National Public \nTelecomputing Network; Newspaper Association of America; People For the \nAmerican Way Action Fund; Recreational Software Advisory Counsel; \nSoftware Publishers Association; and Times Mirror.\n  I have also asked a coalition of industry and civil liberties groups, \ncalled [[Page S8342]] the Interactive Working Group, to address the \nlegal and technical issues for policing electronic interactive \nservices.\n  There is no question that we need to educate parents about the types \nof materials available on the Internet which they may want to stop \ntheir children from accessing. By focusing attention on this issue, \nSenator Exon's efforts to legislate in this area have already made \nstrides in alerting parents to the material available online that may \nbe harmful to kids, such as the Internet, to control the material \ntransmitted to them over those systems. We must find ways to do this \nthat do not invite invasions of privacy, lead to censorship of private \nonline communications, and undercut important constitutional \nprotections.\n  Before legislating to impose Government regulation on the content of \ncommunications in this enormously complex area, I feel we need more \ninformation from law enforcement and telecommunications experts. My \nbill calls for just such a fast-track study of this issue.\n  Mr. President, I tell my good friend from Nebraska, I hope he \nrealizes I would never call him a barbarian. We know each other too \nwell and we are too good of friends for that.\n  I have to admit, when he talks about football, he has the good grace \nto live in a State where the team has had some modicum of success. He \nhas rightly achieved bragging rights on that.\n  But when he talks about punting on this, with all due respect, Mr. \nPresident, I believe the Exon-Coats amendment punts, because it punts \nto the FCC the task of finding ways to restrict minors' access to \nindecent communications so users can implement them and have a defense \nto criminal prosecution.\n  What we have to understand is that nobody in this place wants to give \npornography to children. I do not. The distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, all who have spoken on this issue this \nafternoon, none wants to give pornography to children.\n  Many Members also do not want to destroy the Internet as we try to \nfind how to do protect children from harmful material on the Internet. \nWe can accomplish the goal of keeping pornography from children without \nputting on a huge Government layer of censorship and without destroying \nthe Internet.\n  Now, my friend from Nebraska says his amendment takes the same \napproach as the dial-a-porn statute. Not really. On dial-a-porn, it \ntook 10 years of litigation for the FCC to find a way to implement the \ndial-a-porn statute in a constitutional way. That is why I say his \namendment punts to the FCC the task of finding ways to restrict.\n  Why not instead follow the Leahy amendment, which will require a \nstudy, a group of experts, an accelerated legislative path, so that we \nwill pass responsible legislation that will not be attacked \nconstitutionally for years thereafter.\n  I note that the House Commerce Committee adopted basically the Leahy \nstudy in its markup of the House telecommunications legislation. This \nwas Republicans and Democrats, across the political spectrum, trying to \nfind the best way to handle this. They did what I have recommended \nhere.\n  In fact, some provisions in my friend's amendment could hurt \nprosecution of those who are not law-abiding users of the Internet but \nuse it to distribute obscenity and child pornography.\n  As a former prosecutor, I want prosecutors to have the best tools to \ngo after criminals. I received a letter today from the Justice \nDepartment that makes several points. They say a study of the issue is \nneeded. They also confirm that the Exon proposal would regulate \nindecent speech between consenting adults. And, third, the defenses in \nthis proposal would undermine the ability of the Justice Department to \nprosecute online service providers even though they knowingly profit \nfrom the distribution of obscenity and child pornography.\n  The Department says, ``We still have concerns. We continue to believe \nthat comprehensive review should be undertaken to guide the response to \nthe problems the Communications Decency Act seeks to address.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I write to respond to your letter of \n     March 1, 1995 concerning our prosecution of violations of \n     federal child pornography and obscenity laws and your April \n     21, 1995 request for the views of the United States \n     Department of Justice on the ``Communications Decency Act,'' \n     which has been incorporated as title IV of the proposed \n     ``Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of \n     1995,'' S. 652. In accordance with your request, the analysis \n     of the Communications Decency Act focuses on sections 402 and \n     405 of the bill.\n       The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed, \n     successfully prosecuted violations of federal child \n     pornography and obscenity laws which were perpetrated with \n     computer technology. In addition we have applied current law \n     to this emerging problem while also discovering areas where \n     the new technology may present challenges to successful \n     prosecution. While we agree with the goal of various \n     legislative proposals designed to keep obscenity and child \n     pornography off of the information superhighway, we are \n     currently developing a legislative proposal that will best \n     meet these challenges and provide additional prosecutorial \n     tools. This legislative package is being developed while \n     taking into consideration the need to protect fundamental \n     rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n       With respect to the Communications Decency Act, while we \n     understand that section 402 is intended to provide users of \n     online services the same protection against obscene and \n     harassing communications afforded to telephone subscribers, \n     this provision would not accomplish that goal. Instead, it \n     would significantly thwart enforcement of existing laws \n     regarding obscenity and child pornography, create several \n     ways for distributors and packagers of obscenity and child \n     pornography to avoid criminal liability, and threaten \n     important First Amendment and privacy rights.\n       Similarly, while we understand that section 405 of this \n     bill is intended to expand privacy protections to ``digital'' \n     communications, such communications are already protected \n     under existing law. Moreover, this provision would have the \n     unintended consequences of jeopardizing law enforcement's \n     authority to conduct lawful, court-ordered wiretaps and would \n     prevent system administrators from protecting their systems \n     when they are under attack by computer hackers.\n       Despite the flaws in these provisions, the Administration \n     applauds the primary goal of this legislation: prevent \n     obscenity from being widely transmitted over \n     telecommunications networks to which minors have access. \n     However, the legislation raises complex policy issues that \n     merit close examination prior to Congressional action. We \n     recommend that a comprehensive review be undertaken of \n     current laws and law enforcement resources for prosecuting \n     online obscenity and child pornography, and the technical \n     means available to enable parents and users to control the \n     commercial and noncommercial communications they receive over \n     interactive telecommunications systems.\n       The following are the Department's primary objections to \n     sections 402 and 405 of the pending telecommunications bill:\n       First, section 402 of the bill would impose criminal \n     sanctions on the transmission of constitutionally protected \n     speech. Specifically, subsections 402(a)(1) and (b)(2) of the \n     bill would criminalize the transmission of indecent \n     communications, which are protected by the First Amendment. \n     In Sable Communications of Cal. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), \n     the Supreme Court ruled that any restrictions on the content \n     of protected speech in media other than broadcast media must \n     advance a compelling state interest and be accomplished by \n     the ``least restrictive means.'' By relying on technology \n     relevant only to 900 number services, section 402 fails to \n     take into account less restrictive alternatives utilizing \n     existing and emerging technologies which enable parents and \n     other adult users to control access to content.\n       Nearly ten years of litigation, along with modifications of \n     the regulations, were necessary before the current statute as \n     applied to audiotext services, or ``dial-a-porn'' calling \n     numbers, was upheld as constitutional. See Dial Information \n     Services v. Thornburg, 938 F. 2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991). The \n     proposed amendment in section 402 of the bill would \n     jeopardize the enforcement of the existing dial-a-porn \n     statute by inviting additional constitutional challenges, \n     with the concomitant diversion of law enforcement resources.\n       Second, the definition of ``knowingly'' in section 402 of \n     the bill would cripple obscenity prosecutions. Under \n     subsection 402(e), only those persons with ``actual \n     knowledge'' of the ``specific content of the communication'' \n     could be held criminally liable. This definition would make \n     it difficult, if not impossible, to prove guilt, and the \n     standard is higher than the prevailing knowledge requirements \n     under existing obscenity and child sexual exploitation \n     statutes. Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 629 (1973), \n     the [[Page S8343]] government must only prove that a person \n     being prosecuted under an obscenity statute had knowledge of \n     the general nature of the material being distributed. Large-\n     scale distributors of child pornography and other obscene \n     materials--among the most egregious violators--do not read or \n     view each obscene item they distribute. The proposed \n     definition in subsection 402(e) would make it nearly \n     impossible for the government to establish the necessary \n     knowledge requirement and would thereby severely handicap \n     enforcement of existing statutes.\n       Third, section 402 would add new terms and defenses that \n     would thwart ongoing enforcement of the dial-a-porn statute. \n     Currently, the government is vigorously enforcing the \n     existing dial-a-porn statute. It took more than ten years for \n     the government to be able to do so, due to constitutional \n     challenges. The proposed amendment to this statute \n     fundamentally changes its provisions and subjects it to \n     renewed constitutional attack which would hinder current \n     enforcement efforts.\n       Fourth, section 402 would do significant harm by inserting \n     new and sweeping defenses that may be applied to nullify \n     existing federal criminal statutes. The government currently \n     enforces federal criminal laws preventing the distribution \n     over computer networks of obscene and other pornographic \n     material that is harmful to minors (under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1465, 2252 & 2423(a)), the illegal solicitation of \n     a minor by way of a computer network (under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2252), and illegal ``luring'' of a minor into sexual \n     activity through computer conversations (under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2423(b)). These statutes apply to all methods of \n     ``distribution'' including over computer networks. The new \n     defenses proposed in subsection 402(d) would thwart ongoing \n     government obscenity and child sexual exploitation \n     prosecutions in several important ways:\n       The first defense under subsection 402(d)(1) would immunize \n     from prosecution ``any action'' by a defendant who operates a \n     computer bulletin board service as an outlet for the \n     distribution of pornography and obscenity so long as he does \n     not create or alter the material. In fact, this defense would \n     establish a system under which distributors of pornographic \n     material by way of computer would be subject to fewer \n     criminal sanctions than distributors of obscene videos, books \n     or magazines.\n       The second defense provided in subsection 402(d)(2) would \n     exculpate defendants who ``lacked editorial control over the \n     communications.'' Such a defense may significantly harm the \n     goal of ensuring that obscene or pornographic material is not \n     available on the Internet or other computer networks by \n     creating a disincentive for operators of public bulletin \n     board services to control the postings on their boards.\n      Moreover, persons who provide critical links in the \n     pornography and obscenity distribution chains by serving \n     as ``package fulfillment centers'' filling orders for \n     obscene materials, could assert the defense that they lack \n     the requisite ``editorial control.'' This proposed defense \n     would complicate prosecutions of entire obscenity \n     distribution chains.\n       The third defense provided in subsection 402(d)(3), \n     containing five subparts, would be available to pornographic \n     bulletin boards operators who take such innocuous steps as \n     (A) directing users to their ``on/off'' switches on their \n     computers as a ``means to restrict access'' to certain \n     communications; (B) warning, or advertising to, users that \n     they could receive obscene material; and (C) responding to \n     complaints about such minimum, this proposed defense would \n     lead to litigation over whether such actions constitute \n     ``good faith'' steps to avoid prosecution for violating the \n     section 402, and could thwart existing child pornography and \n     obscenity prosecutions.\n       The fourth defense provided in subsection 402(d)(4) would \n     exculpate defendants whose pornography business does not have \n     the ``predominate purpose'' of engaging in unlawful activity. \n     This defense would severely undercut law enforcement's \n     efforts to prosecute makers and distributors of noncommercial \n     pornography and obscenity.\n       The fifth defense provided in subsection 402(d)(5) would \n     preclude any cause of action from being brought against any \n     person who has taken good faith steps to, inter alia, \n     ``restrict or prevent the transmission of, or access to,'' a \n     communication deemed unlawful under section 402. This defense \n     would encourage intrusion by on-line service providers into \n     the private electronic mail communications of individual \n     users. The defense actually promotes intrusions into private \n     electronic mail by making it ``safer'' to monitor private \n     communications than to risk liability. At the same time, this \n     defense would defeat efforts by the government to enforce \n     federal privacy protections against illegal eavesdropping.\n       Finally, but no less significantly, section 405 amends the \n     federal wiretap statute in several respects, each of which \n     creates considerable problems. First, it amends the wiretap \n     statute to add the term ``digital'' to 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2511,\\1\\ without considering the effect of this \n     amendment on other statutory provisions. For example, 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1) provides that certain government \n     officials may authorize an application for a wiretap order \n     for wire or oral communications while 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(3) \n     provides that other government officials may authorize an \n     application for a wiretap order for electronic \n     communications. Since section 405 does not amend 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2516 to include the term ``digital,'' it would appear \n     that no government official has the authority to authorize an \n     application for a wiretap order for digital communications. \n     This is particularly problematic, since this investigative \n     tool is reserved for the most serious cases, including those \n     involving terrorists, organized crime, and narcotics.\n     \\1\\It should be noted that ``digital'' communications are \n     already covered by the wiretap statute. Under current law, a \n     ``digital'' communication is either a wire communication \n     under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(1) (if it contains voice) or an \n     ``electronic communication'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2510(12) \n     (if it does not contain voice). Since such communications are \n     already covered, the reason for enacting section 405 is \n     unclear, and it is difficult to predict how the courts will \n     interpret the amendment.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Equally disconcerting, the amendment serves to protect \n     computer hackers at the expense of all users of the National \n     Information Infrastructure (NII), including businesses, \n     government agencies and individuals. Prior to 1994, the \n     wiretap statute allowed electronic communication service \n     providers to monitor voice communications to protect their \n     systems from abuse. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2511(2)(a)(i) (1986 \n     version). Thus, when hackers attacked computer systems and \n     system administrators monitored these communications, they \n     had no clear statutory authority to do so. In October 1994, \n     Congress finally remedied this defect by amending 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2511(2)(a)(i) to permit the monitoring of electronic \n     (i.e., digital, non-voice) communications. If section 405 is \n     enacted and these hacker communications are deemed digital, \n     system administrators will once again be denied the statutory \n     authority to monitor hacker communications. It would be most \n     unfortunate if, at the same time Congress is encouraging the \n     widespread use of the NII, it passed a law giving system \n     administrator's a Hobson's choice: either allow hackers to \n     attack systems unobserved or violate federal law.\n       There are three other concerns as well. First, by adding \n     the term ``digital'' without amending the suppression \n     provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2515, voice communications--if \n     they are deemed ``digital''--will no longer be protected by \n     the statute's exclusionary rule. This would serve to reduce \n     the privacy protections for phone calls.\n       Second, section 405 would replace the words ``oral \n     communication'' with ``communication'' in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2511(1)(B). This would have undesirable consequences for \n     law enforcement because it would criminalize the interception \n     of communications as to which there was no reasonable \n     expectation of privacy.\\2\\\n     \\2\\The definition of ``oral communication'' in 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2510(2) contains a requirement that the communication to \n     be protected must have been made under circumstances \n     justifying an expectation of privacy.\n       From the law enforcement perspective, there is simply no \n     sound reason for eliminating this highly desirable feature of \n     present law. Additionally, the amendment might also impact \n     upon the news gathering process. For example, if the \n     conversation of two individuals shouting in a hotel room were \n     recorded by a news reporter standing outside the room, the \n     reporter would, under section 405, be violating the wiretap \n     statute. Under current law, of course, the individuals could \n     not complain about the recording because, by shouting loud \n     enough to be heard outside the room, they lack any reasonable \n     expectation of privacy.\n       Last, the provision in section 402(d)(5) provides that ``no \n     cause of action may be brought in any court * * * against any \n     person on account of any action which the person has taken in \n     good faith to implement a defense authorized under this \n     section. * * *'' This would seem to suggest that any person \n     can freely engage in electronic surveillance otherwise \n     prohibited by Title III so long as they claim to be \n     implementing a section 402 defense. As such, section \n     402(d)(5) severely weakens the privacy protections currently \n     offered by the wiretap statute.\n       In sum, sections 402 and 405 of the bill would hamper the \n     government's ongoing work in stopping the dissemination of \n     obscenity and child pornography and threaten law \n     enforcement's continued ability to use court-authorized \n     wiretaps. We believe that a comprehensive review be \n     undertaken to guide response to the problems that the \n     Communications Decency Act seeks to address.\n       I assure you that the Department is aware of the growing \n     use of computers to transmit and traffic obscenity and child \n     pornography. The Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and \n     Obscenity Section is aggressively investigating and \n     prosecuting the distribution of child pornography and \n     obscenity through computer networks, and the use of computers \n     to locate minors of the purpose of sexual exploitation. As we \n     have discussed with your staff in a meeting focussed on these \n     issues, we remain committed to an aggressive effort to halt \n     the use of computers to sexually exploit children and \n     distribute obscenity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kent Markus,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This is in response to your June 14, \n     1995 letter to me posing [[Page S8344]] questions about my \n     June 13 letter to Senator Exon concerning his proposed \n     Communications Decency Act.\n       My letter to Senator Exon commented on the version of his \n     proposal circulated in his ``dear colleague'' letter of June \n     7, 1995 (the ``Exon proposal''). Senator Exon had requested \n     that we comment on the extent to which that revised proposal \n     satisfied the concerns I detailed to you in my May 3 letter. \n     The letter does not address the Exon-Coats proposal, which we \n     had not seen nor were aware of until today. We have just \n     begun to review this new proposal.\n       As stated in my letter to Senator Exon, his proposal still \n     raises a number of complex legal and policy issues that call \n     for in-depth analysis prior to congressional action. Because \n     we still have concerns, we continue to believe that a \n     comprehensive review should be undertaken to guide response \n     to the problems the Communications Decency Act seeks to \n     address.\n       Among these concerns are constitutional questions raised \n     primarily by the lack of scienter required for the age \n     element of subsection (e) of the Exon proposal. In our view, \n     this subsection would consequently have the effect of \n     regulating indecent speech between consenting adults.\\1\\ \n     Subsection (a) does not have the same constitutional \n     infirmity because of the specific intent requirement that the \n     communication be done ``with intent to annoy, abuse, \n     threaten, or harass * * *'', which we believe is inconsistent \n     with the concept of ``consenting adults.''\n     \\1\\Subsection (e) of the Exon-Coats measure exacerbates the \n     constitutional concerns because it is even more expansive \n     than the similar subsection (e) in the Exon proposal.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As described in my June 13 letter, we continue to have a \n     concern with the ``knowledge'' requirements that were re-\n     inserted in the Exon proposal as defenses for certain \n     parties.\n       The defenses included in the Exon proposal would undermine \n     the ability of the Department of Justice to prosecute an on-\n     line service provider even though it knowingly profits from \n     the distribution of obscenity or child pornography.\\2\\ \n     Although the existence of the defenses in the Exon proposal \n     would make prosecutions under the proposal's offenses \n     difficult, if not impossible, they would not threaten \n     obscenity prosecutions under existing statutes.\n     \\2\\The defense in subsection (f)(1) of the Exon-Coats measure \n     is particularly problematic as it focusses on whether the \n     service provider has control over the bulletin board service. \n     If the provider does not have control, regardless of whether \n     it has guilty knowledge or intent, it is immune from \n     prosecution.\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kent Markus,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me conclude with this: No Member \ndisagrees that we want to keep smut out of the hands of our children. I \nwould remind everybody that the Internet has become the tremendous \nsuccess it is because it did not have Big Brother, the Federal \nGovernment, trying to micromanage what it does and trying to tell users \nwhat it could do.\n  If the Government had been in charge of figuring out how to expand \nthe Internet or make it more available and so on, I guarantee it would \nnot be one-tenth the success it is today.\n  In our appropriate zeal to go after child pornographers, let the \nSenate not kill the Internet or smother it for the 99.9 percent of the \npeople who use it legitimately, the scholars who use it legitimately, \nthe people who use it for legitimate on-line discussion groups, the \npeople who gather information from it, the constituents who use it to \ncontact my office and other offices, and those who find a way to access \ninformation that they have never had before in their lives.\n  That is why, Mr. President, earlier I printed in the Record a list of \neverybody from librarians to publishers to newspaper editors to civil \nliberties groups who support my alternative approach in my amendment.\n  I am perfectly willing, if the managers are here and they want to \nmove forward, to yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of \nour time, I think about 20 minutes. All I need to do is insert some \nadditional material in the Record. If I could have 1 more minute, I \nwould be prepared to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I thank my friend from Vermont for mentioning the Nebraska football \nagain. I had a letter from Tom Osborne, the head football coach at the \nUniversity of Nebraska, who wrote, ``Dear Jim: Thank you for what you \nare doing. I hope you are successful in passing the legislation.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Osborne letter be printed in the \nRecord, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record ``No \nTime to Study.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Nebraska Football,\n\n                                   Lincoln, NE, February 10, 1995.\n     Senator Exon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: Thanks so much for what you are doing in your \n     effort to stop pornography. I realize this is always a \n     somewhat unpopular issue to tackle, however, my experience \n     has been that pornography is tremendously damaging to young \n     people and women in particular.\n       I hope you are successful in passing the legislation.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                      Tom Osborne,\n     Head Football Coach.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                            No Time To Study\n\n       Further study does not solve the problem. The larger \n     telecommunications reform bill before the Senate will help \n     link up schools to new telecommunications services and \n     Internet services. As one of the Snowe-Rockefeller-Exon-\n     Kerrey amendment authors, I am very proud of that fact.\n       In addition, at least two Bell Companies plan to offer \n     Internet access as one of their common carrier services; \n     basic computer software manufacturers now offer ``easy \n     Internet access'' with their programs and thousands of homes \n     every day subscribe to new information service providers \n     which homes Internet access. Let's not lose sight of the fact \n     that this is a very good thing. This is a national policy \n     objective.\n       But let us not turn a blind eye to a very serious problem \n     of obscenity, indecency, electronic stalking and pornography \n     in the digital world. Every day the Congress delays in \n     dealing with this problem the pornographers, pedophiles and \n     predators secure a much stronger foothold in what will be a \n     universal service network. That network was initially created \n     by the U.S. government and still, in part, is supported by \n     American tax dollars.\n       Technology will help. But there is no technological magic \n     bullet. That is why industry is so concerned about vicarious \n     liability. Even the largest computer companies can not figure \n     out a ``fool proof'' way to prevent access. It is odd to \n     expect American tax dollars to pay for the development and \n     expansion of this marvelous system, only to turn it over to \n     pornographers. The Congress should not turn its eyes from \n     what is on the Internet and issue a mere request to parents \n     that they buy expensive products to keep this smut from their \n     homes and keep pedophiles away from their children.\n       The American people need not pay twice in order to keep \n     pornography and filth from tarnishing the sanctity of their \n     homes, the pornographers and the pornography addicts must \n     find their own, secure adults-only stomping grounds and let \n     our kids and families enjoy this universal, public service \n     for education, enlightenment and entertainment.\n       I introduced a version of this legislation nearly a year \n     ago. The time for study is over. The Congress must step up to \n     the plate. The law will facilitate free speech by creating an \n     environment through constitutional means where families and\n      children can enjoy the benefits of the Internet.\n       This is a fundamental question of burdens. The ``hands off \n     crowd'' say that the burden lies entirely on the parent. The \n     parent must spend hundreds of dollars on ``blocking'' \n     software and must be with the children 24 hours a day to \n     assure that they do not access improper material. The Exon-\n     Coats approach says that parents have responsibilities, but \n     so do on-line service providers, and publishers and so does \n     law enforcement. If you operate an on-line adult pornographic \n     book store, movie house or swap meet, you have the burden to \n     assure that children do not enter, and that you are not \n     trading in illegal obscenity. Those engaging in pornography \n     and indecency should install electronic ``bouncers'' at their \n     electronic doorways. The Supreme Court in the Sable case \n     indicated that such a burden was not a constitutional \n     impediment.\n       For all the talk about ``technological fixes'' it is ironic \n     that one group, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who \n     opposes this measure in favor of more of the so-called \n     ``parental control'' posts on the Internet instructions on \n     ``How-to Access Blocked Groups.'' The fact of the matter is \n     that kids, not their parents know ``how-to'' access \n     everything.\n       The Supreme Court noted that daytime radio is ``uniquely \n     accessible to children.'' I submit that computers are not \n     only ``uniquely accessible to children,'' but also ``uniquely \n     inaccessible to their parents.'' I expect that any child or \n     grandchild with basic computer skills can outperform any \n     member of this body when it comes to operating a computer.\n       As the Supreme Court has noted in a number of cases, the \n     Congress has a compelling state interest in protecting the \n     physical and psychological health of America's children. We \n     should not throw our hands up and allow every child's \n     computer to become a branch office of Pornography \n     Incorporated.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, I would \nlike to ask the Senator from Nebraska for clarification on one point. \nTitle IV of this legislation, the Communications Decency Act, includes \nprovisions \n[[Page S8345]] amending section 223 of the Communications Act to \naddress, among other issues, the circumstances under which providers of \nnetwork services may be held criminally liable for the transmission or \ndistribution of obscene, indecent, or harassing materials.\n  Copyright matters are, of course, within the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee, and it is my understanding that those provisions \nin title IV of the bill, as reported by the Commerce Committee, were \nnot intended to--and in fact do not--serve as a precedent for \naddressing copyright infringement carried out over online services or \nother telecommunications or digital networks. Am I correct in that \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. EXON. The Senator is correct. The liability standards contained \nin my proposal have no applicability to liability for copyright \ninfringement. Nor are they intended to set any precedent in the \ncopyright field.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for this clarification.\n  Mr. COATS. I wanted to clarify that it is the intent of this \nlegislation that persons who are providing access to or connection with \nInternet or other electronic services not under their control are \nexempted under this legislation.\n  Mr. EXON. Defense (f)(1) explicitly exempts a person who merely \nprovides access to or connection with a network like the Internet for \nthe act of providing such access. Understanding that providing access \nor connection to online services is an action which can include other \nincidental acts, this legislation is intended to exempt from \nprosecution the provision of access including transmission, \ndownloading, storage, and certain navigational functions which are \nincidental to providing access or connection to a network like the \nInternet. An online service that is providing its customers with a \ngateway to networks like the Internet or the worldwide web over which \nit has no control is generally not aware of the contents of the \ncommunications which are being made on these networks, and therefore it \nshould not be responsible for those communications. To the extent that \nservice providers are doing more than merely providing access to a \nfacility or network over which they have no control, the exemption \nwould no longer apply. For instance, if an access provider were to \ncreate a menu to assist its customers in finding the pornographic areas \nof the network, then that access provider would be doing more than \nsolely providing access to the network. Further, this exemption clearly \ndoes not apply where the service provider is owned or controlled by or \nis in conspiracy with a pornographer who is making communications in \nviolation of this legislation.\n  Mr. COATS. I understand that in a recent N.Y. State decision, \nStratton Oakmont versus Prodigy, the court held that an online provider \nwho screened for obscenities was exerting editorial content control. \nThis led the court to treat the online provider as a publisher, not \nsimply a distributor, and to therefore hold the provider responsible \nfor defamatory statements made by others on the system. I want to be \nsure that the intend of the amendment is not to hold a company who \ntries to prevent obscene or indecent material under this section from \nbeing held liable as a publisher for defamatory statements for which \nthey would not otherwise have been liable.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes; that is the intent of the amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. And am I further correct that the subsection (f)(4) \ndefense is intended to protect companies from being put in such a \ncatch-22 position? If they try to comply with this section by \npreventing or removing objectionable material, we don't intend that a \ncourt could hold that this is assertion of editorial content control, \nsuch that the company must be treated under the high standard of a \npublisher for the purposes of offenses such as libel.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes; that is the intent of section (f)(4).\n  Mr. COATS. Similarly, if a system operator discontinued service to a \ncustomer who was generating objectionable material, it is the intent in \noffering this amendment, and specifically the intent of subsection \n(f)(4), that no breach of contract action would lie against the system \noperator?\n  Mr. EXON. Yes; that is our intent.\n  Mr. COATS. I wanted to clarify that it is the intent of this \nlegislation that persons who are providing access to or connection with \nthe Internet or other electronic service not under their control are \nexempted under this legislation.\n  Mr. EXON. Yes, defense (f)(1) explicitly exempts a person who \nprovides access to or connection with a network like Internet that is \nnot under that person's control. Providing access or connection is \nmeant to include transmission, downloading, storage, navigational \ntools, and related capabilities which are incidental to the \ntransmission of communications. An online service that is providing \nsuch services is not aware of the contents of the communications and \nshould not be responsible for its contents. Of course this exemption \ndoes not apply where the service provider is owned or controlled by or \nis in conspiracy with a maker of communications that is determined to \nbe in violation of this statute.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I would inquire of the Senator from Indiana \nif my understanding is correct that, under subsection (f)(1) of your \namendment, a person is protected solely for providing access. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. COATS. The Senator is correct, this is a narrow defense. The \ndefense is for solely providing access or connection and not a defense \nfor any person or entity that provides anything more than solely \nproviding access. This does not create a defense for someone who has \nsome level of control over the material or the provision of material. \nTo the extent that enhanced access would be an offense, this defense \ndoes not apply to someone who, among other things, manages the \nprohibited or restricted material, charges a fee for such material, \nprovides instructions on how to access such material or provides an \nindex of the material. This is merely an illustrative list and not an \nexhaustive list of the types of activities that would not qualify as \nsolely providing access or connection under subsection (f)(1).\n  Mr. EXON. I agree with the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I oppose the Exon-Coats second-degree \namendment, I oppose it not because I disagree with its mission--which \nis to keep children out of the redlight districts of the Internet. With \nthat, I wholeheartedly agree. As has become all too clear, the new \ninformation superhighway has its gritty roadside attractions: as the \nSenator from Nebraska has documented, some of the information traveling \nover the Internet is tasteless, offensive, and downright spine-\ntingling. I stand with him and the Senator from Indiana in condemning \nand deploring this stuff--and I agree that we should do something here \nand now to help keep it out of the hands of our kids.\n  But I respectfully disagree with them about how we should go about \ndoing that. I believe there is a better, faster, and more effective way \nto make the information superhighway safe traveling for our children. \nIf the Exon-Coats provision passes, we will have mountains of \nlitigation over its constitutionality, dragging on for years and \nyears--and all the while, our kids will be doing what they do best: \nfinding new and better ways to satisfy their curiosity.\n  The Exon-Coats amendment would make it a crime to send an indecent \ncommunications over the Internet to anyone under 18. Although that \ncertainly sounds good, the problem is this: in the world of the \nInternet--where communications are sent out to hundreds and sometimes \nhundreds of thousands of people all at once--a ban on material that \nmight reach a child is tantamount to a complete outright ban.\n  That's where the constitutional problem comes in. In the case of \nSable Communications versus FCC, the Supreme Court held that indecent \nspeech--unlike obscenity--is protected first amendment expression. The \nCourt also ruled that although indecent speech\n cannot be outlawed, it nevertheless can be restricted to protect \nchildren--provided, however, that the restrictions are drawn as \nnarrowly as possible so as not to unduly limit adult access. This is \nknown by lawyers as the least restrictive means requirement. Or put \nanother way by Justice Frankfurter, you can't ``burn the house to roast \nthe pig''--which is exactly what I believe the Exon-Coats provision \nwould do. [[Page S8346]] \n\n  So I believe there will be a heated and protracted constitutional \nchallenge to this provision. In fact, with history as our guide, such a \nchallenge is virtually guaranteed: when Congress banned Dial-a-Porn \nservices to minors, it took 10 years--and many different attempts by \nthe FCC to write narrowly tailored regulations, all of which were \nchallenged and fully litigated--for the statute to be upheld as \nconstitutional.\n  Ten years. Multiple rulemaking proceedings. Four different trips up \nto the court of appeals. I, for one, just can't wait that long. But \nmore importantly, our children shouldn't have to wait that long. I want \nto get to work right now--and come up with the best and fastest way to \nget at this problem.\n  That is why I support the underlying Leahy amendment. The Leahy \namendment will get us going right now. It directs the Departments of \nJustice and Commerce to quickly come up with technological solutions--\nways by which parents can screen out of their computer systems violent, \nsexually explicit, harassing, offensive, or otherwise unwanted \nmaterial. The Leahy measure also directs the Departments to evaluate \nwhether current criminal laws are fully enforceable in interactive \nmedia, and to assess law enforcement resources currently available to \nenforce these laws.\n  The Leahy amendment doesn't stop there: it requires that the \nDepartments also submit a legislative proposal with their study--\noutlining how best, technologically, to empower parents to protect \ntheir kids; how to amend, if necessary, our laws to better crack down \non pornographers; how law enforcement resources should be allocated \nmore effectively.\n  What's more, the Leahy amendment puts that legislation on a fast-\ntrack schedule. That means that it would only be a matter of months--\nnot 1 year, 5 years, or 10 years--for us to have taken smart and \neffective action to get at this problem.\n  Government censorship, in this instance, is not just a bad idea in \nthe eyes of first amendment scholars and activists. It's also a bad \nidea when it comes to the eyes and minds of our children. While we \nmight be able to shut down some of the filthy talk on the net, we \nsimply can't do the job right this way--we can't prevent access to \nsexually explicit information from Finland, Sweden, Japan or other \ncountries, all of which are part of the Internet community.\n  I also want to say that I--and I'm sure I'm joined by many parents \nacross the country--am also very concerned about violent material on \nthe net. As the Judiciary Committee has learned in some detail, you can \nlearn all about bomb-building and other ways of war and destruction \nonline. The Exon-Coats provision doesn't address violence. The Leahy \namendment, with its headlights aimed at technology to screen out \nviolent as well as offensive and sexually explicit material, does.\n  I believe that a technology-based solution, as advanced in Senator \nLeahy's amendment, is a better answer--constitutionally and \npractically. The market, as we speak, is already developing software \nand hardware to enable parents to block children's access to filth, \nviolence, and other objectionable material. I believe it makes more \nsense, and will be more effective, to empower users to protect \nthemselves and their children than to attempt a topdown model of \ngovernmental regulation.\n     levin on exon amendment to s. 652, the telecommunications bill\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support keeping obscene material off the \ninternet and other electronic media. This amendment goes significantly \nbeyond that. The language of the amendment before us is so broad and \nvague that it would subject an American citizen to criminal liability \nand possible imprisonment for two years, a $100,000 fine or both for \nmaking what is termed a ``filthy comment'' on the internet which, in \nthe words of the amendment, is intended to annoy.\n  Annoying filthy comments that are put on the internet are \nreprehensible. But, I am afraid the attempt to make such language \ncriminal will backfire and make it more difficult for us to effectively \nprohibit abusive and threatening activities and pornographic material \naimed at children and adults. Our best chance to meet this objective is \nthrough means which are Constitutional.\n  That is why I support the underlying Leahy amendment to protect the \ninternet and other electronic media from obscene material. The Leahy \nAmendment would require the Attorney General of the United States \nwithin 150 days to produce Constitutional legislation to address the \nproblem. The Leahy Amendment also provides for expedited procedures \nwhich would permit the Congress to consider such legislation quickly. I \nbelieve this is the more effective course to protect the internet and \nother telecommunications media.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a letter printed from \nthe Department of Justice at this point in the Congressional Record. \nThe letter states, in part, ``Defenses included in the Exon proposal \nwould undermine the ability of the Department of Justice to prosecute \nan on-line service provider even though it knowingly profits from the \ndistribution of obscenity or child pornography.''\n  The Department of Justice letter also states that for many other \nreasons a comprehensive review should be made before Congress acts.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                       U.S. Department of justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: This is in response to your June 14, \n     1995 letter to me posing questions about my June 13 letter to \n     Senator Exon concerning his proposed Communications Decency \n     Act.\n       My letter to Senator Exon commented on the version of his \n     proposal circulated in his ``dear colleague'' letter of June \n     7, 1995 (the ``Exon proposal''). Senator Exon had requested \n     that we comment on the extent to which that revised proposal \n     satisfied the concerns I detailed to you in my May 3 letter. \n     The letter does not address the Exon-Coats proposal, which we \n     had not seen nor were aware of until today. We have just \n     begun to review this new proposal.\n       As stated in my letter to Senator Exon, his proposal still \n     raises a number of complex legal and policy issues that call \n     for in-depth analysis prior to congressional action. Because \n     we still have concerns, we continue to believe that a \n     comprehensive review should be undertaken to guide response \n     to the problems the Communications Decency Act seeks to \n     address.\n       Among these concerns are constitutional questions raised \n     primarily by the lack of scienter required for the age \n     element of subsection (e) of the Exon proposal. In our view, \n     this subsection would consequently have the effect of \n     regulating indecent speech between consenting adults.\\1\\ \n     Subsection (a) does not have the same constitutional \n     infirmity because of the specific intent requirement that the \n     communication be done ``with intent to annoy, abuse, \n     threaten, or harass . . .'', which we believe is inconsistent \n     with the concept of ``consenting adults.''\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of letter.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       As described in my June 13 letter, we continue to have a \n     concern with the ``knowledge'' requirements that were re-\n     inserted in the Exon proposal as defenses for certain \n     parties.\n       The defenses included in the Exon proposal would undermine \n     the ability of the Department of Justice to prosecute an on-\n     line service provider even though it knowingly profits from \n     the distribution of obscenity or child pornography.\\2\\ \n     Although the existence of the defenses in the Exon proposal \n     would make prosecutions under the proposal's offenses \n     difficult, if not impossible, they would not threaten \n     obscenity prosecutions under existing statutes.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Kent Markus,\n                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\Subsection (e) of the Exon-Coats measure exacerbates the \n     constitutional concerns because it is even more expansive \n     than the similar subsection (e) in the Exon proposal.\n     \\2\\The defense is subsection (f)(1) of the Exon-Coats measure \n     is particularly problematic as it focuses on whether the \n     service provider has control over the bulletin board service. \n     If the provider does not have control, regardless of whether \n     it has guilty knowledge or intent, it is immune from \n     prosecution.\n  Mr. EXON. With that, if the Senator from Vermont is ready to yield \nback, I am ready to yield back our time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nnumbered 1362.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  [[Page S8347]] The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber who desire to vote?\n  The result was announced, yeas 84, nays 16, as follows:\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 263 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--84\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Packwood\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Chafee\n     Feingold\n     Glenn\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Robb\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n  So, the amendment (No. 1362) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n               Submitted Amendment No. 1286, as modified\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous-\nconsent request?\n  Mr. DOLE. I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a unanimous-\nconsent request.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  On my amendment No. 1286, there is a technical error. I ask unanimous \nconsent to correct that error. There is no objection by Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The submitted amendment (No. 1286), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, line 11, in the language added by the Dole \n     Amendment No. 1255 as modified, insert the following:\n       (b)(3) Superseding Rule on Radio Ownership.--In lieu of \n     making the modification required by the first sentence of \n     subsection (b)(2), the Commission shall modify its rules set \n     forth in 47 CFR 73,3555 by limiting to 50 AM and 50 FM \n     broadcast stations the number of such stations which may be \n     owned or controlled by one entity nationally.\n\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. As I understand, they need to take care of the underlying \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, the \nLeahy amendment has now been amended by the Exon amendment. Because \nmany, many Senators supported the amendment as one by itself--\nobviously, the majority support the Exon amendment--there is really no \nreason to have a rollcall vote on my amendment.\n  I recommend we adopt the Leahy amendment, as amended by the Exon \namendment, by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1288, as modified, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1228) was agreed to.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am trying to determine when we can \ncomplete action on this bill. We had a heavy, positive vote on cloture. \nI am going to read a statement that I think satisfies the managers of \nthe bill to see if we can get some agreement, some accommodation. The \nmanagers have been working toward a final resolution of this bill that \nencompasses the following request. I am not going to try to get the \nagreement, but I will read it:\n  That all amendments qualified postcloture must be called up by number \nby 7:30 p.m.; that all amendments be limited to 15 minutes, 30 minutes \nfor second degrees, for the debate to occur--we are not certain about \nthis--either tonight or beginning at 9 o'clock in the morning. If some \nof those can be debated tonight, it can save us time tomorrow morning. \nIf we can get the agreement, then rollcall votes will be stacked to \nbegin at 12:30 p.m. I would rather begin at an earlier time tomorrow, \nbut I understand there is a problem on that side. If we can resolve \nthat, they will begin earlier, with the last vote in the voting \nsequence being final passage of the telecommunications bill.\n  After that, if get consent, we will go to the highway bill, S. 440, \nwhich I understand there are a couple major issues, but, otherwise, we \nshould be able to finish that by Friday sometime.\n  So if Senators have amendments, the point is they ought to be letting \nthe managers know. We think there are only about six, maybe a few more \nthan that. I understand Senator Stevens has some that may be accepted. \nSenator Leahy has one that is going to be accepted. That would leave \none by Senator Lieberman, one by Senator Simon, one by Senator McCain, \none by Senator Harkin, and then the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, the major one that I had was \ndialing parity. At one time, we thought it would take several hours. I \nthink Senator Breaux and I have worked out a consensus. I suspect, once \nyou have gotten your unanimous consent, if the managers yield to us, we \ncan probably dispose of it in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let us do that right now. Then I will come back after that \nand try to get consent on these other things. In the meantime, if \nsomebody else has an amendment they feel a compelling desire to offer, \nwe would appreciate that information, because it might determine how \nlong we stay tonight.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, personally, I like the plan that the \nmajority leader has laid down. As he knows, we tried on this other one \nto move as quickly as we could, and we moved it much faster than some \nthought. I note in that regard, I appreciate those who expressed their \nconcern in wanting to protect the Internet but also to protect children \nfrom being exposed to smut and pornography. I will state again, the \nprotection of children is something we all want equally in this body. \nWe just have different ways of trying to figure out ultimately how to \nprotect them and the first amendment at the same time.\n  I hope we go to the dialing parity. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe in order for me to yield to the Senator from Louisiana to bring up \nan amendment on behalf of himself and myself. That may settle that part \nand save us several hours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, if that is a request, we \nhave worked out an agreement on three technical amendments that deal \nwith an amendment I previously offered, and I would like to get an \nagreement on those. We will proceed with them later in the evening, but \nI want to make sure we have an agreement before we get into this other \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  Will the Senator yield to me for the purpose of a unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska for the \npurpose of making a unanimous-consent request without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 10 \nminutes equally divided for the consideration of my amendments 1301, \n1302, and 1304; that at the end of that 10 minutes, we then proceed to \nconsider, without any intervening action or debate, each of the three \namendments. I will at that time ask that they be considered en bloc, \nbut I think they should be explained first; in addition, that after \nconsultation with the Members involved, I ask unanimous consent that \n[[Page S8348]] a modification to amendment No. 1301 be permitted prior \nto the vote on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I believe I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as I stated earlier, I think there was \ngeneral agreement among the body that we wanted to find a way to \napproach what many see as a problem on the Internet. We had different \nways of approaching it. I note that only because those who supported \nthe underlying amendment were trying to find the most constitutional \nway of doing it. It was not a case of anybody--anybody--in this body \nbeing in favor of providing pornography to children, it simply should \ngo without saying, but so there will not be any mistake on that point.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Louisiana. He has an \namendment on behalf of the two of us.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1421\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Breaux-\nLeahy amendment at the desk be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator state the number?\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is an amendment entitled Breaux-Leahy at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 1421.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 93, strike lines 7-12 and insert the following:\n       ``(ii) Except for single-LATA States and States which have \n     issued an order by June 1, 1995 requiring a Bell operating \n     company to implement toll dealing parity, a State may not \n     require a Bell operating company to implement toll dialing \n     parity in an intraLATA area before a Bell operating company \n     has been granted authority under this subsection to provide \n     interLATA services in that area or before three years after \n     the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, \n     whichever is earlier. Nothing in this clause precludes a \n     State from issuing an order requiring toll dialing parity in \n     an intraLATA area prior to either such date so long as such \n     order does not take effect until after the earlier of either \n     such dates.\n       (iii) In any State in which intraLATA toll dialing parity \n     has been implemented prior to the earlier date specified in \n     clause (ii), no telecommunications carrier that serves \n     greater than five percent of the nation's presubscribed \n     access lines may jointly market interLATA telecommunications \n     services and intraLATA toll telecommunications services in a \n     telephone exchange area in such state until a Bell operating \n     company is authorized under this subsection to provide \n     interLATA services in such telephone exchange area or until \n     three years after the date of enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1995, whichever is earlier.''\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nyielding to me for this purpose and thank him for working with me and \nwith the distinguished chairman of the committee, as well as the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee, as well as a number of \nother Members in the body.\n  We have tried to work really for the past 2 to 3 days on trying to \ndevelop a consensus amendment, which I think we now have, which I think \nsolves the problem both from a sense of fairness as well as a sense of \ntrying to encourage additional companies to do what they can do best.\n  I think the basic thrust of this telecommunications bill is to \npromote competition. I think the Commerce Committee has done a \ntremendous job in reporting to the body a bill that, in fact, does say \nto all of the companies, whether they be long distance companies or \nwhether they be the so-called regional Bell companies, that we want you \nto be able to do what you do best, we want you to compete, we want you \nto provide good service at a good price to the consumers of America.\n And the big problem is then trying to manage these various companies \nto make sure everybody is treated fairly. We wanted to try to make sure \nno company got an economic advantage, because of legislation, over any \nother company. I think the bill does do that. One of the features of \nthe legislation is that we sort of said, when you can do long distance \nservice, the long distance companies can do local service. It is sort \nof saying that everybody is going to be able to start competing at the \nsame time. One of the provisions in the bill dealt with a prohibition. \nIt said simply that States could not order long distance companies to \nbe able to receive dialing parity when they do long distance service \nwithin an intraLATA situation, within a State.\n\n  Mr. President, we thought that the Commerce Committee provision that \nrestricted that ability of a State was a good idea. It was consistent \nwith what Judge Greene said. But there were concerns, particularly by \nthe Senator from Vermont, who said that, no, the States should be able \nto move forward. We have crafted an amendment that the Senator from \nVermont really was helpful in putting together, which said that those \nStates that have only one LATA and already have issued orders to \nrequire dialing parity would be exempted from that prohibition in a way \nthat would allow that State to take action on ordering parity.\n  This amendment specifies that clearly. It also says, as a precaution \nand a protection that guarantees equal opportunity for all of the \ncompanies, that those States, while they would be able to order dialing \nparity, they would not be able to allow for joint marketing in those \nareas. I think that is a good balance and is fair treatment.\n  One of the things I have always advocated is that companies, when \nthey are allowed to move into another area, know that their competition \nwill also be able to compete in their areas at the same time.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that the amendment is clear, as clear as \nit possibly can be, in dealing with a very complicated situation. I \nthink it continues with the thrust of the committee product, which says \nwe want a level playing field. That is what this amendment addresses \ndealing with dialing parity.\n  I thank all of the Members who had major input in helping us craft \nthis. It has been a bipartisan effort, worked on by people whose \nconcerns were making sure we treated long distance companies fairly, as \nwell as Members who were concerned about making sure we treated \nregional Bells fairly at the same time. I think both sides have given a \nproduct that we now have pending before the Senate, and it is a good \none.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it by a voice vote, which is what I \nhope we will be able to do to dispose of it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I briefly had an opportunity to look at the amendment. I \nasked for a copy to review it in more detail. Let me ask a question \nfrom the perspective of my State. The recent Florida legislature of \nthis spring passed an interLATA dialing parity bill. That legislation \ngoes into effect on January 1, 1996. What effect will this amendment \nhave on my State's ability to adopt dialing parity?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will respond to the Senator by saying that we have \ntried to take into consideration two types of States in our amendment. \nThe first would be about 10 States that are single-LATA States, which \nmeans they only have one division of what can happen in their State. \nThat does not include Florida. The second category includes Florida--\nexcept States which have issued an order by June 1, 1995, requiring \nthis dialing parity, those States would be able to go forward with \nthose orders, and they would be able to implement those orders. The \nonly protection that is required--which I think is a level playing \nfield--is that they would not be able to have joint marketing \nagreements in those areas. But the State of Florida would be able to go \nforward with that order and implement it. In essence, the State of \nFlorida would be grandfathered in because they are a State that already \nissued the order at the State level.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, I am not certain if they have issued an order or \nnot. My information is that the legislation goes into effect on January \n1, 1996. I am not certain if that is the threshold that brings a State \ninto the category of those which will still be allowed to exercise some \ndegree of State regulation over dialing parity.\n[[Page S8349]]\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. My answer to the Senator from Florida is simply, yes. The \nexplanation is that it is based on the States' issuing the order, not \nthe effective date. The State of Florida, for instance, would have \nissued the order in a timely fashion in order to be one of the excepted \nStates.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Louisiana is \nabsolutely correct. Florida, having ordered it, even though they have \nnot implemented it, would be covered by the Breaux-Leahy amendment and \nwould be protected.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I have no additional requests for time on \nbehalf of my amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Breaux-Leahy amendment makes a significant improvement \nin S. 652, and will permit States, at a time certain, to create a more \ncompetitive market for their in-state toll calls.\n  Without this amendment, S. 652 would have prohibited all States from \nordering a Bell operating company to provide dialing parity for in-\nState toll calls before the company is authorized to provide long-\ndistance service in that area. The bill preempted States' prerogative \nto open up the in-State toll market to meaningful competition. This \npreemption would persist under the bill, as reported by the committee, \nuntil the Bell operating company in the State satisfied the unbundling \nand interconnection requirements in the bill and was permitted into the \nlong-distance market.\n  In addition, as introduced, the bill rolled back the actions of 10 \nStates that have already ordered local telephone companies to provide \ndialing parity for in-State toll calls.\n  The 10 States that would have had to undo their dialing parity \nrequirements are: Illinois, Wyoming, Wisconsin, Michigan, Florida, \nConnecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, and New York.\n  These States recognize that dialing parity is a key to healthy \ncompetition for in-State toll calls.\n  They should not be second-guessed and preempted on the Federal level. \nThe bill would have stopped and reversed this progress toward a \ncompetitive market. The bill would also forbid all other States, many \nof which are considering changes, from implementing dialing parity \nuntil the regional Bell operating companies [RBOCs] are allowed into \nthe intraLATA long distance market as a result, the States were left \nwith no time certain for when they could require dialing parity for \nintraLATA calls.\n  Without dialing parity for toll calls, Bell company customers can \nplace an in-State toll call simply by dialing 1 plus the seven-digit \ntelephone number, for a total of eight digits to complete the call.\n  By contrast, customers who want to use their long distance company to \ncomplete that same call must dial 1 plus a special 5-digit access code \nplus the 7-digit telephone number, for a total of 13 digits to complete \nthe call. Dialing these extra digits severely handicaps competition and \ngives an artificial advantage to Bell companies. This handicap is \nanticompetitive and anticonsumer.\n  Dialing parity for in-State toll calls enhances competition for toll \nservices. Requiring dialing parity overcomes the primary obstacle to \nmeaningful competition in these short-haul long distance markets.\n  Without dialing parity, intraLATA toll calls are simply carried by \nthe local exchange carrier.\n  For Vermont, a one ``LATA'' State, this means that NYNEX carries the \nbulk of in-State toll calls, because other toll call carriers may only \nbe accessed by dialing cumbersome access codes. Consumers are the \nlosers.\n  When dialing parity is implemented, customers will be able to choose \nthe carrier that carries their in-State toll calls with the same \nconvenient ``1+'' dialing that they have had available for long-\ndistance calling for many years. Customers will be able to pre-select \ntheir carrier for these calls, just as there is presubscription for \nlong-distance carriers.\n  The availability of dialing parity for in-State toll service should \nsubstantially increase competition in this multibillion dollar \ntelecommunications market. Increased competition, in turn, would bring \nlower prices for consumers and less need for regulation of such \nservices by State public service commissions.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article stated, ``in California, MCI's \ndirect-dial toll rates are as much as 30 percent cheaper than Pacific \nBell's in some cases. Similar savings can be had in other major markets \nacross the country.'' In general, in-State toll calls are significantly \nlower-priced where effective competition is introduced. Implementation \nof toll dialing parity would help accomplish that result.\n  By preserving the Bell companies' dominant position in these markets \nuntil they secure long distance entry, the bill as reported would have \ndiminished, rather than increased, the Bell companies' incentives to \nopen their markets to competition as rapidly as possible.\n  S. 652 provided a disincentive for the Bell companies to open their \nlocal exchange markets so that they could compete in all segments of \nthe long distance market. Instead, the bill might have encouraged the \nBell companies' to fight competition in their local markets, because as \nlong as they do not enter the interLATA market, their lucrative \nintraLATA toll markets are protected.\n  The bill, as reported, also puts unwarranted pressure on the \nregulatory agencies to approve Bell companies entry into the long-\ndistance market, interLATA entry, regardless of the status of local \ncompetition under the bill, until the Bell companies got into the \ninterexchange long-distance market, real competition would not come to \nthe multibillion-dollar in-State toll market.\n  I have heard some concern that in-State dialing parity might increase \nlocal rates and thereby harm universal service. The 10 States that have \nordered dialing parity have carefully analyzed and considered the \neffect of dialing parity on local rates.\n  They have ordered dialing parity after determining that universal \nservice will not be harmed, and that equal access is necessary for \neffective competition. Competition reduces total costs for consumers \nand results in new services and technological advancements. These \nadvances in technology have reduced the cost of providing basic service \nand provided new revenue sources for the Bell companies.\n  Some States may decide that circumstances in their regions are such \nthat dialing parity for in-State toll calls is not in the public \ninterest. In 1987, Vermont decided against requiring presubscription \nand dialing parity, but this issue is currently being reconsidered. The \nBreaux-Leahy amendment would permit the 10 States that have already \nordered it, based upon the particular circumstances present in the \nState, to continue implementation of dialing parity.\n  The intraLATA toll dialing parity preemption provision in S. 652, as \nreported, is opposed by consumer groups, long-distance carriers, \nalternative local transport providers, and State organizations such as \nthe National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners [NARUC], \nand the Attorneys General of 22 States and Guam.\n  In March 31, 1995 letter to Senator Pressler, NARUC wrote that:\n\n       The blanket preemption of states that have already mandated \n     dialing parity will undercut state efforts, already in place, \n     to encourage competition and bring lower prices and more \n     choice to consumers.\n\n  The Breaux-Leahy amendment would permit single-LATA States, including \nVermont, Maine, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Mexico, Utah \nand South Dakota, and the 10 States, which have ordered intraLATA toll \ndialing parity, to implement dialing parity, whether or not the RBOC in \nthe State has been authorized to provide interexchange service.\n  In addition, the Breaux-Leahy amendment provides a time certain for \nall other States to be able to implement such dialing parity of the \nearlier of 3 years after enactment or when the RBOC is granted \nauthority to provide interexchange service. The preemption ``sunset'' \nof 3 years permits those 13 States, Arizona, California, Delaware, \nIndiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia--with proceedings \nunderway, time to complete their proceedings, issue any order for \nintraLATA toll dialing parity and make plans for implementation, though \nthose States may [[Page S8350]] not implement until the earlier of 36 \nmonths or until the RBDOC is authorized to provide inter-exchange \nservices.\n  Finally, in those States where intraLATA toll dialing parity has been \nimplemented--not merely ordered--during the 3 years after enactment or \nbefore the RBOC in the State has been authorized to provide \ninterexchange service, whichever is earlier, the Breaux-Leahy amendment \nwould bar telecommunications carriers in that State from jointly \nmarketing interLATA and intraLATA services. This ban would be lifted or \n``sunset'', 3 years after enactment or when the RBOC in the State was \nauthorized to offer interexchange services, whichever is earlier. \nFurthermore, this ban only applies to carriers serving greater than 5 \npercent of the Nation's presubscribed access lines.\n  The biggest telecommunications legislative reform package in more \nthan 60 years should not include provisions that reverse progress \ntoward competition. Supporting this amendment is proconsumer, \nprocompetitive, and pro-States' rights.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1421) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I sincerely thank the Senators and their \nstaffs who worked that out. That was truly a remarkable compromise. I \nthank them very much.\n  I urge Senators to bring their amendments to the floor. We are \nmarching forward, but we need everybody who has an amendment to get \nover here.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 1317 and 1318, en bloc\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk, en bloc, \nand ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes amendments \n     numbered 1317 and 1318, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 1317\n\n       In managers' amendment, on page 13, line 20, after \n     ``programming'' insert: ``by any means''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1318\n\n       On page 12, line 10 insert after ``services'': ``or its \n     affiliate''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, these are technical amendments. Both sides \nhave had a chance to review them, and I believe they have signed off. \nWhat they do is deal with program access. They make it clear that the \nrules are the same for both cable operators and telephone companies. \nThis is an area in which, it seemed to me, it was appropriate to have \nconsistent rules and treat both of them the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, perhaps my colleague will speak on the \namendments, and then we will be sure we get an agreement here.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, on amendment No. 1317, the amendment to the \nmanagers' amendment, on page 13, line 20, after the word \n``programming'' we insert the words ``by any means.'' And on amendment \nNo. 1318, which deals with page 12 of the managers' amendment, line 10, \nafter the word ``service,'' it inserts ``or its affiliates.''\n  The purpose of these two amendments is to make it clear that the \nrules were the same for both cable operators and telephone companies in \nthe area of program access. It seemed appropriate to treat both kinds \nof firms the same under these circumstances.\n  I believe the amendment is more in terms of a technical amendment \nthan a substantive amendment, in terms of the major policy issues this \nbody has been dealing with.\n  Mr. President, if I might correct something. Amendment No. 1318 is an \namendment to the bill itself. Amendment No. 1317 is the amendment to \nthe managers' amendment.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. I am advised that I can make the following request that has \nbeen cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent all remaining first-degree amendments be \noffered by 7:30 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate, at 7:30, we will assess and see where we \nare. If we can work it out, we will try to accommodate most of my \ncolleagues.\n  I understand there may be a movie tonight--Batman or something--that \nmany of my colleagues are headed for. It is a good movie, I understand, \ntoo.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1317\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have worked out approval of amendment \nNo. 1317. My understanding is it has been signed off on both sides.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We have no objection, and we are in support of that \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 1317 will now be considered \nseparately. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1317) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BROWN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \namendment No. 1318.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1319 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendment No. 1319. That is not one we have been able to reach \nagreement on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1319) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, my amendment No. 1320 is one we are \nattempting to clear on both sides. It is an amendment which I believe \nboth sides have a copy of. My hope is that we will shortly be able to \ndeal with both amendments numbered 1318 and 1320. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1272\n\n(Purpose: To require broadcasters to review viewer input on the violent \n              content of programming upon license renewal)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk amendment No. 1272 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1272.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 82, between lines 4 and 5, insert the following:\n       (3) This section shall operate only if the Commission shall \n     amend its ``Application for renewal of License for AM, FM, \n     TV, Translator or LPTV Station'' (FCC Form 303-S) to require \n     that, for commercial TV applicants only, the applicant attach \n     as an exhibit to the application a summary of written \n     comments and suggestions received from the public and \n     maintained by the licensee in accordance with 47 C.F.R. sec. \n     73.1202 that comment on the applicant's programming, if any, \n     characterized by the commentor as constituting violent \n     programming.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I shall \nnot take a great deal of time to explain it. We have visited with both \nthe chairman of the committee and the minority member, the ranking \nminority member, on this issue. I know the ranking minority member is \ninclined to accept. I have not heard back from the Chair.\n  Let me describe exactly what this does. It follows on the vote that \nwe had [[Page S8351]] yesterday on the issue of television violence. I \nhad originally thought about bringing to the floor the television \nviolence report card, but I decided not to do that.\n  My amendment would do something that is very simple: It would deal \nwith the application to renewal of licenses for televisions and say \nthat for commercial television applicants, for renewal, the applicants \nwould attach as an exhibit for the application for renewal a summary of \nwritten comments and suggestions received by the public and maintained \nby the licensee--which is, incidentally, now required--and that comment \non the applicants programming, if characterized by the commenters as \nconstituting violent programming.\n  What this says is, when you are doing a renewal of application, you \nare a television station and you are filing for a renewal of your \nlicense, that in your application, you shall provide a summary of \nwritten comments and suggestions that are in your file that you are \nrequired to keep, anyway, with respect to those who comment on violent \nprogramming that your viewers have witnessed and felt they wanted to \nbring to your attention, and that that information should be available \nto the FCC.\n  It does not in any way expand the power of the FCC. It simply will \nrequire the disclosure and summary of information that is already in \nthe file that is now required by law to be kept, and I think it will \nemphasize in a renewal for application any information that would exist \nin those files about viewers' concerns about violent programming.\n  I think that that would be something the FCC would find useful in \nreviewing the renewal of applications. I think it also follows on the \nvote that we had yesterday on television violence. My colleague, \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota, offered an amendment with Senator \nLieberman, which I voted for, on the issue of television violence.\n  I have a piece of legislation that I cosponsored with Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison on television violence, calling for the development of \na television violence report card so that parents would know which are \nthe most violent programs, which programs have the most violence in \nthem, and who sponsors them. Parents would, therefore, be able to \nbetter supervise their children's viewing habits and send messages to \nthose who are sponsoring the violence.\n  I have not offered that. Instead, I am offering something that I \nthink complements what we did last evening and something that I think \nis simple, something I hope will not be controversial, and something I \nhope the committee Chair, the floor manager, will accept.\n  I do not intend or need to take additional time on this. I think it \nis easily understood by everyone, and it is complementary to \nlegislation the Senate passed last evening.\n  As I indicated, it does not expand the FCC powers or authority, and \ndoes not require the television stations to collect information that \nthey are not now collecting. It simply requires that the information \nthey now have that is in their files must be disclosed and summarized \nwith respect to comments they have received from viewers on television \nviolence when they file for renewal of their license.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment numbered 1272.\n  The amendment (No. 1272) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, if Senators will bring their amendments \nto the floor, we are eagerly awaiting. We want to do business here.\n We only have an hour and a half.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                amendment no. 1282, as further modified\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. On behalf of Senator Moseley-Braun, I ask unanimous \nconsent amendment 1282 be further modified as indicated in the \nmodification that I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1282), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n       TITLE  --NATIONAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY FUNDING CORPORATION\n\n     SEC. --01.

The question recurs on the Brown amendment, \nNo. 1318.\n  Is there further debate? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend 1318 into \na form the chairman of the committee and distinguished ranking member--\n--\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my colleague will yield, he is not trying to amend \nthe Moseley-Braun amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the amendment of the \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a revised version of \namendment No. 1318, and ask unanimous consent I be allowed to offer the \nrevised version.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1318), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 20 insert after ``carrier'': ``or its \n     affiliate''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. It is my understanding both sides have agreed to this \nversion. I think it more clearly states the intent that was involved. I \nurge its approval.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not the question \noccurs on amendment No. 1318, as modified.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me see a copy of it. I have not seen \nthe modification. We had made suggestions as to the modification. Can \nwe look at it?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, is it possible the Senator from \nPennsylvania could offer an amendment at this point? I ask unanimous \nconsent whatever the pending business is it be set aside so the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania can offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1294, As Modified\n\n  (Purpose: To promote the use of telecommuting by the American work \n                                 force)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering the \namendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It has been previously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1294, as modified.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent there be no reporting of the \namendment so I may explain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TELECOMMUTING PUBLIC INFORMATION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) Telecommuting is the practice of allowing people to \n     work either at home or in nearby centers located closer to \n     home during their normal working hours, substituting \n     telecommunications services, either partially or completely, \n     for transportation to a more traditional workplace;\n       (2) Telecommuting is now practiced by an estimated two to \n     seven million Americans, including individuals with impaired \n     mobility, who are taking advantage of computer and \n     telecommunications advances in recent years;\n       (3) Telecommuting has the potential to dramatically reduce \n     fuel consumption, mobile source air pollution, vehicle miles \n     traveled, and time spent commuting, thus contributing to an \n     improvement in the quality of life for millions of Americans; \n     and\n       (4) It is in the public interest for the Federal Government \n     to collect and disseminate information encouraging the \n     increased use of telecommuting and identifying the potential \n     benefits and costs of telecommuting.\n       (b) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, shall, within three months \n     of the date of enactment of this Act, carry out research to \n     identify successful telecommuting programs in the public and \n     private sectors and provide for the dissemination to the \n     public of information regarding--\n       (1) the establishment of successful telecommuting programs; \n     and\n       (2) the benefits and costs of telecommuting.\n       (c) Report.--Within one year of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to \n     Congress its findings, conclusions, and recommendations \n     regarding telecommuting developed under this section.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. This amendment directs the Secretary of Transportation, \nin consultation with the Labor Department and EPA, to identify \nsuccessful governmental and business telecommuting programs \nand to disseminate information about such programs, including the \nbenefits of telecommuting, to the general public. The amendment is \nintended to promote the increased use of telecommuting through a \nbroader awareness of the benefits, including flexibility, profamily \nemployment, reduced traffic congestion, and lower fuel consumption. The \nSecretary of Transportation will be required to report to Congress on \nhis findings, conclusions, and recommendations regarding telecommuting \nwithin 1 year of enactment.\n  It is my understanding this amendment is acceptable on both sides.\n  [[Page S8353]]\n  \n  Mr. PRESSLER. We are prepared to accept this amendment by Senator \nSpecter from Pennsylvania. I commend him for his efforts.\n  I believe the Specter amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It has been cleared.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment 1294, as \nmodified.\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1294) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1343\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for Commission notification of the Attorney \n   General of any approval of Bell Company entry into long distance)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 1343 at the desk. I \nask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the pending amendment is set \naside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1343.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 93, after line 12, insert the following:\n       ``(6) Notification of attorney general.--\n       ``(A) Notification.--The Commission shall immediately \n     notify the Attorney General of any approval of an application \n     under paragraph (1).\n       ``(B) Action by attorney general.--Upon notification of an \n     approval of an application under paragraph (1), the Attorney \n     General may commence an action in any United States District \n     Court if\n       ``(i) the Attorney General determines that the \n     authorization granted by the Commission may substantially \n     lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly; or\n       ``(ii) the Attorney General determines that the \n     authorization granted by the Commission is inconsistent with \n     any recommendation of the Attorney General provided to the \n     Commission pursuant to paragraph (2) of this section.\n       ``The commencement of such an action shall stay the \n     effectiveness of the Commission's approval unless the court \n     shall otherwise specifically order.\n       ``(C) Standard of review.--In any such action, the court \n     shall review de novo the issues presented. The court may only \n     uphold the Commission's authorization if the court finds that \n     the effect of such authorization will not be substantially to \n     lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any \n     line of commerce in any section of the country. The court may \n     uphold all or part of the authorization.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, because of the time constraint that \namendments must be offered by 7:30, I feel constrained to offer the \namendment but I admit this is a very controversial issue. This is a \ndifferent approach on the issue that we have debated at some length \nwith respect to the role of the Justice Department.\n  I would not, in this amendment, preserve the same role for the \nJustice Department that we had previously debated, but the amendment I \nhave offered, that is germane and I had previously at the desk, is one \nthat would provide, upon notification by the Federal Communications \nCommission of an approval of an application under paragraph 1, that the \nAttorney General may commence an action in U.S. District Court and seek \na stay, if the Attorney General determines the authorization granted by \nthe Commission may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a \nmonopoly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What is the last wording there? I am trying to hear.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me read the paragraph again. Essentially what this \namendment would do is to provide that, if the Federal Communications \nCommission approved an application under paragraph 1 in the bill, the \nAttorney General may commence an action in a U.S. District Court:\n\n       . . . if . . . the Attorney General determines that the \n     authorization granted by the Commission may substantially \n     lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly; or, if the \n     Attorney General determines that the authorization granted by \n     the Commission is inconsistent with any recommendation of the \n     Attorney General provided to the Commission pursuant to \n     paragraph (2) of this section.\n       The commencement of such an action shall stay the \n     effectiveness of the Commission's approval unless the court \n     shall otherwise specifically order.\n\n  I recognize this is a very controversial issue. We have already \ndebated a couple of versions of the Justice Department involvement. I \ndo want to have this called up, as I have just done, prior to 7:30 to \nhave the right to ask for a vote on this different approach with \nrespect to the Justice Department prior to final passage of this bill. \nI do not intend to speak at length this evening but I did want to have \nthis introduced. I will be happy to have it set aside.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I will be prepared to table right now and get a vote on \nit. Then it will be behind us. Would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is we are going to vote on a good number \nof amendments tomorrow en bloc. Or at least stacked amendments. I \nexpect there may be some others who discussed the Justice Department \nrole who may want to add some comments to this.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, if my friend will yield, we have had a \nlong debate on the Senate floor. I thought we had a general agreement. \nWe allowed the Thurmond amendment to be voted on first, in \nconsideration of my friend from North Dakota. We bent over backward to \ngive everybody every chance for this. The bill has been in for a week. \nI would plead with him, we would like to vote now before Members leave. \nThis subject has been debated so thoroughly and for so many days. We \nare prepared to vote here on his amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from South Dakota is absolutely correct. He \nhas been eminently fair. I have not referenced an amendment this \nevening that is identical to the Justice Department amendments that we \nhave discussed before. This is a different amendment.\n  It provides that the Attorney General will have the opportunity to \nseek a stay in U.S. District Court if and only if, upon approval of an \napplication by the Federal Communications Commission, the Attorney \nGeneral would determine the authorization granted by the Commission may \nsubstantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.\n  This is a different approach and it is gradations lower than the \nstuff, rather the approaches that we were talking about earlier.\n  There may be some others who would like to discuss this. But, in any \nevent, the Senator certainly has a right to table this. At the moment, \nI hope he will refrain from doing so in the event some others would \nlike to discuss it.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. If my friend will yield, I hate to do this because at \n7:30 we are supposed to have the potential list of amendments that we \nare trying to move forward. There is very little time tomorrow morning. \nSenator Dole has asked that we vote on as many of these amendments as \nwe can. This has been debated thoroughly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator from South Dakota, as well as the \nranking minority member on this issue--the Senator realizes that we \nhave had substantial debate on the Justice Department role. Those of us \nwho offered the Justice amendment understood that we lost, and it was a \nvery close vote. But, nonetheless, we lost. Many of us feel very \nstrongly about the need to update the 1934 law, that we ought to move \nforward in the rewrite of the telecommunications laws. We also feel \nvery strongly that if we proceed just as we are now with this bill, we \ncould find ourselves in a heck of a fix having dealt the Justice \nDepartment out of a legitimate role here.\n  I guess my question is, Does the chairman of the Commerce Committee \nand the ranking member intend to hold oversight hearings in the next \ncouple of years, next year, or the year after, so that you can, through \nthe committee structure, address this issue of the Justice role and \nwhat has happened since the passage of the bill, if this bill in fact \npasses?\n  If I had some assurance that maybe we would have aggressive \noversight, and if we find in that oversight that we [[Page S8354]] have \nmade a mistake here, then perhaps I would be persuaded to let this go. \nI am uncomfortable with where this rests. This amendment is not the \nsame as the previous amendment. It is a different approach.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee and the ranking minority member \nabout their intentions with respect to evaluating whether what we have \ndone works or does not work and whether dealing out the Justice \nDepartment the way they have been dealt out of this process has been \nhelpful or hurtful to the consumers.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Let me first of all commend the Senator from North \nDakota. He is my friend. We work together on all kinds of issues, and \nwe will in the future. We will try to make this a part of a hearing or \nhearings. I cannot guarantee it. There is so much authorization \nlegislation to do in the Commerce, Science, and Transportation \nCommittee, a stack of authorizing legislation to do when we are getting \na letter from Senator Domenici as to how to raise about $25 or $30 \nbillion. So we have a lot of work to do in the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee. But we will be holding hearings. This will be \na part of it.\n  I really wish that my friend from North Dakota would give us a chance \nin good faith to address this after the proper hearings and take it up \nlegislatively later, if that would be possible.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me join in the comments with our distinguished \nchairman. What happens here is, with the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, as this Senator sees it, it just comes back around and \nreiterates the amendment which was defeated. I do not think it was \nunjustifiably defeated or casually defeated, or whatever was the \nexpression used by my friend from North Dakota. Yes, we should have \noversight hearings. This is a really complex measure. I cannot see, as \na member of that communications subcommittee, that we not have hearings \neach year to see the progress made, how they have managed to set down \nthe rules for the unbundling, the dial parity, the interconnection, the \nnumber portability, and all of these particular things to move \neverything along down this information superhighway.\n  So I agree with the Senator from North Dakota on that. But I agree \nwith our chairman. We do not want to come back around now, and have it \nall settled--one-stop shopping, so to speak, that the FCC comes back \naround here at the last minute saying: By the way, we want to put the \nAttorney General back in there again.\n  I am back in, if you want to hear those arguments again about \nantitrust lawyers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is fine. The Senator does not need to repeat those \narguments. But I was entertained by them the first time. I am sure I \nwould be the second time, as well. In fact, I share some of them. But \nat least with respect to the Justice Department, the antitrust \nenforcement, now with Anne Bingaman down at the Attorney General's \noffice, I am pretty pleased with what is going on.\n  Let me ask one additional question. I guess if I get some feeling \nthat you are willing to do oversight hearings and be aggressive, and \nfind out whether this works or does not work, or whether the consumers \nare advantaged or disadvantaged, I would have some better feeling about \nit. When we go to conference with this bill, if this bill passes the \nSenate and the House comes to a conference with a Justice Department \nrole in it, as you know, it is a lesser standard than we were \nproposing. I know that 43 percent of the membership of the Senate on \nthe issue of the Justice role felt differently than the majority, but a \nsubstantial minority, nonetheless.\n  I hope we can find a way in the conference to resolve this issue in a \nslightly different way, as well.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from North \nDakota because I feel comfortable that our Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee should be an oversight committee for part of \nthe time. We have had two of the larger bills, the tort reform bill, \nand the product liability bill, coming through our committee. And then \nthe telecommunications bill has occupied a lot of our time. Because we \nhave the NASA space issue, we have the reauthorization of the Magnuson \nAct, which has had field hearings, we have had a lot of legislation.\n  But I am hopeful that we can have a lot of oversight hearings because \nI am one who believes strongly that we should have a Congress \noversight. David Boren used to say that in his discussions about \nreforms. That was one of the reforms we were going to have, was to have \na Congress with no legislation and oversight, which is kind of the \n``Blue Monday'' work of Congress where you just sit and try to improve \nthe Government we already have.\n  So I think the Senator makes a good point. We hope to get into those \ntypes of hearings. We have had some already. We will have more. I hear \nwhat he is saying. But I think at this particular time in this bill, \nafter all these negotiations and so forth have gone on, that we would \nhave to oppose his amendment at this time. But we hope to work with him \non it in the future.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, whether we count votes or weigh votes, I \ndo not think there is any reason to believe a tabling motion made by \nthe chairman of the committee would produce a different result than I \nsaw last evening. So I shall not pursue this, and I will ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the amendment in a moment.\n  But I will say to you that I think this issue will not dissolve. The \nissue of the Justice Department role and dealing with anticompetitive \nor antitrust issues will not go away and will show up again, certainly \nwhen some of us think we have the votes to win. When it does show up, \nyou will know that we have counted differently. But in any event, if \nthe chairman and the ranking member will permit me, I ask unanimous \nconsent to withdraw the amendment at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1343) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I thank my friend from North Dakota very much for his \ncooperation on this.\n  Mr. BROWN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 1318, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1318, as \nmodified. I believe all parties have had a chance to review it. It has \nbeen cleared now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1318), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I again urge Senators to please come \nto the floor with their amendments. We are open for business. By 7:30, \nSenator Dole will return to the floor and look over the amendments that \npeople wish to offer. We are eager to do business over here. I plead \nwith Senators. We are trying to finish up. Please come to the floor \nwith your speeches or amendments.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1299\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, on behalf of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Breaux], he wanted to make sure he qualified amendment \nNo. 1299 to be called up but not necessarily to be voted on at this \nparticular time. He is not present, but I would like to call it up and \nthen set it aside, 1299.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for Mr. \n     Breaux, proposes an amendment numbered 1299.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n[[Page S8355]] \n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 123, line 10, add the following new sentence: \n     ``This section shall take effect upon a determination by the \n     United States Coast Guard that at least 80% of vessels \n     required to implement the Global Maritime Distress and Safety \n     System have the equipment required by such System installed \n     and operating in good working condition.''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And I ask unanimous consent now that the amendment be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1285\n\n (Purpose: To means test the eligibility of the community users in the \n                                  act)\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I would like to call up amendment No. \n1285 on behalf of Senator John McCain. The intention is for this \namendment to be debated and possibly voted on tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler], for Mr. \n     McCain, for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Exon, \n     Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Craig, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1285.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 310 of the Act, add the following:\n       (  ) No entity listed in this section shall be entitled for \n     preferential rates or treatment as required by this section, \n     if such entity operates as a for-profit business, is a school \n     as defined in section 264(d)(1) with an endowment of more \n     than $50 million, or is a library not eligible for \n     participation in state-based plane for Library Services and \n     Construction Act title III funds.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1323, as Modified\n\n (Purpose: To postpone the effective date of the authority to provide \n                       alarm monitoring services)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like to call up my amendment. I \nbelieve it is amendment No. 1323.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Packwood, proposes an amendment numbered 1323.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I would like just to take a couple of \nminutes to talk about this amendment. I do not want to take a great \ndeal of time; I know the managers want to move on to other amendments, \nand I have two more amendments I want to offer.\n  I believe this amendment as it has been modified will be acceptable \nto both sides. I wish to thank both Senator Hollings and Senator \nPressler for being willing to accommodate me and to work this out. I \nthank the esteemed Senator from Kentucky also for his willingness to \nhelp work this matter out in an acceptable manner.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to strike the number 6 and \ninsert in lieu thereof the number 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1323), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 109, line 4, strike out ``3 years'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``4 years''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I know that most of any Senate \ncolleagues share my belief that small business people are the backbone \nof both the economic and community life of this country. We know that \nthe small business people in our villages, towns and cities back home \nhelp to provide neighborhood stability and pride by being the \nindividuals who can be depended upon to participate in community \naffairs, and we all know small businesses are where the jobs are \ncreated.\n  Today, in the midst of these great battles among corporate titans \nlike the baby Bells, the major long distance carriers, the large cable \ntelevision companies and the large broadcasters, this amendment helps \nthe little person. The amendment that I have just introduced on behalf \nof myself and Senator Packwood is very simple. It merely changes the \nwaiting period before the Bell companies could enter the alarm \nmonitoring service business to 4 years.\n  Now, some of my colleagues might ask why we are doing this. Well, \nthis amendment would partially restore an agreement reached in the last \nCongress through good faith negotiations between the alarm industry and \nthe Bells. They were asked by Members of Congress to work out a deal, \nand they did. There was give and take on both sides and they came to an \nagreement. It is the purpose of the Harkin-Packwood amendment to \nrestore one key element in that agreement.\n  And why was this agreement struck in the first place? First of all, \nthe burglar and fire alarm industry is unique. It is the only \ninformation service which is competitively available in every community \nacross the Nation. If you want to verify this, I urge you to go back to \nyour offices and check the yellow pages in the phone book for your \nState. What you will find is that the alarm security services are \nwidely and competitively available.\n  What is less apparent is the fact that this highly competitive, $10 \nbillion industry is not dominated by large companies. Instead, it is \ndominated by small businesses which employ on average less than 10 \nworkers. There are over 13,000 alarm companies across the Nation. The \ntop 100 control less than 25 percent of the marketplace and the 100th \nlargest company has annual revenues of less than $3 million a year. The \neight largest companies control merely 11 percent of the marketplace.\n  Many of these businesses epitomize the American dream. Alarm \ncompanies are started by people with all kinds of backgrounds. A \nmilitary veteran who learned electronics in the service, someone who \nworked in the building trades, or a retired police officer, they start \ntheir own businesses; they work hard; they succeed; and they want to \npass on their business to their children.\n  All of that is at risk. The industry is an open marketplace where \nsmall companies compete successfully every day with a few large \nnational companies because no single company has the ability to control \naccess to service or how it is delivered.\n  Furthermore, no single individual or group of companies has the \nability to set the price in the marketplace. It is the American \nconsumer who has the most to lose because the consumer benefits from \nthis competitive marketplace. Over the past decade, the average price \nof the installation of a home security system has declined 40 percent. \nToday, you can have a system installed in your home for as little as \n$200, and some companies are even offering free installation in order \nto promote alarm monitoring services.\n  The alarm industry also has an excellent job creation record. Over \nthe past 20 years, the alarm industry has more than tripled employment \nfrom 40,000 jobs to well over 140,000 jobs.\n  This is a very vibrant sector of the American economy. So vigorous \nalarm industry competition benefits the consumer in another way--the \ndevelopment of an industry-wide culture which promotes prompt, reliable \nservice.\n  This is vitally important in an industry where the service involved \nis a protection of life, safety, and property in one's home or \nbusiness. Knowing that a service person will be there next week \nsometime in the morning or afternoon is not good enough. Consumers \nbenefit from the knowledge that if they do not like the service they \nare receiving, there is always another alarm company that will provide \nthe service they want and need at a competitive price.\n  Another compelling reason for increasing the transition period for \nthe Bell entry into the alarm monitoring service is the fact most \nexperts agree that the vast majority of small business alarm companies \nwill be driven out of business if the regional Bell operating companies \nenter before a level playing field exists.\n  The industry felt it had an excellent chance of developing that level \nplaying field in its prior agreement with the Bells. That agreement \nincluded a ban on Bell company access to the customer lists of existing \nalarm companies, an expedited complaint process at the FCC, a \nDepartment of Justice-administered VIII(c) antitrust entry test, and an \nadequate waiting period to ensure that an overburdened FCC should \nactually address the industry's complaints when Bell entry occurs. \n[[Page S8356]] \n  While the first two of those provisions remain in the bill, the \ncritical VIII(c) antitrust entry test is gone and the term of years \nprior to entry was cut in half to 3 years.\n  So, Madam President, while S. 652 requires the RBOC's meet a \nchecklist of requirements designed to establish conditions necessary \nfor competition in the local exchange, it does not require actual \ncompetition to exist. An VIII(c) antitrust test is no longer available. \nCompetition in the local telephone exchange is the next best assurance \nof a level playing field.\n  So, Madam President, the goal of this amendment is to make sure that \nthese small companies out there, indeed, have some period of time to \nensure that there is a level playing field before the Bells can enter \nthe alarm and service industry.\n  This period, has been agreed upon for 4 years, and I am hopeful that \nwould be the minimum length of time that we would have. I still believe \nthat the initial agreement of 6 years should have been adhered to, but \nI understand that this has been worked out for 4 years here in the \nSenate, with the assurance of the committee that this would be \nacceptable. I am hopeful that a longer period can be worked out in the \nconference committee. Again, I want to thank Senators Pressler and \nHollings for helping work out this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, these carveouts are always difficult \nbecause when there is a carveout, there are problems for new entrants. \nI agree with the Senator from Iowa that this is small business. There \nhas been a lot of discussion on this, whether the burglar alarm people \nshould be given a certain period of protection.\n  We hope in a deregulatory bill to get everybody competing as soon as \npossible. In fact, we had a big thing--at least it was big to me--in \nthe Commerce Committee of keeping even the newspaper publishers without \na carveout, without a period of years --they have 5 or 6 years in the \nHouse bill.\n  If we are going to have deregulation, we have to get people \ncompeting, because new people want to get into the field also out \nthere, new small businesses.\n  As I understand it, there is an informal agreement, if we can use \nthat term, reached that they will not seek beyond 4 years in \nconference, hopefully. With that understanding, we can accept this \namendment.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator have any further debate on \nthis amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1323), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1322\n\n   (Purpose: To prevent unfair billing practices for information or \n              services provided over calls to 800 numbers)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, if my friend from Massachusetts will \nyield, I just have two other amendments that have been accepted. I call \nup amendment No. 1322 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1322.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 146, below line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 409. PREVENTION OF UNFAIR BILLING PRACTICES FOR \n                   INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED OVER TOLL-FREE \n                   TELEPHONE CALLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Reforms required by the Telephone Disclosure and \n     Dispute Resolution Act of 1992 have improved the reputation \n     of the pay-per-call industry and resulted in regulations that \n     have reduced the incidence of misleading practices that are \n     harmful to the public interest.\n       (2) Among the successful reforms is a restriction on \n     charges being assessed for calls to 800 telephone numbers or \n     other telephone numbers advertised or widely understood to be \n     toll free.\n       (3) Nevertheless, certain interstate pay-per-call \n     businesses are taking advantage of an exception in the \n     restriction on charging for information conveyed during a \n     call to a ``toll-free'' number to continue to engage in \n     misleading practices. These practices are not in compliance \n     with the intent of Congress in passing the Telephone \n     Disclosure and Dispute Resolution Act.\n       (4) It is necessary for Congress to clarify that its intent \n     is that charges for information provided during a call to an \n     800 number or other number widely advertised and understood \n     to be toll free shall not be assessed to the calling party \n     unless the calling party agrees to be billed according to the \n     terms of a written subscription agreement or by other \n     appropriate means.\n       (b) Prevention of Unfair Billing Practices.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 228(c) (47 U.S.C. 228(c)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking out subparagraph (C) of paragraph (7) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(C) the calling party being charged for information \n     conveyed during the call unless--\n       ``(i) the calling party has a written agreement (including \n     an agreement transmitted through electronic medium) that \n     meets the requirements of paragraph (8); or\n       ``(ii) the calling party is charged for the information in \n     accordance with paragraph (9); or''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(8) Subscription agreements for billing for information \n     provided via toll-free calls.--\n       ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (7)(C), a \n     written subscription does not meet the requirements of this \n     paragraph unless the agreement specifies the material terms \n     and conditions under which the information is offered and \n     includes--\n       ``(i) the rate at which charges are assessed for the \n     information;\n       ``(ii) the information provider's name;\n       ``(iii) the information provider's business address;\n       ``(iv) the information provider's regular business \n     telephone number;\n       ``(v) the information provider's agreement to notify the \n     subscriber of all future changes in the rates charged for the \n     information; and\n       ``(vi) the subscriber's choice of payment method, which may \n     be by direct remit, debit, prepaid account, phone bill or \n     credit or calling card.\n       ``(B) Billing arrangements.--If a subscriber elects, \n     pursuant to subparagraph (A)(vi), to pay by means of a phone \n     bill--\n       ``(i) the agreement shall clearly explain that charges for \n     the service will appear on the subscriber's phone bill;\n       ``(ii) the phone bill shall include, in prominent type, the \n     following disclaimer:\n\n       `Common carriers may not disconnect local or long distance \n     telephone service for failure to pay disputed charges for \n     information services.'; and\n\n       ``(iii) the phone bill shall clearly list the 800 number \n     dialed.\n       ``(C) Use of pins to prevent unauthorized use.--A written \n     agreement does not meet the requirements of this paragraph \n     unless it requires the subscriber to use a personal \n     identification number to obtain access to the information \n     provided, and includes instructions on its use.\n       ``(D) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding paragraph (7)(C), a \n     written agreement that meets the requirements of this \n     paragraph is not required--\n       ``(i) for calls utilizing telecommunications devices for \n     the deaf;\n       ``(ii) for services provided pursuant to a tariff that has \n     been approved or permitted to take effect by the Commission \n     or a State commission; or\n       ``(iii) for any purchase of goods or of services that are \n     not information services.\n       ``(E) Termination of service.--On receipt by a common \n     carrier of a complaint by any person that an information \n     provider is in violation of the provisions of this section, a \n     carrier shall--\n       ``(i) promptly investigate the complaint;

Madam President, I want to speak about a problem being \nfaced by families across the country--a problem that has cost families \nhundreds and even thousands of dollars. This problem exposes families \nto ripoff schemes in their own homes. Worst of all, young people are \nbeing exposed to dial-a-porn phone sex services, even when the families \ntake the step of placing a block on extra cost 900 number calls from \ntheir home.\n  Most people believe that when they dial 1-800 at the beginning of a \ncall, they are calling toll free. Toll free 800 number calling has had \na dramatically positive impact on many businesses, allowing catalog \nsales to take off, and providing helpful customer services. My State of \nIowa is prominent in providing these telemarketing services. So I \nstrongly believe that we must ensure public confidence in toll-free 800 \nnumbers.\n  Federal law prohibits most practices that would allow people calling \nto an 800 number to be charged for the call. Callers cannot be assessed \na charge by virtue of completing the call, and they cannot be connected \nto a pay-per-call service--which are usually called 900 number \nservices. They also cannot charge for information conveyed during the \ncall--with one exception. If there is a preexisting agreement to be \ncharged, a charge is allowed. This provision was added, because there \nwas concern that the provision might be read to prevent people buying \nmerchandise with a credit card on an 800 number, or for nationwide \naccess numbers for long distance providers.\n  Unfortunately, this small loophole has allowed some sleazy operators \nto set up phone sex services on 800 numbers--and to make the caller pay \nthe bill. They use the loophole allowing a charge when there is a \npreexisting arrangement to turn a toll-free 800 number call into a toll \ncall.\n  Families are being hurt by these services. Youngsters run across the \nads, and, thinking the call will be free, call numbers like 1-800 HOT \nTALK. These numbers appear in all kinds of publications--from the city \npaper here in Washington; Rolling Stone magazine; and a host of adult \nmagazines.\n  Here are just two examples of this outrageous behavior that has come \nto my attention recently. I would bet that every Senator has received \ncalls from constituents about this problem, but here are just two from \nIowa.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print some constituent \nletters in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Consumer Advocate, Office of Utilities, Lucas State \n           Office Bldg.,\n                                  Des Moines, IA January 28, 1995.\n     To Whom It May Concern:\n       This letter is regarding my recent encounter with U.S. West \n     Communications.\n       On Tuesday January 24, 1995 I called U.S. West to change \n     our service. Because of a recent problem with the so called \n     ``chat line'' and because of past problems with the 1-800's \n     that conveniently turn into the 1-900 charges. I asked U.S. \n     West to take my husband off the account completely and to \n     have all long distance service blocked from our home. I \n     wanted no access to any 1+ dialing, 1-800/1-900 calls. I also \n     cancelled all calling cards. My husband agreed and the \n     calling cards were stopped that same day and everything was \n     switched to only my access.\n       On Thursday January 26th I thought I had better check to \n     see that my order was completed. I had no 1+ direct dialing \n     but I could still call 1-800 numbers. I was shocked.\n       On Saturday January 28, 1995 I called U.S. West to see why \n     I still had 1-800 access. They informed me that there was no \n     way to block 1-800 calls. I explained to the lady that I had \n     been misinformed because I was told my husband would not be \n     able to make any long distance calls from our house. She put \n     me on hold then came back to me and said I could not block 1-\n     800 calls. I waited a few hours, thinking about everything I \n     had been told and then I recalled U.S. West and asked to \n     speak to a supervisor. I was told that there were no \n     supervisors around to talk to. The representative offered to \n     help. I explained the situation to her. She read a new \n     department memo on the 1-800 information while I waited to \n     get some answers. I explained to her that I really needed to \n     speak to a supervisor and was told that the supervisor would \n     just do the same thing that she was doing (read the memo on \n     1-800).\n       I am discouraged for many reasons: I could not speak to a \n     supervisor and it was not offered.\n       For a minor to buy alcohol or cigarettes they must show an \n     I.D. They are face to face with the seller. These phone \n     conversations have a recording saying you must be 18 years or \n     older or have parents permission. They have no actual contact \n     with the buyer and in turn are selling to minors, and \n     unfortunately it's the parents who pay.\n       In closing I would like to urge you to please find a way to \n     stop this problem. I would love to find a way to stop the \n     phone scam operations but I do not know where to begin. I \n     plan to send a copy of this letter to Senators Tom Harkin and \n     Charles Grassley. I can only hope that the more of us who \n     complain the easier it will be to put an end to it all.\n       Thank you for your time in reading my concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sheila Wenger.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                             Iowa Utilities Board,\n\n\n                                           Utilities Division,\n\n                                                   Des Moines, IA.\n       Dear Sirs: My name is Sue Tappe and I work as the Clinton \n     County Protective Payee. I work with clients that receive \n     some type of benefit, such as SS or SSI, VA etc., and cannot \n     handle their own funds for a variety of reasons.\n       I am writing today in reference to a client that had a \n     phone service installed in Sept. 1994. This service, at the \n     time of order, had a long distance block set up on it, so I \n     assumed there would be no long distance calling. WRONG \n     assumption. My client got a hold of some advertisements that \n     offered 800 numbers, and went to town dialing them. They then \n     turned into 900 numbers by requesting the caller to push \n     another button. He can only read to approximately 3rd grade \n     level, but he can follow instructions. He said 800 numbers do \n     not cost anything when I questioned him on the subject.\n       I have called all the long distance companies and have \n     asked for credits because of the long distance block. I have \n     gotten cooperation from a couple of the companies, but they \n     also let me know that the normal procedure is to have them \n     then turned over to a collection agency.\n       What can be done about these pay talk telephone companies \n     who take advantage of clients who cannot understand the \n     consequences of their actions much less the value of their \n     money?\n       By the way, my client no longer has a phone service, and \n     that, he does understand. But until there is complete credit \n     back, he will never have service again.\n       I am enclosing copies of bills and sending copies to \n     Senator Tom Harkin and Congressman Jim Leach. We need to take \n     action for a change in laws, and to protect ourselves, all of \n     us, from this situation happening again.\n       Thank you for listening and hope you might provide some \n     suggestions to me and certainly some action can be taken in \n     this area.\n                                                 Sue Tappe, Payee.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, here is how the companies do it. A \ncaller calls an 800 number. He or she is directed to enter an ``access \ncode,'' in order to be connected to a service--without knowing that, by \nentering the number, they are authorizing the service to charge for the \ncall. Another scam is for the call to be switched to international \nnumbers in small countries around the world, or to give an \ninternational phone number without disclosing the extremely high \ninternational calling rates. Phone sex companies set up in these \ncompanies, where local law in the host country allows them to receive a \ncut from the charges. One service operated out of Suriname charges some \n$50 per minute. [[Page S8358]] \n  Under another so-called preexisting agreement, the first call from a \nnumber establishes the agreement, and subsequent calls are charged to \nthe phone number the first call was made from. This means that anyone \nmaking a telephone call from your phone could make you liable for \nhundreds of dollars of calls--even if the person never makes another \ncall from that phone. A person making a call from a motel can set up \none of these agreements with a phone-sex service, and the motel could \nbe forced to pay for subsequent calls from anywhere in the country. At \nthe Motel 6 chain alone, porn calls have cost a quarter of a million \ndollars in the last year. In our own offices here at the Senate, a \ncourier who uses the courtesy telephone, supposedly to call his \ndispatcher, could charge phone-sex calls back to your office account.\n  How many people are concerned about this problem? All you need to \nknow is how many families have signed up for 900 number blocking. These \nfamilies have said that they have no intention of using pay-per-call \nservices. In Iowa, about one in four lines are restricted from calling \n900 numbers, most of which are homes, rather than businesses.\n  Today, I am offering an amendment that would prohibit this abuse. My \namendment, which is similar to one that has been included in the House \nCommerce Committee-passed version of this legislation by our House \ncolleague, Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, would alleviate \nthis problem. Representative Gordon has been a leader on this issue for \nmany years, and has fought hard to get control of the phone-sex \nindustry. This amendment would clarify that a preexisting agreement \nmust be in writing, which would end the supposed preexisting agreements \nthat are initiated by pressing a button on a phone. It also expands the \ndefinition of pay-per-call service to include the international calls, \nto allow the FCC to regulate them.\n  Alternatively, it would allow information services on 800 numbers \nwithout a preexisting agreement. The service provider would have to \ndisclose their rates on each call. If the caller agreed to pay and gave \na credit, charge or calling card to pay for the information, the \nservice could be provided.\n  The bill as reported by committee purports to address this problem, \nin section 406. However, this section would not go as far as the \nlanguage I am offering. My amendment was developed after extensive \nconsultation with industry representatives, to try to take into account \nproblems beyond the 800 numbers, and also to take into account the new \nlegitimate information systems that are going to be offered in the new \ninformation environment that this bill will create. Further, a similar \namendment has already been accepted in the House subcommittee markup. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important amendment to close the \nloophole on the phone sex peddlers.\n  Madam President, again, I believe this amendment has been agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1322) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1324\n\n (Purpose: To combat telemarketing fraud through reasonable disclosure \n          of certain records for telemarketing investigations)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1324.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1324.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 146, below line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 409. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN RECORDS FOR INVESTIGATIONS OF \n                   TELE- MARKETING FRAUD.\n\n       Section 2703(c)(1)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking out ``or'' at the end of clause (ii);\n       (2) by striking out the period at the end of clause (iii) \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``; or''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iv) submits a formal written request for information \n     relevant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation of the \n     governmental entity for the name, address, and place of \n     business of a subscriber or customer of such provider, which \n     subscriber or customer is engaged in telemarketing (as such \n     term is in section 2325 of this title).''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, every year thousands of Americans are \nvictimized by fraudulent telemarketing promotions. And, unfortunately, \nthese scam artists prey most often on our senior citizens. The losses \nevery year are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. I send an \namendment to the desk that would help law enforcement to more \neffectively combat these abuses.\n  How do these rip-offs occur and why is my amendment necessary to stop \nthem? Advertisements regarding sweepstakes, contests, loans, credit \nreport and other promotions appear in newspapers, magazines, and other \ndirect mail and telephone solicitations. The operators of many of these \nphoney promotions set up a telephone boiler room in which a number of \nphones are operated to receive calls responding to their ads and to \nmake direct phone appeals, run their promotion for two to three months, \nripping people off for thousands and even millions of dollars, and then \ndiscontinue the operation and move on to another location and rip-off \npromotion.\n  By the time law enforcement authorities have received enough \ninformation to support obtaining the grand jury subpoenas required \nunder current law, the business and the operators are gone. And the \noften elderly victims are out of luck. Law enforcement authorities \ncurrently do not have a mechanism available to quickly identify the \nlocation of the boiler room before the promotion is discontinued. So, \nthey often cannot get after these scam artists until many people have \nbeen victimized and the operation has closed down.\n  Law enforcement agencies have this problem because often these \npromotions furnish only a phone number, leaving no other means of \nidentification or location. My amendment addresses this shortcoming by \nproviding law enforcement authorities with a narrowly drawn procedure \nto more quickly obtain the name, address, and physical location of \nbusinesses suspected of being involved in telemarketing fraud. Phone \ncompanies would have to provide law enforcement officials only the \nname, address, and physical location of a telemarketing business \nholding a phone number if the officials submitted a formal written \nrequest for this information relevant to a legitimate law enforcement \ninvestigation.\n  The need for this change was brought to my attention by the U.S. \nPostal Inspection Service, the Federal agency which investigates many \nof the telemarketing schemes. It is necessary to crack down on serious \nconsumer fraud. With this change, we will have many more successful \nefforts to shut down these rip-off artists like several recent cases in \nmy home State of Iowa.\n  Gregory Dean Garrison of Red Oak, IA was recently indicted for \noperating a telemarketing promotion. He is alleged to have obtained \nlists of people who had previously been victimized by telemarketing \nschemes. Using the company named Teletrieve, he offered for a fee, of \ncourse, to help individuals recover all the money they previously lost \nto telemarketers. No money was ever recovered. Most of the victims were \nin their eighties.\n  Approximately 30,000 Iowans received solicitations for another scam. \nSweepstakes International, Inc., mailed these Iowans and others around \nthe Nation postcards that enticed recipients to call a 900 number in \norder to receive a ``valuable prize.'' Callers were charged $9.95 on \ntheir phone bill. Based on a Postal Service investigation, civil action \nwas initiated in U.S. District Court in Iowa. As a result of the court \naction the promotion was halted and $1.7 million was frozen. This \nrepresented just one and a half month's revenue from the scam.\n  In a similar case, Disc Sweepstakes, Limited of West Des Moines \nmailed [[Page S8359]] about 1.5 million postcards during a three month \nperiod to individuals throughout the country, representing that they \nhad won a valuable prize. To collect the ``prize'' people had to again \ncall a 900 number for which they were billed $9.90. This scheme brought \nin over $1 million.\n  These are obviously cases in which the Postal Inspection Service was \nable to take action. But for every scam they close down, there are many \nmore that go unstopped. It is frustrating for our law enforcement \nprofessionals and it is costing consumers, particularly the elderly, \nmillions of dollars every day.\n  My amendment simply would allow law enforcement to more easily \nidentify and locate these operations. To get any further information \nabout the company, they would have to go through the current law \nsubpoena process. For post office boxes rented for commercial purposes, \nany individual, let alone just law enforcement for a legitimate law \nenforcement purpose, can obtain the name and address of the box holder. \nSo my proposal is very modest in comparison.\n  I want to make it very clear that this amendment is not about \nprivacy. It should in no way set a precedent for allowing the \nGovernment easier access to company or client records or other \ninformation from businesses. I share the concerns of those who seek to \nprotect privacy rights generally. I want to work with them and others \nwho may have a concern with this amendment to see how we can work \ntogether before this bill is subject to conference and final \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this narrow but important amendment \nto give law enforcement a simple tool to better protect Americans from \ntele- marketing scams.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1324) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1342\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1342 be brought up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1342.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 146, strike line 14 and insert in lieu the \n     following: ``cency, or nudity''.\n       This section shall not become effective unless the \n     Commission shall prohibit any telecommunications carrier from \n     excluding from any of such carrier's services any high-cost \n     area, or any area on the basis of the rural location or the \n     income of the residents of such area; provided that a carrier \n     may exclude an area in which the carrier can demonstrate \n     that--\n       (1) providing a service to such area will be less \n     profitable for the carrier than providing the service in \n     areas to which the carrier is already providing or has \n     proposed to provide the service; and--\n       (2) there will be insufficient consumer demand for the \n     carrier to earn some return over the long term on the capital \n     invested to provide such service to such area.\n       The Commission shall provide for public comment on the \n     adequacy of the carrier's proposed service area on the basis \n     of the requirements of this section.\n                    Amendment No. 1342, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be modified with the changes that I now send to the desk, and \nI do this on behalf of myself, Senator Lott, Senator Hollings, and \nSenator Pressler. This amendment has been worked out on both sides. I \nadvise the Senate that this modification makes no substantive change in \nthe amendment. It merely places the amendment in a more appropriate \nplace in the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n       ``(k) Prohibition on Exclusion of Areas From Service Based \n     on Rural Location, High Costs, or Income.--Part II of title \n     II (47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) as amended by this Act, is amended \n     by adding after section 261 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 253A. PROHIBITION ON EXCLUSION OF AREAS FROM SERVICE \n                   BASED ON RURAL LOCATION, HIGH COSTS, OR INCOME.\n\n       ``The Commission shall prohibit any telecommunications \n     carrier from excluding from any of such carrier's services \n     any high-cost area, or any area on the basis of the rural \n     location or the income of the residents of such area; \n     provided that a carrier may exclude an area in which the \n     carrier can demonstrate that--\n       ``(1) there will be insufficient consumer demand for the \n     carrier to earn some return over the long term on the capital \n     invested to provide such service to such area, and--\n       ``(2) providing a service to such area will be less \n     profitable for the carrier than providing the service in \n     areas to which the carrier is already providing or has \n     proposed to provide the service.\n       ``The Commission shall provide for public comment on the \n     adequacy of the carrier's proposed service area on the basis \n     of the requirements of this section.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to offer a bipartisan amendment, \nwith Senators Lott, Hollings, and Pressler, that will go a long way to \nmake the intentions of the Senate clear in its recognition of the need \nfor every segment of our society to have access to the information \nsuper-highway as it begins to weave its way across the Nation.\n  In presenting this amendment, we recognize that there is a fear among \nmany groups and community organizations that the infrastructure of the \ninformation super highway will leave out and leave behind those who \nmost need access to it, families in parts of Boston, or in parts of \nSouth Dakota, South Carolina, or Mississippi, or other areas of the \ncountry.\n  Ironically, in the 1950's the infrastructure debate was about which \nneighborhoods and which rural areas would be plowed under by bulldozers \nbuilding the Federal highway system.\n  And, here we are again, in the contemporary equivalent of that same \ndebate.\n  When the Federal highway system was developed, we plowed under the \npoorer areas of many cities and the poorest land in rural areas. We \nwere willing then to lay roads and build bridges through the backyards \nof these areas in our good faith efforts to connect States and cities \ncoast to coast. It was the key to commerce and economic opportunity. It \nwas the future.\n  Now, in the 1990's, the information super highway holds the same key \nto economic opportunity, and it would be unforgivable for us to ignore \nand avoid the same backyards that we were so willing to plow under when \nwe built the interstates beginning in the 1950's.\n  Without access to the information super highway there are those in \nour country who will surely be left behind, and we cannot let that \nhappen.\n  Let me make it clear that this is a bipartisan amendment, and that it \ndoes not imply that there is anyone in this Chamber or anyone who has \nparticipated in the development of this legislation who has intended in \nany way to allow the redlining of any area. It is equally true that no \none is seeking to force telecommunications companies, in their good-\nfaith effort to provide universal service, to lose money by providing \nadvanced telecommunications services to every road and home in the \nNation no matter how remote or how impractical.\n  That is not the intent of anyone.\n  But, having said that, the intent of the Senate must be clear: that \neveryone, especially those less fortunate in our society, those poorer \ninner-city areas and poorer more remote rural areas struggling to keep \nup and move on, should have access to the equipment that will hold the \nkeys to success and the tools to compete in the 21st century, even \nwhere it may not produce great profit for the provider companies.\n  Fairness, in this case, means access; and, though there is no intent \nwith this amendment to punish telecommunications companies or to force \nthem to lose money by providing a service to an area where it is clear \nthey will lose money in their effort, we also recognize the importance \nof universal access. [[Page S8360]] \n  The bill, of course, embodies this philosophy in several ways. But \nnowhere is the principle set forth as straight-forwardly as it should \nbe, and as this amendment does.\n  In summary, this amendment prohibits the exclusion of areas from \naccess to service based on either rural location or income; and it \nrequires the Federal Communications Commission to adopt rules and \nregulations to prohibit any telecommunications carrier from excluding \nan area from service based on the income of its residents, or the rural \nnature of the area; but it does allow the company to make a decision \nnot to offer an advanced telecommunication service if it can \ndemonstrate that there will be insufficient consumer demand for the \ncarrier to earn some return over the long term on its capital \ninvestment in providing the service in that area.\n  I think this is a fair amendment. It is fair to the consumer and to \nthe industry. It establishes in law the principle that all our citizens \nshould have access to these telecommunications services and it respects \nthe complexity of providing those services on a universal basis.\n  With this legislation we will move into a new age of information and \ncommunication--a promising future that demands our careful \nconsideration. We will either establish an infrastructure that brings \nevery American along, or leaves some behind.\n  We must remember, that access to and knowledge of the information \nsuper-highway will define the economic and political power of this \ndemocracy. We can no more deny any American access to that power than \nwe can deny them access to a decent education, or to the ballot, or to \nthe voting booth, for in access to them are the fundamental freedoms of \nthis democracy and the individual opportunities that those freedoms \nprovide.\n  Madam President, I urge passage of this amendment. It is fair. It is \nresponsible. It is right. It places the benefit of the doubt where it \nought to be.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their cooperation and \nassistance. I thank the committee staff. I especially appreciate the \ncooperation and efforts of the Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] and \nhis staff, both in committee and now as the bill is considered on the \nfloor.\n  I will just say very quickly that this amendment will empower the \nCommission to try to guarantee that, as we build an information highway \nstructure, no part of America is left out of that for reasons of \ndiscrimination or oversight that no one in the Senate, I think, would \nembrace.\n  I believe this will help us to have a fair and equitable approach. I \nappreciate the help of the managers of the bill in arriving at an \nagreement on this.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I commend my friend from Massachusetts. I urge the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment No. 1342, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1342), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1283, As Modified\n\n (Purpose: To revise the authority relating to Federal Communications \n                  Commission rules on radio ownership)\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I offer amendment No. 1283, as modified. \nI will discuss it tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1283, as modified.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 79, line 11, in the language added by the Dole \n     amendment No. 1255, as modified, insert the following:\n       (b)(3) Superseding Rule on Radio Ownership.--In lieu of \n     making the modification required by the first sentence of \n     subsection (b)(2), the Commission shall modify its rules set \n     forth in 47 CFR 73,3555 by limiting to 50 AM and 50 FM \n     broadcast stations the number of such stations which may be \n     owned or controlled by one entity nationally.\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Madam President, I am not sure we have the right amendment \nhere.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I will take this opportunity to urge \nSenators to bring their additional amendments to the floor and also to \nsay that I am very proud that 500 delegates at the small business \nconference today sent over individual letters endorsing the passage of \nthis bill and also urging President Clinton to strongly support it.\n  I know the White House has been a little cool toward this bill, but I \nhope that they are warmed up by the small businessmen who are in the \nWhite House Conference on Small Business. I have a whole stack of \nletters here, which I will not put in the Record. I might put in the \nnames, but they are from all over the Nation, small businessmen who \nhave come to Washington, who have sent letters urging that the \nTelecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 be passed \nand that the White House support it and that the Senate version is the \nversion that they are interested in.\n  So I am very proud of that. There has been some talk about big \ncorporate interests and so forth. There has been talk about the \ncellular valley out here. But these are 500 small business men and \nwomen from across the Nation wanting to pass this bill because small \nbusiness will benefit and small business will be able to participate.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I hope that Senators will come to the \nfloor with their amendments because the hour of 7:30 p.m. is \napproaching, and Senator Dole will be back here then.\n  So I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend his request for a \nmoment?\n  The Senator from Illinois wanted a vote on his amendment tomorrow.\n  The amendment will be set aside until tomorrow.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1367\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Heflin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1367.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . AUTHORITY TO ACQUIRE CABLE SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding the provisions of section \n     613(b)(6) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by \n     section 203(a) of this Act, a local exchange carrier (or any \n     affiliate of such carrier owned by, operated by, controlled \n     by, or under common control with such carrier) may purchase \n     or otherwise acquire more than a 10 percent financial \n     interest, or any management interest, or enter into a joint \n     venture or partnership with any cable system described in \n     subsection (b) within the local exchange carrier's telephone \n     service area.\n       (b) Covered Cable Systems.--Subsection (a) applies to any \n     cable system serving no more than 20,000 cable subscribers of \n     which no more than 12,000 of those subscribers live within an \n     urbanized area, as defined by the Bureau of the Census.\n       (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``local exchange carrier'' has the meaning given such term in \n     section 3 (kk) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by \n     section 8(b) of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be laid aside until later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now turn to the consideration of amendment 1341.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1325.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, my amendment No. 1325 is a bipartisan \nproposal. I am joined by a number of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, including my colleague Senator Robb as well as Senators \nDomenici, Graham, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, and McCain.\n  This amendment is intended to improve the procompetitive thrust of \nthis bill as it relates to the manufacture of communications products, \nboth telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment. It \nwill make the bill more workable, and most important it will support \nthe bill's effort to generate more jobs, stimulate innovation, and \ndeliver more consumer choices and lower prices.\n  I want to express my thanks to the managers of this bill for their \ntireless efforts to draft and to enact telecommunications reform \nlegislation. I had the privilege of serving on the Commerce Committee \nin the 1970's when we began to address the Federal policies that would \nbe needed because of the then impending and dramatic changes in \ntelecommunications technology. We learned two important things in those \nearly efforts. First, changes in communications and information \ntechnology would transform our society and our economy. Second, \ndrafting the appropriate policies to support this transformation would \nbe a complex and controversial undertaking. Our floor consideration of \nS. 652 bears out the validity of these two points and demonstrates the \nchallenges which the bill's managers have successfully faced.\n  Our amendment deals with the manufacturing sector, which will develop \nthe ``brick and mortar'' of the information highway. As with all key \ncommunication industries, the stakes for manufacturers in this bill are \nvery high. We cannot jeopardize the current competitive nature of this \nsector as the MFJ restrictions are removed. It has been a very \nsuccessful and competitive area, sparked by the innovation and growth \nmade possible by the postdivestiture environment. This has become a $44 \nbillion sector, and it has created tens of thousands of jobs.\n  The manufacturing sector came alive after the 1984 Modified Final \nJudgment ended practices which had discriminated against nontelephone \ncompany manufacturing. The heart of this discrimination was the control \nwhich the local Bell telephone company had--and still has--over the \nlocal telephone exchange. Equipment had to connect to and use the local \nexchange network. Companies who wanted to make telephone equipment \nneeded to deal with the local exchange company as the exclusive \ndesigner of the network and the exclusive buyer of equipment to run the \nnetwork. The MFJ eliminated the local telephone company's incentive to \ndiscriminate in manufacturing by preventing their direct participation \nin this sector, and that MFJ policy has been successful. Manufacturing \nhas flourished while the BOC's have managed their networks in \ncooperation with the manufacturing community.\n  S. 652 develops rules which will guide the local telephone companies \nand policymakers as the BOC's reenter manufacturing. Recognizing the \ncontinued potential for competitive problems associated with the local \nexchange monopoly, the bill also encourages the end to this local \nexchange monopoly by eliminating restrictions--government and \nfacility--on local exchange competition. However, because we do not \nknow how or when local competition will develop, the bill contains \nsafeguards intended to\n preclude recurrence of the practices that hurt the manufacturing \nindustry before 1984. These safeguards will be needed for so long as \nthe local exchange monopoly persists.\n\n  S. 652 contains two important principles for the manufacturing sector \nwhich are intended to maintain the current competitiveness in the \nmanufacturing sector and to build on this competition. First, the bill \ntreats elimination of the long distance and the manufacturing line of \nbusiness restrictions in the same manner. The Bell operating company \nmust comply with the ``competitive checklist'' before it is eligible to \nenter either the long distance or the manufacturing line of business. \nIt is very important to retain this ``parity'' in the timing and the \nrequirements for entry into both lines of business, and I commend the \nmanagers of the bill for establishing this important principle.\n  The second important principle contained in this bill is one that we \nhave relied upon for twenty years, namely, the requirement of a \nstructural separation between the competitive and monopoly activities \nof the Bell operating company. S. 652 requires the Bell operating \ncompany to provide all competitive services, including manufacturing \nactivities, through a fully separate affiliate. Without such a \nrequirement, it would be virtually impossible to assure the ratepayers \nof this country that they were not underwriting the BOCs competitive \nventures. Both the Courts and the FCC have said on many occasions that \naccounting separation alone is insufficient to protect ratepayers in \nthis type of situation.\n  I urge the bill's managers to continue to defend these important \nprinciples.\n  Unfortunately, from a manufacturing perspective, and in my opinion, \nS. 652 has created a potential loophole. The bill would permit the Bell \noperating company to undertake research and design aspects of \nmanufacturing and to enter into royalty agreements with third parties \nas soon as the separate subsidiary rules are adopted. This provision \nmeans that the operating company will not necessarily have complied \nwith the ``competitive checklist'' before it is able to engage in these \ntwo activities. This provision has created an exception to the parity \nbetween manufacturing and long distance services, and in my opinion, it \nmay become a very troubling distraction and loophole.\n  In their package of amendments adopted last week, the managers of the \nbill have clarified that these exceptions are not effective until the \nseparate affiliate rules have been adopted. This is an important \nclarification.\n  In my opinion, these exceptions should be removed from the bill, and \nin my discussions with the bill's managers I am hopeful that you will \nkeep an open mind on this question as you proceed forward to \nconference.\n  For now, the presence of these exceptions in the bill highlights two \nareas where the bill's safeguards should be improved. In my view this \namendment would be an important improvement to the bill even if the \nexceptions were not in the bill. But they are made more important \nbecause of the exceptions.\n  First, the bill does not require full and ongoing information \ndisclosure about the telephone exchange network. In order to develop \nthe products and the services that would connect with and use the \nnetwork, manufacturers need to know the protocols and technical \nrequirements that control connection to and use of the network. As \n[[Page S8362]] currently written, the bill focuses on requiring \ndisclosure of vital network information when the Bell operating company \ntransfers that information to its affiliate. This trigger is important, \nbut it begs the fundamental point that information should be available \nwhen manufacturers need it, not merely when the BOC may decide to \ntransfer it to the affiliate. This trigger also does not address \nsituations where information is transferred to preferred third party\n suppliers. A trigger based on a transfer to the affiliate invites \n``gaming'' by the BOC and it can encourage considerable debate about \nwhen information was given to the affiliate whether information was \nprovided to competitors on the timely basis.\n\n  In my opinion, information regarding protocols and technical \nrequirements for connecting to the network should be on file with the \nFCC and kept current at all times. This is not a regulatory burden. \nThis is good business and sound, pro-competitive policy. And it will \nreduce regulation because it will reduce debates about the timing and \nthe caliber of information available to competitors. Our amendment \nwould call on the Commission to establish this filing requirement at \nthe same time that it establishes the separate affiliate rules.\n  Second, the bill recognizes that relationships between the Bell \noperating companies and third parties can be a source of discrimination \nand cross subsidy. However, the development of rules to prevent such \nactivities are discretionary. Given the royalty and design activities, \nit is especially important for the FCC to address this area at the same \ntime it develops its separate affiliate rules, and our amendment \nincludes this directive.\n  Last, the amendment attempts to address the murky distinction between \n``research and design'' and the other aspects of manufacturing which \nremain prohibited until the BOC has complied with the checklist and is \nauthorized to offer long distance service. If the Bell operating \ncompany is to be allowed to engage in research and design activities \nbefore it is permitted to engage in other manufacturing activities, \nthen it is critical for the Commission to clearly identify and \narticulate these activities which are permitted to distinguish these \nactivities from the other aspects of manufacturing and from BOC \nactivities. This definitional undertaking must be part of the separate \nsubsidiary rulemaking process in order to ensure that ``research and \ndesign'' are completely separate from other aspects of manufacturing \nand from BOC activities.\n  The design area is the most important part of the manufacturing \nprocess. It is the area where considerable value is created, and it is \nthe activity which largely determines the functionality and complexion \nof the products. The MFJ Court has repeatedly found that design \npresents the greatest opportunity for anticompetitive behavior. When \nthe MFJ was adopted, the Court found that ``design'' had been a \nsignificant source of discrimination. More recently, in this report to \nthe Justice Department, Peter Huber concluded that should the BOCs be \npermitted to again engage directly in manufacturing, then ``research \nand development costs, especially for system design and software \ndevelopment, would surely offer an important opportunity for cross-\nsubsidy.''\n  For these reasons I oppose the idea of a more rapid elimination of \nthe entry restrictions for ``design,'' but at the very least the \nCommission must confront the opportunities and risks associated with \nthis exception as part of its development of separate affiliate \nsafeguards rules.\n  Mr. President, our amendment has broad support in the manufacturing \ncommunity. The primary telecommunications manufacturing trade \nassociations, including the Telecommunications Industry Associations, \nthe Electronic Industries Association, the Independent Data \nCommunications Manufacturers Association, and the MultiMedia \nTelecommunications Association, support this amendment. These \nmanufacturers account for an overwhelming majority of the $55 billion \ngenerated by the telecommunications manufacturing industry in 1994. I \nask by unanimous consent that a letter of support from these \norganizations be included in the Record at this point.\n  Again I thank my colleagues, the managers of S. 652, for their \nefforts on this bill and for their cooperation on our amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     The Hon. John Warner,\n     225 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the Telecommunications \n     Industry Association, I want to thank you for your efforts to \n     improve S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and \n     Deregulation Act of 1995. We share your belief that the \n     ``design'' carve-out in the manufacturing section of S. 652 \n     creates a dangerous exception to the bill's otherwise \n     reasonable proposal that a Bell operating company must comply \n     with the bill's ``competitive checklist'' and establish a \n     separate subsidiary before being granted relief from the \n     line-of-business restrictions imposed by the Modification of \n     Final Judgment. Accordingly, although we do not concede that \n     the ``design'' exception in Section 256(a)(2) is appropriate \n     communications policy, and while we continue to believe that \n     Section 256(a)(2) should be dropped from the bill, we \n     strongly support your proposed amendment to S. 652.\n       There is a broad consensus that ``design'' activities are \n     the most important part of the manufacturing process, and \n     that it presents the greatest opportunity for anticompetitive \n     behavior. Thus, the Court administering the MFJ has stated \n     that:\n       ```[I]n virtually every manufacturing episode' that was the \n     subject of a pretrial charge by the government or that \n     produced evidence at the trial, it was design and development \n     manipulation that was the focus or sole subject rather than \n     discrimination with respect to fabrication.'' See United \n     States v. Western Electric Co., 675 F.Supp. 655 (D.D.C. \n     1987).\n       In his report to the Justice Department, Peter Huber \n     reached the same conclusion, stating that ``research and \n     development costs, especially for system design and software \n     development, would surely offer a[n] opportunity for cross-\n     subsidy,'' and that such ``cross-subsidy by U.S. telcos comes \n     at the expense of U.S. ratepayers.'' See Peter Huber, The \n     Geodesic Network (Washington: U.S. Government Printing \n     Office, 1987) at 14.20 and 14.23n. 93. Therefore, allowing \n     the Bell companies to engage in these activities before they \n     have satisfied the ``competitive checklist'' could allow \n     significant anticompetitive conduct by the Bell companies.\n       In addition to providing a check against cross-\n     subsidization, your amendment will help reduce the likelihood \n     that the ``design'' exception will lead to the type of \n     regulatory and judicial disputes that the sponsors of S. 652 \n     are seeking to avoid and ensure that manufacturers have \n     access to the interconnection information necessary to \n     compete equitably for Bell operating company procurement \n     contracts.\n       We are joined in our support for your amendment by several \n     other manufacturing organizations, including the Electronic \n     Industries Association, the Independent Data Communications \n     Manufacturers Association and the MultiMedia \n     Telecommunications Association. Collectively, these \n     organizations represents manufacturers which collectively \n     account for an overwhelming majority of the $55 billion in \n     revenues generated by the telecommunications manufacturing \n     industry in 1994.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Matthew J. Flanigan.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, this is an amendment which the managers \nhave under consideration and, as yet, there has not been a resolution \nbetween the managers as to whether or not it can be accepted. Pending \ntheir decision, I have to make a decision as to whether or not to \npresent it to the entire Senate.\n  If I might briefly state it, I have concerns about the provision in \nS. 652 that permits the Bell operating companies into design aspects of \nmanufacturing as soon as the separate affiliate rules are established. \nThis amendment provides an exception to the bill's important principle \nthat entry into manufacturing in long distance will not occur until the \nchecklist for local exchange competition has been adopted.\n  Short of delaying the design inception, it would be my hope that we \ncould explore the possibility that the provision can be modified to \nmitigate what we view--that is my constituents--as serious potential \nfor discrimination and cross-subsidization, which we view as the \ncurrent situation. Given that the managers are reviewing this, I will \nask that the amendment be laid aside until some future time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I understand that some Senators have a \nproblem with this amendment, and I think we will have to resolve those \nproblems at a future time.\n  Does the Senator from Virginia visage this coming up tomorrow?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, that would be quite agreeable.\n  [[Page S8363]]\n  \n                    Amendment No. 1325, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, to correct what seems to be an \nimperfection, I send a modification of my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nso modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1325), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 222 of the bill, insert the \n     following:\n       (c) Additional Requirements Relating to Research and Design \n     Activities With Respect to Manufacturing.--(1) In addition to \n     the rules required under section 256(a)(2) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934, as added by subsection (a), a \n     Bell operating company may not engage in the activities or \n     enter into the agreements referred to in such section \n     256(a)(2) until the Commission adopts the rules required \n     under paragraph (2).\n       (2) The Commission shall adopt rules that--\n       (A) provide for the full, ongoing disclosure by the Bell \n     operating companies of all protocols and technical \n     specifications required for connection with and to the \n     telephone exchange networks of such companies, and of any \n     proposed research and design activities or other planned \n     revisions to the networks that might require a revision of \n     such protocols or specifications,\n       (B) prevent discrimination and cross-subsidization by the \n     Bell operating companies in their transactions with third \n     parties and with the affiliates of such companies; and\n       (C) ensure that the research and design activities are \n     clearly delineated and kept separate from other manufacturing \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. We have no objection to this amendment being laid over \nuntil tomorrow.\n  I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 1325, as modified, be set \naside until tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I mentioned earlier that over 500 \ndelegates of the, I think, about 1,600 or 1,700 delegates to the Small \nBusiness Conference going on now at the White House have written me \nletters--and also have written President Clinton--urging that he \nsupport the Senate version of the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act and that the Senate pass it.\n  I just pulled out of this packet of 500 letters, one letter from a \nMr. Robbie Smith, Smith Communications in Chicago, IL. I do not know \nhim, but he is a delegate to the Small Business Conference now going on \nat the White House. He wrote the\n following, and I think it is important, because it is illustrative \nthat small business strongly supports this legislation.\n\n       I am writing to urge you to support S. 652, the \n     Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act, which \n     would bring about changes in how telecommunications products \n     and services are sold that would greatly benefit the small \n     businesses of our state.\n       A recent survey, sponsored by the National Federation of \n     Independent Business Foundation, found that a full 86 percent \n     of small business owners said they want the convenience of \n     ``one-stop shopping'' for telecommunications services.\n       S. 652 would bring us one-stop shopping. By creating a more \n     competitive marketplace that will let local Bell companies \n     and long-distance companies and cable companies all compete \n     in each other's traditional businesses, it will provide small \n     businesses with the convenience and lower prices we need.\n       In enacting legislation, we urge Members of Congress to \n     keep in mind ``Five Easy Pieces'' of guidance from small \n     business on what constitutes good telecommunications policy.\n       1. For small businesses as customers, we need legislation \n     that maximizes choice and affordability by simultaneously \n     opening all telecommunications markets--at the earliest \n     possible date--to full and equal competition among vendors.\n       2. For small businesses as customers, we need legislation \n     that minimizes confusion and complexity by letting all \n     vendors compete to offer us one-stop shopping for the full \n     array of telecommunications products and services.\n       3. For all small businesses, we need legislation that \n     maximizes flexibility and minimizes regulation, so \n     introduction of new products and services can keep pace with \n     rapid technological and market changes.\n       4. For small businesses as vendors, we need legislation \n     that maximizes opportunities for us to create and sell \n     innovative new products and services by removing regulatory \n     constraints.\n       5. For small businesses in rural or high-cost areas, we \n     need legislation that maximizes universal opportunity by \n     insuring--through a fair system of cost sharing--that some \n     parts of our country do not become too costly in which to \n     operate, or technological backwaters.\n       We believe S. 652 achieves these objectives. Please support \n     S. 652.\n       The small businesses of our state thank you for your \n     consideration.\n\n  What this letter is saying and seems to represent, talking of small \nbusinessmen, the majority of small businessmen--and indeed I guess \nthere might be at some point some resolutions adopted over there. They \nmade it a point to get to the Senate today over 500 letters supporting \nthe Senate version of the Telecommunications Competition and \nDeregulation Act. They have also given the same letters to President \nClinton, urging him to support it. I hope he is listening closely to \nthe small businessmen in his White House conference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HENRY FOSTER DESERVES A VOTE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, perhaps I am interrupting the flow of \nthe telecommunications bill for just 1 or 2 minutes because I promised \nthat I would do so every day until we hear that there are plans to \nbring the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General to the \nSenate for a vote.\n  Senator Pat Murray from Washington and I brought this issue up \nyesterday. We noted very clearly that Dr. Foster was nominated by \nPresident Clinton in February. This country has no Surgeon General.\n  We still have an AIDS epidemic, Madam President. We have an epidemic \nof teen pregnancy. I know my friend who is sitting in the chair now \nstrongly supports efforts to reduce the rate of teen pregnancy and \nstrongly supports efforts to reduce the rate of AIDS.\n  We now have a tuberculosis epidemic that has reemerged, after we \nthought we had solved the problem. We have teens smoking in great \nnumbers.\n  This is the business of the Surgeon General, to look over the health \nissues. In the Senate we look over so many issues--telecommunications--\ncomplicated issues, difficult issues. They change every day. \nThe Surgeon General will look after the health of this country.\n  We know when we have healthy babies and they are immunized and there \nis prenatal care for women, and we know when there is less drug use and \nalcohol use in our Nation, we become a much more productive nation. \nCertainly, as we are going to look a the welfare reform bill, we know \none of the greatest causes of welfare is, simply put, that teens are \nhaving babies. This is a problem we must deal with.\n  Again, I call on the majority leader to please move forward this \nnomination. Dr. Foster showed he had the true grit to stand the \ncriticism. He emerged out of the committee with a bipartisan, favorable \nvote.\n  I look forward to debating this nomination on the floor. I certainly \nhope that because an individual is an ob/gyn, an obstetrician/\ngynecologist, and in that practice performed a small number of \nabortions and yet brought 10,000 babies into the world, it would not be \nused against that individual and that this will not become a pawn in \nthe Presidential nomination. It would be very sad. I think the American \npeople are very fair people. This man deserves a vote. This man \ndeserves a hearing.\n  I just really hope that the majority leader will come to the floor--\nperhaps today, tomorrow, this week--and tell Members when we can hope \nto have the Foster nomination brought before the full Senate.\n  I thank the Senate. I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft).

Mr. President, at this time I call up amendment No. \n1298.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1298.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . DETERMINATION OF REASONABLENESS OF CABLE RATES.\n\n       (a) Commission Consideration.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this Act or section 623(c), as amended by this \n     Act, for purposes of section 623(c), the Commission may only \n     consider a rate for cable programming services to be \n     unreasonable if it substantially exceeds the national average \n     rate for comparable programming services in cable systems \n     subject to effective competition.\n       (b) Rates of Small Cable Companies.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act or the amendments made by this Act, the regulations \n     prescribed under section 623(c) shall not apply to the rates \n     charged by small cable companies for the cable programming \n     services provided by such companies.\n       (2) Definition.--As used in this subsection, the term \n     `small cable company' means the following:\n       (A) A cable operator whose number of subscribers is less \n     than 35,000.\n       (B) A cable operator that operates multiple cable systems, \n     but only if the total number of subscribers of such operator \n     is less than 400,000 and only with respect to each system of \n     the operator that has less than 35,000 subscribers.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to see occupying the \nchair at this time, the distinguished former attorney general of the \nState of Missouri, because my interest in this subject of the \nregulation of cable rates started in 1984 when I was the attorney \ngeneral of the State of Connecticut.\n  We had established a system similar in many ways, different in some \nways, to other States and municipalities around the country to deal \nwith the advent of this exciting new technology, cable television, in \nwhich our State--during the 1960's, originally, and the 1970's--had \ngiven out franchises for cable television in different areas of the \nState. These were monopolies. Because they were monopolies, which is to \nsay there was only one that any consumer had any access to in the State \nof Connecticut, they were subject to a kind of public utilities \nregulation, since there was no competition.\n  This went on until 1984 when the Congress in its wisdom, without the \nparticipation of the occupant of the chair or myself, at that time \npassed an act which prohibited the States from regulating the cost of \ncable. As I will document in a moment or two, there was a great outcry \nfrom many of us at the State level, first on the basis of federalism, \nthat we had been deprived of this opportunity to exercise our capacity \nand obligation to protect our consumers in the State of Connecticut or \nelsewhere as we saw fit, but also because the effect of the \ncongressional act of 1984 was to leave cable consumers facing \nmonopolies, only one cable provider, without the benefit of protection \nfrom consumer protection legislation, and without the benefit of \ncompetition.\n  What happened I will document in a moment or two, but it ultimately \nled to a very successful effort in 1992 to adopt a cable act which was \npassed with strong bipartisan majorities, and was vetoed by President \nBush. It turned out to be the only veto of the Bush years that was \noverridden by this Congress. The Cable Act of 1992 went into effect, \nwith positive effect, as I will describe in a moment. Then, suddenly as \npart of this major reform of telecommunications, there appears what \namounts to the evisceration of that cable consumer protection.\n  So just 3 years after passing that landmark legislation to bring \ncompetition to cable television and keep regulation until that \ncompetition came, just 3 years after the effort began once again to \nhold down cable rates for the millions of cable consumers around \nAmerica until competition emerges, we are now considering a bill that I \nam afraid will undo many of the consumer protection benefits of the \n1992 Cable Act.\n  The amendment that I have introduced this evening, No. 1298, will \nprevent the dismantling of the cable consumer protections of the 1992 \nact.\n  Mr. President, I assume we all agree--I certainly do--that \ncompetition is the best way to set prices. Markets can set prices much \nmore accurately and effectively than regulators can. Although consumers \ncannot really reap the benefits of competition, obviously, until there \nis effective competition in their local markets, the amendment that I \nam introducing, I think, will provide consumers with some of the \nadvantages of competition. Without competition, monopolies have the \nlicense to unreasonable rate increases. So we have a choice. When there \nis no competition, we can have regulation, or we can just simply say \nlet the monopolies go.\n  The cable rate regulation included in the current underlying bill \nbefore us, in my opinion, does not prevent monopoly abuses, and \nvirtually deregulates cable, which means that \nwithout this amendment we are inviting the majority of cable companies \nto raise their rates. And, unfortunately, we are guaranteeing that the \nmajority of our constituents, many of whom may be watching tonight, are \ngoing to see increases in the cost of cable television every month, \nunless we act to amend this bill. And I believe the amendment I am \noffering is a good procompetitive way to do so, consistent with the \noverall procompetitive spirit of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, before my colleagues vote on this matter, I think it \nis imperative to review the current status of cable regulation and how \nit is working.\n  First of all, let us ask what has happened since we passed the Cable \nAct of 1992; and, second, what impact will this legislation before us \nhave? My concern again is that this legislation, if unamended, \nvirtually guarantees significant cable rate increases before \ncompetition comes to the cable market. And today, the FCC tells us that \nonly 50 of the more than 10,000 cable markets in America have effective \ncompetition. That means if we have constituents in the 9,950-plus other \nmarkets, and if this legislation goes forward as it is, they are \nprobably going to see a cable rate increase.\n  What I see happening here is the potential for this Congress to make \nthe same mistake that was made in 1984 when the cable industry was \nderegulated based on the promise or the hope that competition was right \naround the corner.\n  In 1984, it was the promise of competition from satellites to the \ntraditional cable. Now it is again and still the promise of satellite \ncompetition plus the promise of telephone company competition. After \nthe 1984 act passed the Congress, the fact is that the cost of cable \ntelevision skyrocketed. Today only one-half of 1 percent of cable \nconsumers receiving satellite service from DBS, direct broadcast \nsatellite, which is the new satellite competitor, and only experimental \nefforts exist today to transmit cable over telephone lines. It is only \nnatural to fear that cable rates will shoot up again under the current \nbill.\n  Let me just go back over that. The promise of satellite reception for \ncable consumers, television consumers, was ripe in the air in 1984 when \ncable was deregulated. Today, 11 years later, one-half of 1 percent of \nthe television consumers with multichannel service receive that service \nfrom the Direct Broadcast Satellite.\n  The last time Congress prematurely deregulated cable rates, the \nGeneral Accounting Office found that the price of basic cable service \nrose more than 40 percent in the first 3 years without regulation. And \n40 percent is three times the rate of inflation during that same period \nof time, 1986 to 1989, and four times the level of increases \nexperienced under regulation. [[Page S8365]] \n  Mr. President, the Commerce Committee received testimony from local \nofficials that demonstrated real price exorbitance. Mayor Sharpe James \nof Newark testified that rates increased by more than 130 percent from \n1986 to 1989 in his community. Mayor Eddy Patterson of Henderson, TN, \nnoted rates rose 40 percent in the same period in his area. Rates shot \nup as much as 99 percent in communities in Hawaii, according to Robert \nAlm from Hawaii's Department of Commerce. David Adkisson, Mayor of \nOwensboro, KY, testified that basic receipts rose 40 percent in just 1 \nyear. And I can report that rates in Connecticut jumped 52 percent in \nthose 3 years in the mid-1980's, led by one company which actually \nhiked its rates by an unbelievable 222 percent when there was no \nregulation and no competition, which effectively is what this bill will \nbring us back to.\n  Consumer groups testified to the Commerce Committee demonstrating \nthat in the few communities where there was competition, which is to \nsay two cable companies going head to head, rates were about 30 percent \nlower than in the monopoly markets.\n  So on the basis of that evidence this Congress moved in a bipartisan \nfashion in 1992 to pass the Cable Act. Let me now remind my colleagues \nbriefly what that law does. The Cable Act--that is the law in effect \ntoday, before this bill--allows Federal and local officials to limit \ncable rates to a reasonable level until there is effective competition \nto the cable monopoly. This is not permanent regulation. This is not \nthe heavy, immovable hand of Government. This says let us get \nregulation out of here as soon as there is competition. In other words, \nregulation sunsets, disappears. And the standard here is it disappears \nwhen half the residents of a community have more than one choice for \ncable service and 15 percent of them, only 15 percent of that \ncommunity, actually select the service from the cable competitor.\n  Let us talk about the results of the law. Mr. President, according to \nthe Consumer Price Index for cable service, rates are down about 11 \npercent from their trend line when cable was deregulated. I plotted \nhere on this chart the trend of cable rate increases before rate \nregulation extrapolated to the present. That is the blue line.\n  Also plotted are cable rates after rate regulation, and cable rates \nsubject to competition. So the red line is the difference here in rates \nafter the 1992 act went into effect, and this actually is a projection \nof what has happened in those 50 markets where there is competition, \nwhich is great for consumers.\n  Regulation is modestly controlling monopolies. That is what the red \nline tells us. But competition is the real solution. Competition works \nat keeping cable rates under control. Without competition, regulation \nis necessary to control those price increases. On a nationwide basis--\nthis is an interesting number--this translates into a consumer savings \nof $2.5 billion to $3 billion per year since the adoption of the Cable \nAct of 1992.\n  Furthermore, consumers were not hit by the two to three times \ninflation rate increases they used to face when cable was deregulated. \nSo not only did we not have the increases, we actually had $2.5 billion \nto $3 billion of consumer savings, and there is not much that we can \nlook at in the way of the cost of living in our society that went down \nduring this period of time.\n  While consumers have come out ahead, I want to point out that the \ncable industry has done well, contrary to its fears, under this new \nact. They have been busy developing new service and increasing revenue \nstreams, and as far as I am concerned that is great news. With pay \nchannels, increased advertising revenue and digital audio services, the \ncable industry has made up all of the money consumers saved from \nregulation. In addition, cable has had the money to prosper through \nexpansion. And you can see in this plot the increase in subscribers \nthat cable companies have had since the regulations imposed by the \nCable Act.\n  The impact of the Cable Consumer Act of 1992 saved consumers a \nsubstantial amount of money, $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year, and \nrates went down 11 percent. But the great news about it is that all \nthat happened and the cable companies still remained healthy.\n  In this chart, I am showing the increase in the number of subscribers \nthe cable companies have had since the regulations imposed in the cable \nact. This is 1990, a 4.4 percent increase; 1991; and then after the \nact, 1993-1994, you can see they go up 2.8 percent; and then in 1994, \nwhen the act really kicked in for the full year, a 5-percent increase \nin subscriber growth to cable, which shows that the business remained \nhealthy during that period of time.\n  Last year, cable systems expanded their infrastructure to reach 1 \nmillion additional homes, 1.4 additional households subscribed to basic \ncable service, and 1.1 million families purchased expanded cable \npackages.\n  Pay services were taken by an additional 2 million homes, and dozens \nof new programming channels were developed and offered to the public, \nall of that growth occurring during these 2 years in which regulation \nhas been in place.\n  Equally important, some would say most important, the cable industry \nhas been investing to compete with telephone companies in the \nmultimedia services. I know that one of the arguments that the cable \ncompany folks have made against this amendment and for deregulation now \nbefore there is any competition to them has been that they have to be \nable to raise money to compete, build an infrastructure with the \ntelephone companies when they get into the cable business.\n  But the fact is that the chart illustrates during this period in \nwhich regulation has existed again for a couple of years, the capital \nexpenditures of the cable industry have been very healthy. In fact, \nthey have dramatically increased in the years that regulation has been \non. We go from 1993, up to almost $3 billion; in 1994, up to almost $4 \nbillion, $3.7 billion.\n  Since last summer, 1994, major cable companies have raised and \ninvested over $15 billion in new competitive ventures. Most recently, a \nconsortium that includes TCI, Comcast and Cox, raised and spent more \nthan $2 billion to buy, if you will, the spectrum that was auctioned, a \nfigure higher than any other set of bidders paid in the spectrum \nauction.\n  Let us talk about the profit margin for the cable industry during \nthis period of time. For 1993, it was 20 percent, the highest profit \nmargin of any segment of the telecommunications industry, and this is \nafter regulation went into effect, because there was no competition. \nCable companies have been successful in acquiring and spending money, \nand that is the way it ought to be. I want them to grow and prosper.\n  Finally, here I have plotted the average value of cable stocks as \ncompared to the S 500. As you can see, regulation has not hurt the \nperformance of cable stocks. In blue, we have cable industry stocks \ncharted. The S 500 is in red. Here, again, you can see how healthy \nthe cable industry has been--and the stock market, after all, is a \nmeasurement of consumer confidence in the future of this industry. Here \nwe go, 1993 and 1994, during that period of time when regulation was \ninstituted because there was no competition, the cable industry stock \nindex performed significantly better than the Standard & Poor's 500.\n  Obviously, investors do not think regulation has been bad for the \ncable industry. Just about every day newspapers announce new examples \nof major cable advancement or system upgrades or system expansion. \nAgain, that is good news.\n  Finally, it is critical to understand that the cable act and the FCC \nregulations allow cable operators to respond to both the threat of \ncompetition or actual competition in the same manner that any \nreasonable business in an unregulated market would react to such \nthreats. In the face of competition, a cable operator may either \nimprove service--that is what competition is all about--without any \nregulatory filings, reduce prices for any tier of service--that is what \na normal business does when they have competition without any \nregulatory OK, they reduce their prices--they may offer new services at \nany price, all this without regulation. And, of course, under the act, \nall pay services--this is the 1992 act--all pay services and premium \nchannels are already unregulated.\n  Mr. President, there is only one thing the cable operator may not do \nunder the Cable Act of 1992 and that is to raise rates above a \nreasonable level. [[Page S8366]] Why would any cable operator who faced \nreal competition want to raise prices above a reasonable level? \nObviously, most sensible business people would not raise prices in the \nface of that competition. But does that not all change if there is no \ncompetition?\n  I am sorry to say that the committee bill with its repeal of these \ncable consumer protections that have worked for the consumer and the \nindustry will allow the industry to raise its rates again before \ncompetition ever arrives and literally takes us back to 1984.\n  Although proponents of this bill, S. 652, note that it does \nexplicitly deregulate all cable services immediately, the bill provides \ncable operators an opportunity to raise rates back to about the level \nthey would have been if we had not passed the Cable Act of 1992.\n  Let me briefly explain. In this bill, S. 652 before us now, the \nstandard for determining that a cable company is charging unreasonable \nrates for program services would be a comparison to the national \naverage of cable system rates as of June 1, 1995, a few weeks ago. A \ncable company would have to charge rates that are substantially above \nthe national average on June 1, 1995, before that company could be \nregulated.\n  And this deals with what we all consider to be cable. The bill, S. \n652, leaves basic services regulated. There are three tiers of cable: \nbasic, which is what you can get without cable over antenna, in most \ncases, the networks and maybe public television; the middle tier, what \nmost people think of as cable--CNN, ESPN, Nickelodeon, whatever; and \nthe third tier is channels unregulated.\n  Today, the basic tier and middle tier are regulated. Premium channels \nare not. Under this legislation, the basic tier remains regulated, the \nmiddle tier is unregulated, unless the rates are found to be \nsubstantially above the national average. The national average will be \nrecalculated every 2 years.\n  So, there again, we have an incentive for the industry to increase \nits prices. Ironically, it is as if instead of a reason to reduce \nprices or hold prices, we are giving in this legislation the industry \nan incentive to increase prices, because the standard will be changed \nevery 2 years. With almost 40 percent of the market dominated by two \ncable companies, the national average will be controlled by a small \nnumber of companies.\n  For example, an average package of cable programming around this \ncountry now costs about $15 or $20 a month. Every cable consumer whose \ncompany currently charges less than this average will have a green \nlight to increase their rates to $20 to $25 per month without being \nsubstantially above the national average, which is the standard in this \nlegislation.\n  In other words, consumers are likely to face at least a $5 a month \nrate increase for stations like ESPN, CNN, Discovery, Lifetime, USA \nand, in many cases, C-SPAN. Rate increases in this range would drive \ncable prices back up to the levels experienced from 1986 to 1992 when \nthere was no consumer protection.\n  What we are presenting here is an opportunity for the cable operators \nto go back to their old ways. What I am saying is you do not need to do \nthis to keep them healthy, as the numbers I have shown indicated. Even \nif the Congress completely deregulated cable again, it--well, basically \nthis amounts to complete deregulation.\n  In my amendment, No. 1298, the national average would be calculated \nnot by what exists on June 1, 1995, or on what exists 2 years from now \nafter raising the rates. It will be calculated by including markets \nthat currently have effective competition and those who become \ncompetitive over time, allowing the markets, not regulators to set \nprices.\n  That is the point of this amendment, and that is why I think this \namendment is so consistent with the overall thrust of this bill. It is \nprocompetitive. It says let the markets, not regulators, set reasonable \nprices. Small cable companies, because they have their own economic \npressures that control their rates, in my opinion, would be exempt from \nregulation under this amendment.\n  I want to emphasize that the negotiations that resulted in some \nchanges in the calculation of the national average, while moving in the \ndirection of putting some pressure on these monopolies and protecting \nconsumers, in my opinion, just do not go far enough. The national \naverage would be calculated using the rates from June 1 of this year. \nUsing a fixed date when regulation is in effect is supposed to result \nin a fair value for the national average for cable rates. But that \ndate, June 1, occurs after some significant deregulation for certain \ncable systems under the FCC procedure. Using that date will increase \nthe national average, therefore, leading to higher cable rates. The \nmethod of calculation spelled out in the bill, which is complicated, \nuses a per-channel approach, cost per channel. So let me give you an \nexample based on numbers from a compilation of cost per channel rates \nin an article that appeared in Consumers Research.\n  In 1990, monopoly cable systems were charging 50 percent more than \ncable companies in competitive markets on a cost per channel basis. \nUsing the complex calculation described in the current bill, as \nmodified by the managers amendment, there would be a significant \nincrease in the cost per channel over the rates charged in competitive \nmarkets.\n  So taking inflation into account, the average cost per channel would \nbe 20 percent higher in the current bill than by simply comparing rates \nto competitive markets, as occurs in my amendment.\n  So to summarize, the current bill defines a very complex method of \ncalculation dreamed up by regulators. Not only is the system illogical, \nit is also unfair. And though the system of calculation may be complex, \nthe result, in my opinion, will be plain and simple, and that is that \nthe consumer of cable services--the millions out there across America, \nwho depend on cable for their entertainment, for their information, in \nmany cases today, even for their shopping--are going to be the ones to \nlose their rates. Their rates will go up. My amendment uses markets to \nset prices, not arcane formulas devised by regulators.\n  In conclusion, I want to make sure we do not make the same mistake I \nbelieve Congress made in 1984 and that Congress recognized it made in \n1992. Consumers paid a hefty price for premature deregulation of cable \nover the last decade. I say ``premature'' because competition \neffectively exists in very few cable markets. I do not want to redo \nthat mistake.\n  This amendment will prevent excessive deregulation before there is \ncompetition, while maintaining the spirit of the underlying bill. I am \nin favor of competition. I hope it comes quickly. I hope there are more \nthan one-half of 1 percent who get a competitive cable service from the \ndirect broadcast satellites. I hope that the telephone companies move \nas rapidly as some suggest they will--though, I doubt it--into \nproviding multi-channel services and competition with existing cable \nsystems.\n  Let competition set rates and protect consumers, not regulators. That \nis what my amendment is all about.\n  I thank the Chair for the courtesy and the opportunity to address my \ncolleagues on behalf of this amendment.\n  I urge support for it, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Page 86, line 25, after ``basis'' insert a comma and \n     ``reflecting the actual cost of providing those services or \n     functions to another carrier,''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might state that it is not my present \nintention to call this up. We are working on this, and we may not call \nthis up. I just want to qualify it for the purposes of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be set \naside.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President,\n   the amendment Senator Stevens and I are introducing provides an \nessential mechanism for achieving a central goal of this bill--to open \nthe local exchange to competition for the first time. Today's highly \ncompetitive long distance market has its roots in a 1976 order by the \nFederal Communications Commission that ushered in the unrestricted \nresale of AT's telecommunications services by its competitors. The \nFCC order allowed competitors to purchase AT's excess long distance \ncapacity in bulk, at non-discriminatory and often deeply discounted \nrates, and then resell those services to their own customers at \ncompetitive retail rates. Three companies--Sprint, MCI, and LDDS--\nexploited this resale capability to grow and eventually build their own \nstate-of-the-art national networks. Those networks now allow \nnationwide, long distance competition with AT What's more, excess \ncapacity in the three new national networks has given birth to an \nentire industry of more than 500 resellers around the country. The \nbenefits of this new competition among carriers and resellers have been \nenormous--rapid technological innovations, greater consumer choice, and \nlower consumer prices.\n\n  If our Nation's experience with competitive long distance service is \nany model--and I am convinced it is our best model--resale will be the \nessential first step in developing competitive local exchange markets. \nGiven the enormous cost of building sophisticated communications \nnetworks throughout the country, local exchange competition will never \nhave a chance to develop if competitors have to start by building \nnetworks that are comparable to the vast and well-established Bell \nnetworks. For this reason, affordable resale opportunities are the key \nto stimulating local competition. But these resale opportunities must \nbe based on economically reasonable prices that reflect the actual cost \nof providing those services and functions to another carrier and not \nmonopoly mark-up prices. The amendment we are offering today will \nensure that resale opportunities in the local exchange will in fact \nstimulate the development local competition.\n  Make no mistake--we want to be sure that the Bell companies are \ncompensated for the actual cost of providing these facilities, \nservices, and functions to competing carriers. We are not asking them \nto subsidize their competitors. But neither should these competitors be \nasked to subsidize the Bell companies. Therefore, resale prices must \nreflect the very substantial savings that will be realized by the Bell \ncompanies by selling their facilities on a wholesale, rather than a \nresale, basis. As a wholesaler, a Bell company is relieved of the \nobligation to provide a wide variety of services to the retail \ncustomer, such as billing and maintenance, that add to the cost of \nservice. Similarly, the costs associated with marketing, advertising, \nand collecting on receivables are eliminated when the Bell company acts \nas a wholesaler. By ensuring that these cost-savings are accurately \nreflected in the resale prices charged to competing local carriers, we \ncan guarantee a viable resale industry that will serve as an early \nstimulus for local competition.\n  The amendment also leaves undisturbed pricing structuring that \nbenefit residential consumers of local exchange service. As the Bell \ncompanies have told us, to keep residential prices affordable, they \nsometimes sell these services below their actual costs and recover the \nshortfall, where it occurs, by pricing other services above their \ncosts, thereby indirectly subsidizing their residential retail rates. \nThe amendment we offer today will not affect those subsidies, which \nwill be counted towards the recovery of costs in setting resale prices.\n  We believe the amendment properly balances the interests here in \npermitting the Bell companies to recover their costs and indeed to make \na reasonable profit while assuring that a viable resale business can \njump-start local competition. We simply cannot expect competitors to \nbuild out their own networks before they can provide full, unrestricted \ncompetition to current local exchange service providers. Nor can we \nexpect them to enter the market if the wholesale rates offer them no \nmargins for profit, such as in the Rochester experiment. The creation \nof full-scale, vigorous competition in the market for local exchange \nservices is critical if our Nation's telecommunications industry is to \nprovide a wide array of the best technology at low costs to consumers. \nResale is a proven policy for achieving that competition. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this point, all the amendments offered have \nbeen set aside.\n\n\n                    Amendments Nos. 1301, 1302, 1304\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is it in order to call up my three \namendments, 1301, 1302 and 1304?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield myself 5 minutes on the amendments, and I will \nmake a simple statement on each one.\n  Amendment No. 1301 is a technical clarification of the definition of \nLATA--Local Access and Transport Area--in the bill. This amendment \nclarifies that a Bell company cellular operation will continue to have \nthe same size LATA as they do today.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 1302 is a technical clarification of the \ninterconnection requirements of section 251, to ensure that the \ncommercial mobile service portion of a local exchange carrier's network \nis not subject to the requirements of section 251, unless that carrier \nhas market power in the provision of commercial mobile services.\n  Mr. President, amendment No. 1304 is a technical amendment to my \nearlier amendment on spectrum auctions that the Senate adopted this \npast week. The amendment deletes the requirement that the Secretary of \nCommerce submit a timetable for the reallocation of the 225 to 400 \nmegahertz band of spectrum.\n  I have had several discussions on this matter with the Department of \nDefense and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency. \nBoth have recommended that this frequency continue to be reserved for \nmilitary and public safety uses.\n  I might point out that my amendment did not mandate the transfer of \n[[Page S8370]] that spectrum. It merely made the spectrum subject to \nthe requirement that the Secretary provide a schedule for transfer. The \nSecretary could have indicated no intent to transfer. But since there \nwas a problem, I am going to ask the adoption of this amendment.\n  I am informed that amendment No. 1304 has no budgetary impact on the \nstatement I have previously made to the Senate concerning the estimate \nof revenues pursuant to the CBO estimate process for my spectrum \nauction amendment that was adopted last week.\n  If there are any questions from any Member about these three \ntechnical amendments, I would be pleased to respond at this time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The amendments have been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the statement of the \nSenator from South Carolina that these three amendments are cleared on \nhis side. I ask my friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, if \nhe is prepared to similarly support these amendments?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes, we are prepared to do that. We thank the Senator \nfor taking care of them in such a good manner.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Who controls the other time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I propose that, if we can, we adopt the amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be \nconsidered, en bloc, and adopted, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto, en bloc.\n  So the amendments (Nos. 1301, 1302, and 1304) were agreed to, en \nbloc.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1300, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I send a modification to amendment No. 1300 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1300), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 36, between lines 23 and 24, insert the following \n     new subsection and renumber the remaining subsections \n     accordingly:\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the existing system of universal service has evolved \n     since 1930 through an ongoing dialogue between industry, \n     various Federal-State Joint Boards, the Commission, and the \n     courts;\n       (2) this system has been predicated on rates established by \n     the Commission and the States that require implicit cost \n     shifting by monopoly providers of telephone exchange service \n     through both local rates and access charges to interexchange \n     carriers;\n       (3) the advent of competition for the provision of \n     telephone exchange service has led to industry requests that \n     the existing system be modified to make support for universal \n     service explicit and to require that all telecommunications \n     carriers participate in the modified system on a \n     competitively neutral basis; and\n       (4) modification of the existing system is necessary to \n     promote competition in the provision of telecommunications \n     services and to allow competition and new technologies to \n     reduce the need for universal service support mechanisms.\n       On page 38, beginning on line 15, strike all through page \n     43, line 2, and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 253.

Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, what we \nare trying to do is see that amendment in the second degree. We do not \nhave that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1280\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow turn to the consideration of amendment 1280, that it be considered \nas read, adopted and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nall without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the amendment (No. 1280) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1300\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I renew my request that amendment 1300 be \namended by the second-degree amendment that is at the desk.\n  What the second-degree amendment does is delete a provision that I \nadded in the modification to clarify a concern that I thought had been \nexpressed by the House. It was in order, and I ask to delete that one \nsentence in accordance with that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment modifies the universal \nservice provisions of the bill to address concerns that were raised by \nthe House Ways and Means Committee.\n  As we know, bills that concern the raising of revenues must originate \nin the House. We did not intend to raise revenues, and this bill does \nnot do so, either before or after this amendment.\n  The amendment has been cleared by both sides of the Senate, and the \nsecond-degree amendment has now made this amendment consistent with the \nposition, as we understand it, that has been brought by the House \nMembers who raised concerns about the original language in the bill \nconcerning universal service.\n  As amended, these universal service provisions more clearly address \nthe goal of the bill, which is to target universal service support \nwhere it is needed.\n  I will submit a statement later tomorrow, discussing in detail the \nHouse concerns. Again, I want to state we are doing our best to meet \nthe concerns that have been expressed by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  There is no intention here to make this bill a revenue-raising \nmeasure, and it is not one. It merely intends to modify the existing \nuniversal service concept in telecommunications. As I pointed out \nbefore, the CBO has informed Members that the universal service concept \nin this bill will cost less than the current system. Therefore, it is \nnot a revenue-raising measure.\n  I do ask now that this amendment 1300 be adopted. I hope that my two \nfriends, the managers of the bill, will agree with me that the \namendment--which, incidentally, I assume will be printed in the Record \nbefore my remarks. Is that the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I point out to the Senate that the amendment makes \nspecific findings of the Congress with regard to the universal service \nsystem that exists and has been developed through an ongoing dialog \nbetween industry, the various Federal-State joint boards, the FCC, and \nthe courts.\n  It is an ongoing system that has been predicated on rights \nestablished by the dialog. I believe that the findings we have now put \nin the bill clarify our intent with regard to the concept of continuing \nuniversal service through the use of essential telecommunications \ncarriers.\n  It is a modification of the existing concept, as I said, and it will \nsave money for the system. I believe it will provide universal service \nin the future that will meet the expanding needs of the country, \nparticularly the rural areas.\n  Are my friends ready to accept the amendment numbered 1300, may I \ninquire of the distinguished Senator from South Carolina?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, No. 1300 has been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I make a similar inquiry of the Senator from South \nDakota? Is that amendment acceptable to the chairman of the committee?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. That amendment is acceptable to the ranking member and \nI. I commend the Senator from Alaska for his efforts.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1300), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank both the chairman and ranking member.\n  I am pleased to see we were able to work this out. I hope it is \nworked out now between the Senate and the House, \n[[Page S8372]] particularly with regard to concerns raised by the House \nWays and Means Committee members.\n  Mr. BURNS. While the Senator from Alaska is on the floor, I want to \nexpress my appreciation for his work on this, as a supporter of \nuniversal service, which is the core of our telecommunications \nindustry, and he has worked this out to the good, I think, of the \nindustry. He has been a tireless worker in this. I appreciate his \nefforts, along with many who serve with him on the committee. We \nappreciate that very much.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think due \ncredit has to be given to the staff of the committee on both sides, of \nthe majority and minority, and my able assistant, Earl Comstock, who \nhas worked extensively and tirelessly on the subject. To us in rural \nAmerica this is the core of this bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would just want to make a few remarks \nwith regard to the Lieberman amendment which the Senator spoke on just \na little while ago.\n  I want to set the record straight, because with this amendment we are \ngoing down the old road of reregulation. In fact, more regulation than \nwas placed on the cable industry a couple of years ago.\n  We saw the figures of the stock and the worth of these companies, and \neven though I want to pass along these figures, make no mistake, \nregulation is not too much of a friend to those entrepreneurial people \nwho have built probably one of the greatest cable systems in the world.\n  What we have done is regulated an industry, basically, that is not a \nnecessity in the home. In other words, the homeowner, or whomever, has \nthe freedom of not taking the service. There is still over-the-air free \nbroadcast television that can be received almost everywhere in the \nUnited States. There may be some specific spots that do not receive \nfree over-the-air television.\n  Also, in my State, looking at the rates where I can remember when we \nonly got the two local stations, and I think three stations from Salt \nLake City, and maybe a public television station when cable first came \nto Billings, MT.\n That service cost about $5.50, I think, to $6, something like that. \nToday we receive between 40 or 45 channels for $21. When you figure the \ncost per channel, cable rates have not gone up any.\n\n  And that was done at a time when there was no regulation in the cable \nindustry. The explanation for the explosion in the jobs that were \nprovided, the opportunity in programming, new ideas, new channels, \nexciting Discovery--all of those channels came to be under an era when \nthere was no regulation.\n  Since we passed the 1994 reregulation of cable, cable revenues have \nremained flat. In other words, around $23 billion in 1993; $23 billion \nin 1994.\n  If you look at the cash flows on the reports of the major companies, \ncompanies like TCI--their cash flow, $60 billion; Time Warner Cable, \n$46 billion; Comcast, $30 billion; and Cox at $27.2 billion--those are \nflat from 1993 to 1994 and 1995.\n  Stock values have dropped about 10.1 percent between September 1993 \nand April 1995, while the S and NASDAQ indexes have risen 12.2 \npercent and 14 percent respectively.\n  According to A.C. Nielsen, subscriber growth rates have declined from \n3.14 percent in 1993 to 2.85 percent in 1994.\n  It is very dangerous, when we start down this road of reregulating. \nRight now competition in the entertainment business and in the \ntelevision business has never been better. And I ask my friend from \nConnecticut, why would anybody, even a telco, want to go into the cable \nbusiness with a regulated environment where they could not recover \ntheir costs of investment? This is anticompetitive legislation, if I \nhave ever seen it. In other words, it is, I would imagine, to those who \nare regulated, those who are already in the business--they would stay \nthere. They are warm and comfortable in that cocoon. But whoever wants \nto go into the business--the investment and ability to recover under a \nregulatory environment is very, very difficult.\n  So, if we want to promote competition, and that is the very heart and \nsoul of this legislation, you create competition, you also create new \ntechnologies and new tools and force those technologies into the areas \nthat need them so; and that technology gives them the tools for \ndistance learning, telemedicine, and a host of services that we just \nwould not see in States as remote as my home State of Montana.\n  So, the argument just does not hold water. Additional regulation or \nadditional rules in order to lift regulatory control is \ncounterproductive, and that is what this amendment would be.\n  I am sure we will have a lot of time tomorrow to make our statements \non this. It all depends on what the agreement is. But this is a \ndamaging amendment. It slows the growth in one of the most dynamic \nindustries, the industry that has the potential for the most growth and \nthe potential to really push new services out into America. Do you know \nwhat? They always talk about the glass highway, the information \nhighway. If one wants to think a little bit, maybe the information \nhighway is already there and it could have been built in an era where \nthere was no regulation and it could be called cable.\n  Think about that. Whenever we provide a competitive environment for \nboth the telcos and personal communications, and also in \ntelecommunications, and then in cable communications, we set the \nenvironment for a lot of competition, I imagine the big winner will be \nthe consumers of this country and the services they receive and the \nprice those services will be.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to identify myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Montana. I think Senator Burns is very \naccurate on this cable thing.\n  As reported by the Commerce Committee on March 30, this bill would \nmaintain regulation of basic cable rates until there is effective \ncompetition; deregulate upper tiers of cable programming services only \nif they do not ``substantially exceed'' the ``national average'' for \ncomparable programming service and redefine the effective competition \nstandard to include a telephone company offering video services.\n  On June 9, the Senate adopted, 77 to 8, a Dole-Daschle leadership \namendment, of which I was also a cosponsor, which met the concerns of \nthose who believe that, despite the safeguards already contained in S. \n652, it might lead to unreasonable rate increases by large cable \noperators. The Dole-Daschle amendment also deregulated small operators, \na feature of the pending Lieberman amendment, which proposes to narrow \nthe definition of effective competition and tie ``national average'' to \nsystems that already face effective competition. As such, the Lieberman \namendment is excessive and unwarranted.\n  As modified by our amendment, S. 652 will now, first, establish a \nfixed date, June 1, 1995, for measuring the ``national average'' price \nfor cable services and only allow adjustments every 2 years. This \nprovision eliminates the possibility that large cable operators could \ncollude to artificially inflate rates immediately following enactment \nof S. 652. The bill as amended, establishes a ``national average'' \nbased on cable rates in effect prior to passage of S. 652, when rate \nregulation was in full force, and excludes rates charged by small cable \noperators in determining the ``national average'' rate for cable \nservices.\n  This provision addresses the concerns that deregulation of small \nsystem rates, which was included as part of the Dole-Daschle amendment \nto S. 652, would inflate the ``national average'' against which the \nrates of large cable companies would be measured. It specifies that \n``national average'' rates are to be calculated on a per-channel basis.\n  This provision ensures that ``national average'' is standardized, and \ntakes into account variations in the number of channels offered by \ndifferent companies as part of their expanded program packages. It \nspecifies that a market is effectively competitive only when an \nalternative multichannel video provider offers services ``comparable'' \nto cable television service.\n   [[Page S8373]] This provision enables cable operators not to be \nprematurely deregulated under the effective competition provision if, \nfor example, only a single channel of video programming is being \ndelivered by telco, video, and dial tone providers in an operator's \nmarket.\n  What the bill does: The basic tier, broadcast and PEG, remains \nregulated until, one, telco offers video programming, or, two, direct \nbroadcast satellite, or any other competitor reaches 15 percent of the \nmarket penetration.\n  I think that is very important because the basic tier remains \nregulated until the telco in the area has competition or until there is \nat least 15 percent of a direct broadcast satellite.\n  The upper tiers of cable rates are subject to bad actor review when \nthe price of program packages significantly exceeds the national \naverage. I have been in some parts of the country where you see a cable \nrate that is much higher, sort out of the blue, and I think that under \nthis legislation that could fall under the so-called bad actor \nprovision of the legislation.\n  The point we are making is that, as we move toward deregulation of \nthese cable rates, there are safeguards built into this bill.\n  I am very concerned that the Lieberman amendment would undo the \ncarefully crafted compromise on cable deregulation that has been agreed \nto by Democrats and Republicans, and we have had several votes in \ncommittee and on the floor already. We have the leadership packet. This \nwould tend to unravel all of that at this late moment.\n  The fact of the matter is that rates continue to rise with \nregulation. Cable rates will continue to increase with regulations. \nIndeed, they have been increasing with regulations. The FCC rules allow \nrates to increase for inflation, added program costs, new equipment \ncharges, and other factors.\n  Actual and potential competition spurred by our bill will result in \nlower cable rates.\n  I have said that, if we can pass this bill, we will have much lower \ncable rates than we would under a regulated system because we will have \nmore providers, we will have direct broadcast satellite, we will have \nthe video dial, and we will have the opportunity for utilities to come \ninto the television market.\n  We are really talking about, with this type of regulation, the 1950's \nand 1960's and 1970's when maybe you could conceivably say some of this \nwas necessary when you just had one or two providers. But in the 1990's \nand on into the year 2000, we will have a broad range of competition. I \nhope that we can take advantage of that. It will result in lower cable \nrates.\n  Regulation harms the cable industry. In 1994, for the first time \never, cable revenues remained flat--$23.021 billion in 1993, and $23 \nbillion again in 1994. Cash flows for major companies declined. TCI, \n$60 billion; Time Warner Cable, $46 billion; Comcast, $30.1 billion; \nCox, $27.2 billion.\n  Cable stock values dropped 10.1 percent between December 1993 and \nApril 1995 while the S and NASDAQ indexes rose by 12.2 percent and 14 \npercent, respectively. That is about a 20-percent spread.\n  During the last year 16 major cable companies, representing 20 \npercent of the industry, serving 12 million subscribers have sold or \nannounced their intentions to exit the industry.\n  Capital raised for public debt and equity offerings declined 81 \npercent in 1994, $8.6 billion in 1993 to $1.6 billion in 1994.\n  According to A.C. Nielsen, subscriber growth rates declined from 3.14 \npercent in 1993 to 2.85 percent in 1994.\n  Existing and potential competition: Direct broadcast satellite is the \nfastest growing consumer electronics product in history with 2,000 new \nsubscribers a day projected to grow to 2.2 million subscribers by \nyear's end and over 5 million by 2000.\n  Due to program access, direct broadcast satellite offers every \nprogram service available on cable plus exclusive direct broadcast \nsatellite programming, such as movies and sports; for example, 400 NBA \ngames this season and 700 games next season.\n  Cable also faces competition from 4 million C-band dishes.\n  Wireless cable has 600,000 subscribers, expected to grow 158 percent \nin 2 years to 1.5 million and to 3.4 million by 2000. Bell Atlantic, \nNYNEX, and PacTel have recently invested in wireless cable.\n  So the point is there are new services being offered. There is new \ncompetition coming forward.\n  Telcos have numerous video programming trials all over the United \nStates. Meanwhile the Clinton/Gore administration continues to fight in \ncourt to keep the cable-telco ban firmly in place.\n  Cable deregulation is a prerequisite for competition in \ntelecommunications.\n  A central goal of this bill is to create a competitive market for \ntelecommunications services.\n  Cable television companies are the most likely competitors to local \nphone monopolies, but in order to develop advanced, competitive \ntelecommunications infrastructures, cable companies must invest \nbillions in new technologies.\n  Federal regulation of television has restricted the cable industry's \naccess to capital, has made investors concerned about future \ninvestments in the capable industry, and reduced the ability of cable \ncompanies to invest in technology and programming.\n  Concerns about cable rate increases should be mitigated by cable's \nnew competitive pressures from direct broadcast satellite services and \nfrom telco-delivered video programming.\n  Deregulation of cable television services is a prerequisite to \nbringing competition to telecommunications and is essential to making \nthe competitive model embodied in S. 652 viable.\n  Cable systems pass over 96 percent of Americans homes with coaxial \ncables that carry up to 900 times as much information as the local \nphone company's twisted pair.\n  Cable companies are leaders in the use of fiber optics and digital \ncompression technology.\n  Cable's high-capacity systems will ultimately provide virtually every \ntype of communication service conceivable and allow consumers to choose \nbetween competing providers of advanced voice, video, and data \nservices.\n  Mr. President, I feel very strongly that we have reached a proper \nbalance regarding cable in this bill, and to adopt the Lieberman \namendment would undo that package that has been worked out.\n  I also feel very strongly that the American public will benefit from \nwhat we are doing here. I mentioned earlier that I have received 500 \nletters from the small business people at the White House Conference on \nSmall Business who want to pass the Senate-passed bill and also urge \nPresident Clinton to endorse the Senate-passed bill.\n  I think that we all want that procompetitive deregulatory \nenvironment. Everybody says that. But many of the folks out there are \narguing to preserve regulation. I frequently see large companies using \nGovernment regulation to block out competition.\n  I look upon this telecommunications area as a group of people in a \nroom with a huge buffet of food stacked on the table. But they are all \nworried that somebody else is going to get an extra carrot. I think we \nare going to find there is plenty for all, and the consumers will \nbenefit with lower telephone prices, lower cable prices, more services, \nmore services for senior citizens, more services for farmers, and our \nsmall cities will be able to flourish.\n  And it is my strongest feeling that we should continue, as we have \ndone all day, to defeat these amendments tomorrow. We had a very good \nday today and yesterday in terms of holding this committee bill \ntogether.\n  I see one of my colleagues is in the Chamber and wishes to speak. I \nam glad to have any speakers. We are trying to move forward. I thank \nyou very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this debate on S. 652 has clearly \ndemonstrated the potential of emerging telecommunications technologies. \nIt is truly exciting to contemplate what this legislation could mean \nfor American society.\n  A particularly intriguing new development in the telecommunications \nfield is the creation of personal communications service [PCS]. These \ndevices will revolutionize the way Americans talk, work, and play.\n  While this new technology opens new vistas for personal \ncommunications services, its emergence also highlights the potential \ndownside of entering untested areas. Specifically, concerns \n[[Page S8374]] have been raised about the potential side-effects of \nsome new PCS technology on other devices such as hearing aids.\n  Recently, the Government completed an auction that netted $7 billion \nfor the right to provide advanced digital portable telephone service. \nIt is my understanding that some of the companies that obtained these \nPCS licenses have considered utilizing a technology known as GSM--\nglobal system for mobile communications. I am informed that people who \nwear hearing aids cannot operate GSM PCS devices, and some even report \nphysical discomfort and pain if they are near other people using GSM \ntechnology.\n  It should not be our intent to cause problems for the hearing \nimpaired in promoting the personal communications services market. It \nis my view that the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] should \ncarefully consider the impact new technologies have on existing ones, \nespecially as they relate to public safety and potential signal \ninterference problems. An FFC review is in keeping with the intent of \nS. 652, which includes criteria for accessibility and usability by \npeople with disabilities for all providers and manufacturers of \ntelecommunications services and equipment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be glad to yield to the honorable ranking member \nof the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator for yielding and support his \nsuggestion that the FCC investigate technologies that may cause \nproblems for significant segments of our population before they are \nintroduced into the U.S. market. Such review is prudent for consumers, \nand it will help all companies by answering questions of safety \ninterference before money is spent deploying this technology here in \nthe United States.\n  Four million Americans wear hearing aids, and the Senator from South \nDakota has raised an important issue. GSM has been introduced in other \ncountries, and problems have been reported. It is reasonable that these \nproblems be investigated before the growth of this technology \neffectively shuts out a large sector of our population.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator for his remarks, and would also like \nto commend his role in bringing telecommunications reform to the floor. \nHis leadership and patience throughout this 3-year exercise that has \nspanned two Congresses is well known and widely appreciated.\n  Mr. President, the public record indicates that if companies are \nallowed to introduce GSM in its presemt form, serious consequences \ncould face individuals wearing hearing aids. I would urge the FCC to \ninvestigate the safety, interference and economic issues raised by this \ntechnology. I also would urge the appropriate congressional committees \nto consider scheduling hearings on this issue.\n                      amendments no. 1256 and 1257\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would direct a question to my colleague with regard \nto the Stevens amendment on expanded auction authority for the FCC, as \namended by the Pressler amendment. These amendments will auction \nspectrum currently assigned to broadcast auxiliary licensees, and were \nadopted by voice vote Wednesday evening. This bill now conforms with \nthe Budget Act. Specifically, I do not believe that it is the intention \nof the sponsors to impede the ability of local broadcasters to continue \nto deliver on-the-spot news and information.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. Several concerns have been raised about \nauction of certain spectrum which we intend to address as this bill \nproceeds to conference with its companion bill in the House. In \naddition, some of these same concerns will be considered within the \nbudget reconciliation bills later this summer. Therefore, we will \ncontinue to review these provisions to determine whether the newly-\nassigned spectrum will adequately satisfy the needs of electronic news \ngathering, what, if any, interference problems will arise, and how the \ncosts of such transfers should be borne.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleague for his comments.\n\n\n                        monopoly telephone rates\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Kerrey's \nmonopoly telephone rates amendment. This amendment offers critical \nprotection for ratepayers from potential multibillion rate increases \nfor telecommunications services during the transition to effective \nlocal competition.\n  In mandating price flexibility and prohibiting rate-of-return \nregulation, section 301 of the bill also prohibits State and Federal \nregulators from considering earnings when determining whether prices \nfor noncompetitive services are just, reasonable, and affordable. While \nthe Federal Communications Commission [FCC] and many State commissions \nhave instituted various price flexibility plans, most of those plans \ninvolve some consideration of earning. If regulators are prohibited \nfrom considering the earnings factor when determining the \nappropriateness of prices for noncompetitive services, the captive \nratepayers of these services will be subject to unwarranted rate \nincreases.\n  Mr. President, this amendment does not change the bill's prohibition \non rate-of-return regulation. The amendment would simply allow State \nand Federal commissions to consider earnings when authorizing the \nprices of those noncompetitive services. In this way, the amendment \nprovides a safeguard against excess rate impacts in the future.\n  Mr. President, the monopoly telephone rates amendment recognizes that \nit is appropriate and in the consumers' interest for State regulators \nto continue to have a roll in determining the price of noncompetitive \nservices in their States, and in having the discretion to consider the \nearnings of the local telephone company. Approximately 75 cents of \nevery dollar consumers spend on their overall telephone bills is for \ncalls made within their State. The goal of local telephone competition \nadvanced in this legislation will not be achieved overnight. In the \ninterim, State regulators should have the authority to consider a \ncompany's earnings before setting the price level of noncompetitive \nservices. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this amendment.\n          preemption of state-ordered intralata dialing parity\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the \namendment filed yesterday by the Senator from Vermont [Senator Leahy], \namendment number 1289, I want to discuss the important issue of \nintraLATA dialing parity.\n  Mr. President, Senator Leahy's amendment was very simple. It would \nhave merely clarified the rights of the States to implement pro-\ncompetitive measures for telecommunications markets within their State \nborders, a role which we have always provided to our States. As is \noften the case in other policy areas, many States, including Wisconsin, \nare ahead of the Federal Government in deregulating telecommunications \nmarkets. In the case of my State, efforts to begin deregulation of \ntelecommunications markets have been on-going for many years, \nculminating in a major telecommunications bill passed by Wisconsin's \nState legislature last year and signed by our Governor.\n  Unfortunately, while S. 652 has the laudable goal of increasing \ncompetition in all telecommunications markets, without the changes that \nthe Senator from Vermont and I are promoting, it would actually cripple \nexisting State efforts to enhance competition in markets within their \nown borders. The legislation would prevent States from ordering \nintraLATA dialing parity in local telecommunications markets until the \nincumbent regional bell operating company is allowed access to long \ndistance markets.\n  IntraLATA dialing parity is complicated phraseology for a very simple \nconcept. Currently, for any long distance calls that consumers make \nwithin their own LATA or local access and transport area--also known as \nshort-haul long distance--are by default handled by the local toll \nprovider. In order to use an alternative long distance company to make \na short-haul long distance call, a consumer would have to dial a long \nstring of numbers to access that service, in addition to the telephone \nnumber they must dial. For most consumers, that is a inconvenience they \nsimply will not tolerate and [[Page S8375]] provides an advantage to \nthe incumbent toll provider in providing short-haul long distance.\n  Dialing Parity already exists in interstate long distance markets, \nwhich is why any person can place a long distance call simply by \ndialing 1 plus the area code and phone number. The call is \nautomatically routed through the long distance carrier the consumer has \npreselected. This convenience simply does not exist for consumers \nmaking short-haul long distance calls within their own LATA.\n  Wisconsin's Public Service Commission has gone through a lengthy \nmulti-year process examining the technical feasibility and cost of \nrequiring dialing parity for short-haul long distance, determining \nwhether competition would be enhanced by this type of dialing parity \nand whether the public interest would be served by dialing parity for \nshort-haul toll calls.\n  Their findings indicated that not only was intraLATA dialing parity \ntechnically feasible, it was also in the public interest. The \nCommission stated:\n\n       IntraLATA 1+dialing parity will benefit customers and the \n     State; will encourage the development of new products and \n     services at reduced prices; and will result in local company \n     provision of service more efficiently as the market becomes \n     more competitive.\n\n  In 1994, State legislation directed our Wisconsin Public Service \nCommission to develop rules for 1+dialing parity for intraLATA markets. \nThe Commission has not approached this in a haphazard manner, Mr. \nPresident. In fact the Commission has established procedures whereby a \nprovider can request dialing parity and a company asked to provide that \nservice to request a temporary suspension from honoring the request. \nThis provides our PSC with the opportunity to review each request on a \ncase by case basis if necessary. Our State legislature and our Governor \nendorsed this process in the Telecommunications Deregulation Act passed \nand signed into law last summer.\n  That legislation went far beyond the issue of dialing parity but also \nallowed the toll providers to use price cap regulation instead of rate \nof return regulation. The bill also stripped certain providers of their \nmonopoly status to allow for greater competition in service areas to \nwhich they were not previously allowed access. This legislation was \nmiles ahead of Federal legislation, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the point of this lengthy description of Wisconsin's \nderegulatory process is to emphasize that the States are well qualified \nand experienced in deregulating telecommunications markets and are \ndoing so in a well-reasoned and orderly fashion.\n  Senator Leahy's amendment would have simply allowed States to \ncontinue on their path to deregulation and increased competition in \ntelecommunications markets unhampered by the Federal Government. The \namendment would have allowed the 10 States that have already ordered \nintraLATA dialing parity and the 13 States that are currently \nconsidering that option, to continue their efforts without being \nderailed by this bill.\n  Those States may, in some instances, determine that competition will, \nin fact, not be enhanced by providing intraLATA dialing parity in \ncertain markets if the incumbent toll provider is not allowed to enter \nlong distance markets. In other cases, however, a State's Public \nService Commission's deliberative process may indicate that, in other \nmarkets, dialing parity should be provided regardless of whether the \nincumbent toll provider has access to long distance service. The State \nhas the expertise to examine the different competitive circumstances \nfor individual markets and they should be allowed to do so.\n  It is inappropriate for the Congress to attempt to preempt a State's \nability to make these types of decisions. Recently, 24 Attorneys \nGeneral, in a letter to Senators, stated their opposition to the \npreemption of State's ability to order intraLATA dialing parity. \nSigning that letter were State Attorneys General from Wisconsin, New \nMexico, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, \nIowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, \nNorth Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and West \nVirginia, among others. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nChairman of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, Cheryl Parrino, \nin support of this amendment and addressing the issue of Universal \nService be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See Exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The amendment which I have been working on with Senator \nLeahy would have simply made clear that the bill before us shall not \nprevent a State from taking pro-competitive steps by requiring \nintraLATA dialing parity within markets under their regulatory \njurisdiction.\n  Mr. President, however, it is my understanding that there are a \nnumber of objections to this amendment. In response to those \nobjections, the Senator from Vermont [Senator Leahy] and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana [Senator Breaux] have worked out a compromise which will \nallow the States that have already ordered intraLATA dialing parity, \nsuch as Wisconsin, as well as single LATA states to implement it \ndespite the overall preemption contained in this bill. However, the \ncompromise restricts companies seeking to offer competitive intraLATA \ntoll services from jointly marketing their intraLATA toll services with \ntheir long distance services for a period of up to 3 years. There may \nbe concerns with respect to this restriction that may need to be \naddressed before the legislation is enacted.\n  I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues, Senators Leahy and \nBreaux in reaching this agreement. I thank them for their efforts.\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                         Public Service Commission\n\n\n                                                 of Wisconsin,\n\n                                                    June 12, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I applaud your efforts to remove \n     preemptive language from the telecommunications bill pending \n     before the Senate. This letter is to express support for your \n     amendment that eliminates a preemption clause that prohibits \n     state actions that require intraLATA dialing parity. In \n     Wisconsin, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin has \n     ordered full intraLATA dialing parity (1 + presubscription), \n     and it is our belief that implementation of our orders on \n     that issue will enhance competition and serve the public \n     interest. It would be a disservice to the telecommunications \n     customers of Wisconsin if federal action negated our decision \n     on this issue.\n       Proponents of preemption have suggested that state actions \n     to order full dialing parity prior to federal court action \n     allowing the entry of the Regional Bell Operating Companies \n     (RBOCs) into the interLATA toll market would constitute a \n     threat to universal service. This argument is simply off \n     base.\n       States, particularly state regulatory commissions, are \n     inexorably attuned to the needs of the citizens of the states \n     and are very cognizant of the need to maintain universal \n     service. Any state commission considering an order for full \n     dialing parity will have every opportunity to consider the \n     costs of that decision and the related implications for \n     universal service. The orders of the Wisconsin Commission \n     that mandate intraLATA 1 + presubscription include a process \n     whereby individual local exchange companies may request \n     Commission waivers of the requirements for dialing parity \n     implementation. This Commission will certainly consider the \n     potential costs of dialing parity implementation and modify \n     our requirements when it is in the best interests of the \n     consumers. I am confident that other state commissions would \n     give this same consideration.\n       Further, in Wisconsin, legislation passed last summer \n     mandates a universal service program. This Commission will be \n     promulgating rules to assure service is available and \n     affordable to all parts of the state and to all segments of \n     the public. The safeguards available through that program \n     offer further support to actions by this Commission to move \n     forward with the introduction of competition and fair \n     competitive service standards at a pace that is reflective of \n     the specific needs of this state. Universal mandates or \n     activities are being addressed in numerous other states. \n     Those state plans should be allowed to move forward based on \n     the respective wisdom of the state legislatures or \n     commissions in those states. A blanket hold on all intraLATA \n     dialing parity by Congressional fiat gives no weight to the \n     evidence of competitive need and regulatory safeguards in any \n     individual state.\n       Another argument advanced by those who support preemption \n     is that full dialing parity may cause the loss of the \n     carrier-of-last-resort obligation by the incumbent local \n     exchange carrier. In recent hearings in Wisconsin on this \n     very subject, this argument was raised. It was met by a \n     commitment from other carriers to fill that carrier-of-last-\n     resort role if in fact the incumbent is no longer \n     [[Page S8376]] taking on that obligation. This argument about \n     the loss of universal service because of the carrier-of-last-\n     resort impacts is without merit.\n       Competition is coming to the telecommunications industry. \n     This bodes well for telecommunications customers. Federal \n     action to stunt competition in parts of the market, while \n     arguments are hashed out on the interLATA front, is a move in \n     the wrong direction. State commissions should decide on the \n     need for and pace of competition in the states. While there \n     are many advantages to establishing a national policy on \n     telecommunications, and many good points are spelled out in \n     the legislation, the preemption of the states on dialing \n     parity is not one of them.\n       Again, I commend your attempts to rectify this portion of \n     the pending telecommunications bill. Please contact me if you \n     have questions on my position on this matter.\n       This letter of support for your amendment is independent of \n     the merits of and schedule for interLATA relief for the \n     RBOCs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cheryl L. Parrino,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               State of Wisconsin,\n\n\n                                        Department of Justice,\n\n                                                     June 2, 1995.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: The undersigned state attorneys \n     general would like to address several telecommunications \n     deregulation bills that are now pending in Congress. One of \n     the objectives in any such legislation must be the promotion \n     that fosters competition while at the same time protecting \n     consumers from anticompetitive practices.\n       In our opinion, our citizens will be able to look forward \n     to an advanced, efficient, and innovative information network \n     only if such legislation incorporates basic antitrust \n     principles and recognizes the essential role of the states in \n     ensuring that citizens have universal and affordable access \n     to the telecommunications network. The antitrust laws ensure \n     competition and promote efficiency, innovation, low prices, \n     better management, and greater consumer choice. If \n     telecommunications reform legislation includes a strong \n     commitment to antitrust principles, then the legislation can \n     help preserve existing competition and prevent parties from \n     using market power to tilt the playing field to the detriment \n     of competition and consumers.\n       Each of the bills pending in Congress would lift the court-\n     ordered restrictions that are currently in place on the \n     Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs). After sufficient \n     competition exists in their local service areas, the bills \n     would allow RBOCs to enter the fields of long distance \n     services and equipment manufacturing. These provisions raise \n     a number of antitrust concerns. Therefore, telecommunications \n     deregulation legislation should include the following \n     features:\n       First, the United States Department of Justice should have \n     a meaningful role in determining, in advance, whether \n     competition at the local level is sufficient to allow an RBOC \n     to enter the long distance services and equipment \n     manufacturing markets for a particular region. The Department \n     of Justice has unmatched experience and expertise in \n     evaluating competition in the telecommunications field. Such \n     a role is vital regardless of whether Congress adopts a \n     ``competitive checklist'' or ``modified final judgment \n     safeguard'' approach to evaluating competition in local \n     markets. The Department of Justice will be less likely to \n     raise antitrust challenges if it participates in a case-by-\n     case analysis of the actual and potential state of \n     competition in each local market before RBOC entry into other \n     markets.\n       Second, legislation should continue to prohibit mergers of \n     cable and telephone companies in the same service area. Such \n     a prohibition is essential because local cable companies are \n     the likely competitors of telephone companies. Permitting \n     such mergers raises the possibility of a ``one-wire world,'' \n     with only successful antitrust litigation to prevent it. \n     Congress should narrowly draft any exceptions to this general \n     prohibition.\n       Third, Congress should not preempt the states from ordering \n     1+intraLATA dialing parity in appropriate cases, including \n     cases where the incumbent RBOC has yet to receive permission \n     to enter the interLATA long distance market. With a mere flip \n     of a switch, the RBOCs can immediately offer ``one-stop \n     shopping'' (both local and long distance services). New \n     entrants, however, may take some time before they can offer \n     such services, and only after they incur significant capital \n     expenses will they be able to develop such capabilities.\n       In conclusion, we urge you to support telecommunications \n     reform legislation that incorporates provisions that would \n     maintain an important decision-making role for the Department \n     of Justice; preserve the existing prohibition against mergers \n     of telephone companies and cable television companies located \n     in the same service areas; and protect the states' ability to \n     order 1+intraLATA dialing parity in appropriate \n     cases.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Tom Udall, Attorney General of New Mexico; James E. \n           Doyle, Attorney General of Wisconsin; Grant Woods, \n           Attorney General of Arizona; Winston Bryant, Attorney \n           General of Arkansas; Richard Blumenthal, Attorney \n           General of Connecticut; M.

Mr. President, I should like to address the issue \nof the Supreme Court decision in Adarand versus Pena.\n  Mr. President, on Monday, a closely divided Supreme Court handed down \na 5 to 4 decision in the case of Adarand versus Pena. Adarand involved \na challenge to the provision in the small business act that gives \ngeneral contractors on Government procurement projects a financial \nincentive to hire socially and economically disadvantaged businesses as \nsubcontractors. In its opinion, the Court held that all racial \nclassifications imposed by the Federal Government will henceforth be \nsubjected to a strict scrutiny analysis. Strict scrutiny, Mr. \nPresident, is a very difficult standard to meet. Indeed, it is the most \ndifficult standard the Court applies. Accordingly, Federal racial \nclassifications will be found constitutional only if they are narrowly \ntailored measures that entail further compelling Government interests.\n  At the outset I think it is important to note that under our system \nof government, the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is. \nAccordingly, ``strict scrutiny'' for Federal Government race programs \nis now the law of the land. Ever since I studied constitutional law in \nlaw school, I have had a profound respect for the Supreme Court and all \nthat it represents in our system of laws.\n  Having said that, however, Mr. President, I still believe that the \nAdarand decision was bad law. Clearly, the [[Page S8377]] Adarand case \nwould not be the first time that the Supreme Court has ruled in a way \nthat was just plain wrong. Who can forget the infamous Dred Scott case \nin which the Court stated that a black man had no rights which whites \nwere bound to uphold, and that they were, indeed, mere property? Or \nPlessy versus Ferguson, which held that segregated facilities were in \nfact constitutional? Or the Bradwell case, in which the Supreme Court \nupheld Illinois' refusal to grant a law license to women and stating:\n\n       Man is, or should be, women's defender. The natural and \n     proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex \n     evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil \n     life.\n\n  And certainly, Mr. President, a number of my more conservative \ncolleagues would say that the Court was wrong in its ruling in Roe \nversus Wade.\n  Nevertheless, the Adarand decision is now the law of the land. The \nquestion now before us is how will we achieve the goal of true equality \nin light of this new hurdle? What should we as a Nation do with the \ncontinuing legacy of what was called ``the peculiar institution'' of \nslavery and Jim Crow and its aftermaths?\n  The most important step I believe that we can take in light of this \ndecision is to begin an honest dialog on the issue of race. The racial \nissue is clearly the most volatile and controversial issue to come \nbefore the Court. Indeed, it is one of the most volatile and \ncontroversial issues of our time.\n  As Justice Ginsburg noted in her dissent, the Court applies a mere \n``intermediate'' review for classifications based on gender, while \nreserving its highest review of strict scrutiny for classifications \nbased on race.\n  The irony of the Adarand case is that the individual who won the \ncontract at issue, Mr. Gonzalez, is not black; he is Hispanic. The \ncontract at issue was awarded to a Hispanic subcontractor, yet every \nopinion, both the majority opinions and the dissents, including Justice \nThomas' opinion implies but does not state that the driving issue at \nstake in Adarand is affirmative action for blacks. The opinions in the \nAdarand case underscore the myth that affirmative action only helps \nblack people. The reality of affirmative action is that other \nminorities, and women, have benefited as much if not more than blacks \nas a group, and particularly black men.\n  Affirmative action, Mr. President, was a response to the legacy of \nslavery. It was a positive action to give a boost or, if you will, to \nmainstream a community which had been segregated by law and which had \nthreatened to become a permanent caste in American society.\n  I believe that the originators of affirmative action showed great \nwisdom and forethought in the programs that they designed to bring \nblack people into the economic mainstream. They recognized that black \npeople had been legally disbarred from the opportunity to pursue \nquality education, to serve in the military, to hold a decent, high \npaying job, to pursue employment, and to participate fully in our \neconomy as well as in our society. The creators of affirmative action \nsought to give a boost to black people by lifting them up, by allowing \nspecific preferences for groups.\n  Now, the issue of preferences when it comes to affirmative action is \nreally a curious intellectual side bar. We have and take for granted \nall kinds of preferences which serve policy goals and reflect our \nsociety's values. There are preferences for veterans, never mind \nwhether the individual veteran ever saw a battle. And I think we would \nall agree that it is a good thing to reward people who took time out of \ntheir private lives to serve our country in the military. There are \npreferences for seniors. I do not know too many people who would \ndisagree that getting to the golden years ought to have some support \nfrom society as a whole. There are preferences for residents of a State \nor city in public employment, and a host of others that we could \nmention.\n  So why then is the notion of affirmative action so fraught with \ncontroversy? And why are preferences so bad only when they arrive in \nthe context of race? Justice Scalia, who wrote separately in the \nAdarand case, argues the following: He argues that it is tough cookies; \nslavery happened; it is too bad; and now you are on your own and \nnothing ought to be done about that.\n  What Judge Scalia's decision fails to recognize is that it is in the \ninterests of the entire country, of all of us, to take steps to resolve \nthe legacy of slavery and of Jim Crow. If affirmative action is undone, \nthere will be a very real cost to society as a whole, black and white, \nand others alike, all of us. The imperative for change, the imperative \nfor diversity that affirmative action provided will have been removed \nand once again minorities and women will find it more difficult, if not \nimpossible, to enter the economic mainstream.\n  And that cost will not just be borne by the women and minorities who \nare likely to see opportunity shrink away. It will be borne by our \nsociety as a whole. Affirmative action is about far more than just \nequal opportunity. It is about our country's economic prosperity. We \nare one people. We are one America. We share a collective \nresponsibility to guide our Nation in a constructive direction of \nopportunity for all. And we will all win when America makes it possible \nto tap the talent of 100 percent of its workers.\n  Now, I know there is a particular controversy about why members of \nthis generation should be required or called on to do anything to pay \nfor, if you will, the ``sins of their fathers'' and what happened in \nthis country 100 years ago. Justice Scalia again expressed this \nantipathy when he argued in this opinion in Adarand that there can be \nno ``creditor'' or ``debtor'' races. There is a great deal of \nresentment, we are told, by the angry white male toward the favoritism \nshown to blacks in this country.\n  But, Mr. President, if blacks were so favored as a group in America, \nhow many white Americans do you know would want to wake up tomorrow and \nchange places? How many white males would want to wake up tomorrow \nmorning and be black? The fact is that racism is a reality in this \ncountry, an unfortunate one but reality, and affirmative action is one \nmethod by which we attempt to change that reality.\n  The majority opinion in Adarand fails completely to address this. \nThose in the majority I think would prefer to close their eyes and \npretend that racism simply does not exist, but it does. And the fact \nthat it does is what makes the Adarand decision such bad law.\n  Some have suggested that in response to the Adarand decision we work \non a case-by-case basis to evaluate every Federal affirmative action \nprogram and save those that can meet the strict scrutiny test. I agree \nthat this is an appropriate and necessary activity and one that needs \nto be part of our response.\n  The fact is we have an obligation to make Government accountable to \nreview all programs to see if they are achieving the ends for which \nthey have been designed. And so the issue is not one of review but one \nof retreat and one of retrenchment.\n  Mr. President, others have suggested that the approach ought to be \none now, instead of affirmative action, to speak of reparations--the \nold ``40 acres and a mule'' analogy.\n This approach may seem absurd at first blush but, quite frankly, if \nyou read the Court's opinion in the Adarand case, it really becomes the \nlogical conclusion. Justice O'Connor's majority opinion stated group \nremedies were inherently suspect; instead, Justice O'Connor stated that \nremedies should be targeted to individuals who have been the victims of \nracism. So descendants of slaves who were promised 40 acres and a mule \nwould, therefore, be the logical beneficiaries of Justice O'Connor's \nformula.\n\n  Still others have called for a nationwide apology about slavery, \nsimilar to that apology that many are currently pressing the Japanese \nto issue in response to their actions in World War II --or similarly, \nfrankly, to the apology recently given by the United States Government \nfor its internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.\n  The point is that what we really need and what we have to search for \nare new solutions, solutions that will provide opportunity to those who \nface the higher barriers imposed by racism and discrimination. These \nsolutions, I believe, will come in as many different forms as the \nproblems that we face as a Nation. For blacks, those solutions \n[[Page S8378]] must include access to quality education, access to \ncapital, and assistance with institution building.\n  For women, we must make efforts to shatter the glass ceiling that \nlimits participation at the highest levels and perpetuates the old boy \nnetwork. For Asian Americans, we must seek to remove the mystery that \nsurrounds the Asian community, when even fourth- and fifth-generation \nAmericans are viewed with suspicion as foreign or not real Americans. I \nam certain, Mr. President, there are as many other worthwhile \nsuggestions that will come forward in the coming weeks, and I look \nforward to considering and debating these and other suggestions. But \nthe point is that I think the Adarand decision becomes a starting \npoint, a take-off point for us to begin to have an honest dialog about \nwhere we are going in this Nation and how we can go there together.\n  While I have the utmost respect for those who come forward with new \nways to provide opportunity to all, I still, frankly, find it \nirresponsible that some would merely seek to limit opportunity without \nputting forward any new proposals, folks who would suggest that \nrepealing our current efforts to provide opportunity without proposing \nany new solutions. This, in my opinion, is nothing more than a thinly \nveiled laissez-faire attitude toward diversity that is, at best, \nshortsighted.\n  Instead of a deconstructionist approach, tearing down affirmative \naction and putting nothing in its place, I encourage my colleagues to \njoin in developing creative solutions to the legacy of discrimination \nin this country. For guidance, I believe we can look to the countless \nindividuals, the men and women around this country who are already \nworking in the communities to ensure that the American dream is \navailable for all of us and not just for some of us.\n  And consider for a moment the example of LISC, Local Initiative \nSupport Corporation. LISC was established in 1979 to provide financing \nand technical know-how to nonprofit community organizations, know-how \nthese groups used to develop low- and moderately affordable housing and \nattract commercial investments, create jobs and expand services in \nunderserved neighborhoods. We need to build on successes such as these \nrather than give up on the dream of true equality in America. There are \nenough success stories out there, there are enough examples of people \nworking together to forge a true network, a true quilt of diversity \nthat will reflect the best that is America. I believe we have an \nobligation to look to those examples and to replicate them wherever we \ncan.\n  Mr. President, also, I would like to add that while some uncertainty \nmay surround Federal Government set-aside programs, there are a host of \nother activities which are in no way jeopardized by the Adarand ruling. \nWhile efforts such as the set-asides in the Small Business Act have \nbeen extremely important in helping to bring minorities into the \neconomic mainstream, they, frankly, do not comprise the heart of this \nGovernment's efforts in regard to affirmative action.\n  Despite all the attention that has been focused on the set-aside \nprogram, the heart of affirmative action is not set-asides. The heart \nof affirmative action, on the other hand, is, in fact, to create a \nclimate in which diversity can thrive and which allows women and \nminorities to succeed. The heart of affirmative action is about \nensuring that the qualifications of women and minorities will be \nconsidered and not ignored.\n  Affirmative action does not seek to guarantee any individual a job or \na contract. Rather, it seeks to give women and minorities a chance to \nsucceed or fail, sink or swim, based on ability, not race or gender. \nAffirmative action, therefore, encompasses efforts such as recruiting \nat historically black colleges and universities, in addition to the Big \nTen and Ivy League schools so that the most talented young African \nAmericans will be considered for jobs and careers along with most \ntalented white Americans. It includes the Executive order on \naffirmative action which requires the Federal contractors to maximize \nthe percentages of women and minorities in their work force without \never requiring quotas or preferences.\n  In short, affirmative action is, at its heart, about ensuring equal \nopportunity, not equal results. Affirmative action is not a zero sum \ngain. It does not have winners and losers. We all win when we open up \nopportunity and stir the competitive pot to allow a real meritocracy to \ndevelop in this country, one that is color blind and gender neutral and \ndoes not insist that the shackles of the past are just accidents of \nbirth for which we have no collective obligation as a Nation to remove \nand overcome.\n  Diversity is our strength, not our weakness--or it can be, anyway, so \nlong as we do not allow those who would separate us on the basis of \nrace or gender to prevail. This is not, Mr. President, ``Let's all get \nalong,'' and this is not paternalism, it is an acknowledgment that we \nare all in this together. We will all rise or fall, sink or swim, \ntogether as Americans. Recognizing that, let us not retreat. Instead, \nlet us go forward together to build on the progress that has been made \nso far. It is in our collective and national interest that we do so. \nThe future of our country, and nothing less important than that, hinges \non our response at this time in our history to this very important \nlongstanding issue of the character of the American society.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

While the distinguished Senator from Virginia is here, \nthere is no one I admire more, and I would be ready, willing, and able \nto try to respond. It came to my attention in discussing this just in \nthe last hour that they had a provision in here relative to getting \ninto--I did not realize, Mr. President, on page 99, the language \nappeared about getting into the manufacturing.\n  It reads:\n\n       . . . if the Commission authorizes a Bell operating company \n     to provide interLATA services. . ., then that company may be \n     authorized by the Commission to manufacture and provide \n     telecommunications equipment, and to manufacture customer \n     premises equipment, at any time after that determination is \n     made, subject to the requirements of this section. . . .\n\n  So the work of the distinguished Senator from Virginia is accurate. I \nhad always contended that the manufacturer had no relation whatever to \nlong distance. I think it ought to be written somewhere in the \nCongressional Record that I worked with the Bell operating companies \nfor a good many years on the manufacturing bill.\n  At the time we passed it in the U.S. Senate, 2 years ago--3 years ago \nnow--by a bipartisan 74 votes, it had no relation not only to long \ndistance, but the RBOC's told this particular Senator time and time \nagain, ``We are not interested in getting into long distance. We are \nnot interested at all in long distance. We are trying to get into \nmanufacturing.''\n  Now, there was a difference. The distinguished chairman and Senators \non his side, although we voted it, and that is the way it provided in \nlast year's bill, S. 1822, they had a provision that manufacturing \ncould not commence for 3 years. The compromise was made as appears on \npage 99 that it was after they got into interLATA it was authorized.\n  I do not question the logic, in a sense, of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Virginia. However, then our side, in the negotiations and drawing \nthis measure, said that irrespective of that particular production, \nnamely, the development and actual manufacture of equipment, that we \ncould immediately get into the design, saying:\n\n       Upon the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1995, a \n     Bell operating company may--\n       (A) engage in research and design activities related to \n     manufacturing, and\n       (B) enter into royalty agreements with manufacturers of \n     telecommunications equipment.\n\n  And then in section (b) you have to have a separate subsidiary. So \nlong as they have that separate subsidiary, and they cannot cross \nsubsidize, in any fashion, their research and design activities, the \nresearch and design activities have no relation whatever to the \nchecklist, or the checklist is premised on getting in, of course, to \nlong distance service. There is no connection, whatever. And I really \nthink if we were not this far along in the bill I would be talking to \nmy chairman to knock that page 99 out and that provision out. We have \nagreed to support the bill as is.\n  I understand that some in that particular manufacturing business \nrealize that the research and design, the software, is 90 percent of \nthe business. That is the developmental part. They do not want anyone \nto get into it as long as they can possibly prevent anyone getting into \nresearch and design.\n  Now, if this Senator were king for a day, I would have them into \nresearch and design tomorrow morning. I would have no relation whatever \nto the interLATA services getting into long distance or the checklist. \nThat is why I wanted the Senator to lay that clearly on top of the \ntable here. I am not trying to oppose the Senator, I am trying to \nsupport him. There is the reason I cannot support it at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. My \ndistinguished colleague took the time to meet with my constituents a \nfew minutes ago and expressed to them his concerns about it.\n  Might I suggest that we endeavor to get back to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina tomorrow morning and, indeed, both managers \nof the bill, with perhaps some language that would resolve this \nproblem.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has spoken with clarity now. He has \ndefined the issue far more clearly. We will take another try in the \nmorning. I thank him for his cooperation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to say that I join in \nSenator Hollings' earlier remarks on manufacturing, and I thank my good \nfriend from Virginia for reconsidering. I hope he will be able--this \nbill has been crafted in this area.\n  I know that the Senator from South Carolina had the amendment a \ncouple years ago about manufacturing. I know this has been worked on \nday and night during the drafting sessions, and of course all Senators \nare welcome to offer amendments, but I do hope and I should say that I \nwould stand with the Senator from South Carolina, based on the \ninformation I have at this moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the other distinguished manager from South \nDakota. I hope that we will remain with open mind until tomorrow \nmorning and I can address the issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8379-3", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8379-4", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Kalbaugh, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8379-5", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/06/14/senate-section/article/S8379-6", "month": "06", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "14", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n[[Page S8380]]\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 349.

A bill to assist the preservation of rail infrastructure, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n            THE RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE PRESERVATION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Rail \nInfrastructure Preservation Act of 1995. This legislation is designed \nto target rail freight investment needs in neglected regions of the \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to provide a blueprint for \nrebuilding and improving the rail lines serving our smaller cities and \nrural areas. These lines, run mainly by short-line and regional \nrailroads, are critical to the survival of rural America's economy. \nYet, the capital needed to maintain these secondary rail lines is very \nlimited.\n  My colleagues may recall I introduced a similar bill during the last \nCongress. I continue to believe Federal involvement is necessary to \npreparing our Nation's rail transportation network for the next \ncentury. A national commitment to the future of rail freight service is \ncritical to the advancement of our overall transportation system.\n  Mr. President, we are facing very serious Federal budget constraints. \nI support comprehensive deficit reduction proposals and have backed \nthat support with my voting record. I will continue to do so. In our \nefforts to tackle the deficit, it is important to allocate our limited \ntax dollars wisely.\n  In my view, adequate investment in our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure provides for wise use of these dollars. However, as we \nconsider national transportation infrastructure investment, we must not \noverlook one very critical transportation mode--rail freight service.\n  During the 1970's and 1980's, the large railroads abandoned thousands \nof miles [[Page S8381]] of rail lines throughout the United States. \nMuch of our former rail infrastructure has been abandoned. Fortunately, \nmany independent regional and short-line railroads have filled the gap, \nkeeping many essential rail lines in service.\n  Despite the remarkable efforts by regional and short-line \nentrepreneurs to keep alive our Nation's secondary rail lines, the \ndemand for capital investment to maintain these lines far out-paces \nsupply. This situation keeps far too many rural communities on the \nbrink of losing their rail service or having inadequate service due to \nunsound track conditions. Unfortunately, the Federal commitment to \nmaintaining necessary rail lifelines has diminished almost to the point \nof nonexistence.\n  It would help address the capital investment needs of our rail \nfreight transportation system. Specifically, my legislation would \npermanently authorize the Local Rail Freight Assistance [LRFA] Program. \nHowever, due to legitimate funding constraints, my bill would reduce \nthe authorization level by 17 percent from the amount approved by the \nSenate Commerce Committee during the last Congress. It also updates the \nexisting section 511 railroad loan guarantee program as I first \nproposed in the last Congress.\n  The LRFA Program has proven to play a vital role in our Nation's rail \ntransportation system. Created in 1973, LRFA provides matching funds to \nhelp States save rail lines that otherwise would be abandoned. For \ninstance, over the past few years, several rail improvement projects in \nmy home State of South Dakota have been made possible through LRFA \nfunding assistance. Without LRFA, our freight funding needs would go \nlargely unmet.\n  Of particular importance is how LRFA's matching requirements enable \nlimited Federal, State, and local resources to be leveraged. Indeed, \nLRFA's success has been in part due to its ability to promote \ninvestment partnerships, thus, maximizing very limited Federal \nassistance.\n  Historically, LRFA has received only a very modest level of Federal \nfunding. For example, $17 million was provided for LRFA in fiscal year \n1995. But a substantial portion of this very limited appropriation--\n$6.5 million--was rescinded recently by Public Law 104-6. Yet, LRFA \nremains very popular since it has been the only Federal program that \nprovides infrastructure investment in short-line and regional railroads \nin the absence of section 511 appropriations.\n  For example, in fiscal year 1995, 31 States requested LRFA assistance \nfor 59 projects, totaling more than $32 million in funding requests. \nUnfortunately, less than one-third of funding was available to meet \nthese rail infrastructure needs. With continued railroad restructuring, \nthese legitimate funding needs will only increase. LRFA is a worthy \nprogram and should be continued.\n  In addition, adequate funding for the section 511 Loan Guarantee \nProgram would permit high priority railroad transportation \ninfrastructure investment on lines operated by short-line and regional \nrailroads. In this era of significant budgetary pressures, the 511 \nprogram provides a cost effective method to insure modest \ninfrastructure investment on a repayable basis.\n  The 511 Program requires a processing fee paid to the Federal \nGovernment and the money borrowed is repaid with interest. The cost to \nthe taxpayers should range from negligible to a positive return. In \nthis time of fiscal pressure, we should support programs like the 511 \nProgram and LRFA that provide excellent leverage of our limited Federal \ndollars.\n  The 511 Railroad Loan Guarantee Program is permanently authorized at \n$1 billion, of which approximately $980 million currently is available \nfor commitment. The Credit Reform Act rules require an appropriation \nfor the 511 Loan Program to cover the anticipated loss to the \nGovernment over the life of each loan. Based on a fiscal year 1994 \nappropriation for a 511 project in New York State--the first 511 \napplication processed under the rules of the Credit Reform Act--5 \npercent of the total obligation level must be appropriated.\n  Several regional and short-line railroads are ready to submit loan \napplications as soon as the program is appropriated funding. For \nexample, the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern [DM] Railroad, headquartered \nin Brookings, SD, is prepared to file an application for a 511 loan \nguarantee as part of a project to be matched by financing from revenue \nbonds issued by the State of South Dakota.\n  It also is important to note that recently the House Transportation \nand Infrastructure Railroad Subcommittee approved an Amtrak \nreauthorization bill that includes a 511 loan guarantee provision \nspecifically permitting $50 million of the $1 billion authorized for \nthe section 511 program to be available for Amtrak for fiscal years \n1996 through 1999. Indeed, the 511 program is gaining increased \nCongressional attention and support.\n  My legislation is intended to make the loan guarantee program more \nuser friendly. My overall objective is to ensure the 511 Loan Program \ncan best serve its customers. I am eager to explore all options to \nenable us to reach this goal.\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, we need to help preserve our rural \nfreight rail systems. Building up these systems would allow more \nfreight to be shipped by rail and would help to alleviate highway \ntraffic and congestion. Our national transportation needs can best be \nmeasured on this type of inter-modal perspective. Therefore, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation while we work to address the \nlarger issues of transportation investment policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Minerals Management Service within the \nDepartment of the Interior; and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE ORGANIC ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto establish the Minerals Management Service as a permanent agency at \nthe Department of the Interior. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my colleague from Colorado, Senator Brown, and by the ranking \nmember on the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator \nJohnston.\n  The legislation I sponsor is very straightforward. It would simply \nauthorize the establishment of a Minerals Management Service at the \nDepartment of the Interior, require that it be headed by a Director who \nis to be appointment by the President and confirmed with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate, and direct that it administer royalty management \nand Outer Continental Shelf lands programs. The Minerals Management \nService already exists although, as I will explain, the Clinton \nadministration has proposed to dismantle it. My bill, which is an MMS \norganic act, would authorize and preserve MMS.\n  Mr. President, the Minerals Management Service--or MMS--was \nestablished by Secretarial order in 1982 in response to concerns about \nthe amount of money the United States was receiving for Federal coal \nleases in the West and for the job that was being done in collecting \nmineral royalties owed the United States.\n  When MMS was created, it was given two basic functions: first, to \nassure that there is timely and efficient collection, disbursement, \naccounting for and auditing of the royalties owed the United States for \nmineral leases both onshore and offshore. MMS has principal \nresponsibility for handling the mineral receipts under provisions of \nthe Mineral Leasing Act, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management \nAct, and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.\n  Second, MMS was given responsibility for managing a program to \npromote and regulate the use of lands on the Outer Continental Shelf \nfor purposes of mineral exploration, development and production. The \nOCS contains abundant supplies of oil and natural gas, as well as other \nminerals used for industrial and commercial purposes, such as sulfur.\n  When MMS was formed, many good Federal employees from the Interior \nDepartment's Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Geological Survey, as \nwell as some from the Department of Energy, were selected to staff this \nnew agency. Most of these people brought a particular expertise to \ntheir jobs, with some having experience at the General Accounting \nOffice and the Internal Revenue Service.\n  What has MMS and its employees done with its responsibilities in last \n13 years, Mr. President? Well, it has significantly improved the \nroyalty management program. It has reduced the number of data-related \nerrors and royalty payor mistakes from about 39 percent in 1982 to less \nthan 5 percent. In increased the percentage of monies being distributed \non time from 92 to about 99 percent in a period of about 10 years. For \nits handling of the royalty management functions, MMS received an award \nfor management excellence from the President's Council on Management \nImprovement in 1991, and twice in the last 5 years has been a finalist \nfor the Federal Quality Institute's Quality Improvement Prototype \nAwards.\n  Besides the IRS, the MMS is the second largest source of revenues for \nthe Federal Government, handling more than 4 billion in mineral \nroyalties, bonus bids, and rental payments each year. That is \ntremendous responsibility, and MMS is handling it well. Sure, there are \ndisagreement over policy issues. But, for the most part, people would \nsay MMS is doing a good job.\n  As for its responsibilities over the OCS lands program, Mr. \nPresident, I believe MMS can take great pride in the fact that the OCS \nis contributing to our Nation's energy supply in an environmentally \nsound and safe manner. The OCS accounts for about 23 percent of the \nNation's natural gas production and after 14 percent of our crude oil \nproduction. The OCS contains about 25 percent of our known natural gas \nreserves and about 15 percent of our known oil reserves. Historically, \nthe OCS has accounted for more than 106 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas produced and the production of 9 billion barrels of oil.\n  Remarkably, there has never been a blow-out from an oil well on the \nFederal OCS. The amount of oil spilled as a percentage of oil produced \non the OCS amounts to one-one thousandth of a percent [.001 percent]. \nAnd, the Department has never lost a challenge to one of its 5-year oil \nand gas plans, which are the activity planning documents laying out the \nDepartment's proposed oil and gas leasing program each 5 years. For its \npart in assuring that NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act] and \nother environmental requirements are fully implemented and adhered to \nwith respect to oil and gas exploration, development and production \nactivities on the OCS, MMS received the President's Council on \nEnvironmental Quality Award in 1994 for making environmental \nconsiderations an integral part of the agency's mission and decision-\nmaking process.\n  These are achievements of which MMS can be proud. All this from an \nagency that is not even 15 years old. Compare the effectiveness of MMS \nto one of its sister agencies at Interior, the Office of Surface \nMining, and you have an example of one agency that functions well and \none that is an absolute mess.\n  Now, however, Mr. President, along come President Clinton and \nSecretary Babbitt and their half-baked reinvention of government \nproposal to dismantle MMS, to devolve some of its functions to the \nStates, and to absorb the other functions elsewhere in Interior. If it \nweren't for the fact that we know the President and the Secretary are \nnot economists, I'd swear the MMS devolution idea is the work of an \neconomist. Economists have been described as people who sit around and \nwonder whether things that actually work in practice can work in \ntheory.\n  Here, we have the same kind of genius at work. MMS is recognized by \npeople inside and outside of government as an effective agency. Yet \nPresident Clinton and Secretary Babbitt want to give States the task of \ncollecting, disbursing, and auditing royalties, have the Federal \nGovernment keep responsibility for all major substantive functions, and \ndouble the States' contribution to administrative costs. What a deal!\n  Under the present system, States are assessed 25 percent of the total \nadministrative costs of royalty collection, disbursement and auditing. \nUnder the Babbitt devolution proposal, the States would be assessed the \npresent 25 percent, plus another 25 percent. Wyoming, New Mexico, \nColorado, and Utah would pay an additional $3.2 million, $3.3 million, \n$1.5 million, and $1.1 million, respectively, for the privilege of \ndoing MMS's job.\n  At first blush, Mr. President, the concept of devolving \nresponsibility to the States sounds like a good idea. It's one that \nRepublicans have been espousing for years and one that Democrats only \nrecently have begun to imitate. Give States primacy. Give them the \nability to make decisions regarding issues affecting their economic \nwell-being. Give them a greater say in how public lands and natural \nresources are managed. That is what Republicans [[Page S8383]] have \nbeen advocating for years. The Clinton-Babbitt proposal gives States \nmore work at greater cost. This is their idea of reinventing \ngovernment.\n  Well, the President and his friend Secretary Babbitt have got it \nwrong. The devolution proposal was not clearly thought out beforehand, \nbecause it doesn't really pass true responsibility to the States. All \nit passes to the States is the ministerial function of royalty \ncollection, disbursement, and auditing. And, as I just stated, for an \nadded 25 percent administrative charge. Under the President's proposal, \nthe Federal Government would retain rulemaking authority, \nresponsibility to make valuation determinations, and other important \nresponsibility. So the devolution of MMS responsibility is not really \nwhat it's cracked up to be.\n  We have yet to see an explanation of the economic effects of the \nPresident's proposal that fully sets out the benefits of this proposal. \nWe haven't seen a rush by the States to accept this responsibility, \nbecause many are still trying--as we are--to figure out the proposal, \nwhether they are equipped to handle the responsibilities, and whether \nthe proposal would impose an unfunded mandate. I suspect that some of \nthe numbers used by the President and Secretary Babbitt came from the \nsame creative genius that thought up the MMS devolution proposal in the \nfirst place.\n  Mr. President, the long and short of it is this: President Clinton \nand Secretary Babbitt have missed the mark with their MMS devolution \nproposal. The President's efforts would be better directed in improving \nthe Office of Surface Mining, or in significantly eliminating functions \nof the Department of Energy. MMS is not broken, and does not need to be \ndismembered as proposed by this ill conceived devolution.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that all the good things MMS has \nachieved will be lost if it is dismantled and its functions are spread \nto the wind. We are likely to get inconsistent interpretations, rulings \nand policies from the States on the few functions they will be given, \nwhile we still have the major ``inherently federal functions'' retained \nby the Interior Department. This will lead to costly litigation and an \ninefficient use of private and public sector resources.\n  In addition, Mr. President, if the OCS minerals management function \nis absorbed--or more likely buried--elsewhere in the Department, who \nwill be the advocate for the offshore oil and gas program? Who will \nassure that the OCS continues to be a vital contributor to our Nation's \nenergy security and energy policy?\n  The answer, I submit Mr. President, is that no single person and no \nagency will assure that responsibility. The President has not assumed \nresponsibility for a national energy policy, and has no energy security \nprogram. The President is AWOL--absent without leadership--on our \nNation's energy policy. The dismantling of MMS is consistent with that \nAWOL approach to executive management.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. I urge them not to succumb to the baiting that is likely \nto come from President Clinton, his friend Secretary Babbitt and others \nwho are attempting to ``reinvent government'' by destroying an agency \nthat works and claiming that Republicans are against government reform, \nreduction of the Federal work force, and saving money. The MMS \ndevolution is a bad idea, and is forced on an agency that works. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in sending a message to the President that he \nhas completely missed the mark on this one.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. DORGAN.\n  S. 923. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to \nprovide for a national program concerning motor vehicle pursuits by law \nenforcement officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             The national police pursuit policy act of 1995\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.\n  Mr. President, I intend to send some legislation to the desk of the \nSenate today dealing with an issue that does not command many headlines \nbut that is a critically important issue, in my judgment. It is the \nissue of the policy of police pursuit in this country and the dangers \nresulting from people who flee from police.\n  I received a letter about a month or two ago from a woman in Falls \nChurch, VA. I had written to her 2 years ago. Her husband and two \nchildren, on a Sunday morning, on the way to church, were involved in a \ncircumstance where a young fellow who was drunk and stole a car was \nbeing chased by the police at high rates of speed. This young fellow, \nbeing chased at a high rate of speed, crashed into the car of the \nfather and his two daughters and all three were killed.\n  Of course, the fellow who was drunk and fleeing from the police was \nnot hurt so badly. He eventually recovered and not very much happened \nto him as far as court action. By contrast, this Virginia woman lost \nher husband and two children in a circumstance where there was a high-\nspeed police chase in a city.\n  I wrote her a long letter when I read about it, because I sympathized \nsubstantially with her. I have written letters to others who suffered \nsimilar fates.\n  My mother was killed in a high-speed police chase, and I understand \nthat there are others around this country who, when confronted with \nthis, become angry about the chases that occur on city streets. I have, \nfor some years, felt we should do something about that.\n  The police are not the villains. It is the folks who run from the \npolice who are the villains. I have believed that for a long time and \nhave introduced legislation in both the House and Senate to respond to \nthis problem.\n  It is not just the woman in Falls Church, VA, who lost her family in \na senseless accident, or my mother who was senselessly killed in a \nsimilar circumstance in a police chase in Bismarck, ND, but let me \nexpand on my own experience.\n  Eyewitnesses said that particular chase occurred at speeds up to 80 \nto 100 miles an hour on the city streets. My mother, coming home from \nthe hospital, was a victim of that accident.\n  The villain there was a fellow in the pickup truck who was drunk and \nwho fishtailed his pickup truck because he was pushing the accelerator \ntoo hard, showing off. He took flight from the police at a very rapid \nrate of speed, and the result was that a wonderful woman was killed. \nShe senselessly lost her life.\n  Here's another tragic incident. On November 25, last year, a car \ncarrying a family of four on their way to a movie in Houston, TX, was \nstruck by a speeding car during a high-speed chase.\n  I could stand here for some hours and talk about the number of people \nkilled as a result of high-speed chases. In fact, a lot of people do \nnot know, but more innocent people in this country are killed as a \nresult of an accident that occurs from a high-speed police pursuit or \nchase on city streets than are killed as a result of an accidental \nshooting from a policeman's gun. We do not know how many, but we \nestimate probably a thousand people a year or more. Thousands and \nthousands more are injured as a result of these chases.\n  The fact is that it is not the police that are the source of the \nproblem, it is the people who run from the police. But it is also a \nfact that there are some circumstances where the police should not \nconduct a chase. If a motorist has a broken taillight and that results \nin a policeman trying to stop that person, and the person takes flight, \nthat does not justify a 100-mile-an-hour chase through the city \nstreets.\n  There is an organization called STOPP, whose board of directors is \nmeeting today in Washington, DC. And I believe one of the members of \nthe board of directors is from the State of the Presiding Officer, the \nState of Pennsylvania. Every one of the folks on that board will tell \nyou a similar story. Some member of their family or some friend was an \ninnocent bystander or passenger, but yet a victim of a high-speed \npursuit.\n  Now, what ought we do about this?\n  Well, I think we should do a couple of things. First, I like the \nsystem in Europe, where in most countries people who go out to drink \nunderstand that one of that group ought not to be drinking because they \nare going to drive. If you drive and get picked up drunk, you are in \nvery serious trouble.\n  In this country the consequence has been all too often sort of a \nsmirk and [[Page S8384]] a smack on the wrist. We ought to understand \nin this country that both for drinking, and especially for those who \nare willing to flee from police and take flight when they are trying to \napprehend you, two things are going to happen.\n  One, you are going to be put in jail for 3 months, and second, you \nare going to lose your vehicle. There ought to be certainty in this \ncountry about that. If you take flight from the police, there ought to \nbe certainty in every State in this country that you are going to be \nput in jail for doing it, and you are going to lose your vehicle.\n  I propose legislation that puts this into law. It requires the States \nto adopt policies to comply with those goals. And second, it requires \nthat at every law enforcement agency in this country there be uniform \ntraining about police pursuit, when to pursue and when not to pursue.\n  Interestingly, I was talking to a county sheriff recently and I was \ntalking about my legislation. He said to me, ``It is interesting, \nbecause just the night before, my deputies found a person who was dead \ndrunk driving in a very dangerous way on the city streets, and my \ndeputy turned on the light and siren to apprehend this person, and this \nperson took off at an enormous rate of speed through the city streets.\n  Later on, my deputy saw two small children in the back seat. My \ndeputy and the person on the radio decided between them that this was \nnot a chase that should continue. They broke off the pursuit.\n  An hour later, they went and arrested the person at his home because \nthe police had the license number. That is all they needed to do. They \ncould have decided that nobody is going to outrun us and that at the \nend of this, a couple kids are going to be dead in the street. That \nprobably is what would have happened. Fortunately, they made the right \ndecision because these folks were trained and used proper procedures.\n  The fact is that in a lot of law enforcement jurisdictions, there is \nnot adequate training about when or when not to pursue. There are not \nadequate policies, and there ought to be. I want uniform training and \npolicies across this country on police pursuits.\n  This issue affects the lives of literally thousands of Americans. I \nwould like to see--and my legislation provides for it--that in exchange \nfor receiving the highway safety funds, we insist that States meet a \nlist of criteria. I simply add to the list one feature. That feature is \nthat you shall have certain punishment for those that flee, and the \npunishment is that they will do jail time and lose their vehicles. In \nturn, my legislation also requires a certification that the law \nenforcement jurisdictions have uniform policies and training on police \npursuit.\n  So I intend to offer this legislation again, and I well understand \nthat it is hard to pass legislation like this. But it is legislation \nthat will, I think, save lives and families the grief and heartache of \nlosing loved ones.\n  While I am on my feet, let me describe another piece of legislation \nthat I will introduce, and which I introduced before, again without \nsuccess partly because people feel we should not meddle.\n  Most Members of the Senate will not probably know that you can \nreasonably drive across this country in a meandering line and either \ndrink while you drive and be perfectly legal, or have other folks in \nthe car drinking and be perfectly legal. You can do so because there \nare about 10 States in America where there is no prohibition against \nthe driver drinking. You can get in the car, put a key in the ignition, \nhave one hand on the steering wheel and the other on a bottle of \nwhiskey and drink and drive to your little heart's content.\n  As long as you are not drunk, you can drive in these States. Well, \nthere ought not be any State in this country that does not have a law \nprohibiting an open container of liquor, of alcohol in a vehicle. There \nought not be one. There is no justification in this country to allow \nanybody to move down the highways in a vehicle, that is a noncommercial \nvehicle, and have drinking involved in the vehicle.\n  Yet, sadly, there are 10 States in which you can drink and drive and \nyou are perfectly legal. You can start on the east coast, meander \nacross the country to the west coast, and either drink yourself or have \nsomebody else in the vehicle drinking, and do so legally.\n  I also believe we ought to change that. Some people say that is \nmeddling. That is the State's judgment. Well, I do not want my family, \nI do not want my friends, driving from one jurisdiction to another, \nacross a river or across a State line, and discover all of a sudden in \nthis State you can drink whiskey and drive. And it is hard to catch \npeople who are drinking, whether they are drunk or sober.\n  I do not want people to go across those lines and discover in this \njurisdiction you can drive and drink, and it is fine. It is not fine \nwith me. I want to change that law someday. What I would like to see is \na circumstance where we have decided as a country, much of what the \nEuropean countries have already decided, that drinking and driving \nturns drunk people into murderers. We ought to do what is necessary to \ntell the American people you cannot drink and drive. To do so will \ncause severe penalties.\n  The legislation I will introduce this afternoon, dealing with police \npursuit, sends a message that is just as strong on the issue of fleeing \nfrom police. If the police are trying to apprehend you and you flee \nfrom the police, you will face certain and tough penalties.\n  I hope we will consider and discuss such discuss legislation this \nyear. I know it comes from things that have happened in my family. I \nhave lost two members of our family to drunk drivers. I lost my mother \nto an accident from police pursuit, a person fleeing from the police.\n  I know we are all charged with doing things in our self-interest. \nYes, it is my self-interest, but it is in the self-interest of a lot of \npeople in this country who suffer the anguish they should never have to \nsuffer. They suffer the loss of innocent lives because of people who \ndrink and drive and people who flee from the police. As a result of \nthat, police initiate pursuits in city streets that end in death, all \ntoo often, for innocent Americans.\n  This is something we can do something about. This is not some \nmysterious disease. I hope some of my colleagues who might be \ninterested in this legislation will join me in finally allowing the \nSenate to make some progress.\n  Mr. President, one January morning in 1993 a high speed chase \noccurred in Arlington, VA, where a teenager, driving a stolen vehicle \nand allegedly drunk, fled the police. As the stolen car and police \ncruiser raced through Falls Church, VA, the fleeing teen ran a red \nlight and crashed into a car carrying a family on its way to Sunday \nmorning church. This high speed chase, one of many that occur every \nyear, ended in tragedy: One elementary principal and his two daughters, \nages 12 and 8, were killed, and the teenager driving the fleeing car \nwas hospitalized.\n  Public outrage erupted after this incident, with angry citizens \ncalling the police department to say, ``* * * a stolen car is not worth \na life.'' Mr. President, it seems to me that we need to ask ourselves: \n``Is a stolen car or a traffic violation worth the cost of an innocent \nlife?'' Unfortunately, this question is not being adequately answered \nby hundreds of police officers who on a regular basis pursue stolen \ncars and law breakers at reckless speeds through city streets.\n  There are countless other tragic examples, and I want to mention just \na few. On November 25, 1994, a car carrying a family of 4, on their way \nto a movie in Houston, TX, was struck by a speeding car during a high \nspeed police chase. Innocent passengers Laura Madrid, Robert Romero, \nand Maria Torres Romero later died as a result of injuries suffered in \nthe accident. In fact, that same year in Houston, a total of 11 people \nwere killed, amid 191 hot pursuit chases, prompting the Houston police \ndepartment to reexamine and ultimately change its pursuit policy.\n  In March of this year, police officers collided with a pickup truck \nwhile on pursuit, killing three passengers and injuring four others in \nLos Angeles, CA. That same month in Miami, FL, a woman was killed when \na car full of burglary suspects being chased by police sped off a \nhighway, broad-siding her car. That very same day, three police \ncruisers in Florida City, FL, chased a car at speeds of up to 100 miles \nper hour. The chase began when [[Page S8385]] police attempted to pull \nover a woman who was actually driving too slowly. The woman sped away \nfrom the police, and eventually veered into oncoming traffic, killing \nherself and two young men in an oncoming car.\n  These were senseless deaths that could have--and should have--been \navoided. All of these deaths the result of high speed chases, that \nsimply did not justify putting so many innocent lives in the line of \nfire. Something's got to be done.\n  Approximately hundreds of Americans are killed and many thousands of \npeople are injured every year as a result of high speed chases that are \nstarted when motorists, whether out of fright, panic, or guilt, flee at \nhigh speeds instead of stopping when a police vehicle turns on its \nlights and siren. Some police become determined to apprehend the \nfleeing motorist at all costs, what is alarming is that about 60 to 80 \npercent of all police pursuits are originated for minor traffic \nviolations. The result is that the safety of the general public--the \ndangers that will be created by a high-speed chase in city traffic \nthrough stop signs and traffic lights--becomes secondary to catching \nsomeone whose initial offense may have been no greater than driving a\n car with a broken tail light. Tragically, as in the high-speed chase \nlast January in Virginia, many people are dying unnecessarily from \nthese ill advised pursuits.\n\n  What needs to happen is for every single law enforcement jurisdiction \nin the United States to adopt a reasoned, well-balanced pursuit policy. \nPolice officers should be trained to comply with their departments' \npursuit policies and regularly retrained if needed to guarantee that \nall citizens, both civilians and police, receive the benefit of uniform \nawareness of this problem. A drive across country should not be a pot \nluck regarding one's chances of being maimed or killed by a police \npursuit. We must strive for universal attention to this public safety \nproblem.\n  In addition, we need to focus on the people who are initiating these \nchases--the people who are fleeing from police. The punishment for \nfleeing the police should be certain and severe. People should be aware \nthat if they flee they will pay a big price for doing so.\n  I rise today, Mr. President, to introduce the National Police Pursuit \nPolicy Act of 1995. It is my hope that this legislation, if enacted, \nwill help prevent tragic losses like the episode that occurred in 1993 \nin Arlington, as well as the thousands of other tragedies that occur \neach year all across America, including my own State of North Dakota.\n  It's also my hope that the legislation I introduce today will reverse \nthe trend of the past several years of ever increasing high-speed \npolice pursuits that have caused human losses to steadily mount.\n  Although we are finally seeing some initiative being taken by various \nStates and local communities, there is still no coordinated effort in \nthis country to attack this problem.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would require the \nenactment of State laws making it unlawful for the driver of a motor \nvehicle to take evasive action if pursued by police and would establish \na standard minimum penalty of 3 months imprisonment and the seizure of \nthe driver's vehicle. In addition, my bill would require each public \nagency in every State to establish a hot pursuit policy and provide \nthat all law enforcement officers receive adequate training in \naccordance with that policy.\n  I believe that these requirements, if passed, will demonstrate strong \nFederal leadership in responding to this problem. I am happy to be able \nto note that one important aspect of this issue, a severe under \nreporting of the accidents and deaths caused by police pursuits, has \nbeen addressed under provisions enacted in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Under that statute, the \nSecretary of Transportation is required to begin to collect accident \nstatistics from each State, including statistics on deaths and injuries \ncaused by police pursuits.\n  Mr. President, the problem of hot pursuits is not an easy issue to \nsolve. I understand that it will always be difficult for police \nofficers to judge when a chase is getting out of hand and the public \nsafety best served by holding back. However, we can make things better \nif we do everything we can to ensure that police officers are trained \non how best to make these difficult judgments and if we send a message \nto motorists that if you flee, you will do time in jail and lose your \ncar.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record and I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                 S. 923\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Police Pursuit \n     Policy Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) accidents occurring as a result of high speed motor \n     vehicle pursuits of fleeing motor vehicles by law enforcement \n     officers are becoming increasingly common across the United \n     States;\n       (2) the extent of the problem of those pursuits is evident \n     despite significant underreporting;\n       (3) because the problem of those pursuits is extensive, it \n     is essential for all law enforcement agencies to develop and \n     implement policies and training procedures for dealing with \n     high speed motor vehicle pursuits;\n       (4) a high speed motor vehicle pursuit in a community by a \n     law enforcement officer should be treated in the same manner \n     as the firing of a police firearm because a high speed motor \n     vehicle pursuit involves the use of a deadly force with the \n     potential for causing harm or death to pedestrians and \n     motorists;\n       (5) the Federal Government should provide an incentive for \n     States to enact laws to prevent high speed motor vehicle \n     pursuits;\n       (6) to demonstrate leadership in response to the national \n     problem of high speed motor vehicle pursuits, all Federal law \n     enforcement agencies should--\n       (A) develop policies and procedures governing motor vehicle \n     pursuits; and\n       (B) provide assistance to State and local law enforcement \n     agencies in instituting such policies and procedures and in \n     conducting training; and\n       (7) the policies referred to in paragraph (6) should \n     balance reasonably the need--\n       (A) to apprehend promptly dangerous criminals; and\n       (B) to address the threat to the safety of the general \n     public posed by high speed pursuits.\n\n     SEC. 3.
