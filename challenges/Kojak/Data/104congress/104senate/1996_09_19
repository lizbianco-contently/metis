Mr. President, today there will be a period for morning \nbusiness until the hour of 11 a.m. Following morning business, at 11 \nthe Senate will resume consideration of S. 39, the Magnuson fisheries \nbill. At that time there will be 4 minutes of debate time remaining on \nthe Hutchison amendment. Following that debate time, the Senate will \nproceed to two consecutive votes, first in relation to the Hutchison \namendment, if necessary, to be followed by a vote on passage of S. 39, \nas amended.\n  I want to say again how much I appreciate the good work that has been \ndone on this legislation. This is very important conservation \nlegislation that will help protect our fisheries and at the same time \nmake them available for commercial fishermen and recreational \nfishermen. A lot of good work has been done by the Senator from Alaska, \nSenator Stevens, and the Senators from Washington, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry. Senator Hutchison is very much involved. \nI think they have done really good work. I am pleased we are going to \nbe able to complete this legislation this morning.\n  Following disposition of those votes, the Senate will then be asked \nto turn to the consideration of any of the following items--the \nmaritime bill, H.R. 1350, the pipeline safety bill, and any available \nappropriations bills or conference reports. In the case of \nappropriations bills, if we could work out some sort of agreement as to \nhow to proceed; otherwise, we may have a conference report come over \nfrom the House, perhaps today, the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I know \nthey were trying to wrap it up last night or early this morning. The \nHouse hopes to be able to vote on that this afternoon, I believe.\n  Therefore, votes can be expected throughout today's session on these \nitems or others that may be cleared. I will continue to make an effort \nto notify Members as early in the evening as possible as to what time \nwe are going to finish up or whether or not there will be any \nadditional votes, as we did at 6 o'clock last night when we notified \nMembers there would be debate but no further votes. We will try to do \nthat again tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10899-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 61\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise to support the measure, S. 39, \nwhich is a bill to reauthorize and revitalize the Fisheries \nConservation and Management Act, also known as the Magnuson Act. This \nis without a doubt one of the most important conservation bills that \nhas come before this Congress, along with the nuclear waste bill.\n  The text of the bill before us, which was discussed at some length \nlast night, has changed a good deal since the bill that I had the honor \nto cosponsor along with Senator Stevens and Senator Kerry, in the final \ndays of the 103d Congress. And almost 2 years since that day, Senator \nStevens and Senator Kerry have led, I think, a remarkable, bipartisan \neffort to resolve other Members' problems with the bill as originally \nintroduced. I would like to commend both of them. I would like to also \nrecognize the cooperation of Senator Murray, Senator Gorton, of course \nour leader, Senator Lott, and many others who worked to bring this \nabout.\n  I cannot say I am completely satisfied with all the changes that have \nbeen necessary to accommodate the interests of various Members but that \nhow the process of legislating works. However, I can say that I have \nwatched and participated in the evolution of this legislation with very \nclose attention. I am confident the managers have made every possible \neffort to make those accommodations without violating the intent of and \nthe integrity of the bill.\n  I also want to recognize the tremendous efforts that have been made \nby others, including Bill Woolf of my staff, and the staffs of Senator \nStevens and others, to bring this to fulfillment.\n  The fishing industry itself, the industry groups, the environmental \ncommunity, and others who have participated in this bill to this point \nalso deserve recognition. For without that cooperative effort, we would \nnot be where we are today, ready to culminate this effort in a floor \nvote.\n  My efforts in connection with this bill have largely focused on \ncertain issues that have recently exploded in national prominence: \nfisheries bycatch and discard--in other words, the incidental catch \nthat is picked up as the preferred species is pursued, and the disposed \nof by discarding it over the side of the fishing vessel.\n  My first association with that came as a consequence of being \nappointed by Senator Dole to represent the U.S. Senate at the United \nNations. I learned of a report by the Food and Agriculture Organization \nof the United Nations that indicated that a world total fishery landing \nfigures of about 83 million metric tons did not include the 27 million \nmetric tons of incidental catch discarded overboard. The grand total of \nfish caught, I learned, could easily exceed the sustainable harvest \nlevel of the world's oceans by as much as 10 million metric tons.\n  Such incidental catch, Mr. President, is simply thrown over the side, \nback into the ocean. And it is not thrown over alive, it is thrown over \ndead. While it makes food for other fish, it is still an excessive \nwaste. So what we are looking at is a total catch of about 110 million \nmetric tons of which we discard 27 million metric tons and retain and \nconsume 83 million metric tons.\n  The scientists tell us the ocean is capable of producing--on a \nrenewable basis--about 100 million metric tons. Well, one can quickly \nsee the possibility that we are overfishing the oceans of the world by \nabout 10 million metric tons.\n  If we could just address the discard, to reduce that tonnage, we \ncould get this thing in balance. That was of particular interest and a \nrole that I played. I introduced the first bill to address bycatch and \ndiscard back in 1993. Today, almost 3 years later, I am pleased to say \nthat we are finally on the verge of taking action. The bill before us \nfollows the lead of my earlier efforts by establishing a new national \nstandard calling for bycatch to be avoided, where possible, and where \nit cannot be avoided for steps to minimize the resulting fisheries \nmortalities. We focused in on this issue. This will put us on the road \nto reducing and, hopefully, stopping the shameful waste that is \ncurrently occurring in many fisheries.\n  Following this principle, my good friend, Senator Stevens, has also \nauthored a separate section of the bill for Alaska only, which calls \nfor annual bycatch reductions in the Gulf of Alaska and in the Bering \nSea off Alaska.\n  Among other provisions, this bill will improve fisheries conservation \nand utilization, on which so many individuals in our coastal \ncommunities depend. It will for the first time address the problem of \noverfishing by requiring corrective action to be taken when a fishery \nis or is in danger of becoming overfished. It will also strengthen the \nfisheries management process by improving the way that regional fishery \ncouncils function, improve the way fisheries research is conducted and \nmake many other changes of great importance and urgent need.\n  Mr. President, two issues which have been most contentious during \nthis reauthorization process are the prospects for a new type of \nfishery limitation called an individual fishing quota program, and for \na community development quota program intended to pass through some of \nthe benefits from fisheries in the Bering Sea to disadvantaged, largely \nsmall native communities in that area.\n  In Alaska, and elsewhere, there has been considerable debate on \nredesigning fishery management using an individual fishing quota \nsystem. I will not attempt to get into the level of detail necessary to \nexplain how this would differ from the existing system of management. \nSuffice it to say that supporters believe this would solve most of \ntoday's problems of overcapitalized fisheries with the least Government \ninterference, and opponents claim it would not only be costly to the \nGovernment but hugely unfair to those who are excluded and to \ncommunities dependent on fishing.\n  The bill before us represents a compromise between these two \npositions. It contains a moratorium on new individual fishing quota \nsystems, and a comprehensive study of their potential--that is both \ngood and bad--and of their actual impacts in those cases where they \nhave already been used. I believe this is a compromise worthy of our \nsupport as a Senate body.\n  In the case of the community development program proposal, we also \nsee the results of sensible, needed compromise. The bill before us \ntoday provides a mechanism to assign some of the volume of fish coming \nfrom Bering Sea fisheries to the task of helping provide a stable, \npermanent economic base for some of the poorest, most disadvantaged \ncommunities in the country. This is a very worthy goal, and it is also \none that I believe deserves the support of my colleagues.\n  Finally, there are far too many other specifics in this bill to \nrecount them all, or to provide my views on each and every issue the \nbill addresses. -Instead, let me close with this: If there is anything \non which we can agree, it is the need for productive, healthy oceans. \nThat is the goal of this bill, and this bill is Congress' farthest ever \nreach toward reaching it. Let's not waste the opportunity.\n  Finally, let me note that my good friend and colleague, the senior \nSenator, Senator Stevens, worked with the late Senator Magnuson on the \noriginal formulation of this bill. I personally feel that this \nlegislation should be referred to as the Magnuson-Stevens legislation, \nbut recognizing the lateness of the date for such a change, I will \nreserve that name for my own thoughts about it.\n  I do want to congratulate my senior colleague for his tireless \nefforts, and that of his staff, as well as many other Senators, to \nbring this bill before the Senate today. Needless to say, I urge its \nsuccessful passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are now in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will speak no more than 5 minutes, but I \nask unanimous consent Senator Kennedy follow me for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Craig pertaining to the introduction of S. 2092 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10900-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10901-S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Republicans in Congress say they want to \nwork out an immigration bill that can become law. Yet, the only \nnegotiations now going on are between Republicans and Republicans. The \nstruggling Dole campaign is desperately trying to keep the poison pill \nGallegly amendment in the bill, over the objections of many Republicans \nwho want to deal responsibly with illegal immigration. Dr. Dole is \nprescribing a poison pill, but Congress doesn't have to swallow it.\n  The record is clear. Members of both parties have worked together \neffectively and intensively for the past 2 years to develop bipartisan \nlegislation to address the crisis in illegal immigration, and it is \nirresponsible for Bob Dole to sabotage the possibility of agreement.\n  This bill had its origin in the work of the bipartisan Jordan \ncommission, which conducted extensive hearings and produced a \ncomprehensive set of recommendations in September 1994.\n  Senator Simpson then conducted extensive Judiciary Committee hearings \nin 1995 on needed enforcement at the border, and on measures to deny \njobs to illegal immigrants and prevent document fraud. The Immigration \nSubcommittee held 3 days of markup in June 1995 and again in November.\n  The full Judiciary Committee considered almost 150 amendments during \n8 days in February and March 1996.\n  The full Senate adopted by the bill by an overwhelming vote of 97 to \n3 in May, after almost 2 weeks of intense debate.\n  So we know how to work together to develop responsible legislation to \ncombat illegal immigration. But instead of working together in this \nfinal stage, Republicans Tuesday canceled our immigration meeting at \nthe last minute.\n  So far, Republicans are still fighting among themselves because of \nBob Dole's irresponsible 11th hour intervention to salvage his campaign \nby sinking the bill, so that President Clinton will not have this bill \nto sign.\n  We need a bill that is tough at the border and tough in the \nworkplace, not tough on children. We need a bill that tackles the \nproblem of document fraud head on, so that illegal immigrants can no \nlonger steal American jobs by using counterfeit documents to pose as \nlegal workers. We need a bill that continues to protect Americans and \nlegal immigrants from job discrimination. We need a bill that preserves \nthe ability of American citizens to bring close family members to the \nUnited States.\n  We need a bill that protects all refugees from exclusion, not just \nthose from Cuba. We need a bill that treats legal immigrants fairly \nunder the welfare laws.\n  The current Republican bill winks at unscrupulous employers, and then \nlowers the boom on innocent school children through the Gallegly \namendment.\n  The Nation's police officers and educators vigorously oppose the \nGallegly amendment, and for good reason. As Chief of Police Jerry \nSanders of San Diego wrote in his June 25 letter to Congress:\n\n       If the proposed legislation becomes law, thousands of \n     children may be turned away from school. Many of these \n     children will be drawn to trouble or victimized by it, and I \n     believe that both gang activity and juvenile crime will \n     increase. I hope you will take these factors into \n     consideration, and I encourage you to oppose the legislation.\n\n  Expelling children from school and dumping them on the street is no \nsolution to the problem of illegal immigration, and is not even a \npartial solution. It will only make other problems worse. The cost to \nAmerica in crime and other social costs will be immense.\n  A UCLA study found that each student kicked out of school will cost \nthe Los Angeles government $6,100 in police costs, judicial and penal \ncosts, and health, welfare, and employment services.\n  Teenage pregnancy rates rise dramatically when students leave school. \nThe pregnancy rate for teenagers in school is 8 percent, compared with \n41 percent for those who are out of school. The result is huge costs in \nemergency medical services, intensive care for babies born prematurely \nto teenage mothers, and welfare costs for the children.\n  Every major study of illegal immigration reaches the same conclusion. \nThe reason illegal immigrants come to the United States is for \njobs. Jobs are the overwhelming magnet. They don't come so that their \nchildren can attend U.S. schools.\n\n  That was the conclusion of the 1976 report of the Ford \nadministration's Domestic Council Committee on Illegal Immigration. \nThat was the conclusion of the 1981 report of Select Commission on \nImmigration and Refugee Policy chaired by Father Theodore Hesburgh. \nThat was the conclusion of the Bush administration survey of illegal \nimmigrants in 1992. That was the conclusion of the Barbara Jordan \ncommission in 1994. That was the conclusion this year of a study by the \nCenter for Population Research at the National Institutes of Health, \nwhich concluded that ``the estimated value of welfare, medical, and \neducational benefits that migrants could expect to receive in the \nUnited States had no clear relationship to the likehood of migrating.''\n  Expelling children from school won't prevent illegal immigration. \nSome 80 percent of the children have brothers or sisters or parents who \nare legally in the United States or who may even be citizens. These \nfamilies have roots here, and the Gallegly amendment won't make them \nleave.\n  Some versions of the Gallegly amendment have proposed that States \ncharge tuition, rather than expelling children from school. The average \ncost of public school is $5,600 per child per year. Charging tuition is \nthe same as kicking children out of school. Their parents can't afford \ntuition, even if they were willing to identify themselves by writing a \ncheck.\n  The Gallegly amendment is only the beginning of the problems with the \ncurrent Republican bill. Republicans have kowtowed to special business \ninterests and eliminated needed provisions to protect American jobs \nfrom illegal workers. In fact, for American workers under the \nRepublican bill, it is three strikes and you're out.\n  First, the bill denies the Department of Labor the additional \ninspectors needed to make sure employers obey the law. The Senate bill \nadded 350 more inspectors, a 50-percent increase. The House bill \ncontained a similar increase when it was approved by the House \nJudiciary Committee. But under pressure from business lobbyists, the \nHouse Republican leadership quietly stripped that provision from the \nbill, with no vote and with no debate.\n  No one can say to the American people with a straight face that this \nbill combats illegal immigration, when it gives employers a slap on the \nwrist if they hire illegal immigrant workers.\n  Second, this bill fails to deal adequately with the serious problem \nof document fraud. Too many illegal workers obtain jobs by using fake \ndocuments to pass as legal immigrants or even U.S. citizens.\n  What's needed is more secure forms of birth certificates and other \ndocuments widely used to prove citizenship and identification. Birth \ncertificates in particular are breeder documents. A fake birth \ncertificate breeds a host of other fraud. With a fake birth \ncertificate, an illegal immigrant can get a Social Security card--and \noften a passport, too. These fake documents enable them to get jobs \nillegally, and get welfare benefits illegally, too. Yet the Republican \nbill, under pressure from unscrupulous employers, doesn't crack down \nthe way it should.\n  Third, this Republican bill gives employers who discriminate against \nHispanic-American workers and Asian-American workers a green light to \ncontinue that discrimination. The bill sets an impossibly high standard \nfor proving that employers put Hispanics and Asians through more hoops \nto get jobs than other American workers. This kind of job \ndiscrimination is flagrant and wrong, and Congress should not let \nemployers continue to get away with it.\n  The Republican bill also puts an unfair dollar sign on family \nreunification. American citizens who want to bring in family members--\neven wives or husbands or young children--must meet excessive income \nstandards. It doesn't matter if the family members they are sponsoring \nhave a job or have assets of their own. These citizens are out of luck \nand out of hope for reuniting their families in America, and Congress \nshould reject this harsh antifamily standard.\n  Finally, the Republican bill hurts refugees, makes the recent welfare \nreforms even worse, and gratuitously endangers the environment. All of \nthese\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\nissues can be satisfactorily resolved in a fair bipartisan \nconference. But they cannot be resolved if Republicans continue to \nquarrel among themselves and let the Dole campaign dictate steps that \nhave nothing to do with reasonable immigration legislation. Bob Dole \nmay not want action by Congress on illegal immigration but the country \ndoes, and the vast majority of Americans and Congress do.\n\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nexcellent editorial in the New York Times today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      A Dangerous Immigration Bill\n\n       As the White House and members of Congress make final \n     decisions this week about a severely flawed immigration bill, \n     they seem more concerned with protecting their political \n     interests than the national interest. The bill should be \n     killed.\n       Debate over the bill has concentrated on whether it should \n     contain a punitive amendment that would close school doors to \n     illegal-immigrant children. But even without that provision, \n     it is filled with measures that would harm American workers \n     and legal immigrants, and deny basic legal protections to all \n     kinds of immigrants. At the same time, the bill contains no \n     serious steps to prevent illegal immigrants from taking \n     American jobs.\n       Its most dangerous provisions would block Federal courts \n     from reviewing many Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     actions. This would remove the only meaningful check on the \n     I.N.S., an agency with a history of abuse. Under the bill, \n     every court short of the Supreme Court would be effectively \n     stripped of the power to issue injunctions against the I.N.S. \n     when its decisions may violate the law or the Constitution.\n       Injunctions have proven the only way to correct system-wide \n     illegalities. A court injunction, for instance, forced the \n     I.N.S. to drop its discriminatory policy of denying Haitian \n     refugees the chance to seek political asylum.\n       On an individual level, legal immigrants convicted of minor \n     crimes would be deported with no judicial review. If they \n     apply for naturalization, they would be deported for such \n     crimes committed in the past. The I.N.S. would gain the power \n     to pick up people it believes are illegal aliens anywhere, \n     and deport them without a court review if they have been here \n     for less than two years.\n       The bill would also diminish America's tradition of \n     providing asylum to the persecuted. Illegal immigrants \n     entering the country, who may not speak English or be \n     familiar with American law, would be summarily deported if \n     they do not immediately request asylum or express fear of \n     persecution. Those who do would have to prove that their fear \n     was credible--a tougher standard than is internationally \n     accepted--to an I.N.S. official on the spot, with no right to \n     an interpreter or attorney.\n       Scam artists with concocted stories would be more likely to \n     pass the test than the genuinely persecuted, who are often \n     afraid of authority and so traumatized they cannot recount \n     their experiences. Applicants would have a week to appeal to \n     a Justice Department administrative judge but no access to \n     real courts before deportation.\n       The bill would also go further than the recently adopted \n     welfare law in attacking legal immigrants. Under the \n     immigration bill they could be deported for using almost any \n     form of public assistance for a year, including English \n     classes. It would make family reunification more difficult by \n     requiring high incomes for sponsors of new immigrants. The \n     bill would also require workers who claim job discrimination \n     to prove that an employer intended to discriminate, which is \n     nearly impossible.\n       A bill that grants so many unrestricted powers to the \n     Government should alarm Republicans as well as Democrats. \n     This is not an immigration bill but an immigrant-bashing \n     bill. It deserves a quick demise.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will read the lead paragraph and the final paragraph.\n\n       As the White House and Members of Congress make final \n     decisions this week about a severely flawed immigration bill, \n     they seem more concerned with protecting their political \n     interests than the national interest. The bill should be \n     killed.\n       A bill that grants so much unrestricted powers to the \n     Government should alarm Republicans as well as Democrats. \n     This is not an immigration bill but an immigrant-bashing \n     bill. It deserves a quick demise.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Frahm). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10901-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10902-S10905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE DOLE ECONOMIC PLAN--IT DOESN'T ADD UP\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we are now about 7 weeks away from \ncritically important decisions about our country's future. We are 7 \nweeks away from the Presidential election--7 weeks away from decisions \non who will represent the United States in the Halls of Congress.\n  This election is becoming a debate on the economic policy that will \nguide this country's future. There can be no more important debate. For \na long time the conduct of economic policy in this country has been \ncentral to the question of who will guide our country in terms of \npolitical leadership.\n  Madam President, once before we had a Presidential candidate who told \nthe American people that we could cut taxes dramatically, we could \nincrease defense spending while holding large parts of the Federal \nbudget harmless, and that somehow it would all add up. We took that \ngamble once before. It didn't work. It didn't add up.\n  We can just go back to 1981, and administration of Ronald Reagan, \nwhen he told the American people we could have massive tax cuts, we \ncould increase defense spending, large parts of the Federal budget \nwould not be touched, and it would all add up. We can see what \nhappened.\n  President Reagan inherited a deficit of about $80 billion, but it \nquickly exploded to $200 billion a year. Then we had years of some \nsmall improvement, and years when the deficit jumped back up. But the \ndeficit was averaging over $200 billion. At the end of his term the \ndeficit declined slightly.\n  Then President Bush came into office. He inherited a deficit of $153 \nbillion, and it promptly skyrocketed to $290 billion in 1992. President \nClinton came into office at that point, and every year since the \nunified budget deficit has declined. Four years in a row the unified \ndeficit has gone down. It has now been reduced by 60 percent since \n1992.\n  So that is the record of the last three administrations with respect \nto deficit reduction.\n  Madam President, this chart shows that, even though we have made \nsignificant progress on reducing the budget deficit, if we do not keep \npressure on Federal spending and if we do not keep our eye on the need \nfor deficit reduction, very quickly we are going to see the deficit \nrise again. In fact, if no changes are made, the deficit from 1997 to \n2006 is going to start rising dramatically. This country faces a \ndemographic time bomb. It is called the baby-boom generation. When \nthose baby boomers start to retire in very short order they are going \nto double the number of people who are eligible for our basic Federal \nprograms--Social Security, Medicare. And that is going to put enormous \npressure on the Federal budget.\n  That is why it is critically important that we continue to keep our \neye on deficit reduction. That means we have to do more, even though \nwithout question much has been accomplished under the leadership of \nPresident Clinton. The deficit has come down dramatically. But even \nwith all the progress that has been made, much more needs to be done or \nthis problem once more will get away from us.\n\n  This next chart shows in a very clear way the challenge that we face \nover the next 6 years. This chart shows what the spending will be under \ncurrent law over the next 6 years--$11.3 trillion. That is what will \nhappen if no changes are made. And on the revenue side, if no changes \nare made, over the next 6 years we will get $9.9 trillion in Federal \nrevenue.\n  So we can see very clearly that we are going to be adding more than \n$1.4 trillion to the national debt over the next 6 years if we do \nnothing.\n  What does Senator Dole propose? Senator Dole suggests, looking at \nthese numbers--$11.3 trillion of spending, $9.9 trillion of revenue--\nthat the first thing we ought to do is cut our revenue. He says the \nfirst thing we ought to do is, since we are going to have $9.9 trillion \nof revenue, let us cut that $550 billion. Let us dig the hole deeper \nbefore we start filling it in. Madam President, it does not take any \ngreat mathematician to figure out, if we are going to add more than \n$1.4 trillion to the debt, if we do not make any changes, and the first \nchange Senator Dole wants to make is to cut our revenue $550 billion,\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nthat instead of adding to the debt by more than $1.4 trillion we are \ngoing to add more than $2 trillion to the debt under the Dole plan.\n  Madam President, this is important for people to understand. \nObviously, under the Dole plan we would add dramatically to the debt if \nwe didn't do something. Senator Dole has said that his plan is to \nbalance the budget by the year 2002.\n  Obviously, you would be adding to the debt held by the public until \nthe point in 2002 when you finally reach unified balance. And so the \ndebt would be increasing during this period, all the while we are \nmoving toward unified balance in 2002, according to his statement about \nhis plan.\n  So the question arises, how much do you need to cut the deficit in \norder to balance the unified budget by the year 2002? And we know the \nanswers to those questions. We know that under the 1997 budget \nresolution, Republicans needed to cut the deficit by $584 billion to \nbalance in the year 2002 the unified budget of the United States.\n  The unified budget is a big word. It is very simple what it means. It \nmeans all of the revenues and all of the expenditures of the Federal \nGovernment put into the same pot. That includes all of the Social \nSecurity surpluses that we will run over the next 6 years.\n  We need $584 billion of spending cuts in order to balance the unified \nbudget over the next 6 years. But Senator Dole digs the hole deeper \nbefore we start filling it in. He wants $550 billion of tax cuts that \nreduces our revenue. So instead of needing $584 billion of spending \ncuts, we now need $1.1 trillion of spending cuts. Of course, as I said \nbefore, that is to balance the so-called unified budget that counts all \nof the Social Security surpluses. And that is not really balancing the \nbudget.\n  If we were going to honestly balance the budget, we could not use \nthose Social Security surpluses. So if one does the appropriate \ncalculation, you can see we would need the $584 billion of spending \ncuts necessary to balance the unified budget, then we have to cover \nSenator Dole's $550 billion of tax cuts, and then we would need another \n$525 billion to stop using the Social Security surpluses, because under \nthe Dole plan every penny of Social Security surplus between now and \nthe year 2002 is going into the pot and is going to be used.\n  I call this a major problem with the Dole plan. Remember what we said \nhere. To balance, counting his tax cuts, we would need $1.1 trillion of \nspending cuts, and if we were going to honestly balance the budget, not \nuse the Social Security surpluses, we would need another $525 billion \nof cuts for a total of $1.6 trillion. So if we want to balance without \ncounting Social Security surpluses, counting Senator Dole's tax cuts, \nyou would need $1.6 trillion of cuts.\n  What has Senator Dole offered to us? What has he put on the table? \nHere are the numbers that Senator Dole has offered. He said he will \nstart with the 1997 GOP budget, that cuts discretionary spending $300 \nbillion. By the way, that is education, that is law enforcement, that \nis highways, that is bridges. He is going to cut that $302 billion for \nstarters. Medicare, $158 billion; Medicaid, $72 billion; other \nmandatory programs and interest, $174 billion, for a total of $706 \nbillion.\n  But remember, we said if you are going to balance this thing without \ncounting Social Security surpluses, you need $1.6 trillion--$1.6 \ntrillion. If you use the Social Security surpluses, you need $1.1 \ntrillion. So he is not even close here. So he has suggested another \n$217 billion of cuts. By the way, he has not told anybody the specifics \nof these cuts. He has not told us where they are coming from. He has \nnot told us what program he is going to cut to achieve this additional \n$200 billion. That will be, I guess, a secret plan. Maybe he will tell \nus after the election where that money is coming. But even with that, \nhe has got total cuts of $923 billion. Remember, if we are going to \nbalance and not count Social Security surpluses, we need $1.6 trillion. \nHe is nowhere close. To balance using Social Security surpluses you \nneed $1.1 trillion. He is not even close to that.\n  Madam President, this is what is wrong with the Dole economic plan. \nIt does not add up. It does not add up. The spending cuts are not \nenough to balance this budget, even on a unified basis. They are not \nenough to balance it even if he uses all $525 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  Now, why hasn't Senator Dole told us more specifically where the \nmoney is coming? I think the reason is that when you start getting into \nthe specifics, it does not make much sense to the American people.\n  Senator Dole is looking at the spending. This chart shows the Federal \nspending for the next 6 years. We are going to spend $2 trillion on \ninterest on the debt. We are going to spend $2.1 trillion on Social \nSecurity; $1.6 trillion on Medicare; defense, $1.7 trillion; $800 \nbillion on Medicaid; other entitlements, $1.4 trillion.\n  What are those other entitlements? Well, those are veterans' \nbenefits; those are Federal retirement benefits; those are food stamp \nprograms. That is the kind of thing we are talking about--child \nnutrition--in this category of spending. Then there is what we call \nnondefense discretionary. Nondefense discretionary, that is education, \nenvironmental enforcement, parks, roads, bridges, law enforcement.\n  However, Senator Dole has said we are not going to touch Social \nSecurity. So 19 percent of our spending is off the table. He has said \nwe are not going to cut defense. That is 15 percent. In fact, he said \nwe are going to increase defense spending. He says, of course, we \ncannot cut interest payments; that we legally owe. We cannot cut that.\n  In just those three areas, he has taken half of the spending off the \ntable, but he has not stopped there. He said, well, we are not going to \ncut veterans, not going to cut veterans. He said we are just going to \ncut Medicare by about 10 percent--$160 billion. And he says on \nnondefense discretionary, this is the one that is going to have to take \nthe big hit--the big hit.\n  Remember, he has about $900 billion of cuts. Almost $500 billion is \ngoing to have to come out of nondefense discretionary just on the cuts \nhe has identified. Remember, the cuts he has identified do not do the \njob. But he is going to take $500 billion out of discretionary spending \nof $1.7 trillion over the next 6 years. So he is going to have to cut \n30 percent. Education is going to have to be cut 30 percent; \nenvironmental enforcement is going to have to be cut 30 percent; parks, \nroads, airports, bridges. All of it is going to have to be cut 30 \npercent, and it still does not add up. It still does not balance. And \nyou know what? Law enforcement is going to have to be cut 30 percent \nunder the Dole plan. Those are the cuts he is going to have to make--\n$500 billion out of this little chunk of Federal spending. This is the \nplace he has targeted. This is the place he is going to take $500 \nbillion out of the $1.7 trillion we are scheduled to spend.\n  So, this is the place that is really getting targeted. Because for \nall the rest of the budget he is just going to cut a little bit, or, he \nhas said, he is not going to cut at all, or, he has said, he is going \nto increase. Madam President, there is no wonder this Dole plan does \nnot add up. No wonder it does not add up. Because this is where the \nmoney is going and he said huge chunks of it are off the table.\n  Here is where the money is going to come from, over the next 6 years: \nIndividual income taxes, about half of our income, 46 percent; \ncorporate taxes, 10 percent; Social Security, 26 percent; and other \nrevenue, 18 percent.\n  But let me just show kind of an interesting thing. Here is the \nrevenue from Social Security. Here is the spending for Social Security. \nYou notice something very interesting here--very interesting. They are \nnot the same size. These are all on the same scale but there is a \ndifference. Here is the revenue from Social Security: $2.6 trillion \nover the next 6 years. And here is the spending: $2.1 trillion over the \nnext 6 years. We have way more revenue from Social Security than we \nhave spending on Social Security. We have a difference of $500 billion \nover the next 6 years, $500 billion more in revenue for Social Security \nthan we have expense for Social Security. Where is it going? Where is \nit going? Because I have already showed you that we have more \nexpenditures planned over the next 6 years than we have revenue.\n  Madam President, I think we can see the $500 billion of Social \nSecurity surpluses that Senator Dole is going to use in his plan. \nAgain, I remind everyone who is listening, even with using that $500 \nbillion of Social Security surplus, every penny of it, his plan still\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\ndoes not balance, it still does not add up. But he is using it, $525 \nbillion. It is interesting, that $525 billion of Social Security \nsurpluses that are going to be used over the next 6 years is very close \nto the $551 billion of tax cuts that he has proposed. What earthly \nsense does this make? What earthly sense does this make? To take $525 \nbillion of Social Security surpluses that we get from payroll taxes, \nthat we ought to be saving for the time the baby boom generation \nretires, and turn around and give it out in tax cuts, when we are not \nbalancing the budget in any true sense over the next 6 years with this \neconomic plan?\n  You talk about a plan that is spending the money today and borrowing \nfrom the future; that is the Dole economic plan. It does not add up. It \ndoes not make sense. It digs a very deep hole for the economic future \nof our country.\n  Madam President, I think one reason Senator Dole has been reluctant \nto be more specific is because, when you start being specific, you see \nhow clearly the Dole plan does not add up. Let us just look at the \neducation cuts that would be necessary to finance the Dole tax cut. \nRemember, the GOP budget last year that was vetoed by the President and \nrejected by the American people had tax cuts of $245 billion. On \neducation, they cut $42 billion. I think that begs the question: What \nhappens when you have the Dole plan that has, instead of $245 billion \nof tax cuts, $550 billion of tax cuts? How much are you going to have \nto cut education then? How much is education going to have to be cut to \naccommodate a $550 billion tax cut?\n  The same can be asked of Medicare. Medicare--remember, the GOP budget \nlast year had tax cuts of $245 billion; the Medicare cuts were $270 \nbillion. Now Dole says he is going to have a $550 billion tax cut. How \nmuch would he have to cut Medicare in order to accommodate this plan?\n  This is where Dole has not been specific. Because, when you get into \nthe specifics, very quickly anybody who has been involved in these \nbudgets knows it does not add up.\n  Medicaid cuts necessary to finance the Dole tax cut? Last year, \nagain, GOP budget vetoed by the President, rejected by the American \npeople: $245 billion in tax cuts, Medicaid cuts were $163 billion. Now \nhe says we are going to have a $550 billion tax cut. How big would the \nMedicaid cuts be? How big would they have to be in order to finance \nthis plan?\n  Domestic discretionary spending: education, law enforcement, roads, \nhighways, bridges. Last year, the GOP plan, $245 billion of tax cuts, \ndomestic discretionary cuts $440 billion. With a $550 billion tax cut, \nhow big would the domestic discretionary cuts have to be in order to \nfinance the Dole plan? It does not add up.\n  Madam President, I hope I have been able to communicate that the Dole \nplan does not add up. There is no way there are enough spending cuts in \norder to balance the budget, even on a unified basis counting the \nSocial Security surpluses, and certainly nowhere near enough to balance \nit without using every penny of the Social Security surplus.\n  In addition to that, we have to look at the Dole tax cut and who \nbenefits. This chart shows the various income categories, who the big \nbeneficiaries are. For example, for those who earn less than $10,000 a \nyear, they get a $5 tax cut, on average; for those who are in the \n$10,000 to $20,000 category, they get $120, on average. For those who \nare in the $20,000 to $30,000 category, they get $400, on average. If \nyou start adding these up, zero to $10,000, that is 18 percent of the \nAmerican people; $10,000 to $20,000 is 21 percent; $20,000 to $30,000 \nis another 16 percent of the American people. If you add that up, it is \n55 percent of the American people get less than $400 a year, on \naverage, from this plan.\n  Look at what happens to those earning over $200,000 a year, the top 1 \npercent of people in this country. They would get an average benefit of \n$25,000. Does this strike you as fair? Does that strike you as a \nbalanced plan? I do not think so. I do not think it is fair when the \ntop 1 percent get a $25,000 reduction on average and the 55 percent of \nthe American people who are below $30,000 a year in income get from $5 \nto $400 a year. That is not a fair plan.\n  One of the things that is perhaps most shocking, as you start to \nreally look into the details of this Dole plan that has $500 tax credit \nfor children, what you find out is 40 percent of the children in \nAmerica do not qualify, they do not get anything. They do not get a \n$500 credit, they do not get a $400 credit, they do not get anything. \nThe reason is that their families do not have enough income to be \neligible. Because of other parts of the Dole plan, his reductions in \nthe earned-income tax credit, many families with child-care costs are \nnot going to get a cut; they are going to get an increase in their \ntaxes.\n  Thousands, millions of people in this country are not going to get a \ntax reduction under the Dole plan, they are going to get a tax increase \nunder the Dole plan, because a child care credit doesn't work for you \nunless you reached a certain income level, and he is cutting the earned \nincome tax credit.\n  Let's look at two examples. A two-parent family, four people in the \nfamily with an income of $21,500 and $400 a month in child care costs, \nunder current law they pay $172 in taxes. Under the Dole plan, they get \na whopping increase. They pay $609 in taxes. No tax cut under the Dole \nplan for these folks. They are getting a big tax increase. Interesting, \nisn't it?\n  If you are at the top, you are going to get the gravy under the Dole \nplan. If you are one of the fortunate few in America, the top 1 percent \nthat earns over $200,000 a year, you are going to get a $25,000 \nreduction on average. But if you are one of these folks earning $21,000 \na year, have children, have child care costs, under the Dole plan you \nare not going to get a tax cut, you are going to get a tax increase.\n  Under another example, a two-parent family with two children with \nincome of $25,000 and $400 a month in child care costs, under current \nlaw, they pay $1,176. Under the Dole plan, they would pay $1,734. Not a \nreduction, not a cut, but a big tax increase.\n  Madam President, this Dole plan doesn't add up any way you cut it. It \ndoesn't balance the budget. It doesn't have enough cuts to balance, \neven if he uses all the Social Security surpluses, and goodness knows, \nwe ought not to use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. \nThat is just mortgaging the future.\n  Interestingly enough, Bob Dole has always himself rejected the so-\ncalled supply-side economic theory. The supply-side theory is the one \nthat was in vogue in the 1980's. It is the one that led us into this \nswamp of debt and deficits in the first place.\n  Senator Dole, just last year, said this about supply-side economics. \nThis is Senator Dole. He said:\n\n       What I could never understand is why, if you just cut \n     taxes, you'd have this big, big revenue increase. You know, \n     more jobs, more opportunity. And you didn't have to make hard \n     choices about spending. That was the philosophy back in the \n     eighties, particularly with Newt and the House Republicans. \n     Don't make any painful decisions. Just cut taxes. In the \n     eighties, we said, ``Everything's going to be fine.'' Well, \n     it wasn't.\n\n  That is Senator Bob Dole 1 year ago. Bob Dole was right a year ago \nwhen he said this. Bob Dole was exactly right. And I return to where I \nstarted. This demonstrates how right he was last year and how wrong he \nis this year. Because now Bob Dole, finding himself 20 points behind in \nthe polls, all of a sudden is a born-again supply-side economist, \nbelieving in the tooth fairy, that somehow, somewhere the money will \nemerge.\n  Madam President, we tried that once before. We tried it back in 1981, \nand we know what the results were: the deficit skyrocketed--\nskyrocketed. It wasn't until President Clinton put in place an economic \nplan in 1993--an economic plan, by the way, that Senator Dole said \nwould crater the economy--that we saw 4 years in a row of declining \ndeficits, that we saw the country headed in the direction of a stronger \neconomy, that we finally saw America getting back on the right course \nwith dramatic deficit reduction, renewed economic growth, the creation \nof over 10 million jobs.\n  Madam President, we ought not to take the riverboat gamble of supply-\nside economics. That way lies a future of debt, deficits and decline.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I understand that Senator Heflin has the \nfloor for the next 10 minutes. I ask unanimous consent that I be able \nto speak as in morning business just for 1 minute.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, we have seen a lot of charts and \neverything. Here, again, we are scaring people. We are absolutely \nscaring people about things that, No. 1, President Clinton inherited a \ntrend that was already started; that we know that tax cuts put a spur \nin the economy and more revenues come into the Treasury.\n  I want to put everybody on notice about these scare things--what is \ngoing to happen, what might happen--that Americans don't back up very \nquickly; we don't scare very easy. We know we have a problem, and it \nwill take America to solve it. And this last illustration is absolutely \nbogus.\n  So I just want the American people to put them on notice that we \ndon't scare too easy. We didn't build this country to the pinnacle we \nhave today by backing up, going in reverse in this country. We are not \nprepared to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HON. MICHAEL JOPLING, D.L., M.P.\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Madam President, several of us in the U.S. Senate, as \nwell as some in the House of Representatives, have had the pleasure \nover the years of knowing and working with the Right Honorable Michael \nJopling, a British Member of Parliament and former Minister of \nAgriculture under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He has been a \nfamiliar and most welcome participant at both the North Atlantic \nAssembly sessions and at the British-American Interparliamentary Group \nmeetings in which some of us have participated. He is well respected by \nhis fellow Members of Parliament, both Conservative and Labour alike. \nMr. Jopling, whose retirement from the House of Commons is imminent \nafter close to 33 years in the Parliament, has served as secretary to \nthis important and engaging interparliamentary group for the past 9 \nyears and served the previous 4 years as its vice chairman. The \nposition of secretary is a most important responsibility, since that \nofficer is the chief liaison official with the American delegation. The \nsecretaries of the delegations make most of the logistical decisions. \nThe exchange plan he helped institute is an excellent program and \nvehicle for dealing with issues common to our two countries. He has \nreferred to his activities with the British-American group ``as a \nlabour of love'' and believes ``with a great deal of passion that the \ncontinued warm relationship between Britain and the United States is \ncrucial for world peace.''\n  Mr. Jopling was an outstanding and courageous Minister of \nAgriculture, Fisheries, and Food in the British government for two 4-\nyear periods between 1979 and 1987. Some of his policies angered \nBritish farmers, since he was appointed at a time when food surpluses \nunder the Common Agricultural Policy of Europe had reached very high \nlevels. It has been said that he was a victim of Jopling's law, which \nsays that whatever you do is going to be unpopular with the \nenvironmentalists for not going nearly far enough and with the farmers \nfor doing far too much. For those of us who serve on the Agriculture \nCommittee, Jopling's Law has particular resonance. Nevertheless, he \nstood firm and became a moving force during the 1980's for bringing the \nCommon Agricultural Policy of Europe under control. Under trying \ncircumstances, he endeavored to achieve a proper and reasonable balance \non these issues and always acted in a manner that served the public \ninterest. He was warmly praised and encouraged by former American \nSecretary of Agriculture Clayton Yeutter.\n  He also served as government chief whip. The government and the \nopposition in Parliament both appoint whips whose duty is to manage the \naffairs of the party and to organize their members to provide support. \nThe government chief whip is in charge of the important responsibility \nof arranging the scheduling of the government's business in the House \nof Commons. This is done in consultation with the opposition chief \nwhip.\n  In addition, he was assistant whip, spokesman on agriculture, deputy \nspokesman on agriculture, secretary of the conservative MPs' \nagriculture committee, and a member of the Select Committees on Science \nand Technology, Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, and Privileges. He was \nalso vice chairman of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, \nchairman of the Select Committee on Sittings of the Commons, and \npresident of the Auto Cycle Union.\n\n  Michael Jopling was born on December 10, 1930 in Ripon, Yorkshire. He \nwas educated at Cheltenham College; King's College, Newcastle-upon-\nTyne; and Durham University, where he earned a degree in agriculture. \nHe is a farmer, sharing a 500-acre farm in Thirsk, Yorkshire ``on some \nof the finest arable land in the country.'' He has also served as a \nconsultant to the Hill and Knowlton public relations firm.\n  Mr. Jopling represents Westmorland and Lonsdale, an area of Great \nBritain which is dominated by agriculture and tourism, with some light \nindustry. One British newspaper referred to it as ``a curious mixture \nof farmers in tweeds and sprightly geriatrics * * *'' While I do not \nthink of him as being ``geriatric,'' he certainly reflects the overall \nnature of his constituency. He has been called ``a farmer in politics \nrather than a politician who makes agriculture his specialty.'' He is \nknow as being likable, engaging, and affable. I have had the pleasure \non several occasions to swap humorous stories with him about the \npolitics, government, and cultural idiosyncracies of our respective \nnations. He is a practical joker who has said that ``riding a \nmotorcycle is one of the life's most exhilarating experiences.''\n  He is also a serious leader who pays close attention to the nuances \nof public policy and who judges by eye and instinct. His voice of \nreason at NAA meetings has helped guide favorably its deliberations and \nimproved its decisions.\n  He has always supported a strong national defense and strong NATO. He \noften criticized backsliders like Canada ``with its miserable 1.2 \npercent of GNP'' for defense expenditures. He also warned the British \ncabinet to take ``unpopular decisions, if necessary'' to ensure the \nArmy had the best tank possible.\n  His natural manner is one of caution, of getting all the facts before \nmaking a decision. He instinctively distrusts high-flown theory, \npreferring instead the directness of personal dialog and negotiation. \nHis height, square build, and rustic manner often conjure up the image \nof a genial giant, but his country gentleman appearance often masks his \nshrewdness, keen sense of politics, and anayltically sharp mind. All \nthese traits come together to give him an unusual ability to take the \nfull measure of a person, situation, or piece of legislation \nobjectively, but always with an eye toward accomplishing his goals.\n  I am pleased to commend and congratulate the Right Honourable Michael \nJopling for his outstanding leadership and dedication as a Member of \nthe British Parliament and as a British good-will ambassador at-large. \nI wish him, as well as his red-haired, beautiful, and talented wife, \nGail Dickinson Jopling, all the best as he approaches retirement. He \ndeserves our profound thanks for his many lasting contributions over \nthe years to British-American relations in general and for his personal \ncommitment to preserving the special nature of the relationship between \nour two great nations. After he leaves government service, I hope he \nwill continue to use his enormous talents and energies to benefit \nBritish-American relations.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise today to speak about an issue that \nhas been bothering me for some time. As this Congress begins to wind \ndown, I have reflected on the achievements and the failures during the \npast 2 years of this Congress. As I look back on the 104th Congress, I \nam struck by the public's negative perception, not only of this \nCongress, but our Government, our Federal Government. In my 10 years \nhere in the Senate, I cannot recall a time when the American public had \nsuch a low regard for our Federal Government. It seems like our \nperception of Government in this country has gone from a view where all \nthings are possible to a view by many where all things are suspect.\n  There has always been in this country a healthy tradition of \npolitical dissent, but what I am hearing today is something deeper and \nmore negative than that. This troubles me because I hear it being \nechoed in the State of Nevada even by young people, the very generation \nwho will lead us into the next century. I am not willing to stand by \nand watch an entire generation of Nevadans grow up distrusting our \nGovernment. The future, I believe, of Nevada, and our Nation, depends \non this next generation's youthful energy and natural optimism to carry \nus forward.\n  So I would like to spend a little time today--and I will in the \nfuture--talking about how Government works for each of us. I think it \nis important to take a few minutes to remember how Government has \nchanged our lives for the better. There are many areas about which we \ncould speak, but today I am going to talk about our National Park \nSystem, which I personally am very proud of. I think all of us in \nAmerica should be rightfully proud.\n  In the late 1700's and the early part of the 1800's, hunters and \ntrappers would come back from passing through Yellowstone with \nincredible tales of soaring mountains, steaming lakes, of spouts of \nwater going into the air hundreds of feet, stories that many people \nbelieved were untrue. But, of course, they were true.\n  In PBS's recent production on the West, ``The Making of the West,'' \nthere is a great story in the first couple of series about a mountain \nman by the name of Joe Mink, who came through Yellowstone, and some of \nthe stories that he told.\n  Many stories were told about this great area in our country. These \nstories were passed on, some not believing them, as I mentioned, some \nthinking that they were nothing more than tall tales started by native \nAmericans and then passed on by hunters and trappers.\n  But the stories persisted. Finally, expedition parties were sent out \nto check the stories about Yellowstone. One such expedition journeyed \nthere to report back what they felt should be done with Yellowstone. \nWhat these men found there awed and really humbled them. At their \ncampsite near the Madison River, members of the expedition party talked \nabout what they had seen. Maybe the land, they said, could be mined, \nand surely a few fortunes could be made harvesting timber. The \npossibilities of development really seemed endless.\n  But a member of that expedition by the name of Cornelius Hedges, who \nwas a Montana judge, had a different idea. There are a lot of fathers \nof our National Park System. Cornelius Hedges is one of those fathers. \nHe thought that the land should be preserved as a national park, a word \nthat was unheard of at the time.\n  The expedition returned and began to promote the idea that Hedges \nhad. In 1872 this dream came to fruition when Congress established \nYellowstone National Park. In 1916 the National Park Service was \nestablished by Congress. Today, 80 years after the birth of the \nNational Park Service, there are more than 270 million visitors to our \nnational parks. Of course, some people visit parks more than once.\n  Madam President, I read in this morning's paper about President \nClinton yesterday being at the Grand Canyon. During his presentation \nyesterday at the Grand Canyon, he talked about an event that really \nchanged his life. That was a time when as a young man he went to the \nGrand Canyon and spent 2 hours sitting in solitude, looking at this \npiece of nature. He said even today in his hustle and bustle world he \nis able to reflect back on the solitude that he experienced at Grand \nCanyon National Park.\n\n  I, too, a little over a year ago had the good fortune of traveling \ndown the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon. It was a life-\nchanging experience for me, also, as it has been for thousands and \nthousands and thousands of people over the years who have gone through \nthis, one of our national parks, the Grand Canyon.\n  This year Nevada is celebrating the 10th anniversary of our only \nnational park, the Great Basin National Park. This incredible wonder in \nNevada is home to the southernmost glacier in all of America. Yes, a \nglacier in Nevada--incredible, but true. The oldest living thing in the \nworld is in this national park, the bristlecone pine, a tree that is \ngnarled, and some say not statuesque like a lot of big green trees that \nwe see. It is over 5,000 years old. Madam President, 2,500 years before \nthe birth of Christ these trees were growing in the Great Basin \nNational Park.\n  We have many other things that will cause one to wonder other than \nthese twisted limbs of the bristlecone pine in Great Basin National \nPark, but it is something that we in Nevada are proud of and the entire \nNation is proud of. This 77,000-acre park was visited last year by \nabout 100,000 people. You do not have to be rich to take in the wonders \nof the Grand Canyon. You do not have to be rich to take in the wonders \nof Yellowstone or Great Basin.\n  Our National Park System is designed for everyone. It is something \nthat we as a country should be very proud of and we are. You can travel \nthe depths of the Earth to see the incredible wonders of Lehman Cave, \nalso part of our great national park. This jewel, the Great Basin \nNational Park, will be there for centuries to come, as will Grand \nCanyon, as will Yellowstone.\n  I have talked today, Madam President, about one example of about \nwhere I think Government has worked well for the people of this country \nin establishing our National Park System. Now, this is something, our \nNational Park System, that we should all speak proudly of, positively \nof, and it is a function where Government has worked well. Instead of \ndenigrating Government, we should work to improve our system of \nGovernment that is the envy of the world. Our National Park System is \nthe envy of the world.\n  Unquestionably, the Federal Government needs to streamline, reform, \nand change. Burdens of regulations of unfunded mandates must be \neliminated, and ridiculous paperwork requirements must be eliminated, \nalso. However, Government oversight is not innately evil and can be \ndesigned not as an intrusive control mechanism over the States but as \nan insurance policy to guard against Americans falling through the \ncracks. Our goal should be for a more effective Federal Government, not \none that is useless or so reduced that our citizens are the ones to \nsuffer. As a nation, we cannot afford to have a Federal Government that \nis unable to provide for Americans to defend our interests in the \nworld.\n  Madam President, I ask that we all reflect on a success that we have \nhad as a Federal Government. That is, in establishing and maintaining \nour National Park System. Of course, we need to do more. We have a \ntremendous backlog of renovations and repairs that need to be made in \nour National Park System, but visiting a national park is an experience \nof a lifetime. It was for me as it has been for millions of other \nAmericans.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

The pending question is the \nHutchison amendment, No. 5383. There will be 4 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, on the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, while we are waiting the manager on the \nDemocratic side, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Was the managers' amendment that was adopted last evening printed in \nthe Record?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is. It is on page S10844.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of \nthe managers' amendment be printed in the Record at this point, and \nthat it be printed in the permanent Record following the managers' \namendment of yesterday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Summary of Manager's Amendment to S. 39\n\n\n                     authorization of appropriation\n\n       The manager's amendment authorizes appropriations through \n     fiscal year (FY) 1999 for the purposes of carrying out the \n     Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1801 et seq.).\n\n\n                              definitions\n\n       The amendment defines a number of new terms for the \n     proposes of the Magnuson Act and amends a number of existing \n     definitions. New defined terms include: ``bycatch''; \n     ``charter fishing''; ``commercial fishing''; ``economic \n     discards''; ``essential fish habitat''; ``fishing \n     community''; ``individual fishing quota''; ``overfishing''; \n     ``Pacific Insular areas''; ``recreational fishing''; \n     ``regulatory discards''; ``special areas''; and ``vessel \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.'' The \n     amendment amends the existing definition of ``optimum'' with \n     respect to the yield of fishery to mean the amount of fish \n     prescribed on the basis of the maximum sustainable yield ``as \n     reduced'' (rather than ``as modified'') by any relevant \n     economic, social, or ecological factor. This change prevents \n     the maximum sustainable yield of a fishery from being \n     exceeded.\n\n\n                           bycatch reduction\n\n       The amendment adds a new national standard to the Magnuson \n     Act requiring that, to the extent practicable, conservation \n     and management measures minimize bycatch and minimize the \n     mortality of bycatch that cannot be avoided. The amendment \n     specifically requires the Councils to establish standard \n     reporting methods under fishery management plans to assess \n     the amount and type of bycatch occurring in each fishery, and \n     to include measures to minimize bycatch to the maximum extent \n     they can, and to minimize the mortality of bycatch that \n     cannot be avoided in the first place. The amendment provides \n     the Councils with the new tools of harvest preferences and \n     other harvest incentives to achieve this bycatch reduction. \n     In addition, the amendment requires the Councils to assess \n     the type and amount of fish being caught and released alive \n     in recreational fisheries, and include measures to ensure the \n     extended survival of such fish.\n       The amendment requires the Secretary of State to seek to \n     secure international agreements for bycatch standards and \n     measures equivalent of those of the United States.\n       The amendment requires the North Pacific Council, in \n     carrying out the new bycatch requirements, to reduce the \n     total amount of bycatch occurring in the North Pacific, and \n     authorizes the North Pacific Council to use, in addition to \n     harvest preferences or other harvest incentives, fines and \n     non-transferable annual allocations of regulatory discards \n     as incentives to reduce bycatch and bycatch rates. The \n     amendment requires the North Pacific Council to submit a \n     report on the advisability of requiring the full retention \n     and full utilization of the economic discards in the North \n     Pacific that cannot be avoided in the first place. The \n     Council must report on any measures it already has \n     approved, or approves during the period of the study, to \n     require full retention or full utilization, and is not \n     meant to preclude the Council from taking all actions that \n     it can to achieve these goals.\n       The amendment requires the Secretary to conclude within \n     nine months the collection of data in the program to assess \n     the impact on fishery resources of incidental harvest by \n     shrimp trawl fisheries, and to conduct additional data \n     collection and evaluation activities for stocks identified by \n     the program which are considered to be overfished. Within 12 \n     months of enactment, the Secretary must complete a program to \n     develop technology, devices, and changes in fishing \n     operations necessary to minimize the incidental mortality of \n     bycatch in the course of shrimp trawl activity to the extent \n     practicable as measured against the level of mortality which \n     occurred in a fishery before November 28, 1990. Any measures \n     taken are required to be consistent with measures that are \n     applicable to fishing throughout the range within the United \n     States by the bycatch species.\n\n\n                              overfishing\n\n       The amendment defines ``overfishing'' to mean a rate or \n     level of fishing mortality that jeopardizes the capacity of a \n     fishery to produce the maximum sustainable yield on a \n     continuing basis. It requires the Councils to specify, in \n     each FMP, criteria for determining when a fishery is \n     overfished and to include measures to rebuild any overfished \n     fishery. It also requires the Secretary to report annually to \n     Congress and the Councils on the status of fisheries, and to \n     identify fisheries that are overfished or approaching a \n     condition of being overfished using the Council's overfishing \n     criteria. The Secretary is required to notify the Council \n     immediately if a fishery is overfished.\n       Within one year of the Secretary's annual report, the \n     appropriate Council must submit an FMP, amendment or \n     regulation to prevent overfishing in fisheries determined to \n     be approaching that condition, and to stop overfishing and \n     begin to rebuild fisheries classified as overfished. For an \n     overfished fishery, the Councils must specify as short a time \n     period as possible to stop the overfishing, taking into \n     account the harvest status and biology of the overfished \n     stock, the needs of fishing communities, recommendations by \n     international organizations in which the United States \n     participates, and interaction between the stock and the \n     ecosystem. The duration cannot exceed 10 years except under \n     extraordinary circumstances. The Secretary is required to \n     prepare an FMP or amendment if a Council fails to take \n     sufficient action within one year on an FMP, amendment or \n     regulations to rebuild an overfished fishery. The amendment \n     allows the Secretary to recommend appropriate measures to the \n     Council, and requires that the allocation of both \n     overfishing restrictions and recovery benefits be fairly \n     and equitably distributed among sectors of the fishery.\n       The manager's amendment allows the Secretary to use interim \n     authority to reduce overfishing for up to 180 days, with one \n     additional 180 day period, provided that a public comment \n     period on the measure is provided.\n\n\n                           habitat protection\n\n       The amendment defines ``essential fish habitat'' for the \n     purposes of the Magnuson Act as ``waters and substrate \n     necessary to fish for spawning, breeding, or growth to \n     maturity.'' It requires the Councils to identify essential \n     fish habitat under each FMP, to minimize, where practicable, \n     adverse impacts on the habitat caused by fishing, and to \n     identify actions that should be considered to encourage the \n     conservation and enhancement of essential fish habitat. The \n     Secretary is required to establish guidelines to assist the \n     Councils in describing and identifying essential fish habitat \n     and to review programs administered by the Department of \n     Commerce to ensure they further the conservation and \n     enhancement of essential fish habitat. Federal agencies are \n     required to consult with the Secretary with respect to any \n     action authorized, funded or proposed to be undertaken that \n     may adversely affect any essential fish habitat identified \n     under the Magnuson Act.\n       The amendment authorizes the Councils (similar to existing \n     law) to comment on and make recommendations to the Secretary \n     and other Federal or State agencies on any agency actions \n     that may affect habitat, including essential fish habitat, \n     and requires the Councils to comment on and make \n     recommendations on agency activities that in the view of the \n     Council are likely to substantially affect the habitat, \n     including essential fish habitat, of an anadromous fishery \n     resource.\n       Upon notification of any action authorized, funded, \n     undertaken, or proposed to be authorized, funded, or \n     undertaken by a Federal agency that may adversely affect \n     essential fish habitat, the Secretary is required to \n     recommend measures that can be taken to conserve the habitat. \n     Federal agencies must respond in writing to such \n     recommendations, and explain reasons for not following any \n     recommendations.\n\n\n                             council reform\n\n       The amendment requires Council members to recuse themselves \n     from voting on Council decisions that would have a \n     ``significant and predictable effect'' on their financial \n     interests. Such a decision is defined as one where there is \n     ``a close causal link between the Council decision and an \n     expected and substantially disproportionate benefit to the \n     financial interest of the affected individual relative to the \n     financial interests of other participants in the same gear \n     type or sector of the fishery.'' This language is intended to \n     prevent Council members from voting on decisions that \n     would bring substantially disproportionate financial \n     benefits to themselves, but not to prevent Council members \n     from voting on most matters on which they have expertise.\n       The Secretary, in consultation with the Council, is \n     required to select a ``designated official'' with Federal \n     conflict-of-interest experience to attend Council meetings \n     and make determinations on conflicts of interest. The \n     determinations will occur at the request of the affected \n     Council member or at\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\n     the initiative of the designated official. Any Council member \n     may request a review by the Secretary of a determination. \n     Regulations for the recusal process are required to be \n     promulgated by the Secretary within one year of enactment.\n       The amendment adds an additional seat to the Pacific \n     Council for Pacific Northwest Indian tribes, to be selected \n     by the Secretary from a list of 3 individuals from tribes \n     with Federally recognized fishing rights. The amendment adds \n     two additional seats to the Mid-Atlantic Council to provide \n     representation for the State of North Carolina.\n       The amendment requires the Councils to keep detailed \n     minutes of meetings. It also allows any voting member of the \n     Council to request that a matter be decided by roll call \n     vote, and requires all roll call votes to be identified in \n     the Council's minutes. All written data submitted to the \n     Council are required to include a statement of the \n     information's source. The reported bill allows the Councils \n     (and the Secretary with respect to Atlantic highly migratory \n     species) to establish fishery negotiation panels to assist in \n     the development of difficult conservation and management \n     measures.\n\n\n                        fishery management plans\n\n       The amendment simplifies the review process by the \n     Secretary of proposed FMPs and amendments submitted by the \n     Councils, and includes a new section addressing proposed \n     regulations submitted by the Councils. It eliminates the \n     preliminary FMP evaluation required under current law. After \n     transmittal of an FMP or amendment by the Council to the \n     Secretary, the Secretary immediately must publish notice of \n     the plan in the Federal Register and provide a 60-day comment \n     period. The Secretary must approve, partially approve, or \n     disapprove a plan within 30 days of the end of the comment \n     period.\n       The amendment creates a new framework for the Secretary to \n     review proposed regulations from the Councils and allows the \n     Councils to submit proposed regulations simultaneously with \n     an FMP or amendment, or at any time after an FMP or amendment \n     has been approved. The Secretary has 15 days to review \n     proposed regulations for their consistency with an FMP. If \n     they are consistent, regulations must be published in the \n     Federal Register for a comment period of 15 to 60 days. The \n     Secretary must publish final regulations within 30 days of \n     the end of the comment period.\n       The amendment requires the Councils to describe the \n     commercial, recreational, and charter fishing occurring in \n     each fishery and to allocate any harvest restrictions or \n     recovery benefits fairly and equitably among these three \n     sectors. The amendment codifies existing authority of the \n     Councils to restrict the sale of fish for conservation and \n     management purposes, including to ensure that any fish that \n     is sold complies with federal and state safety and quality \n     requirements.\n\n\n                       Individual Fishing Quotas\n\n       The amendment prevents Councils from submitting and the \n     Secretary from approving or implementing any new individual \n     fishing quota (IFQ) programs until after September 30, 2000, \n     and directs the National Academy of Sciences, in consultation \n     with the Secretary, Councils, and others, to submit a \n     comprehensive report on IFQs to the Congress by October 1, \n     1998.\n       The Academy report must address, among other things, IFQ \n     transferability, foreign ownership, processor quotas, \n     effective IFQ enforcement, IFQ auctions, windfall profits, \n     and potential economic impacts including capital gains \n     revenue. The report must additionally analyze IFQ programs \n     already in existence in the United States (wreckfish, surf \n     clam/ocean quahog, and halibut/sablefish), IFQs outside the \n     United States, and characteristics unique to IFQs as well as \n     alternative measures that accomplish the same objectives as \n     IFQs. Two working groups (West Coast/Alaska/Hawaii and East \n     Coast/Gulf) will assist in preparing the report. After \n     September 30, 2000, in the event that amendments to the \n     Magnuson Act have not been adopted to implement a national \n     IFQ policy, the councils will be allowed to submit new IFQ \n     programs to the Secretary following certain guidelines.\n       The amendment requires the Secretary to establish a fee of \n     up to three percent of the annual ex-vessel value of fish \n     harvested under IFQ programs to pay for management costs. The \n     surf clam/ocean quahog and wreckfish IFQ fisheries will not \n     begin paying fees until January 1, 2000. The amendment allows \n     the Councils to reserve up to 25 percent of these fees be \n     used for loan obligations for IFQs for small vessel fishermen \n     and entry level fishermen. The North Pacific Council is \n     required to reserve the full 25 percent for such a program in \n     the halibut and sablefish fisheries.\n       The amendment requires the Secretary to collect a fee under \n     the authority of a new section 304(d)(2)(A)(i) to recover the \n     actual costs directly related to the management and \n     enforcement of any IFQ program, including any program that \n     may be created under section 313(g)(2) in the North Pacific \n     to reduce per vessel bycatch and bycatch rates. It is \n     expected that the fee collected under any program created \n     under section 313(g)(2) would not exceed one percent of the \n     estimated annual value of the target species in the fishery \n     in which the program is created.\n\n\n                           state jurisdiction\n\n       The manager's amendment restates in greater detail existing \n     law with respect to a state's ability to regulate fishing \n     vessels registered in that state in federal waters. It allows \n     states to regulate all fishing vessels in a fishery in the \n     EEZ off that State if a fishery management plan delegates \n     such authority to the State. Further, it allows the State of \n     Alaska to regulate fishing vessels not registered under \n     Alaska laws in the EEZ off Alaska if there is no fishery \n     management plan in place for a fishery, and allows the states \n     of California, Oregon and Washington to enforce certain state \n     laws in the EEZs off their respective coasts with respect to \n     dungeness crab fishing until October 1, 1999, or if a fishery \n     management plan for that species is implemented.\n\n\n                             lien registry\n\n       The amendment requires the Secretary to establish a central \n     registry system for limited access permits (including IFQ \n     permits), 6 months after the enactment of the Act, and \n     requires the Secretary to charge a fee of not more than one \n     half of one percent of the value of a permit upon \n     registration and transfer to pay for the system. The \n     amendment requires the Secretary to determine whether the \n     Secretary of the Treasury has placed any liens against \n     limited access system permits and to provide this information \n     to both the buyer and seller of any permit before collecting \n     a fee on the transfer of a permit. Consistent with the \n     requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury may withdraw a notice of lien filed \n     against a limited access system permit if the withdrawal will \n     facilitate the collection of a tax liability by allowing the \n     owner of the permit to derive income from the use of the \n     permit. The amendment establishes a Limited Access System \n     Administration Fund in the Treasury. Funds from this fund are \n     available without appropriation to the Secretary to \n     administer the central lien registry system and manage the \n     fishery in which IFQ fees were collected. Any fees collected \n     on the ex-vessel value of the fish harvested under an IFQ \n     system can be spent only in the fishery in which they were \n     collected.\n\n\n                      pacific community fisheries\n\n       The amendment requires the North Pacific Council and \n     Secretary to establish a western Alaska community development \n     quota (CDQ) program under which a percentage of the total \n     allowable catch of each Bering Sea fishery is allocated to \n     western Alaska communities that participate in the program. \n     The amendment prevents the North Pacific Council from \n     increasing the percentage of any CDQ allocation approved by \n     the Council prior to October 1, 1995 until after September \n     30, 2001. The amendment includes a sentence at the end of a \n     new section 305(i)(1)(C)(i) making clear that this cap \n     through September 30, 2001 does not prevent the extension of \n     the pollock CDQ allocation beyond 1998. In complying with the \n     western Alaska CDQ requirement, a percentage of the pollock \n     fishery (and each Bering Sea fishery) must be allocated to \n     the program every year. In the event that the North \n     Pacific Council fails to submit an extension of the \n     pollock CDQ in 1998, it is the intent that the Secretary \n     continue to allocate to the western Alaska CDQ program the \n     percentage of pollock approved by the Council for previous \n     years until the Council submits an extension.\n       The Council retains the ability to revise CDQ allocations, \n     except as provided in the amendment for crab fisheries, \n     provided that the allocations not exceed the levels approved \n     by the Council prior to October 1, 1995 (after September 30, \n     2001, the Councils retains the full ability to revise CDQ \n     allocations). The Secretary is required to phase in the CDQ \n     percentage already approved by the North Pacific Council for \n     the Bering crab fisheries, allocating 3.5 percent in 1998, 5 \n     percent in 1999 and 7.5 percent in 2000 and thereafter, \n     unless the Council submits a percentage no greater than 7.5 \n     percent for 2001 or any other percentage on or after October \n     1, 2001. CDQ allocations already approved by the Council \n     (pollock, halibut, sablefish, crab and groundfish) do not \n     need to be resubmitted by the Council or reapproved (if \n     already approved) by the Secretary.\n       The amendment requires the National Academy of Sciences to \n     submit a report to Congress on the performance and \n     effectiveness of the community development quota programs \n     under the authority of the North Pacific Council. The \n     amendment requires CDQ fees collected by the Secretary to be \n     reduced by the amount of costs imposed on CDQ program \n     participants that are not imposed on other participants in \n     the fishery. The Secretary is required to transfer to the \n     State of Alaska up to 33 percent of any CDQ fees to reimburse \n     the State for its costs in the CDQ program.\n       The amendment authorizes the Western Pacific Council to \n     establish a western Pacific community development program. It \n     additionally authorizes the Secretary and Secretary of \n     Interior to make direct grants, not to exceed a total of \n     $500,000 annually, to eligible western Pacific communities to \n     establish from three to five fishery demonstration projects \n     which foster and promote the involvement of western Pacific \n     communities.\n\n\n                       Reducing Fishing Capacity\n\n       The amendment authorizes the Secretary to implement a \n     vessel and/or permit buyout program at the request of a \n     Council (or Governor for a fishery under a State's authority) \n     if adequate steps are taken to ensure that vessels and \n     permits are removed permanently and the program is needed for \n     conservation and management. Eligible funding sources could \n     include Saltonstall-Kennedy funds, funds appropriated for the \n     purpose of\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n     the buyout section, funds provided by an industry fee system \n     (which cannot exceed 5 percent of the ex-vessel value of fish \n     harvested), of funds provided by a State or other source. The \n     amendment authorizes the Secretary to provide direct loan \n     obligations of up to $100 million per fishery to finance \n     buyout programs, which must be paid back over a twenty year \n     period. Any catch history must be forfeited by the owner \n     of a vessel or permit that is purchased under a buyout \n     program.\n\n\n                       fisheries disaster relief\n\n       At the discretion of the Secretary or at the request of an \n     affected state or fishing community, the Secretary must \n     determine whether a commercial fishery failure has occurred, \n     caused by natural causes; man-made causes beyond the control \n     of a Council; or undetermined causes. If the Secretary \n     determines that a commercial fishery failure has occurred, \n     the Secretary may make funds available to an affected State, \n     fishing community or other activity the Secretary determines \n     appropriate to restore the fishery or prevent a similar \n     failure in the future. The Federal share of the cost of any \n     activity under the authority of the section cannot exceed 75 \n     percent of the total cost. The amendment authorizes such sums \n     as are necessary for each fiscal year for fisheries disaster \n     relief.\n\n\n                                research\n\n       The amendment creates a new title IV of the Magnuson Act, \n     titled ``Fishery Monitoring and Research'' that contains \n     existing Magnuson sections (with some modifications) dealing \n     with information collection, confidentiality, fisheries \n     research, shrimp trawl incidental harvest research, \n     observers. It also contains new sections dealing with vessel \n     registration, and the creation of an advisory panel to \n     develop recommendations to expand the application of \n     ecosystem principles in fishery conservation and management \n     activities. The amendment requires the National Academy of \n     Sciences to complete a peer review of the Northeast \n     Multispecies Fishery Management Plan by February 1, 1997.\n\n\n                          vessel registration\n\n       The amendment requires the Secretary to develop \n     recommendations for implementation of a standardized vessel \n     registration and data management system, centralized on a \n     regional basis, that would be required to integrate and \n     standardize all federal marine resource vessel registration \n     and data collection requirements, as well as State \n     requirements if a State chooses to participate. The system \n     must avoid duplication with any existing State or other \n     systems. Within 16 months of the date of enactment, and after \n     providing for public comment, the Secretary must transmit the \n     proposal to Congress. Within 15 months of enactment, the \n     Secretary must report to Congress on the need to include \n     private recreational fishing vessels in a national fishing \n     vessel registration and data collection system.\n\n\n                               observers\n\n       The Secretary is required to promulgate regulations for \n     vessels required to carry observers, including guidelines to \n     determine when the facilities of a vessel are not safe or \n     adequate for an observer, or how to reasonably make them safe \n     or adequate. The Secretary also must establish, in \n     cooperation with States and Sea Grant College Programs, \n     programs to train and ensure the competence of observers. The \n     Secretary is required to use university training facilities, \n     such as the North Pacific Observer Training Center, where \n     possible, to carry out the observer section. The amendment \n     treats observers as Federal employees for the purposes of \n     compensation under the Federal Employee Compensation Act. \n     Data collectors are protected from being forcibly assaulted, \n     impeded, intimidated, sexually harassed, interfered with, or \n     bribed, while carrying out responsibilities under the \n     Magnuson Act.\n\n\n                         other reauthorizations\n\n       The amendment extends the authorization of appropriations \n     for several other marine statutes, including the Inter \n     Jurisdictional Fisheries Act, the Atlantic Coastal \n     Cooperative Fisheries Management Act, the Anadromous Fish \n     Conservation Act and an authorization for other NOAA marine \n     fisheries programs. The amendment requires the Secretary to \n     submit a report reviewing New England fishing capacity \n     reduction programs.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5383, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 5383), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 142, line 7, strike ``Any'' before ``conservation'' \n     and insert in lieu thereof ``To the extent practicable, \n     any''.\n       On page 148, beginning on line 14, strike ``specified in \n     part 641.24 and 641.25 of title 50, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as revised as of October 1, 1995),''.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I don't even need to take my 2 \nminutes. I will just say that this amendment has been agreed to by both \nsides. I want to especially thank Senators Lott, Stevens, Breaux, and \nKerry for helping me to make sure that the management of bycatch \napplies in the Gulf of Mexico like it will apply to the rest of the \nbill and to the other waters contiguous to our country. Everybody is \nsatisfied with this.\n  I appreciate so much the cooperation and the staff cooperation. We \ncould not have come to this agreement without a lot of hard work late \nlast night and early this morning. I appreciate it very much. I ask for \nconsideration of my amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas is correct. I am \ninformed that this matter was worked out. I should explain to the \nSenate that we had in the managers' amendment one amendment--the one \nfrom the Senator from Texas--that could not be agreed to at the time we \noffered that amendment last night. We pulled it out and asked unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from Texas be able to offer her amendment. It \nhas now been worked out through the night. I am informed by the leader, \nand by the representatives of the other Senators involved, that it is \nacceptable. Therefore, I am prepared to accept this amendment and would \nask that it be adopted on a voice vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise this morning in support of the \nHutchison-Shelby amendment to S. 39, the Sustainable Fisheries Act.\n  Over the past several years, it has become increasingly clear that \nour marine fisheries are in serious trouble. The Sustainable Fisheries \nAct will significantly improve the management and conservation of our \nmarine resources by allowing the regional councils to adopt measures to \nreduce overfishing, bycatch, and waste.\n  What is clear to all who have been involved in the reauthorization of \nthe Magnuson Act is that decisionmaking authority over the adoption and \nimplementation of bycatch reduction programs must lie with the \ncouncils. For the most part, the bill before us today furthers this \ninsight. However, there is a provision which will significantly impair \nthe authority of one of the councils, the Gulf Council, to manage the \nbycatch program of the red snapper.\n  The Hutchison-Shelby amendment corrects this oversight and restores \nthe necessary discretion to the Gulf Council. I want to be clear that \nwe are not adding additional powers. Our amendment merely brings the \nGulf Council in line with the authority of the other regional councils.\n  Without the Hutchison-Shelby amendment, the red snapper fishery will \nbe closed, which will shut down recreational fishermen and a thriving \ncharter boat industry. In the city of Gulf Shores alone, red snapper \nfishing generates approximately $80 million annually. Salt water \nfishing in my State will soon become a billion dollar industry, and \nlimiting the authority of the Gulf Council to manage these waters will \ndevastate the economy of Alabama.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas for her leadership on this important \nissue, and I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5383), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shelby from \nAlabama be added as a prime cosponsor of my amendment to this bill, to \nthe managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as I make clear my strong support for S. \n39, I also extend my congratulations to the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska [Mr. Stevens] and to his fine staff for their efforts in \ncrafting S. 39, the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. This legislation \nstrikes an appropriate balance between the needs of the various sectors \nof the U.S. fishing community while giving both commercial and \nrecreational fishermen adequate opportunities to fish.\n  S. 39 is exceedingly important to our fishermen in North Carolina. I \nwas very pleased last July when Senator\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\nStevens and I flew together to eastern North Carolina to hold hearings \nin Morehead City on this legislation. We heard many concerns and \nopinions from all sectors of the fishing community in my State. I \nappreciate Ted Stevens making the trip and also his allowing me to \nparticipate in those hearings.\n  Mr. President, testimony in that hearing indicated widespread support \nfor adding North Carolina as a voting member on the Mid-Atlantic \nFishery Management Council. My State has long participated in council \nproceedings as an observer and as nonvoting participant in council \ntechnical committees--but never before as a full-fledged voting member.\n  So I am grateful that this legislation allots to North Carolina \nvoting memberships on the Mid-Atlantic Council. There have been so many \ndecisions made by the Mid-Atlantic Council that have affected my \nfishermen; it is good that they will now be able to vote on decisions \nthat affect our State.\n  Fish and fish products have become a greater staple of the diets of \nall Americans. Statistics gathered by the National Marine Fisheries \nService in 1995, revealed that U.S. consumption of fish and fish \nproducts was 15 pounds of edible meat per capita. In 1992 Americans \nconsumed 14.8 pounds of edible meat.\n  Mr. President, I greatly enjoy seafood. I have dined in many seafood \nrestaurants in coastal North Carolina and many fish houses further \ninland. North Carolinians want to maintain a steady supply of good, \nhigh-quality seafood well into the future. We can do that if our \nfishery resources are well managed in an environmentally responsible \nmanner.\n  At the same time, fishery regulations must not be allowed to \nhamstring North Carolina's hand-working, tax-paying fishermen in their \nefforts to earn a honest daily wage. The National Marine Fisheries \nService should be put on notice that the Congress will not tolerate \nunfair and unreasonable regulatory practices that single out one sector \nof the fishing community for penalties.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. We must preserve our fisheries \nfor future generations. If we don't, this country will face great \nadverse consequences.\n  None of us here wants to see entire areas closed to fishing, as has \noccurred off the coast of Massachusetts. Senators from that State are \npainfully aware that three areas near Georges Bank have been \npermanently closed to fishing, due to overfishing the resource. That \nsituation must not be duplicated off the North Carolina coast--or any \nother State's coast for that matter. This bill will go a long way in \npreventing that from happening.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I commend and thank the Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Stevens, for his many months of hard work in getting \nthis vitally important environmental legislation to the floor. I know \nthat in writing and bringing this bill to the floor, Senator Stevens \nhas had to contend with a great many competing interests that were \noften at odds on some very complex issues. Despite this obstacle, he \nhas been able to fashion what I believe to be a strong but fair piece \nof legislation. There remain several changes I would like to see in \nthis bill, but on balance I support S. 39, legislation which should \nhelp our fisheries recover from years of overfishing, mismanagement and \nother negative factors. I would like to briefly share with my \ncolleagues our unfortunate experience with the decline of fishing in \nNew England, and hope that this experience and others like it might \nconvince all Senators on the importance of passing this bill.\n  Commercial fishing has long been a great source of pride for Rhode \nIsland and New England, its history in our region stretching back \nseveral hundred years. Explorers of the New World returned to England \nwith reports of codfish so plentiful that men actually scooped them \nfrom the sea by the bucket. In addition, early colonists relied on fish \nfor subsistence during their first, difficult years of settlement. More \nrecently, commercial fishing remained a fruitful and profitable \nindustry in New England throughout the 20th century. Fishing and all of \nits associated businesses have employed tens of thousands of New \nEnglanders in ports along the coast, making it one of our region s most \nimportant industries.\n  But beginning in the 1960's, distant-water factory trawler fleets \nfrom more than a dozen countries were decimating fish stocks off New \nEngland. In response, Congress in 1976 passed the Magnuson Act, which \nsought to Americanize our fishing grounds within 200 miles of the U.S. \ncoast and let stocks recover from foreign overfishing.\n  Unfortunately, though, the Americanization of our fishing grounds 20 \nyears ago has not resulted in the intended conservation of this \nvaluable national resource. Domestic fishermen have more than made up \nfor the departure of foreign fleets--the introduction of more boats and \nthe use of increasingly sophisticated fishing technology has resulted \nin destructive overfishing throughout New England's prime fishing \ngrounds. In 1976, there were 775 New England boats licensed to catch \ngroundfish. Today there are 4,000, of which 1,800 still actively fish. \nOverfishing and the resulting sharp downturn in our fishing industry, \nparticularly in New England, is nothing short of a genuine tragedy.\n\n  A look at some of the consequences of years of fisheries \nmismanagement in New England is staggering: in 1980, Georges Bank cod \nbiomass totalled about 90,000 metric tons; by last year it had declined \nto under 20,000 metric tons. Georges Bank haddock biomass was nearly \n70,000 metric tons in 1978, while today it is under 20,000. Many of \nthese once abundant fish stocks, which have been such a major influence \non New England's economy and heritage, are now, sadly, at or near \ncommercial extinction.\n  The question we now face in the context of the legislation before the \nSenate today is how do we best restore this sadly declining industry \nand bring life back to a marine resource that is disappearing? \nUnfortunately, efforts thus far to halt this collapse of fish stocks in \nNew England have met with limited success at best. In fact, in 1991 it \nactually took a lawsuit by two Massachusetts environmental groups to \nforce the notoriously slow New England Fishery Management Council to \ndraft and implement a fishery management plan that contained the teeth \nneeded to stem continued overfishing and stock decimation. And this \nplan, entitled amendment 5, did not even take effect until some 3 years \nafter the lawsuit was filed.\n  But amendment 5, while its ground-breaking restrictions on fishing \neffort were significantly stronger than previous efforts, proved to be \ninsufficient to stem the continuing decline in New England fish stocks. \nSo amendment 7, which further restricts fishing off New England in \nseveral ways, was proposed and approved by the Department of Commerce \nseveral months ago. Those of us who are committed to restoring New \nEngland's fisheries are hopeful that amendment 7 might begin to reverse \nthe tremendous damage that has been done to this resource.\n  Unfortunately, though, the New England and other regional fishery \nmanagement councils, while their efforts have improved during recent \nyears, still require additional tools to address the many conservation \nneeds of our Nation s fisheries. Through a long series of hearings and \na tremendous amount of hard work and patient listening, the Commerce \nCommittee has succeeded in producing a far-reaching bill, S. 39, that \nprovides the Councils these tools. I strongly endorse this legislation, \nand urge all of my colleagues, both from coastal and inland regions, to \ndo so as well.\n  S. 39 defines ``overfished'' and ``overfishing'' in the Magnuson Act \nand requires fishery management plans to specify criteria \nfor determining when a fishery is overfished and include measures to \nrebuild any overfished fishery. A council would have 1 year to come up \nwith a plan to stop overfishing and rebuild the fishery, and the \nSecretary of Commerce would be required to step in if the council fails \nto act.\n\n  This bill also adds a new national standard to the Magnuson Act \nrequiring that conservation and management measures minimize what we \ncall bycatch, which is the incidental harvest of nontarget fish. \nBycatch has caused much damage to many fisheries in the United States \nas unintentionally caught fish are often thrown back in the water dead \nor dying.\n  In addition, S. 39 imposes several significant reforms on the council \nprocess, including conflict-of-interest procedures and new mechanisms \nto push\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\ncouncils to develop difficult conservation and management measures. Our \nexperience in New England, where an industry-dominated council for \nyears stymied effective management, certainly illustrates the need for \nthese council reforms.\n  Mr. President, the Sustainable Fisheries Act includes many other \nprovisions aimed at restoring and sustaining some of our Nation's most \nvalued resources. I look with amazement at the array of fishing and \nconservation organizations that have endorsed this vitally important \nlegislation. These groups range from industry to environmental to \nrecreational. I commend the work done by Senator Stevens to obtain this \nwide-ranging level of support, and urge all of my colleagues to join me \nin voting for this bill.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                 Jurisdiction Over Fisheries in the EEZ\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to commend the distinguished \nchairman for his dedication to the conservation of our Nation's \nfisheries, the industry, and its beneficiaries. The chairman and his \nstaff have worked very hard to steer this important legislation through \nthe tedious legislative process. I look forward to working with the \nchairman and the committee in working toward this bill's ultimate \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask the chairman a clarifying question \nregarding an issue that is of great importance to many States, \nincluding the State of Florida.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to respond to a question from my \nfriend, the senior Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The State of Florida has been firmly committed to the \nconservation of the State's natural resources. In the past year, the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, and the Regional Fishery Management \nCouncil had proposed giving authority to the State over certain \nfisheries, such as stone crab and spiny lobster, but could not do so \nbecause Federal courts have ruled that the States are preempted by the \nMagnuson Act from regulating in the EEZ. I am pleased, therefore, that \nthe distinguished chairman has included in this reauthorization \nlegislation, a provision which would allow a fishery management council \nto delegate jurisdiction over certain fisheries in the EEZ to a State, \nif the State has regulations consistent with the fishery management \nplan for that area.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Florida is correct in his understanding \nof what is in the reauthorization bill. His interpretation is \nconsistent with the drafter's intent.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is my understanding that the legislation give states \nthe right to regulate any vessels in a fishery that the regional \ncouncil has designated as being under State jurisdiction, including \nvessels registered outside that particular State. Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Florida is again correct in his \nunderstanding of what is in the legislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Now in the case of my State, if the council designates \njurisdiction of a particular fishery to the State, the officials in \nFlorida would be able to regulate out-of-State vessels, in that portion \nof the EEZ, regardless of which ports it utilizes or chooses not to \nutilize.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the State of Florida has been \ndesignated as having jurisdiction over a fishery in the EEZ, they would \nbe entitled to regulate any vessel in that fishery, no matter where it \ncomes from or what facilities it utilizes, so long as it does so \nconsistent with the fishery management plan that delegates authority to \nthe State.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the distinguished chairman for his clarification \nof the issue.\n\n\n                           state jurisdiction\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nOceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and the author of this bill, Senator \nStevens, in a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be pleased to join Senator Snowe in a colloquy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. As the Senator knows, section 112 of the manager's \namendment amends the Magnuson Act to clarify that the existing \nprovision which allows a State to impose State laws and regulations on \nits State-registered vessels, even if those vessels fish in the \nexclusive economic zone. This provision greatly interests Maine \nbecause, in addition to the Federal rules, Maine imposes stringent \nState lobster conservation regulations on all of its vessels, \nregardless of where they fish. These State regulations are certainly \nconsistent with the Federal lobster management plan in conserving and \nsustainably managing the lobster resource. But some of Maine's \nregulations do differ in design from some of the regulations currently \nin force in the Federal zone. For instance, Maine prohibits the \npossession or landing of lobsters by State vessels that do not use \ntraps to harvest lobster, imposes a maximum-size lobster possession \nlimit, prohibits the possession of egg-bearing female lobsters, and \nrequires the v-notching technique to ensure the identification of these \nlobsters. The Federal lobster management plan does not contain \nconservation and management measures of the same design.\n  As I understand the amendment, section 112 would allow Maine to \ncontinue imposing its more stringent State lobster regulations on all \nof its State-registered fishing vessels because the regulations are \nconsistent with the Federal lobster management plan. Am I correct in \nstating that it is the intent of the author and manager of this bill \nthat section 112 of the manager's amendment dealing with State \njurisdiction would permit a State like Maine to continue applying more \nstringent rules on its State-registered vessels that operate in the \nexclusive economic zone?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Maine is correct. Section 112 of my \namendment protects the existing authority of States to impose more \nstringent regulations which are not inconsistent with a management plan \non its vessels in the Federal zone. Maine's more stringent regulations \nwere consistent with the management plan for lobster before this \namendment, and they would continue to be viewed that way after its \nenactment. Because regulations such as Maine's are not irreconcilable \nwith the management plan, they will be viewed as consistent with it \nunder my amendment.\n\n\n                         Herring Transshipment\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Senator from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, and the chairman of the Oceans and Fisheries \nSubcommittee, Senator Stevens, in a colloquy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would be pleased to join the Senator from Rhode Island \nin a colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to join Senator Chafee in a colloquy.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, section 105(e) of the manager's amendment \ndirects the Secretary of Commerce to provide transshipment permits for \nup to 14 Canadian vessels for the purposes of transporting Atlantic \nherring caught off the coast of Maine in the sardine processing trade. \nI would like to ask the Senators whether the manager's amendment would \nalso require this herring transshipment practice to be consistent with \nany applicable regulations, including fishery allocations, approved by \nthe Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The ASMFC has \nmanagement authority for Atlantic herring.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I sponsored and worked on, with other Commerce Committee \nmembers, the provision to which Senator Chafee refers, and I can assure \nthe Senator that the provision does require these transshipment permits \nto be consistent with all relevant herring management measures approved \nby the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. I would simply \nmention that the ASMFC has expressed support for this provision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I agree with Senator Snowe's interpretation of this \nprovision.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senators for the clarification.\n\n\n                            central registry\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my manager's amendment to S. 39, the \nSustainable Fisheries Act, adds a new section to the Magnuson Act \nrequiring the Secretary of Commerce to create a central lien registry \nsystem for limited access permits. Among other things, the Secretary is \nrequired to notify both the buyer and seller of a permit if a lien has \nbeen filed by the Secretary of the Treasury against the permit.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we have reviewed the central lien registry \nprovisions in the amendment offered by the\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nSenator from Alaska. He has removed language that involved matters \nwithin the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. We do hope, however, that \nthe Secretary of the Treasury will work with the Secretary of Commerce \nas the Secretary of Commerce carries out the new requirement my friend \nfrom Alaska has described.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Delaware for his help with this \nnew subsection. My amendment no longer contains the language that was \nwithin the Finance Committee's jurisdiction. I would, however, like to \nask my friend from Delaware about his understanding of section \n6323(j)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code--26 U.S.C. 6323(j)(1)(C), a \nprovision he helped write. Is that section intended to allow the \nSecretary of the Treasury to withdraw a notice of lien filed against a \nlimited access fishing permit if such withdrawal will facilitate the \ncollection of a tax liability by allowing the owner of the permit to \nderive income from the use of the permit?\n  Mr. ROTH. The Senator from Alaska is correct. Section 6323(j)(1)(C) \ngives the Secretary of the Treasury discretionary authority to withdraw \na notice of lien filed against a fishing permit if the withdrawal will \nfacilitate the collection of a tax liability by allowing the owner to \nderive income from the use of the permit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am pleased we have been able to bring \nto the Senate S. 39, a bill to amend and reauthorize the Magnuson \nFishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976. This bill, introduced \nby Senator Stevens and cosponsored by Senators Kerry, Murkowski, \nHollings, Lott, Inouye, Simpson, and myself, is crucial to continuing \nthe sound management of our Nation's fishery resources.\n  On March 28, 1996, the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation reported this legislation. The report was filed on May \n23, 1996, and a cost estimate for the bill as prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office was printed in the Congressional Record on \nJuly 10, 1996. Under the leadership of Senator Stevens, chairman of our \nOceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, seven field hearings were conducted \nlast year gathering testimony from fishermen, industry representatives, \nFederal and State managers, and environmental organizations, throughout \nthe Nation. While this legislation may not be perfect, the language we \nhave before us today is an attempt to address the concerns raised at \nthose hearings as well as issues brought to our attention by many of \nour colleagues in the Senate. This has been no small feat and I commend \nSenator Stevens for his efforts.\n  Commercial fisheries are very important to many States and the Nation \nas a whole. In 1995, commercial landings by U.S. fishermen were over \n9.9 billion pounds and valued at $3.8 billion. The State of Alaska led \nthe Nation in value of landings with $1.4 billion. Other regions of the \ncountry have a similar dependency on commercial fisheries, some are \nstrong and robust, others have not fared as well--their fish stocks \nhave declined and communities in those regions are feeling that \neconomic impact. Hopefully, provisions in this bill that call for \nreductions in bycatch, measures to prevent overfishing, and \nrequirements for the protection of habitat, will again bring about \nhealthy fisheries and healthy fishing communities.\n  Twenty years ago the Magnuson Act was enacted in direct response to \nthe depletion of U.S. fishery resources by foreign vessels. The \nMagnuson Act secured U.S. jurisdiction and management authority over \nthe fisheries out to 200 miles from our shores. It was intended that \nthis action would provide long-term stability and sustainable \nfisheries, though today in many areas we are again overcapitalized and \nthe stocks face a crisis similar to that of the 1970's.\n  The Magnuson Act is administered by the National Marine Fisheries \nService and eight Regional Fishery Management Councils that manage the \nfisheries in their geographic areas through specific fishery management \nplans. Their actions provide the rules under which the fishing industry \noperates. They determine the harvest quotas, season length, gear \nrestrictions, and license limitations. This is where tough management \ndecisions need to be made.\n  One of the overall goals of the Magnuson Act is to provide a \nmechanism to determine the appropriate level of harvest to maximize the \nbenefit to the Nation while still protecting the long-term \nsustainability of the fisheries. It is a balancing act among competing \ninterests of commercial and recreational fishermen and even competing \ngear groups within the commercial industry.\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Stevens, Senator Gorton, and \nothers have been able to resolve any differences they may have had with \nthe bill as reported. A manager's amendment that I fully support has \nbeen developed that addresses these issues. The amendment shortens the \nauthorization period through fiscal year 1999, thereby reducing the \ntime that a moratorium will be in effect concerning individual fishing \nquotas [IFQ's]; it requires the National Academy of Sciences to conduct \na study on the value of IFQ's and community development quotas or \nCDQ's; it includes consideration for the sustained participation of \nfishing communities, and it also addresses the issue of State \njurisdiction into Federal waters absent any applicable fishery \nmanagement plan.\n  Mr. President, many of the provisions in this bill will strengthen \nthe administration of the Magnuson Act and, in turn, the conservation \nand management of our fishery resources. I say to my Senate colleagues \nthat this bill is a bipartisan effort to accommodate the interests of \nfishermen throughout the Nation. I again commend the leadership efforts \nof Senator Stevens as well as many other members of the Commerce \nCommittee in moving this legislation.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, we are obliged to be responsible \nstewards of our environment, both here and abroad. Even in these times \nof fiscal restraint, it would be counterproductive to cut back on the \ninvestment we have made in our environment and indeed in our own \nfuture. Growing concern over the deterioration of our global resources \nand environment has forced us to examine ways in which we can redouble \nour efforts to protect and conserve these valuable resources. However, \nprotection need not be at the expense of our ability to enjoy, enhance, \nand utilize our resources. There are few industries whose future is as \ndirectly dependent on the conservation of a resource as commercial \nfishing.\n  As residents of Oregon's coastal communities recently learned, due to \nthe closing of a commercial salmon season, when fish populations suffer \nthat hardship is passed along to fishermen, processors, and consumers. \nThe problem of dwindling fishery resources is not unique to the Pacific \nNorthwest. Virtually every region of the country has experienced some \nform of decay in the commercial fishing industry. Therefore, it is \ncritical that we fulfill our obligation to protect and responsibly \nmanage our Nation's fisheries.\n  The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act has been our \nNation's principal offshore fisheries conservation policy since it was \nenacted in 1976. I am gratified the Senate has overcome the substantial \nbarriers that were preventing this important legislation from being \nconsidered. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed its \nversion of this measure last year and it is my hope we will send a \nMagnuson reauthorization bill to the President for his signature this \nyear. However, I recognize there are a number of outstanding issues \nwhich must be resolved before we can complete action on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a brief moment to congratulate \nthe sponsors of the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, Senators Stevens \nand Kerry. They have crafted a bill which enjoys support on a \nbipartisan basis in the Senate and is also endorsed by numerous \nconservation and industry groups. It has taken impressive dedication on \nthe part of the sponsors of this bill and cooperation with many Members \nof the Senate to bring this measure before us today. I commend them for \ntheir leadership on this matter.\n  The Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, S. 39, would extend the \nauthorization of appropriations for the Magnuson Fishery Conservation \nManagement Act through fiscal year 2000 and build on the policy \nobjectives of that landmark legislation. In the 20 years since\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\nits enactment, the Magnuson Act has provided a national framework for \nconserving and managing U.S. marine fisheries.\n\n  In addition to reauthorizing several important appropriations for \nmarine statutes, the Sustainable Fisheries Act includes significant \nfishery conservation and management provisions. The bill contains \nlanguage which requires fishery management plans to specify criteria \nfor establishing when a fishery has been overfished and include methods \nto rebuild an overfished fishery. Additionally, the issue of bycatch, \ntaking of nontarget fish in the process of catching marketable seafood, \nis also addressed by this legislation. It adds a national standard \nwhich would require measures to minimize bycatch and minimize the \nmortality of unavoidable bycatch. The legislation also mandates the \neight regional fishery management councils to identify essential fish \nhabitat and reduce negative effects on habitat due to fishing.\n  As with all natural resource policy matters, effective conservation \nand management of fisheries must be based on sound science and accurate \nresearch. The Sustainable Fisheries Act maintains existing Magnuson Act \nsections dealing with data collection and fisheries research. \nAdditionally, it includes a section which establishes guidelines for \nfishing vessel observers and fishing vessel registration. The \nlegislation also incorporates the National Academy of Sciences to \nconduct a review of the contentious individual fishing quota and \ncommunity development quota programs.\n  Many individuals within my State have contacted me to express concern \nabout specific provisions contained in this legislation. I recognize \neach issue within this bill may not be resolved to the satisfaction of \nall interested parties. However, the compromise package is a reasonable \nattempt to address these concerns and the accommodations made by the \nmanagers of the bill represent our best opportunity to see this overdue \nlegislation enacted this year. Therefore, I will vote in favor of the \nSustainable Fisheries Act.\n  Once again, I applaud the work of the sponsors of this legislation \nand thank them for their efforts on behalf of our Nation's fisheries \nand those who depend upon them. It is my hope the Senate will \noverwhelmingly pass this important measure and that action will be \ntaken quickly by the White House to sign it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10906-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10913-S10931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BUDGETARY TREATMENT OF LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, title III of S. 39, the Fisheries \nFinancing Act, creates a new loan guarantee program and makes some \nchanges to existing credit programs.

Had it not been for his \ndetermination and consistency, we would not be where we are today, \nhaving passed a significant, bipartisan bill.\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\n  But beyond that, Mr. President, I want to issue one word of warning \nas I close. We have passed a bill to try to eliminate waste in the \nfisheries off our shores. Mr. President, if these mechanisms we have \nadopted through compromise do not work, I intend to be back with a \nstronger bill because it is the area off my shores, the shores of \nAlaska, that produce over half of the fisheries of this country.\n  The waste has become just unacceptable, totally unacceptable. When we \nreached the level of 500 to 700 million pounds a year of fish being \nwasted because of the distant water fishing vessels, we have reached a \nlevel beyond our acceptance in the fisheries.\n  Mr. President, I introduced the original 200-mile bill in 1971 \nbecause I flew from Kodiak to the Pribilof Islands and counted over 100 \nJapanese trollers off our shores. We sought to find a way to eliminate \nthat scourge on our fisheries, and we did so by passing, finally 5 \nyears later, the bill that is now known as the Magnuson Act, at my \nrequest.\n  That law brought into effect a new distant water fleet. It is the \nfactory trollers. And 75 percent of that waste comes from the factory \ntrollers. If they do not put their business back in order and get away \nfrom bottom line fisheries and start thinking about the conservation of \nour fisheries and the sustainability of our fisheries, we will be back \nbecause Alaska will not put up with the total depletion of our \nfisheries.\n  There are no known species off our shores that are overfished now. \nSeveral may be very close to it. The day that we get one--even one--\ncaused by factory trollers, I will be back with another bill, because \nwe demand that the reproductive capability of our fisheries be \nsustained. That is what this bill does. That is the intent of the bill. \nIf it does not work, Mr. President, thanks to God and my Alaska voters, \nI will be here 6 more years, and we will see to it that a bill will \npass that will eliminate these vessels that are destroying the \nreproductive capability of the North Pacific. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains on the 10 minutes \nallotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I used too much time. Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent for an extra 5 minutes on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska for his comments. It is my hope that both God and some other \nvoters will help me be back here to work with him.\n  Let me just say, Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments \nabout our joint work. It has been a great privilege working with the \nSenator from Alaska and his staff in an effort to try to move this very \nimportant piece of legislation. I think it is fair to say--and I know \nthe Senator from Alaska will join me in this--a lot of countries around \nthe world were waiting to see how the United States was going to \nrespond to its crisis of dealing with its fishing stocks and the \nprotection of our available fishing grounds from the waters off Alaska \nto the waters south all the way to San Diego, the tuna fleet, all \nthrough the gulf coast, the Gulf of Mexico, around to Florida all the \nway up to Charleston, SC, North Carolina, New York, New Jersey, to \nMaine.\n\n  We have had different interests that have been tugging within this \nbill. We have commercial fishermen tugging against recreational \nfishermen. This is a $50 billion a year industry to the United States \non the commercial side and it is a $7 billion industry with respect to \nthe recreational side. There are enormous pressures by that monetary \ninterest to continue to deplete. But this is a finite resource, and we \nhave to manage it.\n  Other countries are wrestling with this. Great Britain is doing a \nbuyout. Iceland, Russia, other nations, Norway, all of them have \nimplemented particular environmental concerns. What we did here today \nwas important to say that we are going to be a leader in that \ninternational effort and that we are serious. I join the Senator from \nAlaska in saying that this must work. If it does not, we will come back \nwith tougher measures in order to guarantee that the stocks are able to \nreplenish and that fishing is an ongoing effort.\n  I simply repeat what I said yesterday. This is not a signal of an end \nto fishing nor even the downturn. If we do our job properly and if the \nmanagement councils do their jobs properly, 300,000 new jobs can be \ncreated. This can be a growth industry for the United States of \nAmerica. That is our goal.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Louisiana for his continued and \never-present counsel and assistance in these efforts. He understands \nthe issues as well as any person in the Senate, and his help has been \ninstrumental in building the consensus that we brought here today. I \nyield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will just take a moment, but I say, that \nif the work on this legislation is any measure of the voters of Alaska \nand voters of Massachusetts, both of our colleagues will in fact be \nback in the next Congress to work on this legislation and many other \nareas.\n  I just say to the Senator from Massachusetts, who has just spoken, \nthat his fisheries area was on the brink of disaster, but because of \nhis outstanding work on this legislation, I suggest that the New \nEngland fisheries are going to be much better off. Maybe not just this \nafternoon, but in the next year and the years after that and for the \nnext several decades, that very vital fisheries area of the United \nStates, the New England fisheries, is going to be better off because \nthis bill will provide better science, better management tools for \nlocal fishery management organizations to manage the fisheries in that \narea.\n  I think he deserves a great deal of credit, as does the Senator from \nAlaska, for putting together a bill that really has been nonpartisan. \nTo be able to get the Gulf of Mexico and the New England fisheries to \nagree with the fishermen in the Northwest and in Alaska is quite a \npolitical achievement. I want to say to both of these leaders what an \noutstanding job they have done in bringing forward this piece of \nlegislation. Millions and millions will be much better off because of \ntheir work today in this legislation.\n  I want to also thank two members of my staff, Mr. Mike Parks, who has \nworked on this legislation for so long, and also my legislative \ndirector, Ms. Darla Romfo, for stepping in at the last minute. This is \nnot her area, not her expertise, but she became a very quick expert in \nthe area of fisheries. We thank them both for their effort. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I see that the chairman of the committee \nis here now, Senator Pressler. I want to add to the comments that I \nmade previously that he and Senator Hollings, the leader and ranking \nmember on our committee, the Commerce Committee, have allowed us broad \nleeway and literally allowed us, with almost all our funding from the \nCommerce Committee, to travel in connection with the hearings we \nconducted on this bill in the period of 2 years.\n\n  Senator Pressler has contributed very greatly to the outcome of this \nlegislation. I want to acknowledge his leadership as well as his \ncooperation. Both he and the staff of the full committee have assisted \nus in every way. I do thank him. And Senator Hollings has done the same \nfor Senator Kerry. So it was with the absolute cooperation of the \nleadership of the committee that we were able to achieve the passage of \nthis bill. It is another bipartisan bill that goes down on the record \nof Senator Pressler during his chairmanship of this committee. We look \nforward to working with him in the years to come.\n  I would also like to add my special thanks to Senator Inouye, who has \nstood beside us and made a major contribution to this bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I just want to add, once again, my thanks to the \nleaders of this bill. We have talked about the importance of this bill \nto the management of the waters of the United States. It could not have \ncome about without the leadership of Senator Pressler, the chairman of \nthe committee, who really made it come together when there were many \nissues still left on the table.\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\n  Certainly, the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nStevens, along with Senator Kerry, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Lott--everyone worked so hard to do something that I think \nreally will be for the benefit of all of the people who care about our \nwaters, and use them either for commercial use or for recreation and \nconservation. Kudos to all.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10932-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this morning I was watching a morning \ntelevision show and heard a report that was dumbfounding to me. It was \na report on a decision by an appellate court of New York State dealing \nwith a young man who had brought a gun to school. The gun had been \ndiscovered and taken from the youth. The boy was expelled from school. \nThis case has made its way through the New York court system to the \nappellate court, which ruled Tuesday that the security guard had acted \nimproperly in removing the gun from the boy who was in a school.\n  I came to the office this morning after hearing that report and asked \nfor some information about the appellate court decision and got it. I \nread through it and there are times when you scratch your head and \nwonder why there are people serving in public office in any branch of \ngovernment who are so completely devoid of common sense. I read this \ndecision and wondered how anyone could really have decided that it is \nall right for a boy to carry a gun in school and not be punished for \nit.\n  There is a law on the books now, the Gun-Free Schools Act, that says \nschools must have zero tolerance for guns in our Nation's classrooms \nand hallways. I wrote it. I, along with the Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein, wrote this legislation that is now law. It says with \nrespect to the issue of guns in schools, we are sending a message that \nis very clear anywhere in America.\n  The message ought to be clear to every student and every parent: \nThere is zero tolerance for guns in schools. Do not bring a gun to \nschool. If you do, you will face certain punishment. Now, that is law.\n  In the report I heard today about the court case in New York \nregarding the young man, identified as Juan, in the Bronx, at William \nHoward Taft High School, a security guard testified that he spotted \nwhat looked like the handle of a gun inside Juan's jacket. A search \nturned up the weapon, which was loaded. Juan was suspended for a year, \nand criminal charges were filed against him. A Bronx family court \nkicked out the charges, ruling that the outline of the gun was not \nclearly visible. The slight bulge was not, in any particular shape or \nform, remotely suspicious, so the security guard had conducted an \nunreasonable search. The appellate court went a step further and said, \nsince the guard improperly removed the gun, the boy should not have \nbeen suspended from school.\n  I think that is nuts. When I get on an airplane to fly to North \nDakota, I have to walk through a metal detector. They want to know \nwhether I have a weapon on my person. They also have a right to search \nmy briefcase and my luggage, and they have a right to determine that \nthe people who board that airplane have no guns or weapons on them.\n  This court says that a security guard, or teachers, or principals \nhave no right to determine whether a student with a suspicious bulge in \nhis clothing has a gun in his pocket or in his jacket as he walks down \na hallway or sits in a classroom at a school in the Bronx. Where is the \ncommon sense here? Of course, we have a right to determine that no kids \nin schools have guns. When a court says that a school has no right to \nexpel a student who was caught with a gun by a security guard who saw a \nbulge in the student's pocket, then there is something fundamentally \nwrong with that court.\n  Now, as I said, I wrote the provision 2 years ago that says there is \nzero tolerance for guns in schools, and there are certain penalties for \nevery student who brings a gun to school anywhere in this country. That \ndoes not vary from New Mexico to Indiana to North Dakota. If you bring \na gun, you are expelled--no ifs, ands, or buts. This court decision, \nalong with some background on other court decisions that I just heard \nabout this morning on television, so angered me--to believe that we \nhave the capacity in a country like this to prevent people from \nbringing guns onto airplanes but we can't expel a kid who is caught \nwith a gun in school.\n  I have a young son in school today. He is 9 years old. He is sitting \nin a classroom in a wonderful school. I, just like every other parent \nin this country, want to make certain that if there is any kid that \ncomes into that school, or any other school, with a gun, our children \nare safe, and that someone can intercept those students, and if they \nfind a gun, they are going to remove the gun and the student. We have \nevery right to expect that to be the case in our schools.\n  This court decision, as I said, denies all common sense. I fully \nintend to pursue additional Federal legislation, if necessary, in order \nto remedy this sort of circumstance. A country that can decide that \npeople who board airplanes can be searched--and we can make certain \nthat people will not take guns in airplanes--ought to be able to decide \nthat children in school will be free from having another child in a \nclassroom or in the hallway packing a .45 or a .38.\n  Parents ought to be able to believe that security guards who \nintercept people with guns in schools will be able to remove those \nstudents. Not too long ago, at a school about 2 miles from where I \nstand, a young boy was shot. I had visited that school about a month \nbefore the young boy was shot. I went to a school with nine students in \nthe senior class, in a town of 300. But I wanted to tour this inner-\ncity school and see what it was like. As I walked in, I went through a \nmetal detector, and I saw security guards. I went into a school that is \nin a lockdown state when the school day begins. When the students are \nin, the doors are locked. They have metal detectors and security guards \nto try to make certain there are no students bringing in weapons and no \nunauthorized people are coming through the doors. Frankly, the security \nwas pretty good at that school. They felt that there was a need to have \nsubstantial security.\n\n  About a month or so after I toured that school, a young boy was in \nthe basement of that school in the lunch room at a water fountain. \nAnother young boy named Jerome bumped him at the water fountain. For \nbumping the boy at the water fountain, Jerome was shot four times. I \njust read about it in the papers. I didn't know Jerome. He was shot \nfour times and he lay on the floor critically wounded. He survived \nthose wounds. He graduated from school. I visited with Jerome a couple \nof times, just trying to understand what is happening in these schools. \nIt was prior to my passing legislation here dealing with the issue of \nzero tolerance and guns in schools. I found it unusual that a school \nwith that security still had a boy in the cafeteria with a gun--a gun \navailable to shoot\n\n[[Page S10935]]\n\nsomeone who bumped him at a water fountain.\n  Now comes, this morning, a court case where this boy Juan was in \nschool 4 years ago. It has taken that long for this case to get through \nthe courts. This boy isn't even in school anymore. But the decision is \nthat a security guard at school improperly removed a gun from the \npocket of this student. I find this so preposterous. I know if we talk \nto the judges, they would give a million reasons why they reached this \ndecision. I don't want 10 reasons or 5 reasons. I want one person to \ngive me one reason why we ought to believe it is ever appropriate for a \nyoung student to put a pistol in his pocket in order to go to school in \nthis country.\n  If we can't keep guns out of schools, we can't take the first baby \nstep in dealing with this country's education problems. So I come to \nthe floor to express enormous dismay over what I heard and read this \nmorning and to say to those who are making these decisions: If need be, \nthere will be Federal legislation, once again, telling those who are \ntrying to keep guns out of our schools that you have the authority to \ndo it. We are going to give school officials the ability to keep our \nchildren safe.\n  I am not antigun. I hunt. In my State we have great hunting. But guns \nhave no place in schools. No kid ought to bring a pistol to school. \nThose who do ought not to be told by the courts that it is OK. They \nought to be told by parents and security guards, and by the law in this \ncountry, that it is not OK. If necessary, we are going to pass Federal \nlegislation to make that occur.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Before the distinguished Senator from North Dakota leaves \nthe floor, I would like to ask him a question or two.\n  I have been listening, with keen interest, to his addressing this \nissue that I know he has been involved in for a long, long time. I have \nsome comments to make on this. But I simply would like to ask him, who \nbrought the action? Under whose auspices was the case filed that he has \njust addressed, where the decision came down yesterday? Where was this \ncase and who brought the action?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I say to the Senator from Nebraska, this was in an \nappellate court of New York State. I don't have, at this moment, the \ninformation about who brought the action. I assume that attorneys on \nbehalf of the student, or the student's parents, brought an action \nagainst the school and, also, of course, contested the criminal \ncharges. This student who brought a gun to school, which was then \nseized by the security guard, eventually had the criminal charges \nagainst him dropped.\n  Mr. EXON. Were there any other organizations involved in this, to \nyour knowledge? Or was it just an individual action by a parent?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, other organizations are quoted in the press \nstories, but there is not a reference about whether they were involved \nin the case. So I will not use their names, except to say that my \nexpectation is that there are organizations who would join parents of \nthe student and who would contest these sorts of policies. But it is \nbeyond my comprehension to understand how anyone can argue anywhere \nthat it is appropriate under any circumstance for a kid to pack a \nweapon to go to school. If we can't as parents, as school \nadministrators, and as public officials decide that our schools are \nplaces where kids can learn and feel safe in an environment in which \nthey can learn, then we cannot solve our education problems in this \ncountry.\n\n  Mr. EXON. I have not seen the information that the Senator from North \nDakota has. I guess I am specifically asking whether or not there were \nother organizations who hired attorneys or had attorneys there \nrepresenting those who brought the action.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will get that information. I do not feel comfortable \ngiving you the names of the other organizations named in the news \narticles I have because I do not know whether they were actively \ninvolved in bringing the case. But I hope by Monday or so to have all \nof that information, and I will come to the floor again and provide it \nfor the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate that very, very much. The fact that the \nSenator has the courage to stand up on the floor of the U.S. Senate and \nmake such an obvious, commonsense argument encourages me that we are \nbeginning to look at some of the real problems in America. One of the \nproblems in America today is kids with guns. Certainly I would agree \nwith my friend from North Dakota. If we are powerless to do anything \nabout that, regardless of the status, the opinion, the background of \none court, or one judge, then we are in serious trouble.\n  As a former Governor who had appointed lots of judges, I have never \nlaunched an attack on the courts per se because I think by and large \nthe courts do a good job. Unfortunately, it is obvious to me from some \nof the recent decisions that I have seen on a whole series of areas--it \nindicates to me that perhaps all too often the courts think they are \nnot the third branch of Government but they are the branch of \nGovernment, and they seemingly are becoming all powerful.\n  There was a time when the courts of the United States were somewhat \nrestrained and did not become activists for causes. It seems to me that \nall too often those who are foremost in bringing these actions have \nscrutinized the judiciary to the point where they know what judge to go \nto on a certain issue and what judge would be most likely to go along \nwith this particular point of view. To me, that is not a good comment \non the judiciary that is supposed to be under the law, ones that make \nlegitimate decisions based on law. And breaking new ground in the \njudiciary at one time was somewhat reserved. These days the judiciary \nis breaking more new ground more often and, in the opinion of this \nSenator, more wrongly than ever before.\n  So I will be looking forward to hearing the next comment on this.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am mindful of the dilemma of criticizing the courts. I \ngenerally don't do that. I may have used some intemperate language \ntoday to do so, but I am a little tired of the judiciary saying, \n``Well, you know, don't ever comment about us. We are over here way \nabove comment.'' I called a judge one day when I picked up the \nWashington Post some while ago. A couple of people put a pistol to a \nman's head in a pizza delivery murder and killed him. The trigger man \nwas let out on, I think, $10,000 bond by the judge. I read that story. \nI thought to myself, ``What on Earth are we doing?'' I called the \njudge. The judge says, ``How dare you call me. You have no right to \ncall me.'' I said, ``Of course, I have a right to call you.'' It turned \nout a lot of other people in that community called him, and he decided \nto change the bail. That young fellow was brought back to jail and was \nsubsequently convicted of murder and put into prison.\n  But the point is that I do not criticize the judiciary lightly. I do \nnot want to taint the judiciary. The fact is a lot of people are doing \na lot of wonderful work, I am sure. But there are times when you see \ndecisions come out that are so unsound and so devoid of common sense.\n  I try to be mindful of the point about criticizing the judiciary. \nBut, frankly, I think sometimes they deserve a little criticism. I am \ngoing to do it when I feel they have made decisions like this that we \ncan remedy with some Federal legislation, and they should know it is \ncoming.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend. I find myself aligned \nalmost identically with the viewpoints that the Senator has just \naddressed. I was very much interested to see how a judge resented the \nfact that a U.S. Senator called him asking the reasons for the decision \nthat the judge had rendered. That takes me to the place that, while I \nrecognize the courts as the legitimate third force of government, the \ncourts are not sacrosanct, and the courts had better get off of the \nkick that they seem to be increasingly on, as evidenced at least by the \none instance that the Senator from North Dakota addressed. Judges are \nhuman beings like all of us. Those of us who are in public service \nexpect to receive criticism. That is what making hard decisions is all \nabout.\n  But I simply say that, from what I know of the case that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota referenced today about the most recent decision, \nprobably the most recent outrage by at least one\n\n[[Page S10936]]\n\ncourt against what thinking people are trying to do to provide at least \nsome degree of safe haven for our kids in school, highlights the point \nthat the Senator from North Dakota is making and this Senator from \nNebraska is making about the way things are happening today. The three \nequal branches of Government--the executive, the judiciary, and the \nlegislative--had better be looked on.\n  I say as a legislator to the courts, ``Do your job but don't trample \non us as a second-class part of the equal three-part series of our \nGovernment that has served this Nation and this country so well for so \nvery long.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10934-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, as I understand it, the manager of the bill \non the other side will be here briefly. Since this matter is now before \nthe Senate, I would like to proceed with a statement on this particular \nmeasure. I assure all that contrary to the misunderstanding of half an \nhour ago, I am convinced that all possible disagreement with certain \npoints of the bill had been earlier cleared today. The bill I believe \nis ready for acceptance on both sides of the aisle, so I will, since \nthe measure, S. 1505, is before us, continue with my statement on the \nbill, with the hopes that the manager on the other side will be here \nand ready to act on the measure, and we will not attempt to act on the \nmeasure until the majority representative is here.\n  Mr. President, the amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. \n1505, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996, is \nan important piece of legislation. We worked this out in the Commerce \nCommittee. We have worked out some word and language concerns with \nother Members of the Senate, and I think the measure is ready to pass.\n  Pipeline safety is an extremely important issue for me. I have tried \nduring my years in the Senate to give the issue of pipeline safety the \nvisibility that it deserves, which it did not receive previously. I am \nvery proud of what the Senate has been able to accomplish in this \nimportant area.\n  Just to name one such recent effort, we can point to the Pipeline \nSafety Improvement Act of 1991. With favorable Senate action on the \nAccountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act today, we will continue \nour efforts to make gas and hazardous liquid pipelines safer and to do \nit while allowing the pipeline industry to continue to provide \neffective and efficient service to the Nation's consumers, as they \nobviously do today.\n  The bill is aptly named. After long negotiations between the \nregulators, the Department of Transportation Office of Pipeline Safety, \nand the pipeline industry, the parties agree that this bill can create \na working partnership to improve pipeline safety while allowing the \nsafe pipelines to operate with a reduced regulatory burden and allowing \nthe OPS to put its resources where and when the problems exist. In \nother words, putting cops on the beat in the neighborhoods that need \nthem.\n  The cornerstone of this bill is the risk management program. The \nprogram would allow the Secretary of Transportation to establish \ncriteria under which the pipeline owners and operators can present \npipeline safety plans that provide at least an equivalent level of \nsafety with the level of safety already provided by the existing OPS \nregulations. In return for participation in the program, the eligible \npipeline owner will be allowed to operate free of regulations that the \nSecretary determines are no longer necessary in light of the facility's \nsafety plan.\n  In return, the OPS can concentrate its resources on those pipeline \nfacilities, the safety record of which can and should be improved. I \nbelieve that the parties have agreed to a workable plan for increasing \nthe safety of gas and hazardous liquid pipelines while reducing the \nregulatory burden on the affected industries.

Mr. President, I wanted to address for just a few \nminutes the issue I spoke about yesterday, and that is the level of \nsupport we are providing in this Congress to education. I wanted to do \nit by showing some charts that I was shown yesterday which I think are \nparticularly instructive. Let me just put them up for the benefit of my \ncolleagues so that they can see what we are talking about.\n  There are really two items on this first chart. The first is \nprojected enrollment. You see here, starting in 1996, we have 52 \nmillion students enrolled and by the year 2002 that goes up to 70 \nmillion. We are seeing that kind of increase and even more of a \npercentage increase in my State, in States like New Mexico, where there \nis substantial growth in population.\n  This chart also shows the funding proposal which was in the budget \nresolution that was adopted last year during the Congress, and that is \nto go from $39.5 billion in 1995 down to $35\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nbillion, an absolute cut of over $4 billion in that period. This is an \nissue about which I think there is some confusion. As I travel around \nmy State, people say, well, there is really not a cut in education \nbeing considered; it is only a cut in the level of increase.\n  That is not accurate. This is a cut. When you go from $39.5 billion \nin 1995 to $35 billion in 2002, that is a cut that is not a cut in the \nrate of increase.\n  Mr. President, this second chart makes the same point. That is, each \nyear up until the last few years, we had seen an increase in education. \nSome years it was a modest increase, some years it was a more \nsignificant increase, but there was always some increase and there was \nbipartisan agreement to do that. Beginning in fiscal year 1995 this \nCongress for the first time saw a $3.7 billion cut and, of course, we \nare trying to reduce the level of that cut this year.\n  Another chart which makes the same point, Mr. President, is this one \nwhich says ``Education Is Cut $3.2 Billion From the Original FY 1995 \nProgram Level Spending.''\n  This shows in 1995 through rescissions of spending in that year we \neliminated $600 million; in the fiscal year 1996 appropriations, it was \na cumulative $1.1 billion cut; the 1997 House appropriation was a $1.5 \nbillion cut and the total funding loss from the original 1995 level is \n$3.2 billion.\n  Mr. President, let me just show this final chart here which I think \nmakes the obvious point that I think all Americans would understand, \nand that is that our ``Unmet Education Needs'' are large and growing. \nThis shows that in the school year 1994 through 1995, there were 10 \nmillion students eligible for title I funding--that is, they attended \nschools where the income level was such that they should have been \nreceiving title I funding. Only 6.5 million of them actually received \nit. There were 3.5 million students in that school year who were not \nable to receive the funding because of funding levels. When you combine \nthis chart with the first of the charts that I showed, which is the \nincrease in enrollment that our schools are experiencing, you can see \nthe problem is growing worse, and that is the only point I am trying to \nmake here.\n  In this last 2 weeks of the session, I hope very much we can get back \nto the 1995 funding level for education. It is a small request to make. \nI think it is one that is certainly justified.\n  I appreciate the chance to point out these charts to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased we are considering S. 1505, \nthe Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996. This is \nneeded and important legislation, and I urge my colleagues' full and \nenthusiastic support.\n  On June 6, 1996, S. 1505 was amended by the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation and ordered to be reported without \nobjection. I also have one technical amendment that I believe has been \ncleared by the majority and the minority.\n  S. 1505 reauthorizes appropriations for Natural Gas and Hazardous \nLiquid Pipeline Safety Programs and seeks to reduce the risks and \nenhance environmental protection associated with pipeline \ntransportation. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation, I want to take a moment to highlight some \nof the most important provisions of S. 1505.\n  But first, Mr. President, I want to share some brief background on \nhow S. 1505 reached this point. It was a long, but fruitful journey.\n  Last December, our distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, \nintroduced S. 1505. Mr. Lott's original bill was cosponsored by Mr. \nBreaux, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Exon, Mr. Burns, Mr. Ford, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Frist, Mr. Inhofe, and myself.\n  S. 1505 was based on a bill (H.R. 1323) pending in the House. The \nHouse legislation had been approved by two panels, but it has not been \ndebated on the House floor. Because of the majority leader's \ninitiative, emphasis shifted to our Chamber.\n  On April 16, my committee held a hearing on pipeline transportation \nsafety and S. 1505. At the hearing, pipeline owners and operators, as \nwell as Federal and State safety regulators, voiced their individual \nviews on how to reauthorize and enhance pipeline safety.\n  At the hearing, I stated my view that with a little give and take, we \ncould reach agreement on how best to improve pipeline safety. I am \npleased that our efforts succeeded.\n  The text of S. 1505 reflects an agreement reached over several \nmonths. The negotiators in this process represented two offices in the \nDepartment of Transportation DOT--one of which was the Office of \nPipeline Safety OPS--natural gas pipeline operators, hazardous liquid \npipeline operators, and majority and minority committee staff. Valuable \ninput was also received from the dedicated staff of the Congressional \nResearch Service and groups like the National Association of Pipeline \nSafety Representatives and the Natural Resources Defense Council. I \ncommend the work of all those involved.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved with pipeline safety issues for \nseveral years. A vast network of underground pipes safely transports \nfuel to our homes and businesses.\n  National Transportation Safety Board statistics show pipelines to be \none of the safest modes of transportation. Among all modes--highway, \nrail, aviation, marine, and pipeline--fatalities from pipeline \naccidents represent less than 3/1000 of 1 percent of the total number \nof transportation fatalities on an annual basis.\n  At the same time, we must do everything possible to prevent natural \ngas and hazardous liquid pipeline transportation accidents. A few years \nago, a pipeline leak occurred near Sioux Falls in my home State of \nSouth Dakota. I met with Federal, state and local officials at the time \nto discuss many public health and safety aspects of pipeline \ntransportation. I also initiated efforts to improve hazardous liquid \npipeline inspection programs and to add inspectors to focus on States \nlike South Dakota that did not have their own hazardous liquid pipeline \nsafety programs.\n  Through this experience, I came to realize that pipeline \ntransportation is one of the United States' most unique transportation \nmodes. There are individual product characteristics and product-\nspecific types of piping materials. A subterranean network of \nunderground pipelines runs under farms, rural communities, suburbs, \nmetropolitan regions, rivers, and environmentally sensitive areas. \nGiven this unique transportation environment, it became clear that a \nsingle uniform set of safety standards cannot effectively address all \nrisks.\n  S. 1505 responds to this unique pipeline operating environment by \napplying a simple, flexible, commonsense risk assessment and cost-\nbenefit analysis for new pipeline safety standards. The legislation \nmoves pipeline safety away from prescriptive, command-and-control \napproaches and focuses future standards on actions that address \nassessed safety risks.\n\n  S. 1505 also provides statutory authority for the Office of Pipeline \nSafety to initiate the risk management demonstration project it has had \nunder development for 2 years. Under the demonstration program, \npipeline operators would be given more flexibility in applying their \nresources to solutions that best fit their unique pipeline operation \nproblems.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the technical provision at the desk to be \nadded to S. 1505 has been cleared by both the majority and the \nminority. The language in the provision provides for the opportunity \nfor public comment in a demonstration project's approval process.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety testified that there ``are too many \nvariations'' in pipeline operations to think ``we in Washington are in \na position to mandate solutions to fit all problems.''\n  I wholeheartedly agree. One-size-fits-all regulations do not and \ncannot address the thousands of differences between pipeline operations \nnationwide.\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\n  S. 1505 is a responsible bill and it represents sound public policy. \nThe risk assessment and risk management provisions of the legislation \nrest on the foundation already built by the Office of Pipeline Safety. \nThe bill also builds on initiatives undertaken at OPS to focus its \nregulatory and programmatic agenda on the most important public safety \nand environmental protection standards.\n  Aside from the risk assessment and risk management provisions, S. \n1505 contains many other noteworthy provisions. Although I cannot \nmention each one individually, I do want to touch on one particular \nissue.\n  States currently represent more than 90 percent of the State/Federal \ninspector work force that oversees pipelines nationwide. For more than \ntwo decades, OPS has leveraged its resources, thereby increasing its \npipeline inspection capabilities, by reimbursing States for up to fifty \npercent of their program costs. This leverage is a key link in the \npipeline safety network. I am pleased that despite severe budget \npressures, S. 1505 maintains this important State/Federal cost-sharing \npartnership.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank all those involved in bringing \nS. 1505 to the floor today. I want to again acknowledge the role the \nmajority leader played. S. 1505's development and evolution was \ndifficult, but the end result is a bill worthy of enactment.\n  Also, I would like to cite the staff who did a great deal of work:\n  Charlotte Casey, Tom Hohenthaner, and Paddy Link of the majority \nstaff of the Commerce Committee; Carl Biersack with Senator Lott; Clyde \nHart, Carl Bentzel and Jim Drewry of the minority staff of the Commerce \nCommittee; and Chris McLean with Senator Exon.\n  Mr. President, I have completed my statement. On this side of the \naisle, we are ready to proceed. At this time, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator withhold that? Mr. President, has he \noffered a manager's amendment? We have it here now. It is his \namendment. You must have it. We approve it as drafted. Therefore, I \nsuggest if the Senator will go ahead and offer that, we can probably \npass the bill.\n\n\n                Modifications to the Committee Amendment\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send \nmodifications to the committee substitute to the desk and ask that the \ncommittee substitute, as modified, be considered as original text for \npurpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \ncommittee amendment is so modified.\n  The modifications are as follows:\n\n       On page 48, line 4, strike ``and''.\n       On page 48, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       ``(J) an opportunity for public comment in the approval \n     process; and\n       On page 44, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       (g) Mapping.--Section 60102(c) is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following:\n       ``(4) Promoting Public Awareness.--\n       ``(A) Not later than one year after the date of enactment \n     of Accountable Pipeline Safety and Accountability Act of \n     1996, and annually thereafter, the owner or operator of each \n     interstate gas pipeline facility shall provide to the \n     governing body of each municipality in which the interstate \n     gas pipeline facility is located, a map identifying the \n     location of such facility; and\n       ``(B)(i) Not later than June 1, 1998, the Secretary shall \n     survey and assess the public education programs under section \n     60116 and the public safety programs under section 60102(c) \n     and determine their effectiveness and applicability as \n     components of a model program.

Have we adopted the manager's amendment?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Yes.\n  Mr. EXON. It was my hope, Mr. President, that we were ready to pass \nthe bill. It was my hope that we would pass the bill in wrap-up last \nnight. That was not possible. It was my hope that we would wrap it up \nand pass it earlier today at noon. That was not possible.\n  It was my hope, Mr. President, that we could wrap it up now. I am \nadvised that is not possible, and the responsibility at this time is on \nthis side of the aisle, I say to my friends on the other side of the \naisle. The measure is open to amendment, and if anyone ever wonders why \nit takes so long to get anything done in the U.S. Senate, after endless \nhours of consultation, double consultation, this is a typical case in \npoint. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I join that request for a quorum call, \nbut I just would like to join in those remarks 100 percent. I might \nalso take this opportunity to say that I am in the process of placing a \nstatement in the Congressional Record relative to what a great Senator \nSenator Exon has been in the Senate and what a great colleague he has \nbeen to work with.\n  I share his frustration at this moment. He is a lucky man in that he \nis retiring from this body, so he will not have these frustrations in \nthe future. I do not think they are going to change very much, but I am \nequally frustrated. We are ready to pass this bill on this side of the \naisle. Whenever you give me the nod, we will go.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from South Dakota for \nthose kind remarks. I simply say to him that I was misinformed. I will \ncheck into this. I will see who in the world it is that wants to make \nan amendment to this measure but is not here to do it in an orderly \nfashion. I will report back to the Senate and to my friend from South \nDakota as soon as I am able to get that information, if I can get the \ninformation.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take a moment to pay tribute to the \nU.S. hockey team. As many of my colleagues may know, Team USA won the \nWorld Cup of Hockey last Saturday night with a decisive 5-2 victory \nover Canada.\n  This was an extraordinary tournament. All the traditional hockey \npowers--countries such as Canada, Russia, and Sweden--sent their very \nbest players to this competition. Unlike the Olympics, in which the \nteams have been made up principally of amateur players, these players \nwere strictly professionals. It was the best in the world against the \nbest in the world.\n  At the outset, the Americans were the underdogs. In the end, however, \nnot only did we win, but we dominated play throughout the tournament.\n  As an American, I was thrilled to read about Team USA's outstanding \nperformance. But I am particularly proud of this team's accomplishments \nas a Rhode Islander.\n  The team was assembled by Lou Lamoriello--a native of Rhode Island \nand a former head coach of the Providence College hockey team. Lou is \nnow the president and general manager of the New Jersey Devils.\n  The team's assistant general manager was Jack Ferreira, a graduate of \nLaSalle Academy in Providence, and a former assistant coach for Brown \nUniversity.\n  The team was coached by Ron Wilson. He grew up in East Providence and \nplayed hockey for Providence College. He's now the head coach of the \nAnaheim Mighty Ducks.\n  Defenseman Mathieu Schneider is a graduate of Mount Saint Charles \nHigh School in Woonsocket, RI.\n  The athletic trainer, Peter Demers, a long-time trainer for the Los \nAngeles Kings, is originally from Pawtucket.\n  To top it off, the team trained at Providence College's Schneider \nArena.\n  So you can see that this team had a distinct Rhode Island flavor to \nit. And so, I join with all Rhode Islanders and Americans in \ncongratulating the U.S. hockey team for their marvelous achievement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, has the Pastore rule expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. It has not? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nout of order for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Hearing no objection, the Senator is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10942-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10942-S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DAVID PRYOR\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator David Pryor is retiring from the \nSenate at the end of this session after giving 18 years of exceptional \nservice to the people of Arkansas and to the Nation. His quiet, \nthoughtful manner, his unfailing good humor, his wise counsel, and his \nnatural leadership will be missed here.\n  I think of that quotation from Edmund Burke, the great Irish \nstatesman, orator, and writer, who observed in his ``Reflections on the \nRevolution in France'':\n\n       Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the \n     field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of \n     great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, \n     chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those \n     who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field . . \n     .\n\n  The Congress is an open field for serenading grasshoppers, who make a \nlot of noise unmatched by significant accomplishment. Senator Pryor, on \nthe other hand, shuns the limelight of the Senate stage to devote his \nenergies to quietly and tenaciously improving living conditions for \nAmerican citizens, particularly the elderly.\n  Senator Pryor began his political career in Arkansas investigating \nabuses in nursing homes, even working undercover as an orderly to \ngather firsthand evidence. As the Chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging for 6 years, Senator Pryor has led the crusade to \nprotect America's elderly and to oversee Medicare. On the health care \nfront, Senator Pryor labored valiantly to craft a workable solution to \nthe massive health care reform effort in the last Congress.\n  His concern for the elderly has led Senator Pryor to become an expert \non, and a vocal critic of, the prices pharmaceutical companies charge \nfor prescription drugs. And he has matched his criticism with action. \nSenator Pryor was instrumental in requiring drug companies to charge \nthe same prices to state-federal Medicaid programs for the poor as they \ndo to other bulk-drug purchasers.\n  During this Congress, Senator Pryor has led a fight to close a \nloophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade legislation that \ncreates a windfall for name-brand pharmaceutical companies by \nprotecting them from generic competition under GATT. This loophole, a \ncreation of error rather than of intent, means that consumers, and \nespecially pensioners dependent on prescriptions that eat up a large \npercentage of their fixed incomes, are paying more for their \nprescriptions than otherwise would have been the case. I am proud to \nhave supported Senator Pryor's tenacious and repeated efforts to remedy \nthis problem. Although unsuccessful to date, Senator Pryor's leadership \non this important issue merits commendation.\n  On the Finance Committee, Senator Pryor has consistently worked to \nimprove the notoriously painful interactions between the IRS and \nindividual taxpayers. On the Agriculture Committee, he has championed \nissues important to the hardworking farmers laboring in the cotton and \nrice fields of Arkansas. This search for a balm to smooth the rough \nedges of life, to offer oil to calm the troubled waters of public \nexchange, is characteristic of the gentle Senator from Arkansas.\n  In the behind-the-scenes life of the Senate, Senator Pryor has worked \nto encourage civility and order. He has provided leadership as the \nSecretary of the Democratic Conference in the 102nd and 103rd \nCongresses. He built the consensus that over a decade ago introduced \nfamily-friendly procedural changes, some of which are still in effect \ntoday, that restored some discipline to the way this body conducts its \nbusiness. The time limits on votes and the recess schedule that we \nstill attempt to follow are the lasting fruits of his labors.\n  Senator Pryor has not limited his concern for family time to Senators \nalone. He cast a critical vote to override President Bush's veto of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act in the 102nd Congress, helping to provide \na safety net for family members to look after a newborn, or a sick or \ndying relative, without risking the loss of their job.\n  Another way in which Senator Pryor has enriched the life of the \nSenate and demonstrated his sincere devotion to young people is his \ncontinuing consideration for the Senate pages. These young people, whom \nwe see every day on the floor and busily running our errands throughout \nthe Capitol complex, have come from around the Nation to learn from us, \nas well as to assist us. Whether from large cities or rural areas, few, \nif any, of these young people are ever fully prepared for the demands \nand challenges of life on Capitol Hill, as many of us are not, until \nthey have plunged into the midst of it. Having been a page himself, \nSenator Pryor knows firsthand that sometimes the learning part of this \nheady experience can be swamped under the working part.\n  But he makes the time and takes the time to talk with the pages--and \nthat\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nis quite a learning experience, for those of us who take the time to \ntalk with them; I have often done that over the years--and to share \nwith them his insight and his wisdom, to decipher for them the \nimportance of what might be occurring on the floor, and to listen to \ntheir questions and their concerns.\n  His interest in them is genuine, and it has made him a favorite of \ngenerations of pages. This is yet another facet of the quiet but \nextraordinary legacy of courtesy and accomplishment bequeathed to the \nSenate and to the Nation by Senator Pryor.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Pryor for his service to the Senate \nand to the Nation. He has not trumpeted his ambitions, not made big \nnoises like half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern, but has led by \nexample, earning the genuine esteem and respect of his colleagues and \nthe admiration of so many others whose lives he has touched. I wish him \ngood health and happiness in his retirement. As he listens to the \ncrickets chirping in the Arkansas dusk, raising their noisy chorus to \nthe rising Arkansas moon, I hope that he remembers us as fondly as we \nwill remember him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Pressler] \nis recognized.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to commend our former majority \nleader on his great remarks about David Pryor. His remarks have \ninspired me to say a few words about David. I have been trying to say a \nfew words about each retiring Senator. But David Pryor has been a \nfriend of mine. In fact, I have been down to Arkansas to his charitable \nevent that he has to raise money in Texarkana several times. I have \nalso been down to Little Rock to speak at college events. I feel that I \nhave gotten to know David and Barbara Pryor quite well.\n  He is a legendary figure in this body because he is, I think, one of \nthe President's best friends, and David Pryor can go straight to the \nPresident with certain information or projects. That is an unusual \nresponsibility for a Senator to have.\n  But he is sort of a legendary U.S. Senator in that he came here as a \npage, I believe. He was in the House of Representatives when I was over \nin the House. I have followed his career for a number of years with \ngreat admiration.\n  I shall miss David Pryor a great deal. He has done a lot of \nlegislation. I serve with him on the Senate Finance Committee. I serve \nwith him on the Senate Committee on Aging. But more than that, he is my \nfriend. I shall miss David Pryor. We all come and go. David Pryor is \nleaving a little early, in my opinion, and I shall miss him very much. \nI join in those wonderful remarks paying tribute to Senator David Pryor \nof Arkansas.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Madam President, I objected regarding the Pipeline \nSafety Act, which I am trying very hard to pass. I will not object if \nthe Senator desires to discuss issues unrelated.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to discuss an unrelated matter. If it \nbecomes apparent that you can move ahead in terms of final disposition, \nI will withhold further comments. If I could, I ask unanimous consent \nto proceed with what I expect to be 12 or 15 minutes on the issue of \neducation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10942-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10943-S10945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, on Tuesday, the Republicans announced, \nwith great fanfare, an education amendment that is a day late and $800 \nmillion short. It restores $2.3 billion of $3.1 billion necessary to \nmeet the President's request for fiscal year 1997. But this amendment \nis hardly motivated by concern for the students of America. It is an \nelection-eve conversion, and the American people should not be fooled.\n  As costs, student enrollments and college debts soar, the Republicans \nare offering ``education lite.'' The increase they offer falls well \nshort of the funding needed just to keep pace with inflation and \nenrollment increases.\n  Senator Lott himself admitted the amendment was designed to meet the \npolitical needs of the Republican Party, not the educational needs of \nAmerican students. Senator Lott said on Tuesday, ``We can either get \nour brains beat out politically, or we can get in there and mix it up \nwith them, and that's what we are going to do.''\n  Republicans are running scared from the fact that the American people \nsupport education. Their change of heart is cynical and hypocritical, \nand it will not last past the November election.\n  What Trent Lott gives with one hand, Newt Gingrich is already \nplanning to take away with the other. The Republican leaders in the \nHouse are telling their rank and file not to get excited because they \ncan rescind the money later. House Republican conference member John \nBoehner said, in appropriations --and Bob Livingstone agreed--that ``we \ncan always have a rescissions bill in January.''\n  Senator Lott and the Republicans are fleeing from their anti-\neducation record, but they better not look back, because if they do, \nthe sight of all their cuts in education might turn them into pillars \nof salt.\n  When the Dole-Gingrich Republican leadership took over in 1995, their \neducation agenda was stark and severe: abolish the Department of \nEducation and slash Federal support for schools and college students.\n  From January 1995 to the present, Republicans have proposed education \ncuts every chance they have had: on rescission bills, on budget \nresolutions, on appropriations bills and continuing resolutions. When \nDemocrats refused to let these devastating cuts pass, Republicans shut \ndown the Government because they could not get their way.\n  With the help of students and parents across the country, we turned \nback the worst of these anti-education funding measures for fiscal year \n1996.\n  Republicans did not learn. In this year's budget resolution, they \nagain propose to slash education, this time by 20 percent over the next \n6 years.\n  The record of the past 2 years is clear. It is clear that Republicans \nare no friends of education, and it is equally clear that the American \npeople do not want education cut. The current election-eve Republican \n``education lite'' amendment has no credibility. It is written in \ndisappearing ink. Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and their allies have an \nirresistible impulse to slash education to pay for tax breaks for the \nwealthy. And Democrats will not let that happen.\n  Madam President, this chart illustrates clearly exactly where we are \non the issue of education. The black line going back to 1995 is \nPresident Clinton's request. That line represents inflation plus \nexpanded enrollment. We have expanded enrollment in the elementary and \nsecondary schools, going up to 52 million or 53 million, and expanded \nenrollment as well in higher education. This particular line reflects \nthe increase that is necessary to deal with the problems of inflation, \nexpanded student population in the K-12 well as in higher education.\n  This line here reflects what was actually the fiscal year 1995 level \nof funding in terms of constant dollars. This $600 million loss \nrepresents the figure that was effectively agreed to after the proposal \nby the Republicans of $1.7 billion in rescissions in 1995. Their \nproposal was to cut $1.7 billion. We were able to resist that, and the \nfinal figure that was set was $600 million in rescissions. These were \nmoneys already going out to schools all across the country, K-12--also \navailable, some of the funding, in terms of higher education \nappropriated in previous years. Their proposal reduced this by $1.7 \nbillion.\n  We see that this $3.9 billion cut represents the House appropriations \nin 1995. The continuing resolution brought it back to $3.1 billion. \nFinally, just before the Government shutdown\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nthat took place here, there was an add-on of $2.7 billion, and the \nnegotiation which took place at that time brought us to $400 million \nless than level funding--in absolute dollars. There is a significant \nreduction here in terms of the real purchasing power in education. We \nsee, once again, in this year's House appropriations, a cut of $1.5 \nbillion. The Senate cuts in appropriations are not as severe as in the \nHouse appropriations.\n  The press asked us why we are bringing this up at this particular \ntime. The fact is that the Senate Appropriations Committee met last \nweek and finally resolved the dollar figure that was reached by that \ncommittee. Within a day, under the leadership of Senator Daschle, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Kerry, Senator Levin, Senator Wellstone, and \nothers, we announced that we would be offering an amendment that would \nrestore the $3.1 billion difference between the President's request and \nwhat was actually coming out of the Senate Appropriations Committee. So \nwe did that at the end of last week. We tried to offer the amendment \nearlier this week. We were denied that opportunity, and we were \nnotified then that the Republicans had decided to an add-on of some \n$2.3 billion.\n  Mr. President, of course, if they had made that add-on last week, for \na good chunk of these education programs, we would not have this kind \nof difference. So I say election year conversion because what a \ndifference a week makes. What a difference a week makes in terms of the \nRepublican position.\n  The fact of the matter is, on each and every occasion since 1995, on \nany budget, any appropriation, any reconciliation, any continuing \nresolution, any time the issue of funding for education has been out \nthere, there has been a reduction.\n  I want to take notice here, Madam President, and say that there have \nbeen some notable exceptions among our Republican friends. I \nacknowledge the Senator from Maine, who has placed a high priority in \neducation, and Senator Hatfield, and a few others. But this chart \nrepresents the ongoing and continuing record that has taken place.\n  Basically, we are talking about the rescissions of 1995, where it was \n$1.7 billion. In the 7-year budget resolution of 1996, they proposed a \nFederal slash of one-third over 7 years in Federal investment in \neducation. The deep cuts came in college aid, $10.6 billion in student \nloan cuts, and a freeze on Pell grants, which reduces their value by 40 \npercent, or effectively eliminates grants to 1 million students. You \ncan have it either way. That is the effect of their recommendation in \nterms of funding the Pell grant. Cutbacks in other education--and this \nis in 1996--such as 350,000 preschool children who would lose Head \nStart, 2 million children who would lose title I, reading and math, and \nprograms to keep schools safe and drug-free would be cut back for 39 \nmillion students. That was in 1996.\n  On the budget reconciliation, listen to what was recommended. The \nRepublican majority carried out of our Labor Committee a 2-percent \nstudent loan tax on every college and university in the country. Do we \nunderstand that? A 2-percent tax on every college. That 2-percent tax \nwould be on the amount of scholarship aid and assistance. So when you \ntake a school like Northeastern University, 80 percent of the kids that \ngo there, their parents never have completed college; 85 percent are \nworking 25 hours a week or more. These are individuals who are hungry, \nthey are gifted, but they don't have great resources and they are \ntrying to make it to enhance their own opportunities for advancement in \nour society. This 2-percent tax would have particularly hit Boston \nUniversity by $750,000 to $800,000 a year, which meant anywhere from 18 \nto 20 students' scholarship help that the university would not have \nbeen able to provide. That was one aspect. They raised interest rates \non the Plus Loan. The Plus Loans are basically for middle-income, \nworking families. It gives them additional opportunity at a somewhat \nlower rate for educational loans to supplement their children who are \nin college. The Republicans eliminated the interest-free grace period \nfor students beginning to repay after graduation. We now have a 6-month \nperiod.\n\n  The fact remains that that 6 months is a key period for the student \nto get a decent job. They wanted to eliminate it and start repayment at \nthe time of graduation, which would have put additional pressure on the \nstudents to become employed because they would have had to start \nrepaying their debt. If you ask Secretary Riley what is the impact of \nthat grace period on students repaying their debt, his testimony, and \nall the testimony, is that if you give them a grace period, they have \nmore time to get a good job, one that they want to stay with and one \nwhere they will have an enhanced opportunity for repayment.\n  So those are some of the areas of the cuts, as well as cutting back \nand putting a cap of 10 percent on the direct loan program. That direct \nloan program, which moved us up toward a division of total student aid \nso that we would have competition between the guarantee and direct loan \nprograms, was agreed to by Republicans and Democrats in the previous \nCongress. Nonetheless, this was closed down, and it would only be 10 \npercent.\n  The amendment that was offered here on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nto permit each college to make its own judgment whether it wanted to go \nto direct loan or guaranteed loan was overwhelmingly defeated by those \nwho want to continue the guaranteed loan program, which will mean that \n$127 billion will go through the guaranteed agencies over a 6- to 7-\nyear period. It means anywhere from $7 to $10 billion in profits to \nthose agencies, which is basically money that is coming out of the \npockets and pocketbooks of working families.\n  The 1996 appropriations bill is cutting education 16 percent. It \nterminated Perkins loans and student initiative grants for the neediest \nstudents. It raised the Pell minimum grant to $600. The effect of that \nis that you eliminate awards to 175,000 low-income students. The bill \ncuts back title I by $1.1 billion to deny reading and math to over a \nmillion children. It cuts back Head Start by $140 million, denying \npreschool to 48,000 children.\n  Then we come to the continuing resolution of January 26, 1996. That \ncut education by $3.1 billion from 1995 levels, a 13-percent cut.\n  The final omnibus resolution reduced education $400 million, after \nthe Senate adopted the Specter-Harkin amendment, which restored $2.7 \nbillion in education. That amendment passed 84 to 16.\n  So during this national debate about how there is a distortion and \nmisrepresentation about who is for education, even when we had the \nprincipal instrument to recover and restore some of that education, \nsupported at that time by a number of Republicans--there were 16 \nRepublican Members of the Senate who said ``no.''\n  Now, a 6-year budget resolution, which was passed in May and June \n1996, cuts Pell grants by $6.2 billion over 6 years. It cuts work study \nfor 800,000 students. It cuts title I for over 300,000 children. The \nlist goes on.\n  The final point I make, Mr. President--and I will include this \nanalysis as part of the Record--is that the Republican platform, in \nAugust, said, ``We will abolish the Department of Education.''\n  Maybe there have to be adjustments in some of the agencies of \nGovernment. But I would suggest that most American families want to \nhave the Secretary of Education at the President's elbow every single \nday of the year saying, ``What about the education of the children of \nthis country? What are we going to do about that?''\n  Money can't solve all of the problems. But what changes are necessary \nto make academic achievement and accomplishment, enhanced standards, \nand improved quality education available? I think most Americans would \nsay of all the agencies of Government, certainly you need Defense, \ncertainly you need the Secretary of State and maybe the Treasury. But I \ntell you. The Secretary of Education is right up there among American \npriorities.\n  So why do the Republicans want to abolish the Department of \nEducation, and now in the final hours come back and say, ``Oh, well, we \nare really for education--we are the education Congress?'' It is \nsomething that I have difficulty understanding.\n  Earlier in the day we were asked, ``What about the Republicans' \nproposal, the Lott amendment?'' I just\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\npoint out very briefly that this amendment does not meet critical \nneeds--no increase in the Head Start Program, and no increase in \nteacher training.\n  We just had the Carnegie Commission report a week ago that one of the \nprincipal deficiencies in our educational system is that we are not \ngetting enough teachers that are well trained, nor are teachers getting \nenhanced training. We have tried to restore the administration's \nrequest in this area. The Republicans offer no additional funding for \nteacher training; no money for the TRIO Program, which is academic \nsupport for disadvantaged students; and no money for School to Work. \nThese are crucial programs. Twenty years ago, if you graduated from \nhigh school you were making 65 or 70 percent of what a college graduate \nwas making. That percentage has dropped to about 55 percent--the \ngrowing income gap that is taking place.\n  We tried with School to Work to move three out of four kids that do \nnot go on to college into the private sector. It has been strongly \nsupported by Republicans in a number of States.\n  Again, I refer to the distinguished Governor of Maine, the husband of \nour chair, who is one of the very innovative Governors in moving toward \nthe School to Work Program, and other Republican Governors and \nDemocratic Governors as well.\n  There is no money for summer jobs, even though about 40 percent of \nall the summer job programs have academic provisions. There were funds \nin terms of other education programs. I had hoped that we would take \nthose increases and put them in for increases to the President's \nrequest here on the floor of the Senate, or in the continuing \nresolution. We would get a positive response--an overwhelming \nresponse--in favor of those measures.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10943-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10945-S10947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FUNDING EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Madam President, I am here to answer some of the \nstatements made by the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy. Unfortunately, I did \nnot hear all of the comments but some that I heard made by Senator \nKennedy regarding education need to be answered.\n  It just is not the case that education has been slashed by \nRepublicans over the last 6 to 8 years, and I really find it very \ndisappointing that somehow this keeps coming up. It is easy to make a \nstatement saying education has been slashed and decimated by \nRepublicans without any real understanding of the programs under \ndiscussion, what has been debated and what resolutions have been made \nbecause, actually, education budgets have continued to climb.\n  I think nearly all of us at least would acknowledge that money alone \nis not the answer to quality education. It certainly has been important \nfor us to have a support system when we are asked to help with special \neducation moneys, moneys for disadvantaged students, moneys for \ndisabled students, for the student loan program. But money alone is not \nthe answer.\n  We are now spending more than $25 billion in our budget for \neducation, and there has to be some understanding of what it is all \nabout. For one thing, we have dramatically increased money for Head \nStart programs, which are preschool programs for those young children \nwho need most to have that assistance.\n  At the time we worked on the legislation to increase Head Start \nfunding, we also incorporated changes in the program which were \ndesigned to enhance the quality of delivery of Head Start programs. \nSome States have outstanding Head Start programs. Other States have not \npulled together the network that I think is necessary for quality \npreschool education. But that money has been increased.\n  As for student loans, I think it is exceptionally misleading to claim \nthat the student loan program has been decimated. For one thing, all \neligible students applying for a student loan receive a student loan. \nIn 1993, the volume of student loans was $16.1 billion; 3 years later, \nit is $26.6 billion. Students are not being denied student loans.\n  The Pell grant program and the other grant and work-study programs \nhave not been appropriated to the level that has been authorized, and \nthat has always been a concern. But it is also a fact that funding for \nthose programs has not been reduced. Whether it has grown to the level \nit should grow perhaps should be the question. I think it is very \nimportant for us to debate these issues in the context of understanding \nwhat is, and is not, occurring in education.\n  We have figures which show, as I pointed out earlier, that we are \nincreasing, and have continued to increase every year, the budget for \nour education programs. Whether it should be increased more or less has \nbeen a subject of debate.\n  I particularly would like to address the student loan program because \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, attacked the efforts to \ncut the student loan program. When we debated whether to have direct \nlending for student loans, the intent was to help if students wanted to \nget their student loan money immediately when they registered for \npostsecondary education. It did not in any way mean a student was going \nto pay less on their student loan, and in fact, it was through \nRepublican initiatives in trying to reduce some of the bureaucracy and \nsome of the requirements on the student loan that did produce what \nsavings could be achieved for students.\n  Direct lending, as such, in no way changed the amount of funding that \nis available to students. This has been, I think, poorly understood. \nSomehow it has been portrayed as a choice between supposedly greedy \nbanks or the Federal Government that would handle student loans. We \nmissed completely, I think, the part of the debate regarding who should \nbe responsible for cutting the checks for the student loan program, who \ncan do it the best, and who should bear the responsibility for those \nloans and for payments that have not been collected.\n  I, myself, thought it was something we should go somewhat slowly on, \nso that we could understand the effects of the Federal Government \ntotally handling the student loan program, or whether we should \ncontinue to let it also be an initiative in which the banks and the \nstudent lending guaranty agencies could be involved, believing they \nwere going to be better able to collect on the loans than the Federal \nGovernment. I believe it is something we can and should continue to \ndebate. But that program has not been decimated by efforts of \nRepublicans to somehow cut student loans.\n  I think it is interesting that, in the first half of President \nClinton's administration, when the Democrats controlled the Congress, \nactual spending for education programs fell on the average of $1 \nbillion below the President's request. I do not intend to get into a \ntit for tat on educational spending, however. Being a member of a local \nschool board at one time before I came to the Senate, and as chairman \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee responsible for education \nfunding, there is nothing that I care more about than being certain \nthat we do have quality education in this country. That is something \neveryone is dedicated to. How much of that can be guaranteed by moneys \nwe spend here in Washington is another matter. In some cases it is \nclearly something we need to do, particularly when we mandate certain \nrequirements on schools. Then, we must be willing to be a participant \nin helping to pay for those mandates. That, I think, has been \nparticularly true with initiatives such as the education for disabled \nstudents. We mandated the inclusion of those students in public \nschools, and I think we should be willing to help continue to fund the \nneeds of that mandate.\n  But I suggest that, as we debate education today, most citizens in \nthis country realize the success of excellence in education really \ndepends on our local communities, our local school boards, and students \nand parents who will recognize the importance of quality education and \nare willing to invest the time and the resources to see that\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\nwe have it. I think there is no sadder indictment of education in \ngeneral than the fact that some students are taking student loans when \nthey graduate from high school but then have to take remedial reading \nwhen they get to college. We are doing a great disservice to the \nstudents in our Nation when they pile up an indebtedness of student \nloans but are not prepared to take advantage of the higher education \nthey are receiving, whether it be in liberal arts or vocational-\ntechnical education.\n  We have to give those students--and it is not just we here in the \nFederal Government, but each and every one of us--the ability and the \nopportunity to achieve excellence in education. It should be the \nstudents themselves who will have the self-discipline to recognize the \nimportance of that to them.\n  But right here in the Nation's Capitol we have not been able, with \nall the money that has gone into the District of Columbia, to hold up \nour heads with the primary and secondary schools that we have here in \nthe District of Columbia. It is a shame that we have students who have \nto walk through metal detectors for fear of what might occur, a \nshooting in a high school. It is a shame that we have leaking roofs and \ncrumbling infrastructure in our elementary schools. Every child in this \ncountry should be able to attend the elementary school in their \nneighborhood that has the highest quality of education to be offered.\n  But I would just suggest, and I am sure the Senator from \nMassachusetts believes the same as I do, that this is something that \nour Nation does care about. We have always been a country that cares \nabout education. We have always been a country that hands off, as a \nlegacy to the next generation, our belief in the importance of \neducation. But it is totally wrong to say that we have decimated this \nopportunity for excellence in education because Republicans have \nslashed the education budget. That is not the case, Madam President, \nand that is not the answer to excellence and quality in education. We \nneed to work together to the extent that we can to find those programs \nthat can be of help. We have done that before and we should continue to \ndo so.\n  It has been a big disappointment to me that the Democratic side of \nthe aisle has not been supportive of efforts which we have undertaken, \nand which we passed unanimously, except for two votes, to initiate job \ntraining reform efforts and strong support for vocational education \ninitiatives, which are an important component of our desires to achieve \na working partnership between the Federal, State and local governments. \nThat, I think, is one of the answers that we need to look to when we \nlook at what the Federal responsibilities may be in assisting in \neducation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I made some comments earlier in a \npresentation about the record, about the resources of the Congress in \nthe last several years. When I returned to my office, I saw my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Kassebaum, addressing the issue of \neducation, and returned to hear her pearls of wisdom on this issue.\n  Senator Kassebaum's suggestion that education funding has been \nslashed over a 6-year period is simply mistaken. In every year since \nfiscal year 1990, education spending has increased. In fiscal years \n1994 and 1995, education appropriations increased by $1.1 billion and \n$0.9 billion. It was not until the Republican takeover that Congress \nproposed to slash education spending.\n  There are just a few more points I want to add at this time. I tried \nearlier to point out what the Congress had actually done in allocating \nresources. The fact that you spend money does not necessarily mean you \nare going to end up with good education. That is a given. But it is a \nreflection of your priorities. And when we have a reduction in real \nterms, given the expanded student population, both in K-12 and higher \neducation, cutting back in technology and other programs, that is a \nreflection of national priorities.\n  What basically we do as legislators, as the Senator from Kansas \nunderstands so well, is make choices. And we make choices about \npriorities. When we see, now, funding in education at about 1.3 percent \nof our national budget, I think most American families think it is \nconsiderably higher. That number is not concomitant with our commitment \nto the young people of this country. I think it is worthy of pointing \nthat out.\n  The fact of the matter is, if a child goes to school hungry in the \nmorning, that child is not going to be able to learn, even if you spend \nmoney on books and teachers. If you go to a school, you will find that \nclassrooms are in a deteriorating condition. Many of the classrooms in \nmy own State are. A recent report by the General Accounting Office \nshows the deterioration of the physical structures. It is primarily a \nState and local responsibility. But some of the schools in my own city \nof Boston will reach a temperature in the wintertime that is \nsufficiently cold that many of the students will be affected by that \ncold. It will be difficult to teach. If you have inadequate books or \ninadequate training for teachers, students will not learn.\n  We know in many of the schools that we have in this country they are \nspending, by and large, probably double what is being expended in other \nschools, and we know they are getting, by and large, students who are \ngraduating with high abilities. We know, really, what needs to be done.\n  There are shared responsibilities in attempting to do it, but I would \nthink our challenge is how we will push the envelope in this area. How \nare we going to encourage the local communities to enhance and support \nadditional help? How are we going to get the States to recognize this \nas the priority? If we here in the Congress of the United States are \nseen as constantly reducing our commitment in this area, that sends a \nvery powerful message. It is a very powerful message.\n  I do take exception to what has happened in recent years, frankly, \nunder Republican administrations, in higher education. Education in the \n1960 election was one of the prime differences, that, I think, played a \nmajor role: Was the Federal Government going to become involved in \nscholarship help and assistance? One candidate said yes. The other \ncandidate, effectively, said no.\n  And then it was set up for higher education that $3 out of every $4 \ninvested by the Federal Government went into grants, not into loans. \nNow it is just the reverse: $3 out of the $4 are loans, not grants. Yet \nreviews have demonstrated, time and again, that the Federal Treasury \nprofited $8 for every dollar invested in education grants through the \nGI bill.\n  Investments in education pay off, and that has been the lesson. Maybe \nthere are some programs that should be changed. To move back from that \nongoing and continuing commitment is a reflection of different \npriorities, and that is essentially what I think is the point being \nmade.\n  The fact of the matter is, a week ago when we saw the significant \ncuts made by the Senate Republicans and then a week later they come \nback and add $2.2 billion, I doubt very much that somehow the \nRepublican leadership suddenly discovered increasing value in \neducation.\n  A final point I want to make is about questions of higher education \nand the indebtedness of students. One of the very important aspects of \nthe Direct Loan Program is not only in the facility of lower interest \nrates and the facility of students to deal with those, but also tuition \ncontingency repayments, which said that if you are a student and you \ngraduate, you might have $10,000 or $15,000 of loans obligated; if you \nwant to be a teacher or you want to be a social worker or you want to \nbe a police officer or you want to be a child care worker or you want \nto be a teacher's aide, then what it is going to mean, in terms of your \nrepayment, is a percent of your income--just a percent --for a period \nof time.\n  That says to the young people, OK, maybe we haven't gotten it quite \nright at the Federal level in terms of the ratio of direct loans to \ngrants, but I tell you what we are going to do. Even if you have to \nborrow, we will make it affordable so you only have to pay it at 5 \npercent or 7 percent.\n  That is an enormous, enormous advantage to students. I don't think \nyou could find a handful of students in this country who would turn \ntheir backs on that particular opportunity. That was part of our Direct \nLoan Program. We stood out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and \nsaid, ``Let the colleges make their own decision whether they\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nwant the Direct Loan Program or the Guaranteed Loan Program. Let the \ncolleges, let the students.''\n  What is more democratic than that? What is more local empowerment \nthan that? What gets more power from the Federal Government back to the \nStates and the colleges than that particular proposal? You would think \nthat was a proposal that would carry. Absolutely not. We were closed \ndown. Virtually unanimous support in opposition to that by our \nRepublican friends.\n  So I hope as we come into these last days that parents, students, \nbusiness leaders, and young people who are not going on to college--\nthose who are concerned about the future of this country--really study \nthis record well.\n  Any time Senator Kassebaum speaks about education, there is a great \ndeal for us to learn from her comments. I always do. Although I missed \nher remarks earlier, I look forward to reading them in the Record.\n  But I do think there is a pretty central difference in the record of \nthe two political parties on the priority of education. The President \nhas stated that education, Medicare, and environmental issues are his \npriorities, and it was only after there were significant cuts in those \nthat the Government was shut down. I think the American people remember \nthat.\n  We speak today about one aspect of those priorities, and it is \neducation. I think the American people place a very high priority on \nit. They place a great responsibility on all of us to try and make \nwhatever we allocate more effective in enhancing student achievement \nand accomplishments in schools and colleges across this country.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, if I can comment for a moment. We can \nprobably go on all afternoon talking about education, but I am sure \nthere are those who would like to get back to the pipeline bill.\n  We can have dueling charts. I don't think that helps us at this \njuncture. The Senator from Massachusetts raised many of the same \npriorities in education that I did. We worry about crumbling \ninfrastructure, we worry about the quality of education, we worry about \nbeing able to attract the best and the brightest teachers into \nteaching. All of these things are a part of the educational debate.\n  I think where we differ, and differ significantly, is whether the \nFederal Government is the answer to all of those questions, and I \nsuggest not. I believe most Americans realize that is so. Federal \ndollars in education are less than 10 percent of the education dollars \nspent in this country. Local and State governments spend, I think, \nabout $508 billion in education. I happen to believe that it still \nshould be a question of local and State authority on education.\n  The Federal Government can provide support, but if we start to rely \nmore and more on Federal dollars coming from here in Washington and \nbelieve that solves the problem, then I suggest, Mr. President, that we \nare in trouble. That is where we differ: Who bears the main \nresponsibility for the funding of our educational system?\n  I suggest it has worked well, and it will continue and should work \nbest, at the local level. I think that is where there is a fundamental \ndifference.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10945-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10947-S10950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1996\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks \nabout the pipeline bill, because I think this is a very important bill \nfor the future and safety of our country. This is a bill that has been \nworked on for quite a long time. It is a bipartisan bill.\n  I am very pleased that we have a safety pipeline program, we have a \nfunding source. We are reauthorizing the Federal Pipeline Safety \nProgram. I think everyone has worked in good faith. In fact, the bill \nis sponsored by Senator Lott, cosponsored by Senators Pressler, \nStevens, Hutchison, Burns, Shelby, Cochran, Frist, Inhofe, Breaux, \nFord, Exon, Inouye, Johnston, and Heflin. I think all of us want to \nmake sure that the pipelines that are running through the ground in our \ncountry are as safe as they can possibly be.\n  Of course, we have user fees that pay for the safety inspections and \nthe Office of Pipeline Safety. I think this bill also adds some simple \nand flexible risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses to some of \nthese new regulations. So I think we are going to be taking a giant \nstep in the right direction with this bill.\n  It does authorize the Office of Pipeline Safety funding through the \nyear 2000 so that we will know that the source is good and that it is \nat a reasonable level. It is about what our budget resolution is today, \nand I think that we have made a great improvement.\n  So I am very pleased to support this bill as the new chairman of the \nsubcommittee from which this bill came.\n  I think we have a good, bipartisan compromise that is going to move \npipeline safety very, very much into the forefront of our consciousness \nas we continue to put down more pipeline and take more energy to the \npeople of this country.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Lautenberg, who has also worked very \nhard on this bill, has remarks to make. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Texas. I know that she has \nan interest in safety with our pipelines. Obviously, coming from a \nState like she does, there is a great deal of interest in providing the \nresource, the gas, that travels through these pipelines because it is \nan efficient and cost-effective way of taking care of our energy needs.\n  I want to also extend my accommodation to the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, for his work on this bill, as well as the chairman and \nthe ranking minority member of the Commerce Committee, Senator Pressler \nand Senator Hollings, and the other Senators who have worked hard and \nwho have contributed to this legislation.\n  The bill before us enhances our existing pipeline safety program in a \nnumber of ways. For example, it would promote one-call programs to \nensure that those who dig in the ground can easily find out where the \npipelines are located--not only find out, but must know where the \npipelines are located.\n  The bill would also increase funding for pipeline safety programs and \nmake other improvements. At the same time, I do have some concerns \nabout certain provisions in the legislation which could limit the \nregulators' abilities to adequately manage the program.\n  Frankly, it does not go all the way that I would like it to go, but \nit certainly is an improvement on the status quo and should improve \npipeline safety significantly.\n  Mr. President, I have a special interest in this bill--I am sure many \nin this room are aware of it--because an explosion took place in my \nState a couple of years ago, and our experience with it was one that \nwill stay permanently etched in the memories of people in New Jersey.\n  What happened there was almost inexplicable because, though the \ndamage, the physical damage, was extensive, fortunately it was limited \nto one death. There could have been many more. That one death was as a \nresult of someone's physical disability who had come in to be in touch \nwith friends who lived in the neighborhood. It was terrible. That was \n2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  That rupture in a gas pipeline led to a terrible explosion in Edison, \nNJ. The blast created an enormous fireball that could be seen for miles \naround. It leveled eight apartment buildings and left a gaping hole in \nthe ground. It reminded me, very frankly, Mr. President, of some of my \nwartime experiences when bombed-out areas were left with buildings \nflattened and holes, craters, in the ground. That is what this looked \nlike.\n  The explosion and the fire injured more than 100 people and brought \non, as I said, the death of one person, a fatal heart attack of a 32-\nyear-old woman who had come to visit friends who were in the area. And \n150 families\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\nwere made homeless. Not surprisingly, many of the victims are still \ndealing with the emotional, psychological, and financial consequences \nof the explosion.\n  Mr. President, I visited the site of this disaster with Senator \nBradley very shortly after it took place. We saw the devastation \nfirsthand. It was a sobering experience. Nobody could witness a scene \nlike that without being committed to doing everything possible to \nprevent similar tragedies from happening in the future.\n\n  In response to the explosion in New Jersey, I began to explore \nvarious ways that pipelines could be made safer. I talked with experts \nfrom around the country, and I developed legislation, now introduced as \nS. 162, that did propose a variety of steps.\n  First, my bill promoted the establishment of the so-called one-call \nprogram. One-call very simply requires anyone who is about to dig--a \nbuilder, construction company--to simply make a telephone call to make \nsure that where they are going to dig is not dangerous because of \npipelines. This is important because two-thirds of all pipeline \naccidents are caused by people who dig without knowing where they are \ndigging.\n  So I say, they must know. So I am pleased that the bill before us, \nlike my own, would promote one-call programs and direct the Office of \nPipeline Safety to help States establish these programs.\n  Another provision in my bill required the use of remote control \nshutoff valves. Mr. President, given the state of technology in the \nworld today, you would think this kind of thing would be used \nroutinely, which simply means that someone in a remote location with \nsome visual contact through electronic means could see what is \nhappening and start turning down the cutoff valves. Unfortunately, that \nvery simple technology was not used in this case. But it is now being \nused.\n  Too often when a major leak occurs, pipeline operators must \nphysically travel to the site of the leak and manually turn off a huge \nvalve. This process can take many hours. After the Edison explosion, it \ntook over 3 hours to shut off the valve, the valve that was producing \nthe gas flow to continue the flames and the destruction that was taking \nplace, in large part, because the shutoff valve was manual and took \nover 700 turns to close. Meanwhile, again, the dangerous gas was \nescaping into the environment. Remote control shutoff valves would have \nsolved this problem in fairly quick fashion.\n  So I am pleased that the managers of the bill were able to include a \nprovision in the managers' amendment that would require that DOT, which \nhas jurisdiction here, study the feasibility of these devices. If, as I \nexpect, the Secretary determines that the devices are feasible and \nwould reduce risks of pipeline accidents, the Secretary would be \nrequired to mandate their use.\n  Another proposal in my bill would allow residents to be notified of \nthe location of the pipelines in their neighborhoods. Citizens have a \nright to know this information. A better informed public leads to \nimproved safety. So I am pleased that the managers of the bill have \nincluded in their amendment, the managers' amendment, a provision that \nrequires that all operators provide a pipeline map to local \ncommunities.\n  The provision also requires that the Secretary review existing \npipeline safety education programs, determine which ones are the most \neffective, and implement appropriate programs nationwide.\n  My legislation also would have helped ensure that pipeline leaks and \nweaknesses were detected before disasters by promoting the use of so-\ncalled smart pigs. The term ``smart pigs'' refers to technology that \nessentially permits a device to travel through a pipeline and evaluate \nwhether or not there are weaknesses that have to be attended to or that \notherwise could lead to problems in the future. The use of this smart \npig technology is important, especially as more pipes grow older and \nthus more vulnerable to problems.\n\n  The bill before us would authorize OPS, the Office of Pipeline \nSafety, to require the use of smart pigs, though it does not mandate \ntheir regular use, as I would prefer. I am hopeful that OPS will \npromote these tools aggressively.\n  There are other provisions in this bill before us that also mirror \nproposals of mine. One provision would make it a Federal crime to dump \nwaste in pipeline rights of way. This will help protect these rights of \nway from large volumes of material which can damage the pipeline.\n  So, Mr. President, there are several provisions in this bill that I \nsupport and that can help, and will help, to improve pipeline safety. \nAt the same time, however, in my view, the legislation should go \nfarther.\n  For example, I am concerned that the public will not have adequate \ninput in the review of proposed risk demonstration projects. I am also \nconcerned that the bill could make it harder for the Office of Pipeline \nSafety to propose and adopt pipeline safety standards because of new \ncost/benefit requirements.\n  On balance, though, Mr. President, this bill represents a very good \nstep forward. Although far from perfect--and we know around here that \nthe perfect is the enemy of the good; it is said so often and proves \ntrue almost every time--although far from perfect, it should improve \npipeline safety, and it deserves our support.\n  Once more, I thank the majority leader and the other Senators \ninvolved for their work on this bill. I look forward to working with \nthem in the future to ensure that the legislation is implemented \nproperly and effectively, and to consider other steps that can be taken \nthat promote pipeline safety in our communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nreauthorization of the Office of Pipeline Safety (S. 1505).\n  This is a bill which is bipartisan with seven Democratic and nine \nRepublican cosponsors.\n  This is a bill which was unanimously approved by our Commerce \nCommittee.\n  This is a bill which is supported by both the administration and the \nregulated pipeline industry.\n  This is a bill which focuses on just the statute which regulates the \nnatural gas and liquid transmission and distribution industry.\n  This is a bill which is targeted on the role and responsibilities of \nthe Office of Pipeline Safety within the Department of Transportation.\n  This is a bill which deals in a responsive and responsible manner the \nway rules are made for this sector of the energy community; but, I want \nto be very very clear, nothing in this bill will jeopardize the \nintegrity and safety of America's natural gas transmission system. And \nnothing in this bill will reverse the environmental success story of \nthis industry.\n  This is a bill which permits demonstration projects by recognizing \nopportunities for regulatory flexibility.\n  This is a bill where the one-size-fits-all mandate mentality is \nreplaced by responsible creative yet accountable rulemaking.\n  This is a bill which will intimately affect 160 million Americans \nbecause they live in gas heated buildings.\n  This is a bill which governs enough natural gas pipes to go around \nthe Earth 48 times.\n  And, finally this is a bill which has direct impact on under a \nmillion Americans because they work in some aspect of the natural gas \nindustry.\n  The leadership of Senator Pressler and Senator Exon has made this \nmanager's amendment possible, and I want to publicly thank them for \nboth their time and attention to advancing this consensus compromise.\n  Let me say in conclusion: Safety on America's interstate natural gas \npipelines will be enhanced by this legislation. And I want to \nunderscore that environmental protection along America's pipeline \nright-of-ways will also be enhanced by S. 1505.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1505, the \nAccountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the pipeline safety programs that are \nthe responsibility of the Department of Transportation's Office of \nPipeline Safety (OPS). OPS has a tremendous responsibility in ensuring \nthe safety of the nation's gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. The \ncombined interstate pipeline system has approximately 1.8 million miles \nof pipeline, consisting of approximately 1.6 million miles of gas \npipeline and 155,000 miles of hazardous liquid pipeline. Any map of the \nnation's pipeline system shows how much\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\nour population depends on safe pipelines. The question is not whether \npipeline safety programs should be reauthorized. Rather, we must \ndetermine the best way to maintain the safety of the interstate \npipeline system while allowing the pipeline operators and owners to \nprovide the service so necessary to the nation's well-being.\n  The importance of OPS is not theoretical. Many of us can report on \ngas line ruptures and spills in our states in the past. For example, \nthere was a gas pipeline rupture in New Jersey two years ago. There was \na horrible spill in my home state of South Carolina this summer. Over 1 \nmillion gallons was spilled. My staff has spent countless hours in \nmonitoring this disaster. Luckily, the skill and dedication of OPS \nprevented that spill from becoming a major environmental disaster. The \nOPS training exercise with the pipeline owner held just prior to the \nspill contributed to the speed with which the adverse effects of this \nspill were mitigated--most of the spill was cleaned up and the \nremainder evaporated. In this regard, I extend my appreciation to OPS \nfor keeping me informed of the spill and the efforts to redress the \nharm done to the land and water in South Carolina. Of course, I intend \nto continue monitoring our pipeline situation in South Carolina until I \nam satisfied that our pipelines are truly safe.\n  This bill provides authorization levels that are consistent with the \nAdministration's budget request for OPS, but unfortunately, the \nappropriations for OPS that just passed the Congress are about 10 \npercent below the budget request. Obviously, OPS will be able to do its \njob better if it does not have to shift resources constantly to cope \nwith funding difficulties. Despite its funding shortfall, however, I \nhave reason to believe that OPS will ensure that our situation in South \nCarolina is rectified.\n  This legislation was crafted from many discussions between OPS and \nthe pipeline industry. The bill refines the present OPS regulatory \nprogram so that OPS's scarce resources are put to the nation's best \nadvantage. This greater ability to target its resources will help OPS \nto concentrate on the most serious problems, like the one we have faced \nin South Carolina. The bill also allows OPS and the pipeline industry \nto cooperate in designing risk management programs which will provide \nan appropriate level of safety while relieving pipeline facility owners \nand operators of unnecessary paperwork. In addition, this legislation \ncontemplates a true partnership between the parties by including the \nstates in the regulatory process with OPS and the pipeline industry.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 1505.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before us would establish a new \nstatutory standard for the Secretary of Transportation to meet when \nissuing a standard for pipeline safety. Section 4 of the bill provides \nthat: ``Except where otherwise required by statute, the Secretary shall \npropose or issue a standard under this Chapter only upon a reasoned \ndetermination that the benefits of the intended standard justify its \ncosts.''\n  When the Senate was debating governmentwide regulatory reform \nlegislation earlier in this Congress, much of the debate focused on the \nissue of whether or not it was appropriate to set an across-the-board \nstandard for the application of cost-benefit analysis to major rules. \nWe referred to this issue as ``decisional criteria''--which basically \nmeant the standard to be applied by the agency in selecting a rule for \npromulgation based on an analysis of the rule's benefits and costs. We \nwere unable to reach agreement.\n  Some thought there should be a strict standard--that the head of an \nagency should have to show that the benefits of the rule justify the \ncosts. Some thought we should apply that standard, but permit important \nexceptions for uncertainty in the data and rules where the public \ninterest was significantly at stake. Others thought we should require \nthe agency to do the analysis and explain, based on the cost-benefit \nanalysis, whether the benefits of the rule justify its costs and if \nnot, explain why the rule is still being issued.\n  As a body, we have not been able to agree on the formulation for this \nstandard. That is why Senator Glenn and I have had some concern about \nthe standard being adopted for the Office of Pipeline Safety. We don't \nwant anyone to view acceptance of the standard in this bill as a \nprecedent for adopting a similar standard in any other Federal program. \nThat's because what may work well and be appropriate for the Office of \nPipeline Safety and the safety rules issued by that office, is not \nnecessarily an appropriate standard for any other Federal agency.\n  So I wish to ask my colleagues who have been working on this bill a \nfew questions about the scope of the standard contained in this bill.\n  Mr. President, would the Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, who has \nworked so hard on this legislation, agree that it is not the \ncommittee's intent that the standard for the application of cost-\nbenefit analysis included in this legislation be applied to any other \nagency?\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the provision in this legislation with \nrespect to cost-benefit analysis is unique to the Office of Pipeline \nSafety. It is not my intent, nor was it ever suggested by any member of \nthe committee that the standard we use in this bill, be applied to the \nregulatory process of any other Federal agency.\n\n  Cost benefit analysis for pipeline safety is straight forward and \nlargely quantifiable. Assessing the effects of pipeline safety ruptures \nis not as uncertain as health-related analyses, such as lead exposure \nlevels or other long-term exposure to toxics. Pipelines are fixed \nfacilities in known locations that carry finite quantities of specific \nproducts. The consequences of different types of ruptures or problems \nis therefore very quantifiable. The costs of various proposed \nrequirements is usually also very quantifiable as most proposals seek \nto use existing procedures, processes, or tools with which pipeline \noperators have actual field experience. This makes cost and benefits \nmore readily identifiable regarding pipeline safety regulations.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a comment? If \nI may, I agree with the Senator from Nebraska. This standard we've set \nin this bill for the issuance of pipeline safety standards is unique to \nthe Pipeline Safety Office. That's why we have the support for this \nlegislation of the Department of Transportation and the regulated \nindustry. The Department of Transportation says it can live with this \nstandard, and that's why we are able to include it in this bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Will the Senator from Michigan yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I have been pleased to work with the \nSenator from Michigan on this matter as well as the overall issue of \nregulatory reform. In August I wrote to the majority leader, Senator \nLott, who has taken a strong interest in drafting this legislation, and \nexplained to him our concern about the cost-benefit standard contained \nin this bill. My concern, like Senator Levin's, was that this \nlegislation could be used as a precedent in the debate on the larger \nregulatory reform bill. The majority leader, in a letter dated August \n9, 1996, assured me that would not be the case. He said in that letter, \n``S. 1505 only applies to the federal pipeline statute. In fact, it \nwill affect only one federal agency with 100 employees and could impact \nless than ten rules per year. This is not a precedent setting \nproposal.''\n  Would the majority leader be able to confirm his earlier statement?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond to the Senator's \nrequest. The cost-benefit standard included in S. 1505 is not intended \nto be used, nor will I use it, as a precedent for a cost-benefit \nstandard to be applied to other agencies. It works for pipeline safety, \nbecause it was specifically written with the knowledge of that office \nand its unique responsibilities in mind.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Senator from Mississippi and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with those assurances by the majority \nleader and the key members of the Commerce subcommittee who've been \nworking on this bill, I can support this legislation.\n  In the recently enacted, bipartisan Safe Drinking Water Act, we \nadopted a very different standard for rulemaking. In that legislation \nwe said: ``At the time the Administrator (of EPA) proposes a national \nprimary drinking\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\nwater regulation under this paragraph, the Administrator shall publish \na determination as to whether the benefits of the maximum contaminant \nlevel justify, or do not justify, the costs based on the analysis \nconducted under paragraph (3)(C).''\n  We will now be able to see how each of these proposals works in real \nlife. I look forward to seeing and analyzing the results.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I join with my colleague and friend from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, in saying that I can support this legislation \nwith respect to this issue. I am also happy to support the inclusion of \nadded language to protect the public's right to participate in the \ndevelopment and approval of the risk management demonstration projects \nprovided udner this bill.\n  I was concerned that as initially drafted, communities affected by \nthese projects might not have a voice in commenting on the proposals \nmade by pipeline owners and operators for alternative methods of \ncomplying with the law. The sponsors of the legislation agreed to add \nstatutory language to protect that right to public participation. With \nthat addition, as well as the statement of the sponsors as to the scope \nof the bill, I will support this legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10947-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10950-S10953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARITIME SECURITY ACT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ntemporarily set aside Senate bill 1505 and that the Senate now proceed \nto the consideration of Calendar No. 262, House bill 1350, the maritime \nsecurity bill.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no amendment relative to the \ntuna-dolphin issue on the Panama declaration issue be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1350) to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 \n     to revitalize the United States-flag merchant marine, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate will soon consider House bill \n1350, the Maritime Security Act of 1995. This is the companion \nlegislation to Senate bill 1139, the maritime reform legislation \napproved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation earlier this year.\n  This historic legislation is the culmination of over two decades of \nwork by the Senate Commerce Committee. I said two decades.\n  For most of the 1980's the senior Senator from Hawaii and myself \nspent hundreds of hours in congressional hearings, consultation with \nadministration officials, and discussions with affected industry in \nseeking to find a way to stabilize and reform the Federal maritime \nprograms.\n  We became involved in this debate in large part because of our \nresponsibility to the Senate and the Nation to find methods of \nimproving our military support capabilities for the Department of \nDefense.\n  The Navy and the Marines deploy the Maritime Prepositioning Force, \nwhich is our core capability to respond in an emergency to hostile \nactions worldwide which threaten the security interests of the United \nStates.\n  We have known for many years that advance military capability must be \ncombined with the ability to provide both surge sealift capability and \nsustainment sealift capability.\n  Without both surge and sustainment, we expose our fighting men and \nwomen to the dangers inherent in any military involvement far from our \nshores.\n  The Congress has appropriated billions of dollars over the last 15 \nyears to improve our surge sealift transportation capability.\n  We have procured Fast Sealift Ships, Large Roll-On, Roll-Off ships, \nReady Reserve Force vessels, and strategic lift aircraft to support our \nmilitary forces in the initial days and months of battle.\n  We now have the most technologically advanced surge sealift \ncapability in the history of the world, and are approaching a maximum \nstate of initial readiness.\n  Military capability and surge sealift capability are, however, only \ntwo legs of the three legged stool for our advance deployed military \nforce.\n  The third leg is the ability to sustain these forces over extended \nperiods of time, after we place them in foreign territory, far from \nhome. The maritime security program in H.R. 1350 provides that third \nleg.\n  Why is it necessary for the Federal Government to provide \nsupplemental payments to U.S. companies to keep their ships under U.S.-\nflag?\n  The answer is simple. We hold our U.S.-flag carriers to operating, \nsafety, and labor standards far superior and far more costly than those \nimposed on foreign-flag carriers by their governments.\n  Operators of U.S.-flag vessels must meet payroll taxes, including \nsocial security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. U.S. \ncarriers pay income taxes and a 50 percent penalty for repairing their \nships overseas.\n  These ships must be in compliance with more restrictive Coast Guard \nand OSHA safety regulations. In short, our Federal laws build in \neconomic disincentives for U.S. companies to keep their vessels under \nthe national flag.\n  What is the national interest in keeping these ships under U.S.-flag? \nOpponents of the bill have pointed to Desert Shield/Desert Storm as \nevidence that commercial sealift can be procured in times of emergency.\n  My questions to the Senate are two-fold: At what price, and in what \nstate of readiness? Let me reemphasize to my colleagues in the Senate \nthat there are no free meals in the real world.\n  There will always be a price for an immediately available sustainment \nsealift capability in a trained and effective state of readiness.\n  As chairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nresponsible for managing the long-term costs of the Defense Department, \nI have come away with a much different lesson learned from Desert \nStorm.\n  The costs of contracting with the private sector in an emergency come \nat a high premium and the state of readiness is inadequate.\n  Logistical support is like an athlete's muscle--you must exercise \nthese muscles early and often if you are going to compete and win in \nthe field.\n  The first lesson we learned from Desert Shield/Desert Storm is that \nforeign shipping companies can easily gauge the needs of the U.S. \nmilitary and the availability of tonnage to meet these needs.\n  The average cost to the United States for procuring U.S.-flag ships \nfor sustainment sealift during Desert Shield was $122 per ton. Foreign-\nflag shipping, in contrast, charged rates averaging $174 per ton of \ncargo.\n  Norwegian and Italian shipping companies, for example, extracted \npremiums in excess of 50 percent higher than their normal charter price \nand, in some cases, doubled their charter price.\n  The second lesson from Desert Shield/Desert Storm is that the callup \nand coordination of civilian private sector operations to meet military \nsurge requirements takes time.\n  At the height of Desert Shield, we had over 120 U.S.-flag vessels \ncalled up and in service in the supply line to the Persian Gulf.\n  Fifty-one of these ships were immediately available to the Department \nof Defense pursuant to their subsidy contracts with the Department of \nTransportation, and sixty ships were called up from the Ready Reserve \nForce [RRF] to supplement the commercial fleet.\n  We also chartered over a dozen large roll-on, roll-off vessels from \nforeign shipping companies to carry heavy equipment and inventories.\n  The RRF callup was painful in its early stages. The ships were being \noperated in a reduced state of readiness, and many were required to \nundergo extensive repair work in our shipyards before they could accept \ncargo.\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\n  We experienced serious short-term manning problems as our maritime \nlabor force scrambled to bring people out of retirement or other \nsectors of the economy to fill the berths in a national emergency.\n  We had to wipe the cobwebs off the RRF and scrape for anybody who had \never sailed the high seas with a mariner's license.\n  At the end, we had an active force of U.S. Flag ships with 3000 \ncivilian, volunteer merchant mariners crewing the RRF ships and 100 \nU.S.-flag private sector ships time chartered to the Military Sealift \nCommand.\n  It was the U.S.-flag fleet which stepped into the gap and provided \nthe sustainment sealift during the initial months of Desert Storm.\n  These ships were fully crewed and ready to serve because they were \noperating in regular commercial service in the foreign waterborne \ncommerce. These companies and mariners were ready when our Nation \ncalled, and they honored their contractual commitments to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The United States was not treated the same way by the foreign \nshipping community.\n  We had foreign ships refuse to enter the war zone and saw foreign \ncrews desert their ships rather than carry cargo to the Persian Gulf.\n  In many instances the promise of double pay was not sufficient to \nkeep these crews recruited and in active service during the Desert \nShield/Desert Storm period.\n  When we were able to get the foreign ships under contract, we paid \nthe premium.\n  It is my message to the Senate that we must not repeat the mistakes \nof the past. The Congress owes an obligation to this Nation to properly \nsustain our fighting men and women when the U.S. asks them to risk \ntheir lives in protecting America's security interests abroad.\n  I do not stand before the Senate today to defend an old and obsolete \nsubsidy program.\n  With my good friend from Hawaii, I know the current system is \ndysfunctional and in need of a comprehensive overhaul.\n  The task that began in the 1970's and ends today is simple: How do we \nensure an adequate U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed private sector fleet to \nprovide sustained sealift in a cost-effective and logistically \nefficient manner?\n  This Bill, H.R. 1350, is the answer to that question.\n  There are two cornerstones of this proposed revision of our \nsustainment strategy: reform of the maritime program itself and \ninclusion of a new, state-of-the-art commercial fleet into the \nEmergency Preparedness Program.\n  The first removes the inefficiencies that have crept into the old \nmaritime programs over the last 50 years.\n  The second acts as our Nation's insurance policy on the costs of \nsealift and provides the link between those water-borne assets and the \nDepartment of Defense mobility structure.\n  When I served as chairman of the Senate Merchant Marine Subcommittee \nin the 1980's, the existing operating differential subsidy--the ODS \nprogram--was costing the Federal Government well over $350 million per \nyear. U.S. companies were receiving differential payments for crew \ncosts, insurance, vessel maintenance, and other associated ship costs.\n  The per ship costs ranged between $4 and $5 million annually. We had \nno effective fiscal controls over this program because ODS was a \ncontract entitlement.\n  Today, the administration has the authority to enter into new subsidy \ncontracts without the approval of the Congress or any prior \nappropriation of funds.\n  We first started the discussion about substitution for the system of \ncontract entitlement with a system of annual appropriations in 1986. \nThis bill, H.R. 1350, would finally accomplish this objective, which is \nwhat the Senator from Hawaii and I started out to achieve.\n  This bill would authorize only $100 million annually for the new \nsustainment sealift program, $250 million less than the funded levels \nin the 1980's and $150 million less than the costs of the existing \nprogram as it stands today.\n  We are proposing a firm fixed price system rather than a differential \ncost program. Participating companies are to receive roughly $2 million \nper ship per year, half the amount these companies receive under the \ncurrent entitlement program.\n  U.S. companies will be forced to continue their improvements in \nproductivity, capital and labor cost reductions, and intermodal \ntransportation capability in order to remain competitive in the foreign \nwater-borne commerce.\n  In order to assist them in this goal, this bill would eliminate \nunnecessary trade route regulation and allow them to better adjust to \nthe changing trends in international cargo movements.\n  We would also be procuring participation in the Emergency \nPreparedness Program.\n  There has been surprisingly little discussion about one of the more \nimportant features of the proposed reform effort in this bill.\n  A major requirement of the new Maritime Security Program is \nenrollment in the Emergency Preparedness Program. This program is \ncurrently being tested as a pilot called the Voluntary Intermodal \nSealift Agreement, or the VISA program. The United States \nTransportation Company, in consultation with the Maritime \nAdministration, developed VISA in response to lessons learned in the \nPersian Gulf war.\n  The objective of VISA is to tie U.S. carrier sustainment commercial \nsealift and their worldwide intermodal transportation and management \nnetworks into the DOD sealift program.\n  Mr. President, worldwide water-borne transportation is no longer just \na port-to-port movement of goods. It now involves multibillion-dollar \nintermodal transportation networks, including ships, the rail industry, \nthe trucking industry, and aviation links.\n  The industry's capital base includes sophisticated marine terminal \nand port facilities, worldwide computerization of cargo movements, and \nnew age management systems.\n  The VISA program accesses this multibillion-dollar shipping network. \nThe objective of VISA is to promote and facilitate Department of \nDefense use of these existing systems.\n\n  It would literally break the bank if Congress were forced to \nreplicate, operate, and maintain a similar system.\n  The Government costs for such a transportation system ranges from \n$800 million per year and up, we are told, and we simply cannot afford \nthose costs in this time of budget control.\n  An essential feature of the Maritime Security Program envisioned by \nthis bill, H.R. 1350, is advance rate-setting through the Emergency \nPreparedness Program.\n  As a precondition for a fixed price MSP contract, the participating \ncompany must agree to rates established in advance for the chartering \nof its ships to DOD in the event of a call-up.\n  The MSP contract price paid to the carriers is, in its essential \nform, an insurance premium being paid for access to the multibillion \ndollar intermodal transportation network. This is clearly, in my \njudgment, the most cost-effective method yet proposed to allow for DOD \naccess to sophisticated sustainment capability.\n  Finally, the Emergency Preparedness Program will also require \nperiodic training exercises with the commercial fleet.\n  The United States Transportation Command is already conducting \ntraining exercises with select carriers on a voluntary basis as part of \nthe VISA pilot program.\n  As part of the Maritime Security Program, training exercises through \nsimulated call-ups will become an integral part of the Department of \nDefense's Sealift Readiness Program.\n  We will begin to exercise our sustained commercial sealift muscles on \na regular basis. The next time an international incident, such as the \nPersian Gulf, arises, God forbid, the United States should be and will \nbe ready under this bill.\n  As we debate this bill today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to \nlook at the large picture now and avoid getting caught up in issues and \nsubissues that are being raised as reasons to block the passage of the \nHouse bill, H.R. 1350, today.\n  I believe that if we do not act on this bill today, there will be no \nU.S. flag sustainment fleet in the immediate future. The loss of our \nprivate commercial sealift will, in turn, result in huge defense costs \nand a gaping hole in our national sealift strategy.\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate has the opportunity to close the book on an \nissue that has been ongoing for decades and, I believe, may and should \nact in a manner which strengthens our national security.\n  I commend this bill to the Senate on the basis of the many hours I \nhave spent with my colleague from Hawaii in trying to find a solution \nto the problems which beset our sealift capability.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate Senator Lott, the \ndistinguished former chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine, for his commitment to the cause of \nreformulating our maritime policies, and also welcome Senator \nHutchison, who was recently appointed chairman of the subcommittee.\n  I also wish to commend my colleague from Alaska for once again coming \nto the front and distinguishing himself in managing this bill before \nus.\n  Mr. President, the measure before us truly represents a bipartisan \neffort, and I urge all of the Members of this body to support this \nbill.\n  In recent years, we have spent a great deal of time and effort in \nevaluating and discussing maritime policy. Unfortunately, to date, this \nevaluation and discussion has not resulted in action. It is time to \nstep forward and to ensure the continuing presence of U.S.-flag \nvessels.\n  This country, the sole remaining superpower, cannot be put in a \nposition of relying on the goodwill of foreign nations to transport \nvital military cargo. And, we cannot rely on the goodwill of foreign \nnations to achieve the transportation of cargoes vital to our economic \ninterests. It is not an acceptable or prudent national policy.\n  One of the issues that the Department of Defense [DOD] was forced to \nconfront in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf conflict was the \ninadequacy of U.S. sealift assets.\n  While the logistical efforts put forth by the military in the gulf \nwar were truly astounding, including the sealift of more than 10 \nmillion tons of surge and sustainment materiel by sea, it was evident \nthat U.S. forces could not have accomplished this sealift alone without \nthe support of foreign nations.\n  While the Persian Gulf conflict unified international opposition to \nthe actions of the Iraqi government, and allowed for the international \ncoordination of sealift, we cannot expect international support for \nevery conflict.\n  We must be able to ensure that U.S.-flag shipping is available to \nbring materiel and ammunition to soldiers who are defending our \ninterests on foreign soil.\n  One only has to look as far as the recent developments in Iraq. Our \nallies were less than forthcoming in efforts to provide assistance. If \nwe need to proceed on a unilateral basis we must have the requisite \nsealift.\n  We must also remember that the United States is a maritime nation.\n  As a Senator from the only island State in the United States, I \nappreciate the importance of ocean shipping. The continued \ndisintegration of the U.S.-flag transportation fleet greatly concerns \nme. I fear the possibility of being completely reliant on foreign \ncorporations and foreign nations for transportation service.\n  A study of history will reveal the cyclical patterns of U.S. maritime \ndevelopment. Historically, the U.S.-flag fleet has suffered through \nlong periods of neglect and disregard, only to reemerge. Reemergence \nusually occurs in times of national emergency, and usually only after \nthe Government has spent considerable sums in reestablishing our \nfleet. Today we cannot afford to repeat this cycle again. Once more we \nare approaching a precipice. But this time it is one from which we may \nnot be able to turn back. We are facing the total elimination of the \ninternational presence of U.S.-flag carriage.\n\n  After the end of the Civil War, interest in maritime activities \nwaned, leaving waterborne commerce and shipbuilding mainly in the hands \nof foreign countries. In 1914, with the onset of World War I, ocean \nshipping rates rose 300 to 400 percent. In 1916, the U.S. Government \nrealized the need for a strong U.S.-flag merchant fleet and began a \nmassive shipbuilding campaign.\n  However, most of these ships were not complete by the end of the war \nand throughout the war, the United States depended largely on foreign \nshipping to support American soldiers. Unfortunately, little was \nlearned from this, and most of these ships were allowed to fall into \ndisuse within only a few years.\n  In 1936, Congress passed the Merchant Marine Act which would \nrevolutionize American shipping. It provided a workable basis for \nbuilding and maintaining a strong U.S.-flag merchant marine. This act \ncame at precisely the right time--with the onset of World War II just a \nfew years later.\n  In this war, once again, one of the most critical shortages was \nmerchant shipping, but the United States was prepared and able to \nconstruct many vessels. By the end of the war, the United States had \nused over 4,000 war-built merchant ships. The U.S.-flag merchant marine \nwas vital to war efforts and suffered great casualties.\n  At the end of the war more than 700 U.S.-flag vessels had been sunk \nand more than 6,000 civilian merchant mariners had lost their lives. \nTheir casualty rate was second only to the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  In 1950, the private U.S.-flag merchant marine was comprised of 1,170 \nships totaling 14.1 million deadweight tonnage. With this surplus of \nships, once again, the merchant marine was allowed to become stagnant \nand shipbuilding was greatly reduced.\n  In 1970, the U.S.-flag merchant marine comprised 793 ships totaling \n14.4 million deadweight tons. The number of ships had been greatly \nreduced, but, because of new, larger vessels, tonnage was increased by \n300,000 tons. The United States was then ranked No. 8 in the world in \ndeadweight tonnage. As we all know, in 1945, at the end of the Great \nWar, we were No. 1. It may interest you to know we are at this moment \nNo. 14. The superpower of this planet is No. 14 when it comes to \nshipping.\n  Today our merchant fleet has fewer than 350 vessels, although our \ntonnage capacity is over 20 million deadweight tons as U.S. operators \nuse larger, more efficient vessels.\n  Although the United States has many of the most innovative ships in \nthe world in its fleet, it still is increasingly difficult for American \nvessels to compete in the international trades against foreign \nsubsidies, state-owned fleets, and the tax advantages and lack of \nmeaningful foreign regulation of foreign vessels.\n  In addition, we have seen the promulgation of the operation of \nvessels under flags of convenience. Flag-of-convenience vessels have \nnominal connection to the country whose flag it flies. They sail under \nthe Liberian flag, Panamanian flag and, believe it or not, under the \nSwiss flag. There are no harbors in Switzerland, but they have a fleet \nwhich, incidentally is larger than ours. They do not pay taxes, nor do \ntheir workers pay tax to the nation whose law they operate under. In \nfact, they do not even employ citizens from the host nation, and they \nmay never even visit that nation.\n  In the last decade many U.S. shipping companies have begun placing \ntheir vessels under flag-of-convenience registries. The high cost of \ndoing business under the American flag--paying full U.S. taxes, abiding \nby all U.S. laws and the numerous rules and regulations imposed by the \nFederal Government--have contributed greatly to this movement.\n  The simple fact is that today, if these trends continue, the U.S.-\nflag fleet will disappear from the sealanes of the world in less than \n10 years. We cannot allow this to happen. This is why we must act now.\n  In the early 1990's, the Persian Gulf war once again proved the \nimportance of a strong, vital U.S.-flag merchant marine. This conflict \nproved that the only reliable choice is to use American vessels with \nAmerican crews. Too often during the Persian Gulf war, foreign-flag \nships with foreign crews refused to enter the war zone.\n  We did not see this on our front pages, but on 16 different occasions \nforeign-flag vessels with our cargo declined to provide transportation \nservice into the Persian Gulf. But we were fortunate in the Persian \nGulf war. Saddam Hussein did not attack Saudi Arabia. Why he hesitated \nwe have no idea. We had the time to get the job done with a unified \ncoalition. We may not be so lucky in the future.\n  We must, therefore, have in place a modern, capable, and reliable \nU.S.-flag\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\nfleet with the same loyal Americans to crew them whose predecessors \nhave never let us down in the more than 200 years of our Nation's \nhistory.\n  The Maritime Security Act of 1995 is essential to the military \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  Specifically, this legislation will do the following: It will \nguarantee a pool of American citizen crews and a 50-ship fleet of \nmilitarily useful U.S.-flag commercial sealift vessels for our national \nsecurity; it will also provide that the companies' entire intermodal \nlogistical support systems--containers, rail cars, computer tracking, \nport operations, and management--will be available to the DOD when \nneeded; it will guarantee the availability of American mariners to crew \nthe DOD's sealift fleet of fast sealift ships, prepositioned ships and \nReady Reserve Force vessels; and it will ensure that military supplies \nare on reliable U.S.-flag ships with patriotic, dependable American \ncitizen crews. Many people are unaware that even our DOD reserve fleet \nvessels are operated by civilian merchant marines, because they cost \nless to operate than vessels directly controlled by the Navy.\n  This Maritime Security Act will cut costs by more than 50 percent \ncompared to today's program. It will reduce burdensome Government \nregulations that hamstring U.S.-flag operators which give competitive \nadvantage to foreign-flag companies.\n  And it will save the Defense Department billions of dollars--because \nthe DOD will be able to use modern, state-of-the-art commercial assets \nrather than buying and maintaining this capability on their own. It is \neight times cheaper to have the private sector perform this vital \nnational security task--and this point alone makes the Maritime \nSecurity Act a commonsense bargain for America.\n  My fellow colleagues, in the past we have often taken for granted the \nrole of the merchant marine in the economy and security of the United \nStates. We cannot afford to do so today--nor can we suddenly rebuild a \nmaritime capability in the future if we need it urgently.\n  It is simply not economically feasible or realistic to repeat the \nmistakes--the ups and downs of maritime support--we have made in the \npast.\n  We need a merchant marine in place that is strong and reliable in \nboth peacetime and wartime. The new maritime security program will help \nour Nation reach this goal in a cost-effective, more efficient and more \ncompetitive manner. So I urge all my colleagues to support this \nprogram, and to enact it into law.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I think the Senate will note my partner \nacross the aisle and I have been involved in a lot of issues together, \nparticularly defense issues. With regard to these issues, at times the \nSenator from Hawaii has been chairman of the subcommittee. At other \ntimes, I have, depending upon the political winds of our country. But \nthe Senator from Hawaii and I, as I have said in my opening statement, \nspent many hours over the last two decades trying to find a way to \nsolve this problem.\n  At one time when I was both chairman of the subcommittee of \nAppropriations and the subcommittee of Commerce, I secured the approval \nof the Senate, not once but twice, of a special program, the Eisenhower \nBuild and Lease program. We tried to put it back into effect. We \nactually had the Congress appropriate more than $1 billion in a reserve \nto start that program. It was not possible to get it started because of \nthe various conflicts within our merchant marine industry.\n  We are now in a position of, really, suggesting to the Senate what \namounts to a proposal like the Civil Air Reserve Fleet that we use in \nthe event of emergency, where we have preexisting contracts with \nairlines that enable us to, really, commandeer our civilian airline \nfleet in order to meet our emergency needs. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  We have now switched over to a concept of relying upon the private \nsector to build and we will lease. The Eisenhower program was building \nand then leasing. That went on for a period of time, but it just did \nnot work because of the problem within the industry of subsidizing one \nline and not subsidizing another. It led to, really, problems within \nthe merchant marine fleet.\n  This answer that has come to us from the House, I think, is the most \nworthwhile approach that I have seen. It has taken a long time to work \nout. I am hopeful we will see approval of it today.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa seek the floor at this time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Shortly.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have checked with the participants in this \npiece of legislation. It may be some time before they will be able to \nstart their deliberation. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I \nmight proceed for up to 10 minutes, as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10950-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10953-S10955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AMENDMENT TO THE FISCAL YEAR 1997 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, when the Senate returns to the consideration \nof the Interior appropriations bill, I intend to offer an amendment \nthat would redirect the bill's earmark of $3 million to create a 20,000 \nacre national wildlife refuge in western Kentucky.\n  On Monday, the Senate approved the energy and water appropriations \nbill that, due to budget constraints imposed by this Congress, will not \nadequately fund an important, existing environmental project in western \nKentucky called the Land Between the Lakes. LBL is a 170,000-acre \npreserve located just 15 miles east of the Interior bill's proposed \nwildlife refuge.\n  I fail to see the logic of what some people are proposing here: \ninadequately fund one outdoor facility, the Land Between the Lakes, on \nMonday, and then, just days later, try to appropriate funding for a new \nfacility just 15 miles away. In Marshall County, where most of the \nproposed refuge would be located, the judge/executive has asked me, \n``why don't we take care of what we've got before we open a new nature \npreserve?'' I could not agree more. The fact of the matter is that we \nare not taking care of the Land Between the Lakes. Its appropriation \nhas dropped by one-third since 1994 even as millions of dollars' worth \nof maintenance projects pile up.\n  The rider in the Interior appropriations bill will ensure that LBL \nand other wilderness projects continue to go begging in years to come. \nThat is because the $3 million earmarked in the Interior appropriations \nbill is just a fraction of the $15-20 million it will cost to actually \ncreate the refuge. That is not just me talking. Those estimates are \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService. So, Mr. President, supporters of the earmark will be back next \nyear, and the year after, looking for more money for this new project.\n  What is worse is that Kentuckians living in the surrounding counties \ndo not even support the proposed wildlife refuge created by the bill. I \nhave already mentioned the statement of the Marshall County Judge \nexecutive. Well, the Marshall County Soil and Water Conservation \nDistrict has also gone on record, saying, ``Our opposition to making a \nFederal Wildlife Refuge of the East Ford of Clark's River stems from \nthe overwhelming opposition of land owners and tenants in the proposed \narea.''\n  The sentiment if the same in Murray, KY, located in the adjacent \ncounty of Calloway. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an editorial from the Murray Ledger-Times.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Murray Ledger & Times, Feb. 8, 1996]\n\n                National Refuge at Odds With LBL Dilemma\n\n       We're scratching our heads over the latest from Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell.\n       What could McConnell be thinking?\n       We know it's an election year, but can his plan to create a \n     national wildlife refuge just\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\n     15 miles west of Land Between the Lakes be serious?\n       The senator wants to buy up to 20,000 acres of land located \n     on the east fork of Clarks River which is the site of the \n     only major bottomland hardwood area left in Kentucky.\n       Listening to McConnell's plans for the area reminds us of a \n     brochure for LBL.\n       The senator stresses the environmental and educational \n     benefits of such a wildlife refuge.\n       Hmmm--they say the same thing about LBL.\n       McConnell's proposal is puzzling in light of his \n     involvement in securing operational funds for LBL.\n       The Tennessee Valley Authority has been under a constant \n     barrage from congressional critics the last two years. We \n     don't expect that scrutiny to lessen in the future.\n       McConnell has created his own catch-22 with a plan to spend \n     federal money to establish a wildlife refuge while TVA \n     officials are busy peddling a commercialized LBL.\n       If adequate funding can be assured for both wildlife areas, \n     we gladly embrace McConnell's plan.\n       However, Washington, D.C. becomes a twilight zone for such \n     promises.\n       Unless LBL's status becomes more secure, we'll have to say \n     thanks, but no thanks, Mitch.\n\n  Mr. FORD. The Ledger-Times reminds us that the refuge and the project \nat Land Between the Lakes would provide very similar services and that \nthe creation of the refuge will put future LBL funding at risk.\n  Mr. President, supporters of the refuge have compiled a seemingly \nimpressive list of endorsements. But listen to who is on the list: Mall \nInteriors, the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and Pride, Inc. I have no \ndoubt that these are fine organizations, but how are they qualified to \nspeak to a proposed wildlife refuge in western Kentucky?\n  Of course, there is also a list of Kentucky environmental \norganizations who support the refuge. But again, you will not hear the \nname of a single county or county organization in or near the proposed \nwildlife refuge that supports it. In fact, the closes organization is \nlocated over 80 miles and five counties away from where the refuge \nwould be located.\n  We should listen to the people of western Kentucky before creating a \nrefuge that currently includes at least 7,000 acres of cropland. What \nwill happen to that cropland? What about the communities and families \nin and around the refuge? At a minimum, we should be holding official \npublic hearings in the community and inviting public comment before \nestablishing a wildlife refuge instead of creating it through an \nappropriations earmark.\n  Mr. President, my amendment redirects the bill's earmarked funds \ntoward Land Between the Lakes projects that already enjoy wide support \nin Kentucky. First, my amendment provides $2.25 million for the repair \nand maintenance costs of ``the Trace,'' which is the north-south \nroadway in the Land Between the Lakes. Over 2 million people visit the \nLBL every year and they ought to be able to get from one end to the \nother on a decent, safe road.\n  Second, my amendment directs $275,000 to repair the Brandon Springs \nResident Center, which serves as a youth camp for underprivileged and \ndisabled children. Brandon Springs is a great resource that we need to \nprotect and preserve, but its facilities are inadequate and \noverextended. We need to make a commitment to Brandon Springs, not just \nfor children from Kentucky, but for the children who come from \nTennessee, Alabama, the Carolinas, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, \nVirginia, and Ohio for a real wilderness experience. This is not just a \nlocal operation. It is a national operation, Mr. President.\n  Last, my amendment directs $475,000 to provide water and sewer \nservice and disabled access for the youth station in the Land Between \nthe Lakes. Mr. President, it was heartbreaking to see this facility \nclosed due to lack of funds, which gave kids the chance to live in the \ngreat outdoors and learn how to be good stewards of our natural \nresources. Until it was closed due to lack of funding, the youth \nstation provided environmental education to thousands of \nschoolchildren, including my own grandchildren--and I have that \npersonal experience, Mr. President--as well as adults. Teachers came to \nyouth station to receive valuable training in environmental education \nat the facility and took that information back to their students. If \nthe center is reopened, I understand that at least two different \nuniversities in the area have offered to assume the operational and \nprogramming responsibilities of the facility, which will allow programs \nto continue with virtually no Federal cost.\n  I have letters of support for what I propose today, and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Mayfield, KY.\n     Senator Wendell Ford,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       To Senator Ford: I am writing this letter to you about a \n     matter I feel is of great importance to our region in Western \n     Kentucky. My name is Tawnya Hunter and I am a teacher at \n     Graves County High School in Mayfield, Kentucky. The matter \n     which I would like to inform you about is the closing of the \n     Youth Station in Land Between the Lakes.\n       As you know TVA has been cutting back on its funding of LBL \n     and one of its major cut backs was the closing of the Youth \n     Station. The Youth Station has been serving children and \n     adults of this area as well as across the country for about \n     twenty years. Children come and stay for various camps though \n     fewer and fewer have been offered to them in the last five to \n     six years. Murray State has been using the Youth Station for \n     about twelve years for several different teacher training \n     courses. This is how I got involved. I attended a week long \n     class on Environmental Education in which I got graduate \n     credit for. The experiences and materials obtained during \n     that week far surpass other classes and courses that are \n     required to take for masters classes. The same course taught \n     in a regular classroom would not have the same effect.\n       Since the impending closure Murray State has come up with a \n     proposal to run the Youth Station for TVA. TVA turned the \n     proposal down stating it could not afford what Murray State \n     proposed. What was proposed was that TVA allow Murray State \n     to run the facility and take over all costs after TVA \n     restored the place to a running condition (i.e., fix the \n     plumbing, telephones). This is where TVA said they could not \n     afford this. To let a facility like this go would be a \n     tremendous waste. If TVA truly cannot afford this proposal \n     then maybe Congress could pass a one time appropriation to \n     cover the initial cost to fix the Youth Station. This is \n     where I need your help. I am not in the habit of writing \n     Congressmen about problems but this is something that I feel \n     very strongly about, and I do not know where else to turn. If \n     there is anything that you could do to help, it would be well \n     worth your time and would be greatly appreciated. Dr. Joseph \n     Baust is the contact person at Murray State and has been \n     working extensively on saving the Youth Station since 1991. \n     He would be more than willing to meet with you or talk to you \n     about this any place and at any time. He can also tell you \n     much more about this than I can. I have really only told you \n     the very basics of this issue. Irene Riley is my ``Granny'' \n     (my husband's Grandma but I consider her mine too) and I know \n     that she talked to you on your trip to Mayfield. Thank you in \n     advance for any consideration you give this issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Tawnya Hunter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                 Hopkinsville Electric System,\n\n                                    Hopkinsville, KY, May 7, 1996.\n     Ms. Moira Shea,\n     Senator Ford's Office, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Moira: Thank you for your call and Senator Ford's \n     interest in Land Between the Lakes (LBL). As I mentioned, the \n     LBL budget request for this year is $6.6 million which \n     includes $900,000 for TVA police services not included last \n     year.\n       As a user of LBL, I personally think the budget has already \n     been cut too far. Attractions have been closed and roads and \n     facilities continue to deteriorate.\n       For example, ``The Trace'', which is the major north/south \n     roadway, is falling into disrepair. The cost to repave it \n     this year is $2.15 million which is not in the budget \n     request.\n       The Brandon Spring Group Camp had to be closed because \n     there was just not enough money to keep it in repair. This \n     facility was used by Murray State and other schools as a \n     youth camp, including under-privileged and disabled kids. \n     There, these kids could feel the great outdoors and study the \n     protection of our natural environment. The cost to refurbish \n     this facility, which includes repairing the ceilings, a new \n     HVAC unit, along with trail, fishing pier and parking lot \n     renovation (handicapped access), is $261,000--also not in the \n     budget request.\n       Funding of the above projects would go a long way toward \n     restoring LBL to a more usable state and would be much \n     appreciated by this region. However, this needs to be an add-\n     on to the budget request as funding of TVA's other Land and \n     Water Stewardship projects has already been cut to the bone. \n     We, the friends of LBL, certainly would be obliged by any \n     assistance Senator Ford could provide. Say ``hello'' to \n     Senator Ford and Charles for me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Austin B. Carroll,\n                                                  General Manager.\n\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I am not opposed to the creation of a \nwildlife refuge, as proposed in the bill. What concerns me is the idea \nthat we here in the Senate can or should designate thousands of acres \nof cropland--over 7,000 acres of cropland--as a wildlife refuge without \neven consulting affected farmers. What concerns me is that we would \nmake this designation without consulting or seeking the consent of the \naffected localities. What concerns me is a proposal that results in \nKentuckians writing to me to say, ``no one seems to listen'' isn't that \nsomething?--``no one seems to listen to what the majority of landowners \nand farmers, who are directly involved, are saying.''\n  With my amendment, we will be listening to the people of western \nKentucky. My amendment, unlike the proposal in the bill, has the \nsupport of citizens in Kentucky who live around the Land Between the \nLakes and helps to preserve a vital natural resource we already have.\n  I urge my colleagues, if we get to the Interior bill, that they \nsupport the adoption of my amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10953-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--VETO MESSAGE TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 1833\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on the maritime bill \nthat is before us. I, first of all, want to compliment the leadership \nof the Senate, plus the managers of this legislation, because we are \nbringing up maritime legislation in the daylight. The last time it was \nbrought up it was the last item on an omnibus bill, a very big omnibus \nbill. It was at 9 o'clock at night. It was just before we were taking a \nweek's recess. And it was to finance a subsidy for the maritime \nindustry.\n  For something that costly, for something that important, it seems to \nme it is not something that we should try to sneak through in the dark \nof night as the last piece of business because controversy that is \nconnected with it might not be so welcomed to be answered. And, \nconsequently, we just avoided all the necessary discussion we ought to \nhave of very costly legislation.\n  So here we are not doing it on a Friday. We are not doing it late in \nthe evening. And I want to compliment the leadership for bringing up a \nvery important new program, a very costly new program, at a time when \nit can be given some legitimate consideration.\n  I also want to compliment our majority leader because he has been \nvery forthright with me and very open with me in making sure that I had \nopportunities to present my point of view and to offer amendments. And \nit was not handled in the stealth manner that I have teased him about \nin the past as this bill was working its way out of committee. So I \nthink again it is being done in an open and very forthright manner so \nwe can have discussion on this.\n  I see the leader has come in. And if he is here to do other business, \nI would be happy to yield to him for that sole purpose.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the Senator yield just briefly?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will yield, not losing my right to the floor, yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for his \ncomments. I know that this is an issue that he has an interest in. We \ntalked about it. And I had indicated to him earlier, even though we \npicked at each other for years on this subject, that this would \ncertainly be something that he would be given notice on and that we \nwould meet with him and talk to him about the substance, about what was \nwithin it and not within it, and to give him ample time to study it and \nprepare remarks and amendments.\n  The only reason we are starting as late in the afternoon as we are is \nbecause I believe he had a conflict, and we wanted to try to \naccommodate him earlier. We are going to continue to proceed in that \nway. We want to make sure everybody has a chance to make their case and \nlook at this legislation very carefully. I appreciate his attitude and \nhis comments very much. I just wanted to thank him for that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. While we are talking about accommodating me, from 8 to \n8:30 I have my monthly town meeting via television satellite with the \npeople of Iowa. I would like to be able to keep that.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield for me to respond to that, and \nfor no other purposes, Mr. President, we certainly have other Senators \nthat want to make statements and maybe debate on amendments. We will \nmake sure that nothing happens during that time that would be a problem \nfor him. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, why are the taxpayers up in arms about \nWashington, DC? I think it is because they know how to spend their \nmoney better than Washington does. Americans are overtaxed. Ask any of \nthem. Washington is also overweight. Today American workers work \nlonger, they work harder, just so that Washington can spend more of \ntheir money. Taxpayers sacrifice more, I am sorry to say, so that \nWashington can spend more. That is just not right.\n  I want to make it possible for taxpayers to keep more of their own \nmoney. Part of that is to get Congress then to stop spending so darn \nmuch of it in the first place. That is why whenever I see a grossly \nwasteful program, I feel obliged to squeeze the fat out of it. And I \nurge my colleagues to help in that effort.\n  Maritime subsidies, the subject of this legislation, is one, one \nblatant example of how Washington wastes taxpayers' hard-earned money. \nIt is a case study in how Washington turns common sense upside down. \nInstead of competition for lower costs, this program creates a monopoly \nthat raises costs. Now we all expect competition to lower costs, and in \nmost instances it does lower costs, but the program that is in this \nlegislation creates a monopoly. And you know what happens most of the \ntime when you have a monopoly? That ends up raising costs.\n  Instead of supporting the national security, as this program purports \nto do, this program is becoming irrelevant to national security.\n  This program delivers to the taxpayers higher costs and no national \nsecurity benefit. Should that not be a clue that this program is \nwasteful? I know how the taxpayers would answer that question, Mr. \nPresident, but I am not sure yet how my 99 other colleagues will answer \nthat question.\n  There is an old way and a new way of doing business in Washington. \nThe old way is to spend money to get reelected. Just tax the citizenry \nmore to pay for that effort. The money goes to wealthy companies--we \ncall that corporate welfare--and it goes to powerful unions. It becomes \ncorporate and union welfare. They keep getting more money from the \nTreasury and then they have clout. They pay contributions to reelect \nfriends; that way they do not have to be accountable for the taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  A very ineffective program can exist and survive in Washington simply \nbecause it has so much clout. That is the political game in Washington. \nThat is the political game that the grassroots of America, if people \nare candid with you, are sick and tired of. That is also how Washington \nwastes the taxpayers' money. To Washington, it is not waste. No, it is \nnot waste. It is currency. It is the cost of getting reelected. That is \nthe old way of doing business in Washington.\n  The new way, beginning with this Congress, is to be frugal. The era \nof big Government is over. Even President Clinton said that in his \nState of the\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\nUnion Message. Of course, even big-spending liberals are saying that. \nWe are a vote or two shy of the balanced budget constitutional \namendment, and maybe then, eventually, of getting a balanced budget. \nThe days of fiscal responsibility are nearly upon us.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I view this vote on this bill, my \namendments to this bill, as a test case for this Congress, a test \nbetween doing business the old way and doing business the new way. \nTaxpayers are tired of the burden we place on the taxpayers to feed the \nappetite of Washington bureaucracy. It is time for Washington to \nsacrifice for a change.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to share my \nconcerns about the bill before the Senate. That bill is H.R. 1350, the \nMaritime Security Act. I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer a \nfew amendments to address these problems.\n  Frankly, if these amendments pass, I intend to support the bill. When \nI talk about supporting and when I talk about amendments, because of my \nhistorical opposition to maritime legislation subsidies, the subsidies \nthat are in the legislation, people might feel, well, I am gearing up \nto talk this bill to death and to not let it come to a vote. I have \nassured the leader that we are talking about minutes on amendments and \nsome time for me to make opening statements. The legislative process in \nthis body on this bill, even though maybe the outcome may not be to my \nliking, should work its will.\n  Mr. President, my criticism of maritime subsidies has centered upon \nthe fact that taxpayers and consumers have suffered under the burden of \nmonopoly. Let me emphasize that monopoly, maritime rates, and also \nhidden back-door subsidies, all meant to materially and beneficially \nimpact our national security, but all the time we have these monopoly \nrates and these hidden back-door subsidies, the sad commentary is that \nit only marginally assists. I want to emphasize, only marginally \nassists our national defense.\n  This may be one reason that the Defense Department resisted so \nstrongly having to pay for H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act. The \nDepartment of Defense resists paying for this cost, and yet it is being \noffered to us as necessary for our national security. Who is more \nconcerned about the national security of the United States of America \nand our responsibilities in the world than, of course, the Department \nof Defense? Yet, let me say to you, this bill is being offered as \nnecessary for our national security, yet the Department of Defense \nresists strongly having to pay for H.R. 1350.\n\n  It seems these subsidies have far more to do with maritime union \nwelfare and with corporate welfare and much less to do with the defense \nof our Nation. The maritime union welfare focus is clearly borne out by \nthe 1993 maritime decision memo prepared by President Clinton's very \nown Cabinet officials. These Cabinet officials told President Clinton \nthat the primary purpose of these maritime subsidies is to pay high-\npriced wages and benefits of seafarers. This is not Republican Senator \nChuck Grassley saying why we are having this bill before the Senate. \nThis is the President's own Cabinet people saying that the primary \npurpose of these subsidies is to pay high-priced wages and benefits of \nseafarers.\n  Mr. President, now, again, besides the President's own Cabinet, I am \nnot alone in opposition to our current system of maritime subsidies. \nProminent public interest in taxpayer organizations such as the \nCitizens Against Government Waste, the National Taxpayers Union, \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, and Americans for Tax Reform all oppose \nH.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act. These are the people who issue \nreport cards at election time. These are the people that your \nconstituents--who expect you to be fiscally responsible--look at how \nthey rate you, as fiscally responsible or fiscally irresponsible, who \nput out reports, and legitimately so, in the spirit of free speech and \nthe process of representative government, to tell you or your \nconstituents, are you pro-taxpayer or anti-taxpayer? These \norganizations oppose this legislation.\n  I might add, however, that these groups do support the changes I \nseek, the amendments I offer. They support my amendments because this \nis clearly a taxpayer/good government issue. My amendments are also \nsupported by a number of retired admirals.\n  Now, for my colleagues on the floor who are so closely and \nlegitimately associated with uniform military leadership of America, I \nwant to remind you the very same admirals I am talking about are the \nones who had previously been listed as supporters of this legislation \nbut had been given some sparse information about it. Their comments are \nrevealing.\n  I refer, first of all, to a letter I received June 8, 1996, from Vice \nAdm. George P. Steele, U.S. Navy, retired. I will not read the entire \nletter, but he said in part:\n\n       My signature is on a form submitted by the American \n     Security Council. I only signed that form to gain time for a \n     mature study of a then-pending bill which could have resulted \n     in subsidies for the VLCC's, and now that I see how my name \n     is being used, I much regret it. I was invited to help that \n     council formulate positions and I met with their \n     representative, and I have not heard from them since, but I \n     am not surprised that my opinions do not suit them.\n       I do believe that this country needs and should pay for \n     only that part of the U.S. Merchant Marine that is configured \n     in type and numbers to support our authenticated defense \n     requirements. I am opposed to the continuation of Federal \n     programs mostly designed to line the pockets of unions, \n     owners, and shipbuilders unwilling to give up grossly \n     inefficient practices. We desperately need a fresh start, not \n     a continuing jobs program.\n\n  Signed, ``George P. Steele, Vice Admiral, U.S. Navy, retired.''\n  Then we have a Karl J. Bernstein. This is a handwritten note that I \nreceived in June 1996:\n\n       Thank you for your letter of May 30, 1996. It was most \n     informative. Had I been aware of the facts, I certainly would \n     not have agreed to the Maritime Reform and Security Act of \n     1995, as recommended by the American Security Council. Their \n     pitch was the usual one: ``We need adequate sealift.'' Of \n     course, everyone will agree to that.\n\n  Then I have a letter from Rear Adm. J. L. Abbott, retired, U.S. Navy, \nJune 11, 1996:\n\n       Of all the words, those quoted from a Defense Department \n     memo--\n\n  That is the one that I said the Clinton Cabinet presented to the \nPresident to make a final choice on this legislation.\n  I will start over:\n\n       Of all the words, those quoted from a Defense Department \n     memo strike me as most compelling. The issue of two major \n     U.S.-flag container ship operators disposing of their U.S.-\n     flag fleet is primarily an economic policy issue rather than \n     a national security issue and should be treated accordingly. \n     I certainly support additional hearings by both the Senate \n     Commerce Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee to \n     probe exhaustively into the above-quoted statement in order \n     to find out where the truth lies.\n\n  Mr. President, my staff has just advised me that when I was quoting \nfrom that last letter and I referred to the Defense Department memo, I \nsaid that was the very same memo the Cabinet people had given to the \nPresident for him to make his judgment on. I was in error. That memo \nreferred to in Admiral Abbott's letter was the memo of former DOD \nAssistant Secretary Colin McMillen. That was Colin McMillen's quote I \njust gave.\n  I could give a lot of letters. I want to finish with this one. These \nare Charles Minter's comments, a vice admiral, and this is penciled in \nat the top of a questionnaire that I sent to him asking him to fill \nout. He said:\n\n       I greatly appreciate your bringing to my attention facts of \n     which I was previously unaware. I strongly support additional \n     hearings at which voices in opposition can be heard so that \n     legislation which best deals with our sealift capability to \n     be effected.\n\n  I only bring these letters to my colleagues' attention because there \nis going to be a lot of weight put on by the proponents of this \nlegislation in support of this legislation, saying that we have all \nthese retired admirals who are saying this legislation is absolutely \nessential. I didn't know what sort of reaction I would get from these \nadmirals. Obviously, all of them did not write back saying that they \ndisagreed with their original position. But I would like to have my \ncolleagues take with some caution this reference to their support, \nbecause we have a lot of these admirals who have questioned the use of \ntheir name.\n  We also have Admirals Minter, Edward Martin, Victor Long, Theodore \nAlmstedt, Robert Stroh, and I have already talked about Karl Bernstein.\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\n These folks particularly were on record that we needed further \nhearings on this bill. We worked very hard with the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee to get hearings, and he consented to have those \nhearings, and they never materialized because of legislative \nresponsibilities. But the reason for further hearings was that, at the \ntime this bill had a hearing on it, opponents asked for an opportunity \nto be heard and there was no opportunity for the opposition to be \nheard. So the committee record, obviously, is not complete, because you \nshould have both a balance between those who support legislation and \nthose against the legislation. But the leadership wanted to move this \nbill out of committee very rapidly. That caused me some concern a year \nago. I wish it hadn't happened, but it does happen, and when those \nhurdles are crossed, we are where we are now. So, hopefully, some of \nthese things could have been worked out in committee.\n  Now, these admirals that I referred to also support my amendments to, \nfirst of all, restrict tax-supported seafarer war bonuses to those \ngiven regular military, so that there is a parity between our full-time \nmilitary people who get war bonuses along with seafarers who get \nbonuses. I will show you where there is a terrible distortion and \nunfairness in that.\n  Seafarers, unlike people in the military, reserve some right to serve \nwhen called on, and our full-time military people do not have that \nright. So I have an amendment dealing with that subject. The next one \nrequires subsidized U.S. carriers to provide both U.S.-flag vessels and \ncrews in meeting its military obligations and does not allow them to \nsubstitute foreign flags and foreign crews for any or all of their \nmilitary sustainment voyage responsibilities.\n  That amendment is a direct result of something Senator Lott said \nbefore he was floor leader, when this issue was up, as I referred to \nwell over a year ago, when it was brought up late in the evening on a \nFriday before we were taking a recess. He said that we have to have \nthis program because we have to make sure that American merchant \nmariners with American-flag ships are available to transport our \nmateriel. This legislation does not require that. This legislation \nallows contracting for non-American-flag ships to do that.\n  Fourth, we would provide for the Department of Defense, and other \nagencies, buy-America type laws that protect taxpayers from price \ngouging. Again, all of these admirals are listed by the American \nSecurity Council as supporters of this bill before us. Yet, when given \nsome facts--and we mailed them the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo, which \nis a memo that I previously referred to that the Cabinet sent to the \nPresident to make his decision as to whether or not he should get \nbehind this legislation. These admirals, particularly after reading the \nRubin-Clinton maritime memo, agreed that my amendment should pass and \nthat further hearings should have been held.\n  I offer these as basic commonsense amendments. They are protaxpayer \nand prodefense amendments. If we continue to subsidize maritime in the \nname of national defense then the U.S.-flag carriers and seafarers must \nserve when called. It must not be optional. It is not optional for the \npeople right now who are leaving the United States on their way to \nKuwait because of problems in Iraq with Saddam Hussein, and the \nPresident defines those problems as needing another 5,000 troops on the \nground in Kuwait. You saw those families on television last night with \ntears in their eyes but with an understanding that this is their job. \nAnd without question, they just pack up and go when called. The people \noperating our maritime fleets have an option.\n  Of course, as with any taxpayer subsidies, taxpayer protections ought \nto be provided. So my amendments will do that.\n  I want to highlight a few problems, and be more specific than I have \nwith H.R. 1350.\n  Problem No. 1: It is simple--maritime union and corporate welfare. If \nsomeone told you, Mr. President, that the Clinton administration was \ntrying to mislead us, someone might respond, ``What's new?'' What would \nbe new is after receiving clear evidence that this ploy involves a jobs \nprogram for the maritime union that the Republican-controlled Congress \nwent along with it. And the Republican Congress, when I am done, is \ngoing to know that this is what this is. How people vote is their \nchoice. But it is not the Clinton administration that is misleading us. \nWe bear some responsibility on the majority side of the aisle for that. \nEarlier this year, Citizens Against Government Waste delivered to every \nSenate office such evidence. And it is this internal White House memo \nfrom Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, to President Clinton \ndiscussing maritime subsidies. This memo represents the deliberations \nand conclusions of the political heads of 16 different executive branch \nagencies--departments, and agencies. We have a memo from the \nPresident's own people to the President. I suggest that it was never \nintended that this would ever get into the public domain. This memo now \nshows that 15 of 16 agencies supported a deficit-neutral maritime \nsubsidy option that--this is from the memo--``would meet the Department \nof Defense maximum military requirements.''\n  There were three options in this memo. There was one of deficit \nneutral. That means, if you change your program, there is enough money \nsomeplace else in the budget to pay for it, or it is not going to cost \nany more than what is in the budget presently for that program. You \nhave 15 out of 16 agencies. These are appointed by a Democratic \nPresident. They support a deficit-neutral option. Only the \nTransportation Secretary opposed this prodefense, taxpayer-friendly \noption because--again from the memo--``it provides less support than is \nsought by the industry and its supporters.'' Fifteen out of sixteen \nDemocratic heads of agencies say we ought to take this option because \nit is deficit neutral, and it would still meet our military needs. You \nhave 1 out of the 16, the Department of Transportation Secretary, who \nsuggests that the other 15 ought to be ignored because their option \nprovides less support than is sought by the industry and its \nsupporters.\n  Here is the President of the United States representing 269 million \npeople, the only political office representing the entire Nation, who \nis given a memo by 15 of his advisers saying here is a revenue-neutral \noption that will meet our military needs. But he has one who says, \n``Well, forget about the military needs. Forget about being deficit \nneutral. The industry wants this, and its supporters want this.''\n\n  So instead of listening to the people, instead of listening to 15 of \nyour 16 department heads, you get a recommendation from one person who \nsays it is based upon what the industry wants and what its supporters \nwant.\n  And that is what we have before us. What is truly remarkable about \nthis memo is the admission that ``subsidies are needed principally to \noffset the higher wages of U.S. mariners.'' President Clinton ignored \nthe plan supported by 15 of his agency heads including, let me say, the \nagency that is concerned and which administers our national security--\nthe Defense Department --and sent to Congress a far more expensive bill \nthat 3 years later is basically included in H.R. 1350.\n  In other words, for President Clinton, the era of expensive \nGovernment is not over. With regard to the maritime labor subsidies he \nstill supports wasteful Washington spending, and the subsidies that \nthat spending means.\n  We all thought that this Congress was going to reform welfare as we \nknow it. If we can eliminate welfare affecting the poor, you would \nthink that we could eliminate welfare of the wealthy maritime companies \nsuch as Sealand and powerful maritime unions. But, of course, as we all \nknow, welfare is great, if you can get it.\n  I suppose that might be what MIT's Defense and Arms Control Studies \nInstitute Director, Harvey Sapolsky, was driving at when he was quoted \nin the August 1991 Defense News. He said this, and I quote: ``Despite \nany accompanying rhetoric about national security, subsidies for the \nMerchant Marine fulfill the commonplace desire of obtaining a \nlivelihood without the burden of having to compete to earn a living.''\n  So I want to get it straight from the beginning of this debate. Both \nthe Clinton administration officials and the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology defense experts agree that maritime subsidies are little \nmore than welfare.\n  What I find really interesting in this whole approach is that Members \nof\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\nCongress--particularly my friends on the other side of the aisle--\ndenounce corporate welfare. And you even have Republicans saying that \nbecause we had in our tax bill of a year ago $30 billion for \nelimination of corporate welfare. So you are on to something. Yet, I \nwill bet most Democrats plan to vote in favor of H.R. 1350 which will \ngive wealthy maritime corporations hard-earned taxpayer dollars that \nthese companies hardly need; hardly need.\n  For instance, after years of opposing subsidies, Sealand looks to \ngain the most from H.R. 1350. Why should taxpayers of this great \ncountry, people that work 40 hours or more a week, or families where \ntwo people work and can't pay their bills at the end of the week \nbecause so much of their income goes for taxes--why should these hard-\nworking American taxpayers subsidize one of the world's largest and \nmost successful container vessel companies that in recent years has \nposted record-breaking profits? Are Democrats for corporate welfare? \nAre these the Democrats, who have awakened Republicans to the crime of \ncorporate welfare so that we put $30 billion of reduction of corporate \nwelfare in our tax bill--are they for corporate welfare now when they \nsupport this bill? It appears so. But now what is really up? It is \nthat, while Republicans complained about the millions upon millions of \ndollars that the AFL-CIO is spending to return Congress to Democratic \nParty control, my Republican-controlled Congress is on the verge of \napproving $1 billion in subsidies for some of the most politically \nactive labor unions in the country.\n\n  How many Tuesdays and Wednesdays that Republicans meet--this is no \nclandestine meeting. These meetings are on everybody's schedule. How \noften do we meet as a Republican Party --I suppose the Democrats meet \nas the Democratic Party, and they may talk about the same things we \ntalk about but from a different perspective--how many times do we meet \nand the subject is always coming up of the $35 million that the AFL-CIO \nis raising by taxing their members more--that $35 million is on top of \nwhat they are paying in labor union dues--this $35 million for the \ncampaign for Democrats to regain control of the U.S. Senate?\n  We are always talking about that. We are nervous about that. We think \nit is awful that 40 percent of the union members who vote Republican \nare taxed by their leadership to run these horrible ads, and let me say \nintellectually dishonest ads, scaring the old people of America against \nRepublicans. Forty percent of those union members vote Republican. They \nare taxed to run these ads against the political philosophy that they \nagree with, and they do not even have anything to say about it because \nthis administration rescinded a rule that the Supreme Court gave the \nminority of American union members the right to ask for their dues \nback, that portion of which goes for political education. That rule was \nrescinded by this administration, so that 40 percent of the union \nmembers this year pay these dues to perpetuate a lie on television.\n  We are concerned about that in our Republican caucus, and yet here we \nhave a Republican-controlled Congress on the verge of approving $1 \nbillion in subsidies for some of the most politically active labor \nunions in this country.\n  Now, I want to give this some perspective because this is not just $1 \nbillion, and this is not just $35 million that is being spent for this \nadvertising now; this is real money per seafarer.\n  In an old report, in 1977, by the former House Merchant Marine \nSubcommittee ranking Republican, because the Republicans were in the \nminority then, Congressman McCloskey of California said all of the AFL-\nCIO members each averaged about 11 cents towards campaign \ncontributions.\n  Obviously, that is way up now with the $35 million.\n  But there is a contrast between the rest of the AFL-CIO and the \nSeafarers International Union that contributed $29.06 to political \nactivity. The Marine Engineers Beneficial Association gave a whopping \n$56.81 per seafarer, which is over 500 times what the average AFL-CIO \nmember gave.\n  So here we Republicans stand today about to approve a 10-year $1 \nbillion subsidy to pay maritime labor which, at least back in the \n1970's, was about 500 times more politically active than the rest of \nthe AFL-CIO unions.\n  Remember, that is what the Clinton Cabinet told us these subsidies \nwere for--to pay for high-cost maritime labor unions. And I want to \nread that quote again. Secretary Pena said that you could not go with \nthat option that 15 out of 16 Democrat agency heads wanted because it \nprovided ``less support than is sought by the industry and its \nsupporters.''\n  Now, that is problem No. 1 of this bill.\n  Problem No. 2 is that the Department of Defense already has VISA. \nVISA is an acronym for Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement--VISA, V-\nI-S-A, Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement. We are being told that \nthis bill, H.R. 1350, will provide our national defense with a \nwonderful new intermodal transportation system that is crucial in time \nof national emergency. What is not commonly known is that VISA--again, \nthe Volunteer Intermodal Sealift Agreement--is already in place and \nwill be used to implement H.R. 1350.\n  Most U.S.-flag carriers have already transferred from the Sealift \nReadiness Program to VISA. The key point is legal authority already \nexists for VISA, and that is the Defense Production Act of 1950, and \ntherefore H.R. 1350 and S. 1139 are not needed--not needed unless, of \ncourse, you want to funnel welfare subsidies to maritime unions, as \nrevealed in the Rubin-Clinton memo.\n\n  So not only is this a high-cost program, but it adds little national \nsecurity benefit. What kind of a deal is that for the already heavily \nburdened taxpayers of this great country, people who are spending for \nState, local, and Federal taxation 40 cents. A Washington bureaucracy \nis going to waste this money.\n  Problem No. 3 is that in the process of consideration of this \nlegislation and building grassroots support for it, the active and \nretired military was misinformed. So some would ask the question, is \nthis merely labor and corporate welfare? And, if so, why does our \nmilitary support H.R. 1350 and S. 1139? The answer is simple. The \nRubin-Clinton memo is evidence of the real position of our defense \nofficials--not this bill. They offered a deficit-neutral plan that \nwould subsidize their true military requirements--as few as 20 U.S.-\nflag vessels.\n  But when the Commander in Chief--and that is President Clinton--\nignores his defense officials--he ignored the Department of Defense; he \nignored 14 other agency heads--and he chooses a more expensive plan, \nthe subsidies that are now included in this bill, then, of course, at \nthat point you know he is the Commander in Chief. The military heads \nhave no other choice but to publicly support their Commander in Chief's \ndecision. Anybody participating in defense budget hearings has \nexperienced firsthand this problem. Military leaders have to fall in \nline with the Commander in Chief.\n  But what about all of those retired admirals who support the Maritime \nSecurity Act? You can legitimately ask, shouldn't their view be \nentertained with some degree of authority because of their lifetime \ncommitment to the national security of our country?\n  It has become clear to me that these retired admirals lent their name \nto an effort for which they had few reliable facts. Certainly, they did \nnot know about the specific problems with the bill, nor did they know \nanything about the Defense Department's position, and they surely did \nnot know about the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo.\n  As I stated earlier, I wrote to a number of these retired admirals \ngiving them a copy of the Rubin-Clinton maritime memo, and I also sent \nthem other information.\n  I received those very interesting responses that I have already \nquoted from. Some felt that they had not been fully informed and now \nsupport, at the very least, further hearings, and some support these \namendments.\n  Problem No. 4 is that we have adequate sealift capacity with or \nwithout these subsidies. Now, here you get to the nitty-gritty of this \nlegislation. It has been the same nitty-gritty for 50 years that we \nhave been trying to promote a strong maritime industry. The excuse is \nwe need it for our national security. I say, and the Department of \nDefense says, in a deficit-neutral way, with one of the other three \noptions,\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\ntheir demands for the shipment of materiel in wartime can be met.\n  U.S.-flag companies have made it clear that their vessels will be \navailable for national defense sealift if they reflag. In fact, our \nGovernment makes certain that, if they reflag, they flag under a \ncountry that allows the United States to maintain control over the \nvessels. The Defense Department Joint Chiefs of Staff prepared a \ndefinitive analysis of the sealift capacity and availability. It is \nincluded in the MRS Mobility Review Study, Bottom-Up Review update.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an unclassified \ntable from this study, which details the projected sealift capacity \nupon which our military can depend.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   TABLE C-17.--(U) FISCAL YEAR 2001 PROJECTED SEALIFT ASSETS WITHOUT MARITIME REFORM                                   \n                                                                     [Unclassified]                                                                     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Fleet                                Ship type                  Number         SqFt capacity       TEU capacity      Cube capacity  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRRF.........................................

What is striking about this table is the extent of the \nvast array of sealift capacity that will be available to the United \nStates in the event that H.R. 1350 subsidies are not passed.\n  I want my colleagues to note in particular the large number of \nvessels available to us. These vessels are what we call ``effective \nU.S.-controlled vessels,'' and they include vessels that are owned by \nAmerican companies. Foreign flags are reliable. First of all, keep in \nmind that many foreign-flag vessels are actually owned and controlled \nby American companies. They flag foreign, they flag under a foreign \nnation primarily to avoid the unbearable cost of the high salaries and \nbenefits of U.S. seafarers. Foreign-flag vessels delivered about 50 \npercent of all cargo in the Persian Gulf war. Nearly 200 foreign ships \nwere chartered from 36 nations. Only one ship loaded under DOD contract \ndid not complete its voyage. The handful of small foreign feeder \nproblems were the result of contract disputes with U.S.-flag carriers, \nnot foreign flags.\n  But far more important is the fact that Congress has already funded \nthe Department of Defense's wartime sealift requirements. Congress \nprovided over $7 billion in the 1980's and will provide another $10 \nbillion in this decade to meet the Department of Defense's unique \nstrategic sealift requirements. The Department of Defense has, over the \nlast two decades, constructed and purchased a sealift force to \nunilaterally meet our prepositioning and surge sealift wartime \nrequirements as specified by the Bottom-Up Review. The ships of the \nDepartment of Defense's strategic sealift force are of the unique \nmilitary design required to transport heavy tanks and other outsized \nfighting equipment.\n  Remember, most of the vessels subsidized by the Maritime Security Act \nare container vessels that will carry, primarily, sustainment supplies, \nsuch as clothing and food, and not sensitive military equipment. This \nbrings all the more light to the significance of the conclusion of \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology's defense expert, Harvey \nSapolsky, who stated:\n\n       Most of the amount hauled in a crisis is done by \n     government-owned standby and reserve ships.\n       Moreover, there is a ready charter market for commercial \n     cargo vessels when more ships are needed.\n       The price required for these services in a crisis is \n     cheaper than the cost of maintaining a large subsidized \n     commercial fleet for a mobilization that may not happen again \n     for years.\n\n  So, with problem No. 4, the Department of Defense has the capability \nof meeting our national security needs, getting our materiel from \nwherever it is now to wherever it must be to conduct war. They do not \nneed this legislation. The Department of Defense said that when they \nrecommended, along with 14 other department heads, to the President of \nthe United States that there is a revenue-neutral, there is a budget-\nneutral way of doing this that meets our national security needs. That \nis the Department of Defense. That is 14 other department heads that \nsay that.\n  Problem No. 5, this bill is not needed to maintain an adequate pool \nof American seafarers for defense sealift. This, again, refers to the \nRubin-Clinton maritime memo. These subsidies will preserve about 2,500 \nseafaring jobs. There are numerous other sealift manning options. Mr. \nPresident, $100 million a year to save 2,500 jobs is too steep a price \nfor taxpayers, in view of all these other options; $100 million to save \n2,500 jobs.\n\n  This is the high cost of maintaining a monopoly, as I said earlier. \nThis high cost reflects the great success in playing the Washington \npower game.\n  Modern, highly automated ships require fewer seafarers. The \nGovernment has carefully studied many measures to crew sealift. These \ninclude expanding the Naval and Merchant Marine Reserve programs.\n  What would be particularly cost effective is the option of certifying \nthe mariners employed in the Great Lakes and inland waterways. This \noption would provide a very large labor pool of over 60,000 mariners \nwho could be used during a national emergency.\n  Again, if you read the Rubin-Clinton memo, at the bottom of page 3--\nand this will be made available; it has been made available for \neverybody this morning in their offices, so every staff\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\nperson has this. The Clinton administration argues this:\n\n       Subsidizing carriers simply to preserve jobs would leave \n     the Administration hard pressed to explain why it should not \n     also subsidize every other industry that suffers job losses.\n\n  It is too bad that part of the Rubin memo was not followed, because \nthat lays it out as plain and simple as you can. If you spend $100 \nmillion to save these 2,500 jobs, it is going to open it up so the \nPresident is letting down the floodgates for efforts for other new \nsubsidies for other whole industries that suffer job losses.\n  I might ask, just what kind of seafarers' salaries and benefits are \nwe forcing taxpayers to support? Again, in the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology Manning study--according to this study, a master or a \ncaptain billet costs about $34,000 per month to pay for salary, \nbenefits, and overtime; $34,000 per month. The earlier draft report \nplaced the monthly cost at $44,000, but was lowered in the final report \nwhen I made it public that the taxpayers are forced to subsidize about \n85 percent of these salary and benefit costs.\n  This MIT study concluded that with adequate reforms, such as \neliminating featherbedding, we can lower subsidies to a little over $1 \nmillion per year. Unfortunately, H.R. 1350 provides well over twice \nthat recommended by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is \n$2 million per year.\n  Again, the Rubin-Clinton memo says at the bottom of page 9:\n\n       Subsidies are needed principally to offset the higher wages \n     of U.S. mariners.\n\n  Let's face it, these high-priced wages and benefits taxpayers are \nforced to subsidize are at the heart of the demise of our merchant \nmarine fleet. A dozen years ago, then military sealift commander, Vice \nAdm. Kent Carroll, warned our merchant marine was crumbling. Twelve \nyears ago, we had a vice admiral warning us about the crumbling of our \nmerchant marine:\n\n       Why are we in such a mess? One of the reasons is that crew \n     costs continue to be the highest in the world. Monthly crew \n     costs of U.S.-flag ships are as much as three times higher \n     than those of countries with comparable standards of living, \n     such as Norway.\n\n  Mr. President, the former military sealift commander hit it on the \nhead. The taxpayer-supported crew costs are driving U.S. carriers to \nreflag. It makes a mess of the U.S.-flag merchant marine, and it makes \na mess for the American taxpayers. It is time for real reform, but that \nhas to be real commonsense reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, for more than 5 years, the Congress \nand two administrations have worked on a bipartisan basis to develop \nand enact into law a critical program to reform Federal support for the \nU.S. flag maritime industry and to revitalize our merchant marine as an \nelement of our national defense sealift.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and \nMerchant Marine of the Commerce Committee, I am proud to say that this \njob is nearly complete. On December 6 of last year, the legislation \nthat embodies this program, H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act of \n1995, passed the House of Representatives with overwhelming support by \nvoice vote, with full leadership support on both sides of the aisle. \nHere in the Senate, we have held full, open and public hearings in the \nCommerce Committee with all interested parties having the opportunity \nto present their views for and against this program. Significantly, all \nindividuals or organizations affiliated or associated with national \ndefense indicated support for this proposal.\n  I think you can see from the bipartisan nature of this bill--my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle and I, working with Senator \nStevens, who is the manager of this bill--that there is agreement on a \nvery important reform that we must produce, and it improves the \nefficiency of the current program.\n  Here is what the bill does:\n  The Maritime Security Act will provide a fleet of militarily useful \nU.S.-flag commercial vessels and their American citizen crews for our \nNation's defense airlift and sealift, as well as guaranteed access to \nmodern intermodal transportation networks and management that can \ndeliver cargo from Kansas to Kuwait and track it every step of the way.\n  For DOD to duplicate this necessary capability, it would cost over \n$800 million per year, eight times the yearly cost of the Maritime \nSecurity Program. When you think about it, maintaining that kind of \nship fleet would be something that the Department of Defense would say \nwould certainly increase their budget. But here we can do it for half \nthe amount than has been done in the past, and it will do the job.\n  The Maritime Security Program Act, the bill we are discussing, will \ncut the cost of Federal support for these sealift vessels more than 50 \npercent from the program now in existence. This will have a spending \nlimit of $100 million a year, compared to the current level of roughly \n$210 million per year, and this funding is subject to appropriations, \nnot an entitlement, which is currently the case. So you can see that we \nare cutting back on the subsidy while maintaining this fleet at a much \nmore efficient rate than we could do if we had to maintain the fleets \nwithin the Department of Defense.\n  The Maritime Security Act will eliminate outdated and unnecessary \nrules and regulations which impede the ability of U.S.-flag commercial \nvessels to compete, and that prevents, of course, the expansion and \nmodernization of the U.S.-flag fleet. These changes will give our fleet \nmore incentive to hold down costs.\n  This act will encourage the construction of commercial vessels in \nU.S. shipyards, a vital program for our economy and for our defense \nindustrial base.\n  This act is essential to our defense. It is needed now, more than \never. Let me give you an example of how this works.\n  During Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, more than 350 ships \nin more than 500 voyages supported the multinational coalition, \ndelivering an average of 42,000 tons of cargo each day. Under this \nprogram, 350 ships participated. At the height of this activity, there \nwas a ship every 50 miles, a steel bridge along an 8,000-mile sea lane \nbetween the United States and the Persian Gulf. Ninety-five percent of \nall equipment and supplies needed by American soldiers in the field was \nmoved by sealift. One-third was shipped on privately owned U.S. flag \nvessels, just what we are talking about today.\n  Using U.S.-flag vessels was more cost effective during Desert Storm. \nIt cost about $174 per ton of cargo under non-U.S.-flag vessels, but \nwith U.S. flags, it was $122, a 30-percent savings.\n  But more important, we were able to put American cargo on American \nships using American crews to deliver to our American troops. In a time \nof crisis, we cannot depend on foreign ships. We cannot depend on \nforeign crews for sealift and sustainment requirements. Without this \nlegislation, our Armed Forces would have to trust foreign vessels for \nthe supplies and support they need to fight and win.\n  Mr. President, that is not right, and we are not going to let it \nhappen. More recent events in the Persian Gulf area, where many of our \nclosest allies have either refused to participate or refused to allow \ntheir soil to support American military operations, should make it very \nclear to everyone that we must have sealift fleets of vessels that we \ncan count on under our flag and manned by Americans, and that is what \nthis act does.\n  This act has the strong endorsement of the Department of Defense. \nGeneral Rutherford, the commander in chief of the U.S. Transportation \nCommand, our Nation's top logistics commander, testified at our \nCommerce Committee hearing last July that his command wants assured \naccess to this type of quality and quantity of sealift capacity and \nmariners necessary to meet Department of Defense contingency \noperations.\n  This bill provides that. Without the enactment of this legislation \nthis year, America's merchant marine on the sea lanes of the world \ncould essentially disappear.\n  I am told that our number of U.S.-flagged ships could drop to below \n100. Forty years ago, this country had the largest merchant marine \nfleet in the world and over 4,000 vessels flying the U.S. flag in \ninternational trade. Today, there are fewer than 400. Today, we are the \nworld's largest trading nation, but 15 countries have bigger fleets \nthan we\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\ndo. We send 96 percent of U.S. exports overseas on foreign-flagged \nships. The United States must not become a second-class maritime power.\n  Geography dictates that lesson today as much as it did 50 years ago. \nThis Maritime Security Act is sound and vitally important. It is \nimportant legislation for our Nation's security, and it has been \ncarefully developed by both Houses of Congress. It is essential to \nmaintaining our maritime industry and defense readiness.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a bill whose time has come. I urge all of \nmy colleagues to support it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair and my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I would like to start off by saying how much we all \nappreciate the work that Senator Inouye and Senator Stevens and other \nmembers of the committee have done in bringing this legislation to the \nfloor.\n  It was interesting that one of our colleagues earlier said this is a \nnew subsidy program. Well, it certainly is not a new subsidy program. \nWe have had a maritime bill since 1936 which has done essentially what \nthis bill does, and that is to support the American maritime industry. \nThere is nothing new about this program. It certainly is not a new \nsubsidy program.\n  It is new only in the sense that it is a major reform plan. It is a \nmajor reform plan in a number of significant ways because we on the \ncommittee, and I think most Members of Congress, know that while the \nold program has been a great help to our American maritime industry, \nthere were some ways it could be improved.\n  I am not going to take a long time to hear myself talk on this \nproposition because I am not sure that there are right now any \namendments even pending to the bill. I would like to think we ought to \ngo ahead and pass it and move on to something else rather than spend \ntime talking to each other about why we think it is a good bill.\n  I have only heard one of our colleagues talk in opposition to the \nbill. I think we ought to go along and get it passed. If anybody has \nany amendments, bring them up, let us debate them and move on with \nthem.\n  I would like to point out that this is a major improvement. This is a \nmajor reform bill. No. 1, it greatly reduces the amount of money \navailable to the American maritime industry to keep these private \nvessels available for the Department of Defense. It used to be running \nabout $225 million a year. We have cut it by more than half. The \nassistance that is in this bill is less than half of what the \nassistance to the ships in the American fleet used to be. When there is \na greater demand for more, we in this bill have come up with \nsubstantially less.\n  So to those who say, well, we may have been spending more than we \nshould have, this bill addresses it. Instead of $225 million a year \nbeing available to keep these ships afloat, this bill has $100 million \na year.\n  The second major improvement is that it is not an entitlement \nprogram. Throughout the history of the bill it has been an entitlement \nprogram. Whatever money was required was automatically available to the \nship owners. This bill provides, for the first time--and this is a \nmajor, major change--that any of the assistance programs available to \nany of these ships has to be appropriated funds, appropriated by the \nCongress of the United States. It is no longer an entitlement program. \nThat, obviously, is a major, major, and a very substantial improvement \nover the existing program.\n\n  It is subject to annual appropriations. That simply means--we all \nunderstand this--that every Member of Congress will get to look at this \npiece of legislation and this program, see how it is working, see \nwhether we can justify the money each year and, if so, appropriate \nthose amounts of money. On the other hand, if they think it is not \nworking, then we have the same ability to lessen those appropriations. \nI think this is an absolute minimum that cannot go down any further \nthan this.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Texas--and I was listening to her \nremarks--was talking about, this bill is important to the national \nsecurity, the national defense of the United States. Simply put, we are \nspending a lot less money to have ships available in times of a \nnational emergency than if we did not have this program, because if we \ndid not have this program we would be spending up to $300 million per \nship to have them just sit there and wait to be used in a time of \nnational emergency.\n  It is far better to say that we are going to help the operation of \nsome American commercial vessels that are operating every day out \nthere, that are crewed with U.S. men and women who have been trained \nand who are able-bodied seamen, who understand how to run these ships, \ndo it every day, that we can call on those ships and say, yes, this is \nan emergency in a particular part of the world, and we need this ship \nright away to transport ammunition and equipment to some far part of \nthe world to take care of a national emergency.\n  If we had to spend defense dollars to have these ships sitting there \nwhen there is not an emergency, we would be spending a lot more money \nthan a paltry $100 million. It would pale in comparison, if we had to \nbuild five or six $300 million vessels just to sit there in case \nsomeday we might need them and they will be there.\n  Not only that, if we had the ships there, there is no guarantee the \ncrew would be there. If the ships are just sitting somewhere in dry \ndock, what is the crew doing? The crew is not doing anything--it \nprobably does not have a crew. So then you have to go out and find the \ncrew members in the time of a national emergency. Guess what? They are \nnot going to be there.\n  So this legislation takes a very careful approach by helping to \nassist commercial vessels to operate with U.S.-trained crews, to have \nthem available in times of a national emergency. They are ready to go \nfrom day one. And every private company that gets an assistance program \nunder this legislation has to agree in advance that that ship will be \navailable in times of a national emergency.\n  That is what this program is all about. It has been there since 1936. \nI suggest that when everybody says, well, we should not have subsidy \nprograms, let us start off by saying, well, let us eliminate subsidies \nall over the world. It would be a great world. But that is not the real \nworld. We have agricultural programs which have subsidies. I have \nsupported them. I think they are necessary. But we also ought to have \nprograms that make sense from a national security standpoint, from a \nnational defense standpoint. I suggest that this is that bill.\n\n  This is not a new bill. This is not a new subsidy bill. It is a major \nreform bill subject to annual appropriations every year, and we have \nreduced the amount available by over 50 percent, from $225 to $100 \nmillion a year. That is a substantial and major, major change.\n  The other good news is, it has always been bipartisan. This has never \nbeen a Democrat-versus-Republican piece of legislation. It has the \nsupport that we have today. The majority leader, Trent Lott, from \nMississippi, strongly supports it. Senator Inouye from Hawaii strongly \nsupports it. Senator Stevens strongly supports it. Senator Hutchison, \nfrom Texas, myself, from Louisiana, we all recognize that this is \nimportant for the national security of this country. It has always been \nbipartisan.\n  The first proposal which, in fact, really moved toward reforming this \nprogram was by President Bush, who really, for the first time in a long \ntime, got involved in this and really had a Secretary of \nTransportation, Andy Card, who really said, ``Yes, I'm going to put \nthis deal together.'' And we worked on it in a bipartisan fashion. And, \nlo and behold, we now have this bill that President Clinton supports, \nthat Secretary Pena has worked on for so long and so hard. It has been \nbipartisan. It was very similar before under President Bush and is very \nsimilar now under President Clinton and the Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  So this is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation. It has national \ndefense implications. It is not a runaway program. We have drastically \ncurtailed it. We have made it subject to annual appropriations.\n  I suggest, let us get on with the voting. I mean, if we have \namendments, let us offer them and let us debate\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\nthem. Let us finish this. We are wasting time by just, I think, looking \nat it and talking about it and talking about it and talking about it \nand talking about it. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that I agree totally \nwith the Senator from Louisiana. This is a bill that has been worked on \nfor a long time, and if there are going to be amendments--and that is \nfine--let us bring them up. Let us talk about them.\n  I think it is time to move this bill. It is a good bill. It is \nreform. It is going to save the taxpayers of this country $100 million \nwhile preserving the right of our Department of Defense to take those \nships when we need them, as we did in Desert Storm. It worked. It \nworked. And it is going to be better.\n  I think it is time for us to come together. Let us talk about the \namendments. Let them have their fair shot, and let us get on with it. I \nappreciate his remarks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to hear the \nRepublican manager of the bill, the Senator from Texas, speak about her \nsupport of this legislation, and for part of my remarks, she was \nabsent. I wanted to remind her of some concerns I have about this \nlegislation.\n  That concern is the oddity we have here of the Democratic Members of \nthis body campaigning to end corporate welfare, to such an extent that \nthey even have us Republicans proposing tax legislation to eliminate \n$30 billion of corporate welfare in our tax bill last year, and now the \nparty that encourages doing away with corporate welfare, the Democratic \nParty, is very much for this legislation. Then you have the oddity of \nRepublicans who considering the upcoming election are very, very \nconcerned about the labor unions spending $35 million for the \nDemocratic Party, to help the Democratic Party regain control of the \nCongress, and Republicans abhorring that situation. Then here we have a \nbill that is corporate welfare. It is also maritime union welfare.\n  So we have the oddity of Democrats who condemn corporate welfare \nvoting for a bill that is going to establish more corporate welfare, \nand you have Republicans who say how awful it is that men and women who \nbelong to unions do not have any choice about the assessment for $35 \nmillion more so that the unions can run ads against Republicans when 40 \npercent of the union Members vote Republican. Then here we are as \nRepublicans, promoting legislation that is going to feed the treasury \nof the maritime unions.\n  This follows on that memo to the President where Secretary Pena was \nadvising the President to ignore the recommendations of 15 out of 16 \nCabinet agencies who said an option that was budget neutral and would \nstill meet the national security demands of our country should be \nignored because the industry--meaning the maritime industry; and its \nsupporters, meaning the maritime unions--wanted this legislation that \nhad this subsidy in it.\n  So I hear the Senator from Texas suggesting support for this \nlegislation, contrary to a lot of concerns we have on this side of the \naisle. And when we have meetings of our party--and she is one of the \nleader's of our party--very concerned about what is being done through \nthe use of mandatory checkoff of union dues. In our councils, we are \nconcerned about this. Then I see the leaders of our party supporting, \nalmost, the buying of the rope to hang ourselves.\n  I remind the Senator from Texas that we have letters here from four \norganizations who I think she would agree with 95 percent of the time, \nwho we would agree with 95 percent of the time, who oppose this \nlegislation. From Americans for Tax Reform, I have a letter that says:\n\n       This legislation, the Maritime Reform and Security Act of \n     1995 now pending in the Senate, Americans for Tax Reform \n     strongly oppose the continuation of commercial maritime \n     subsidies in any form, and strongly urges you to remove any \n     such subsidies from this bill.\n\n  I have a letter from the National Taxpayer Union, also cosigned by \nthe Council for Citizens Against Government Waste that says:\n\n       Most Members of the 104th Congress have prided themselves \n     in ending welfare as we know it. Unfortunately, the Senate \n     may soon consider H.R. 1350, the Maritime Security Act, which \n     is nothing more than a corporate and labor union welfare. The \n     Council for Citizens Against Government Waste will key vote \n     these votes for 1996 congressional ratings,\n\nand then it says that they are very much against this legislation.\n  Then I will read from Citizens for a Sound Economy:\n\n       On behalf of the 250,000 members across America, I want to \n     express our strong opposition to H.R. 1350, the so-called \n     Maritime Security Act and our strong support for \n     amendments to this bill offered by Senator Charles \n     Grassley. The amendments would limit the cost to the \n     taxpayer from this proposal without weakening our national \n     defense.\n\n  I encourage leaders of our party, particularly those who are leaders \nof the group of us that have the most fiscally sound voting records, \npeople who are always abhorring in our party meetings the waste of the \ntaxpayers' money, and particularly when we have respected organizations \nlike I just quoted from, those which we agree with about 90 percent of \nthe time, why are we off the beaten path on this issue? Why are we \nRepublicans, who pride ourselves for fiscal conservatism, subsidizing \nan industry, some of the same companies in the industry, that have the \nvery highest of profits in recent months?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before the Senator from Iowa leaves, let \nme tell him I compliment him for his courage in taking on this issue. I \nagree with him. I think the subsidies that the Senator outlined are \noutlandish, they are not sustainable, they are not necessary, and they \nshould be eliminated.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator in the near future to have \nan amendment to do that. I compliment him for his statement, for his \nwork, and for the work of the organizations trying to save taxpayers' \ndollars and to ensure that Government act responsibly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1350, \nlegislation to revitalize and stabilize our maritime industry. It is \nlong past time for legislation to stop the flight away from the U.S. \nflag. The United States has a long and honorable maritime heritage and \ntradition, but we are facing the prospect that our maritime industry \nmight not be part of our future.\n  The U.S. Government has imposed regulatory demands on the U.S. \nshipping industry, demands that are similar to those we impose on other \nindustries. These demands reflect our national interest in protecting \nthe safety of our workers and our environment and include tax \nliabilities, safety regulations, and operating requirements. While our \nmaritime industry carries these regulatory responsibilities, other \nadvanced nations have given special treatment to their maritime \nindustries in efforts to maintain core shipping capacity. But even such \nspecial treatment has often been insufficient to help shipping \ncompanies to resist the temptation to shift their operations to \nunregulated, untaxed flags of convenience offered by certain less \ndeveloped countries. Currently, over two-thirds of the world ocean-\ngoing fleet is operated under flags of convenience.\n  The Maritime Security Program is designed to offset the costs of \noperating under the application of U.S. law, and to stem the flight of \nU.S. vessels from U.S.-flag to flags of convenience. H.R. 1350 \ncompletely overhauls the existing maritime subsidy program, and \nultimately will reduce Government expenditures on maritime policies by \nover one-half. The program will help our vessels compete globally by \nreducing some of the regulatory burdens that have restricted the \ncommercial operations of U.S.-flag operators.\n  In exchange for receiving payments under this program, U.S.-flag \noperators will be required to sign agreements to make their vessels and \nrelated intermodal assets available to the Department of Defense [DOD] \nto sustain U.S. defense operations. Additionally, the operation of U.S. \nvessels generates a surplus of U.S. mariners. U.S. vessels operate 7 \ndays a week, all year round, thus necessitating more than one mariner \nfor each particular position. This\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\nsurplus of mariners is instrumental in the crewing and operation of our \nreserve fleet of vessels. In the Persian Gulf war, the ability to crew \nour reserve fleet was seriously questioned, and the United States was \nforced to rely on 60- and 70-year-old merchant marine pensioners. \nWithout the Maritime Security Program, we will not be able to crew the \nreserve fleet.\n  The United States relies on ocean transportation for international \ntrade purposes and almost 99 percent of our international trade arrives \non board a ship. Without a U.S.-flag merchant marine, we will be held \nhostage to the trade policies of foreign nations who would transport \nour goods abroad. The United States also relies on ocean transportation \nto protect our national security interests. U.S. shipping companies are \nrequired to sustain U.S. troops in foreign conflicts, and U.S. seamen \nnot presently serving aboard ships are capable of being utilized to \nactivate our reserve fleet of vessels in order to transport military \nequipment and other military surge cargoes. The continued presence of \nan active maritime industry ensures that the United States will not \nhave to rely on the kindness of other nations to achieve important \nnational economic and national security objectives.\n  The United States is the world's only remaining superpower, but we \ncould be put in the position of sending U.S. troops into war with only \nthe promise that we would supply them, and then only if DOD can charter \nvessels willing to deliver cargo into the war zone. This position would \nbe simply unacceptable. Ironically, DOD has spent billions of dollars \nin the construction of surge sealift vessels, and billions of dollars \nin maintaining a Reserve Fleet of vessels. However, DOD has neglected \nthe most important component in marine transportation: who will \nnavigate those ships and deliver the cargo. The commercial U.S.-flag \nindustry provides a labor pool of experienced personnel capable of \ncontributing to any defense logistical support need. If we do not pass \nthis legislation, DOD will be forced to implement a new, and I will \nguarantee, costly program to train mariners for use in reserve \nsituations.\n  Attempts to formulate a maritime reform bill over the years have had \nbipartisan support, and I look forward to continued efforts with my \ncolleagues to revitalize our maritime industry. However, today we \nshould take the necessary steps forward to ensure that the United \nStates continues to have a maritime industrial base--it is simply too \nimportant to our national and economic interests to allow to vanish \ninto the mist.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the U.S. merchant marine is facing an \nuncertain future. The U.S. commercial fleet is falling behind which \ndiminishes its power to protect the United States' interests abroad and \nat home.\n  This is why I strongly support the Maritime Security Act of 1995, \nH.R. 1350. This bill would be the beginning of the rebuilding of the \nU.S. merchant marine fleet. It will establish a fleet of privately \nowned, active and military capable ships to help maintain the defense \nof the United States' interests. This will help maintain peace and \nprotect cargo during times of crisis in the world. The fleet would also \nbe updated because of the bylines in the bill which in itself would \nmake the merchant marine stronger and allow it to continue being \ncompetitive in the world market.\n  This bill through the building of the fleet will create jobs in many \nsectors of the economy. The increase in the economy will range from the \nworkers on the ship all the way to those manufacturing the parts. The \nbill will also change the way that the costs of running a ship in the \nUnited States are offset. This will encourage more owners to register \ntheir ships under the U.S. flag. From the changes, old outdated \nregulations will be cut, such as the way to replace older vessels. This \nin itself will help keep costs down and help generate profits and \nrevenues for all.\n  This legislation is very much in our national interest. And I, \ntherefore urge its passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \naddress a very serious concern about the pending legislation.\n  The bill authorizes the payment of $1 billion to American shipping \ncompanies over the next 10 years to subsidize a 47-vessel, commercially \nowned Maritime Security Fleet.\n  Operators of American-owned, flagged and manned merchant marine ships \nparticipating in the MSF will receive a yearly $2.1-million retainer to \nremain on call to provide sealift services in the time of national \nemergency.\n  I appreciate that this new approach replaces the current, more costly \nprogram, which pays American shipowners an ``operating differential \nsubsidy'' to remain available in the event of conflict. Under the ODS \nprogram, the Federal Treasury pays carriers the added cost of operating \na ship under the American flag rather than foreign flag--a yearly \nfigure that has hovered around $4 million.\n  So, I agree this program improves on the current situation. But, Mr. \nPresident, I believe we can do much better. I hope all Senators would \nagree we have an obligation to fully meet our military needs as cost-\neffectively as possible. The fact that the new program is more cost-\neffective than the existing scheme does not relieve us of our \nobligation to ensure that we continue to pursue the most cost-effective \napproach to meet our needs.\n  Let me emphasize: I profoundly appreciate that sealift is essential \nto effectively meet our security obligations across the globe, and that \nwe must assure access to dependable vessels and qualified crews who \nwill remain loyal to our cause.\n  Nevertheless, I am concerned that we are embarking on a program that \nmay be excessively expensive. One that is not based on reasonable \ncontingency scenarios and one that does not take into account our \naccess to vessels and manpower other than the domestic carriers \nqualified to participate in the MSF.\n  When I asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff the number of American \ncommercial ships which are necessary to meet our readiness needs, I was \ninformed that they do not have a definitive answer to that question. I \nam very dubious about authorizing a $1-billion program without such \nbasic information.\n  It is important to point out that the 47-ship level is based on \nassumptions that the United States must fight two major wars \nsimultaneously with no allied assistance.\n  Sealift planning, like all readiness programs, should be based on \nrealistic scenarios. Failing to plan realistically wastes money and \nskews priorities.\n  For instance, I don't believe it is realistic to expect that, in a \nscenario in which the United States is fighting two major wars, we will \nnot have access to any allied ships.\n  Second, according to the Bottom-Up Review, the United States has \naccess to nearly 90 ships which are operated under a foreign flag but \nare owned by United States citizens or companies and can be called upon \nin time of war. Our planning scenarios do not take into consideration \nour access to those vessels, many of which might be militarily useful.\n  My overwhelming desire is that we have strong and prosperous domestic \nmerchant marine. I would hope, however, that we could accomplish that \ngoal without having to resort to expensive subsidy programs. I would \nprefer that we address the core problems that make it much more \nexpensive and difficult to operate under the American flag and \neliminate incentives for carriers to operate under foreign flag.\n  I have discussed this matter with the distinguished majority leader. \nHe understands my concerns, and we have agreed to jointly request from \nthe Pentagon an analysis to determine the number of ships needed for \nthe MSF, taking into account reasonable planning scenarios and our \nneeds, factoring in: our access to allied ships; the availability of \nU.S.-owned vessels operated under a foreign flag; the impact of the \nongoing equipment prepositioning program; and the Pentagon's own \nsealift shipbuilding program. We should only subsidize those ships to \nprovide services which far less costly alternatives cannot provide. We \nwill request the Pentagon to report its findings no later than May 1, \n1997.\n  Mr. LOTT. I first want to thank my colleague for his careful \nattention to this very important matter of national security and \neconomic security. The Senator from Arizona has given our Nation's \nfuture maritime policy very thorough scrutiny, and he should be \napplauded for his efforts. Our colleague, Senator Pressler, has also\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nbeen in close consultation with me regarding maritime policy, and I \nwish to acknowledge his concern and his constructive efforts as well.\n  Let me begin by saying to the Senator from Arizona that I understand \nhis concern and will join with him to request a report from the \nDepartment of Defense which describes under various reasonable and \nrealistic scenarios the number of ships that should be included in the \nMaritime Security Fleet Program. I am firmly convinced that American-\nflag ships, crewed with loyal, American-citizen mariners, provide the \nmost reliable, effective, and efficient means of meeting our Nation's \nsustainment sealift requirements and for providing the dedicated \nmanpower to crew the Defense Department's organic surge vessels. At the \nsame time, I agree it will be helpful for the Defense Department's \nreport to also include information relating to DOD's reasonable \nexpectations for access to allied ships; the availability of vessels \noperated under foreign flag but owned by U.S. interests; the impact of \nprepositioning programs; the need to crew the Ready Reserve Fleet; and \nthe Pentagon's own shipbuilding program.\n\n  But I also want to emphasize that the Maritime Security Act is first \nand foremost about security. It is about protecting our national \nsecurity, by ensuring that we will continue to have at our disposal a \nfleet of militarily useful U.S.-flag commercial vessels, and a trained, \nloyal American-citizen maritime workforce, to provide our military with \nreliable, global sustainment sealift capabilities. And it is about \neconomic security, because only through maintaining a viable U.S.-flag \nmerchant fleet in international commerce can we ensure fair ocean \ntransportation rates for American businesses and consumers.\n  I want to assure the Senator that I understand his concerns with our \nGovernment's past maritime policies. That is why it is so important for \nme to make it clear that the Maritime Security Act is not business as \nusual. First, it will replace the existing Operating Differential \nSubsidy Program--at less than half the cost. Second, it is not an \nentitlement program. Only militarily useful vessels will be accepted \ninto the Maritime Security Program; the vessel owners must apply to the \nMaritime Administration for admittance into the program. And third, for \nthe first time ever, the military will have guaranteed access to the \nstate-of-the-art land and sea intermodal logistical apparatus of the \nU.S.-flag commercial fleet. The people whose business it is to move \ncargo around the world will be actively assisting the Pentagon's \ntransportation commanders, providing logistical know-how, intermodal \nequipment, and port facilities around the world.\n  The Maritime Security Program is the product of years of consultation \namong the military, the U.S. maritime community, and Congress. It is a \nwell-designed, bipartisan solution to meeting our Nation's military \nsealift requirements for the next 10 years.\n  That said, I would like to briefly address some of my colleague's \nconcerns with this legislation.\n  It is most significant that we are engaged in this debate at a time \nwhen the United States is deeply involved in military operations in \ndifferent parts of the world--specifically, Bosnia and the Middle \nEast--which demonstrates the wisdom of our top military planners who \nhave sought to prepare contingency plans should the United States \nbecome involved in two major regional conflicts simultaneously. And \nthis discussion also comes at a time when we have seen several of our \nclosest friends in the Middle East and elsewhere refuse to cooperate \nwith the United States in opposing Saddam Hussein's aggression.\n\n  The events of the past few weeks in Iraq demonstrate most clearly \nthat the United States cannot, and should not, rely on other countries \nto support our military operations. If some of our closest allies \ncannot be counted upon to allow the U.S. military to overfly their \nairspace, or to use our own American military bases located on their \nsoil to carry out our Commander-in-Chief's instructions, then how can \nwe put the safety and well-being of our troops in the hands of foreign-\nflag ships and foreign crews?\n  Furthermore, in recent years many of the vessels once in our allies' \nfleets have flagged out to flags of convenience, or joined second \nregisters, and most of their crews come from Third World nations. The \nreport that the Senator from Arizona is proposing may reinforce the \nneed for the Maritime Security Program, because the fleets of our \nallies are no longer what they once were.\n  Some of our Nation's most distinguished current and former military \nleaders have said, time and again, that we must have U.S.-flag \ncommercial ships and American-citizen crews to effectively and reliably \nmeet our sustainment sealift requirements. I agree with their \nassessment. We must make sure that our soldiers, sailors, marines, and \nairmen will not have to count on foreign-flag ships to bring their \nsupplies and ammunition to a hostile shore. They have also urged us to \nsupport the U.S.-flag merchant marine, because they know that the \nGovernment-owned Ready Reserve Force--the Pentagon's rapid deployment \nfleet--relies absolutely on the availability of American-citizen \nmerchant mariners to crew its ships. If there is no maritime \nemployment, there will be no merchant mariners, and we will be forced \nto turn elsewhere.\n  Foreign-flag ships and foreign crews have proved unreliable in the \npast, they have turned around and fled in the face of danger. The U.S.-\nflag merchant marine, on the other hand, has served with distinction \nand honor since the Revolutionary War.\n  Additionally, if we put our trust in foreign-flag vessel operators to \nprovide our sustainment sealift, we can count on them to do one thing--\ngouge us on shipping rates. During operations Desert Shield and Desert \nStorm, our Government paid $122 per ton for U.S.-flag ships to carry \nour military cargo. We had to pay foreign ships $172 per ton. If there \nis no U.S.-flag alternative to carry that cargo, I cannot imagine how \nthat price could go anywhere but up.\n  It is true that there are foreign-flag ships under the effective \ncontrol of U.S. citizens. But I would point out to my colleagues that \nsome of these are vessels that are not useful to the military, and some \nof them have foreign crews upon which we cannot rely in a crisis or \nconflict. I would also point out that the Maritime Security Act would \ncreate a partnership between U.S.-flag vessel operators and military \nlogistics planners--a partnership that is already underway, and that \npromotes joint planning and shared logistics capabilities. That, to me, \nis a much more preferable alternative to requisitioning a foreign-flag \nship that happens to be owned by an American citizen, and then facing \nthe task of refitting it, or forcing its owners to bring it to a U.S. \nport. The latter solution gets America a vessel at best, if all goes \nwell. The MSP gets America an entire intermodal network that can carry \na container from Kansas to Kuwait--under any circumstances, with \ncomplete reliability, and tracked every single step of the way.\n\n  Once again, I would like to thank my colleague for his input on this \nissue. I respect his recommendations and I welcome his assistance in \nthis matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The majority leader agrees then that before any contracts \nare renewed for the second year of the program, the fleet will be \nadjusted to the number of ships identified by the Pentagon as truly \nnecessary?\n  Mr. LOTT. As I noted earlier, the legislation we are considering \nsubjects the Maritime Security Fleet Program to the annual \nappropriations process. Consequently, my colleague is correct in that \nwe have guaranteed Congress the right to review each year the size and \nscope of the Maritime Security Fleet.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I might add the quadrennial defense review provides an \nexcellent opportunity to examine and update our needs in the area of \ncommercial sealift.\n  The majority leader is aware of a second concern I have about the \npending legislation regarding $2.1 million per vessel subsidy.\n  While the $2.1 million figure is roughly half of the per ships ODS \nsubsidy, the figure is still somewhat an arbitrary amount.\n  I believe that in acquiring necessary sealift services, we should \napply the same mechanisms of competition that we employ in other areas \nof Federal procurement and acquisition.\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\n  I'm disappointed that the bill contains no competitive bid process. \nIt may be that the number of available vessels to fully meet MSF \nrequirements will exceed the number of MSP slots.\n  In that case, we should have some mechanism to test the market and \nacquire the needed services at the lowest cost to the taxpayer through \nsome appropriate bidding procedure. Again, the majority leader and I \nhave discussed this issue. We have agreed to request the Pentagon, the \nDepartment of Transportation, and the General Accounting Office to work \ntogether to craft an appropriate competitive bidding procedure. The \nAgencies will report their recommendation no later than April 1, 1997, \nso that the procedure can be employed prior to the renewal of any \ncontracts in fiscal year 1998. Implementing the procedure will require \nstatutory changes and the majority leader has pledged to assist in \neffecting this modification.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. My colleague is correct in that I am pleased to join with \nhim to request the appropriate Federal agencies to determine whether a \ncompetitive bidding process is appropriate to the Maritime Security \nProgram and, if so, to recommend procedures for Congress to consider. \nSuch a determination and any recommendations should be submitted to us \nso that we can proceed accordingly for fiscal year 1998 appropriations.\n  In finally deciding on a competitive bidding process, however, we \nmust not undermine the program in the interest of competition. If \noperators do not have some assurance of stability if they are doing a \ngood job, they will not participate in the program and upgrade their \nvessels. In that event, we will be throwing our money away.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to raise with the majority \nleader an additional question. Section 16(e) of the bill requires the \nSecretary of Defense to select nine ships in the DOD's Ready Reserve \nFleet to receive regular maintenance and the bill directs the Secretary \nto geographically distribute the maintenance contracts. As we learned \nin the Gulf war, properly maintaining RRF vessels is critical to \nensuring timely and efficient sealift capabilities.\n  Two issues are raised. First, we must make it absolutely clear that \nin selecting which Ready Reserve ships will be maintained, our national \ndefense needs take priority over any secondary goal of geographically \ndistributing the contracts.\n  Those ships best able to meet our sealift needs under the most likely \ncontingency scenarios should be selected without any extraneous \nconsiderations.\n  Second, the goal of geographically spreading out the maintenance work \nmust not take precedence over the Secretary's responsibility to obtain \nthe highest quality services at the lowest price to the taxpayers. \nQuality and price must remain the primary consideration of where we \nchoose to have maintenance work conducted. Would the majority leader \ncomment on that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the Senator's concerns. It is certainly our \nintent that the Secretary choose those ships that are most militarily \nuseful no matter where they are ported. Furthermore, it is not our \nintention that efforts to geographically distribute RRF maintenance \ncontracts take precedence over quality and cost considerations.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So the intent of the legislation is that the Government \nacquire the highest quality services at the lowest prices, irrespective \nof where the shipyard is located, and that the ships are selected for \nmaintenance based on their military utility first and foremost.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator is correct. I appreciate the opportunity to \nmake the clarification.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Mr. President, I would like to express my \nconcern about a perhaps unintended impact of a provision of this \nlegislation regarding Maritime Security Fleet carriers who also \ncontract with the Federal Government to carry non-military cargo and \nare paid the U.S.-flag vessel contract price.\n  Such carriers will now be allowed to subcontract non-contingency \nrelated Government work to foreign-flag carriers as a replacement for \nU.S. vessels called up under the Maritime Security Fleet Program to \nserve in a time of conflict.\n  We must be sure that when such subcontracts are entered into, the \nU.S. carrier receives from the Federal Government only the amount it \npays for the subcontracted services, not the amount the carrier would \notherwise receive for providing the services directly. I think this is \na very important point.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. It is certainly our intention that \ncarriers do not automatically receive the U.S.-flag vessel contract \nprice if an MSP carrier subcontracts its work to a foreign-flag vessel. \nIt is our intent that the Federal Government be able to renegotiate \nsuch contracts, based on the cost of the replacement vessel. Again, I \nthank the Senator for making this clarification.\n  Mr. McCAIN. One final point: When the Pentagon analyzes our sea lift \nneed they should work with the DOT to determine what the availability \nof American-flagged ships would be without the subsidy program. This is \nimportant information we must have before any contracts are renewed.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand the benefits that the Maritime Security \nProgram will bring to the United States. However, I am concerned that, \nbecause this program will be funded through yearly appropriations, \nfolks will come looking for offsets every year, which might result in \nnew tax proposals, user fee proposals, new duties, or other revenue \nraising mechanisms to be imposed upon the maritime industry at some \npoint down the road.\n  This would be devastating to the export/import trade in my home State \nof Montana, as well as in other States, because a tonnage tax is \nparticularly harmful to bulk commodities. Bulk commodities, as we all \nknow, are highly price sensitive in the extremely competitive world \nmarket--an increase of a few cents a ton, caused by new taxes or fees, \ncan make the difference between whether a foreign purchaser buys U.S. \ngrain or grain from some other country.\n  I do not believe that exporters and importers should bear the burden \nof funding--through tonnage taxes or user fees--this program. On the \ncontrary, because the program is designed to benefit the country as a \nwhole, it should be funded from general receipts from the treasury, \nand, as I understand it, that is what this act does, is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct. It is an annual appropriation.\n  Mr. BURNS. So this act does not, in any way, contemplate funding this \nprogram by imposing new taxes, user fees, or other revenue raising \ndevices that would adversely affect the maritime industry customers \nlike the good farmers in Montana.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10955-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10965-S10969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA WELFARE WAIVER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, most of my colleagues are well aware that \nI have introduced legislation to rescind the portion of the DC welfare \nwaiver that was recently enacted by President Clinton, because it went \ndirectly in opposition to the welfare bill that was passed \noverwhelmingly by this body and the House of Representatives and was \nsigned by the President and is now the law of the land.\n  What a lot of people didn't know--I didn't know it--is that when the \nPresident signed the welfare reform bill that had 5-year time limits \nfor everybody in America, where no longer could you get cash assistance \nfor the rest of your life--and President Clinton campaigned on 5-year \nlimits, on limitations of cash benefits, and also on work \nrequirements--what I didn't know is that the District of Columbia was \ngranted a waiver, which the President signed a couple of days before, \nthat allowed the District of Columbia to have a 10-year waiver from \ntime limits. So there is a 5-year limit in Michigan, a 5-year limit \neverywhere else in the country, but not for the District of Columbia, \nand there are no work requirements for the District of Columbia.\n  Frankly, I find that to be very deceitful and misleading by the \nadministration--to go out and tell everybody,\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nhey, we have ended welfare as we know it--and every time I have heard \nthat line, I applaud, because I know the present welfare system hasn't \nworked. It has hurt a lot of people who it tried to help. You don't \nneed anymore evidence than to look at the District of Columbia. If \nanywhere is in need of welfare reform, it is the District of Columbia.\n  Why in the world would the President, at the same time he is signing \nwelfare reform for the rest of the country, and bragging about it, \ngetting great accolades--and it helps his rise in the polls and his \nmove back toward the political center--suddenly decide to support a \nbill that had already passed Congress twice? He vetoed it the first \ntime. The third time was a charm. He decided to sign it the third time. \nBut at the same time he signs it, he exempts the District of Columbia \nfrom welfare reform, from time limits, and he exempts the District of \nColumbia from work requirements.\n  Unbelievable. Misleading. Deceitful. All of the above apply to \nPresident Clinton's position on welfare reform. Guess what? He got \ncaught. I didn't know about the DC waiver when he signed the welfare \nbill. Somebody started to tell me about it, and I looked at it and I \nsaid, ``I can't believe it. I can't believe that the same \nadministration that has said, yes, we are going to have real time \nlimits, real limitations, real work requirements, would totally exempt \nthe District of Columbia where 1 out of 6 people is now on welfare. \nThat is so misleading, it is unbelievable.\n  Now, I am very pleased that the Department of Health and Human \nServices has withdrawn the waiver today. I have a letter that I will \nhave inserted into the Congressional Record, signed by Mary Jo Bane, \nAssistant Secretary for Children and Families, stating that DC's waiver \napproval as it pertained to work requirements and time limits has been \nwithdrawn by HHS.\n  Why did they decide to do this? I think because they got caught. I \nknow the House was interested in legislation I introduced, with time \nlimits that would apply to every State and the District of Columbia. We \nwere going to pass that. I think the administration realized they were \ngoing to be embarrassed politically for trying to be on both sides of \nwelfare reform, saying they are for welfare reform and, at the same \ntime, exempting the District of Columbia. They realized that that \nwasn't politically defensible. They figured they better cut their \nlosses and repeal the waiver. That is my guess.\n  It is interesting to note--and I will put this in the Record. I \nreceived this. This waiver that protects the District of Columbia from \npotential welfare reforms is getting a cool reception from some members \nof the city council. Linda Cropp, a DC council member who chairs the \nsubcommittee on human services, announced Tuesday, at a September 30 \nhearing on the Federal waiver, that she was concerned that welfare \nwaiver would make the city a ``welfare magnet'' since there are tougher \nstandards in nearby jurisdictions.\n  She is exactly right. If you have tougher restrictions in Virginia \nand Maryland, and in every other State, but you have no restrictions \nand no limitations on welfare in the District of Columbia, it would be \nmore than a welfare magnet, it would be receiving welfare recipients \nfrom all around. DC council member Harold Brazil said the waiver \n``encourages dependency and ruins initiative.'' He is exactly right. I \nwill enter that in the Record as well.\n  I have a couple of articles that dealt with this issue. One was an op \ned piece that was in the Washington Post on September 15, 1996. It is \nentitled, ``Welfare as Usual in D.C.; The bureaucrats Conspire to Block \nReforms,'' by Matthew Rees, as well as an op ed article by Naomi Lopes \nand Michael Tanner, entitled, ``Welfare Reform Bypass for DC,'' and one \nfinal op ed piece from Investor's Business Daily, ``Will Clinton Undo \nWelfare Reform?\"\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of the material I have referenced be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 15, 1996]\n\n Welfare as Usual in D.C.; The Bureaucrats Conspired To Block Reforms \n                                  Here\n\n                           (By Matthew Rees)\n\n       It doesn't really matter how you measure the District's \n     social conditions, because by nearly every standard they are \n     appalling. The infant mortality rate is the highest in the \n     nation, the percentage of the population receiving benefits \n     through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) is \n     double the national average, more than one-third of the \n     children are living in poverty and more than two-thirds are \n     born to single mothers. With the District leading the nation \n     in so many of the wrong categories, it could be an ideal \n     place to gauge the effectiveness of the welfare bill \n     President Clinton signed last month. Unfortunately, some \n     last-minute collaboration between the District and the \n     federal government means the nation's capital will be \n     experiencing little in the way of genuine welfare reform.\n       To better understand why the prospects for reform are dim, \n     you have to go back to Aug. 19. That was the day the Clinton \n     administration's Department of Health and Human Services \n     (HHS) issued a landmark announcement, telling the District it \n     was free to make cash payments to welfare recipients for up \n     to 10 years so long as the recipients ``made a good-faith \n     effort to find employment.'' The announcement also declared \n     that the District would be granted a relatively liberal \n     definition of what constitutes ``work.'' According to top \n     District officials, obtaining a driver's license, or \n     attending self-esteem classes, would meet the work standard.\n       The net effect of this decision was obvious: It undermined \n     the welfare legislation the president was about to sign. The \n     District would have no real obligation to comply with the \n     bill's five-year time limit on cash welfare benefits, and the \n     requirement that 50 percent of each state's welfare caseload \n     be engaged in strictly defined work activities by 2002 would \n     be considerably watered down. ``If you wanted to send a \n     message to the District that `we're not serious about welfare \n     reform,' a 10-year waiver was a pretty good way to do it,'' \n     intones Mickey Kaus, a neoliberal commentator who's written \n     extensively on welfare.\n       Some see nothing wrong with the HHS exemption, known as a \n     ``waiver,'' because it gets the District out from under the \n     new law's mandates and allows for local flexibility. That \n     would be an attractive argument if the District had followed \n     the lead of states with pioneering welfare reform projects, \n     such as Michigan and Wisconsin. Unfortunately, just the \n     opposite has been the case: The District maintains a welfare \n     system that is viewed by many welfare experts as one of the \n     country's least demanding, and least oriented toward reform. \n     The results speak for themselves.\n       That's why allowing the District to opt out of major \n     provisions of the new welfare law is such a grave error. Even \n     when confronted with scenes straight out of Dickens, the \n     District government has chosen to maintain the infrastructure \n     supporting these conditions. The genius of the federal \n     welfare bill is that while it gives states the freedom to \n     craft their own public assistance programs, it also gives \n     them positive and negative incentives to get people off \n     welfare before five years and require them to go to work \n     after two years. For the District to even come close to \n     complying with these demands would require trying new and \n     innovative approaches to old problems. With the waiver, \n     however, it's unlikely such approaches will be considered.\n       The pro-waiver arguments rested on a simple belief: The \n     District would suffocate under the new rules. It was, \n     therefore, preferable to preserve the old ones. HHS \n     spokeswoman Melissa Scolfield justified the waiver with the \n     explanation that ``we are, of course, sympathetic to the \n     special situation of the District.''\n       The shortcoming in this paternalistic approach is self \n     evident. Given the option of doing nothing versus \n     implementing reforms that result in some short-term pain for \n     some greater long-term gain, it's all too easy to choose the \n     former. The Clinton administration was in a position to \n     remove this option by denying the waiver request. But far \n     from discouraging it, top HHS officials saw the District as \n     an opportunity to subvert Clinton's stated intentions of \n     ending ``welfare as we know it.'' The waiver was originally \n     needed because of the welfare reform legislation approved by \n     Mayor Marion Barry in August 1995. Among other things, that \n     legislation instituted a ``family cap,'' which meant mothers \n     on welfare who had additional children would be denied \n     increased AFDC payments. Teen mothers could also be required \n     to attend school and live with a parent, guardian or adult \n     relative. While these are steps in the right direction--\n     though they appear to have substantial loopholes--they are \n     not the sweeping reforms the District desperately needs. \n     Nonetheless the District needed a waiver before it could \n     proceed because parts of the legislation conflicted with \n     federal law. Financial constraints meant the waiver \n     application wasn't submitted to HHS for nearly a year, and it \n     only happened then because President Clinton announced the he \n     would sign the Republican welfare bill.\n       The president's July 31 announcement set off a flurry of \n     activity at the upper echelons of HHS. Many of the agency's \n     welfare analysts opposed Clinton's decision--three of them \n     have resigned in protest--and they immediately set out to \n     soften the bill's impact, on the District in particular. Top \n     welfare officials in the District government were alerted to \n     the consequences of the legislation by Wendell Primus--one of \n     the HHS officials who has since resigned--and Robert \n     Greenstein, an influential private welfare analyst.\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\n     HHS helped fill out the waiver and put it through the ``fast \n     track'' approval process.\n       Most striking was the waiver's approval time. Republican \n     governors such as Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and John Engler \n     of Michigan have been highly critical of waiver delays, \n     charging that HHS bureaucrats have taken forever to approve \n     changes that have already been approved by their state \n     legislatures. Some have been held up for years, yet the \n     District's sailed through in just 13 days. Mary Jo Bane, \n     another of the HHS officials who resigned, was one of the \n     lead staffers who decided that the D.C. waiver--and seven \n     others--would be granted at the last minute.\n       This incurred the wrath of Bob Dole, the Republican \n     presidential nominee and congressional Republicans such as \n     Representative E. Clay Shaw, chairman of the congressional \n     subcommittee responsible for welfare legislation. Senator Don \n     Nickles, an Oklahoma Republican, has gone so far as to \n     introduce legislation seeking to repeal the waiver, charging \n     that the administration had approved it only because the \n     president was ``trying to placate some liberal people who did \n     not like him signing the welfare reform bill.'' The House \n     Ways and Means Committee will also be holding hearings on the \n     matter this week.\n       Certainly there are reasons for concern about how the \n     District would fare under a more restrictive system. HHS \n     officials were sure that the District wouldn't be able to \n     meet the legislation's work participation rates. Stephen \n     Fuller, a professor at George Mason University, points out \n     that the District had a net loss of 15,000 jobs over the past \n     12 months and has lost 60,000 job over the previous five \n     years. While there's been healthy employment growth in \n     Northern Virginia over the past year (25,000 new jobs), \n     nearly all of this growth has occurred outside the Beltway, \n     and it's been in sectors such as engineering and business \n     services.\n       Another factor is the District's unique demographics: \n     Welfare populations tend to be concentrated in the inner \n     cities, but each state's overall percentage of welfare \n     recipients levels out once it's balanced against the lower \n     percentage found in rural and suburban areas. The District \n     has no suburbs within its rapidly declining population of \n     560,000--the only state with fewer people is Wyoming--and \n     most of the recent population loss has come from those not on \n     welfare. In other words, there's good reason to expect the \n     proportion of District residents receiving AFDC--currently \n     about 13 percent--to remain stable or increase.\n       Yet some of these concerns may be exaggerated. The work \n     participation rates, for example, are nowhere near as \n     demanding as many analysts have claimed. Indeed, the \n     District--and all 50 states--have considerable flexibility in \n     determining how they meet the rates. Because the law contains \n     an array of loopholes, a state could have work participation \n     as low as 20 percent--as opposed to the 50 percent rate \n     spelled out in the legislation--and still be in full \n     compliance.\n       When the federal welfare legislation is viewed in this \n     light, the District's situation doesn't look so dire. The \n     current work participation rate among District welfare \n     recipients is 6 percent, and the District program is \n     recognized as one of the most poorly run in the country. Once \n     the new rules went into effect, as much as 10 percent of the \n     caseload could be expected to stop asking for welfare \n     (studies have shown this has happened elsewhere, probably \n     because some portion of welfare recipients are already \n     working in underground jobs). And at least some of the rest \n     would presumably respond to the threat of having their \n     benefits cut off and go to work. But extending the waiver for \n     such a long period of time ensures only that the status quo \n     will be preserved.\n       Or, it could get worse. One long-term effect of the waiver \n     could be that it attracts the poor of nearby states such as \n     Virginia and Maryland, which do have tough reforms in place. \n     In Virginia, for example, welfare recipients must go to work \n     within 90 days of beginning to receive public assistance.\n       ``We want to make sure the District doesn't become a \n     welfare magnet,'' says D.C. Council member Linda W. Cropp (D-\n     At Large).\n       The fear grows out of the District's past experience with \n     providing relatively generous benefits to the homeless, only \n     to see the homeless population rapidly expand. The situation \n     with welfare is similar: The District's 1994 AFDC benefits \n     were $428 per month for a parent and two children (the 18th \n     highest when compared to the 50 states). This was $55 a month \n     higher than in Maryland, and $137 a month higher than in \n     Virginia, according to a recent study by the Washington-based \n     Population Reference Bureau. When these figures are mixed \n     with the generous time limits on the receipt of cash \n     benefits, and liberal regulations on work, the magnet effect \n     begins to look plausible.\n       District and HHS officials emphasize there was nothing \n     extraordinary about the waiver, which they claim was similar \n     to those granted other states, such as Wisconsin. But the \n     Wisconsin waiver is part of a strongly reform-oriented plan, \n     where the District's is not. The District will allow welfare \n     recipients to continue receiving cash benefits for a decade \n     or more, with minimal threat of being cut off. That \n     guarantees the District will have little or no real incentive \n     to begin the welfare-to-work experiments found in so many \n     other states.\n       At a time when the District's social conditions so clearly \n     scream out for major changes, it seems tragically misguided \n     to declare that the nation's capital will be not the first \n     place where there's welfare reform, but the last.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        [Briefs from Washington]\n\n       Washington.--A waiver that protects the District of \n     Columbia from stringent welfare reforms is getting a cool \n     reception from some members of the city council.\n       Council member Linda Cropp, who chairs the committee on \n     human services, announced on Tuesday a September 30 hearing \n     on the Federal waiver.\n       Cropp said she was concerned the waiver will make the city \n     a ``welfare magnet'' since there are tougher standards in \n     nearby jurisdictions.\n       Under reform legislation passed by Congress, most welfare \n     recipients who do not find work cannot continue to receive \n     benefits for more than five years.\n       The waiver backed by President Clinton and Mayor Marion \n     Barry gives the city a 10-year exemption.\n       Councilman Harold Brazil said the waiver encourages \n     dependency and ``ruins initiative.''\n       The council members aren't alone. Some Republicans in \n     Congress have already voiced their opposition to the waiver.\n       At a hearing Tuesday before the Human Resources \n     subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, \n     Congressman E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., said if the city plans \n     to use the waiver to exempt more than 20 percent of its \n     current caseload, he will move to repeal the exemption.\n       Democrats countered by saying Idaho, Michigan, \n     Massachusetts and Washington state have all been granted \n     similar exemptions.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                   Will Clinton Undo Welfare Reform?\n\n       Having shifted right by signing the Republican welfare-\n     reform bill, President Clinton is now doing all he can to \n     assure the left that he will ``correct'' the new law. \n     Machiavelli would be proud.\n       We can see why Clinton would like political cover on \n     welfare: the left is dead certain the new law will cause \n     untold suffering. And the media seem to feel obliged to give \n     heavy play to anything--instant studies, predictable \n     resignations--that feeds those fears.\n       Why is the hue and cry so much greater after the fact? Some \n     on the left no doubt were surprised when the president signed \n     the law. Others may think the suffering they expect to see is \n     necessary, but still feel guilty about it. Now that it's too \n     late to change matters, they can safely stand on principle--\n     and demonstrate their purity, too.\n       Such mixed motives are natural to any large group. Much \n     stranger are the conflicting signals that come from a single \n     man: our president.\n       Clinton has already promised that, if he can't get the \n     members of Congress to revise the law in the ways he wants, \n     he'll enforce it as if they had.\n       Thus, he signed a bill into law, but he's actually going to \n     implement something else. It's an incredible bait-and-switch, \n     even for Bill Clinton.\n       But this is just the culmination of his welfare politics. \n     In 1992, ``New Democrat'' Clinton vowed to ``end welfare as \n     we know it.'' But in 1993 and 1994, when his own Democrats \n     ran Congress, he dropped the ball.\n       After voters handed Congress to Republicans, the GOP called \n     Clinton's bluff by sending him a welfare-reform bill not \n     wholly unlike the one he just signed. Clinton vetoed it. \n     Congress sent up another: He vetoed that, too.\n       Enter '96, a campaign year. Republicans drafted a third \n     welfare-reform bill. Bob Dole prepared to bash Clinton for \n     delivering three vetoes where he had promised reform. So the \n     president finally, reluctantly, signed.\n       As he's done so often before, Clinton thus signaled to the \n     voters that he'd learned his ways, that he'd moved \n     permanently to the right. Yet he knows full well that he'll \n     turn left after the election. With welfare reform, though, \n     he's signaling left at the same time. Clinton has his hazard \n     lights on.\n       The welfare backflip exposes what's fundamentally wrong \n     with this White House: It governs by fraud. What's more, it \n     has no shame.\n       Take Vice President Al Gore's comments on a recent Sunday \n     talk show:\n       The vice president admitted the welfare system is ``cruel'' \n     and needs to be changed. Yet, seconds later, he pointed out \n     that the welfare act's changes do not go into effect until \n     July 1, 1997--leaving plenty of time for Clinton and a \n     Democrat Congress to scrap the law.\n       And if Republicans maintain control, Gore added, Clinton \n     would use the line-item veto to fix things Clinton and \n     liberals don't like about the bill.\n       What things are those? Ask the first lady. Interviewed in \n     Chicago, she said she didn't like the limits on food stamps \n     or on payouts to legal immigrants. She said she'll speak out \n     next year to ``correct'' the welfare-reform bill that her \n     husband signed.\n       If the bill was so flawed, why sign it in the first place? \n     No one held a gun to the president's head. Why not work to \n     fix it, and sign it later?\n       The questions are obvious. But such logic doesn't work with \n     Clinton. Stand on principle? Avoid shame? This politician \n     never shoots straight: Everything is a bank-shot, or worse.\n       It's no wonder polls show a majority of us do not trust our \n     president. How can we? Not only can we not trust him to do \n     what he says. We can't even trust him to do what he\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\n     does, because he undoes what he does. Next thing, he'll be \n     telling us that's not what he did.\n       Accepting the GOP nomination, Bob Dole spoke scornfully of \n     leaders ``unwilling to risk the truth, to speak without \n     calculation.'' he went on: ``All things flow from doing what \n     is right.''\n       Reforming welfare is right. Now we just need a leader who \n     will do what is right.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      [From the Washington Times]\n\n                     Welfare Reform Bypass for D.C.\n\n                    (By Naomi Lopez/Michael Tanner)\n\n       ``Welfare as we know it'' has been ended, right? Well, not \n     in the District of Columbia. Even as President Clinton was \n     signing the new welfare reform bill with one hand, with the \n     other he was simultaneously granting the District, a 10-year \n     waiver exempting it from most of the requirements in the new \n     welfare bill, including time-limited assistance and certain \n     work requirements.\n       The waiver for D.C.'s ``Project on Work, Employment, and \n     Responsibility'' (POWER), submitted in early August, was \n     rushed through the Department of Health and Human Services' \n     ``fast track'' waiver approval process just three days before \n     Mr. Clinton signed welfare reform into law. As a result, \n     welfare reform will have only a minimal impact on welfare \n     dependency in the District and an even smaller impact on D.C. \n     welfare spending.\n       For example, the welfare reform bill calls for a five-year \n     lifetime limit on welfare benefits. Not under the District's \n     waiver; there would be no cutoff of benefits for any D.C. \n     resident who could not find a job that pays more than welfare \n     benefits. The most unfortunate aspect of this exemption is \n     that the District, aided and abetted by the Clinton \n     administration, is sending a message that the rules will not \n     apply to its residents and that cash assistance is still an \n     entitlement.\n       While one of the big selling points of the new welfare \n     reform law was its requirement that welfare recipients work \n     in exchange for benefits, the District's waiver defines work \n     activities so liberally as to be meaningless. Attending a \n     job-training program or engaging in job search (i.e., looking \n     for work) will be enough to satisfy the District's work \n     requirement. Thus, welfare in the District will remain pretty \n     much as we know it. Yet few welfare systems are as badly in \n     need of reform.\n       Despite the fact that 1 in 6 District residents are on \n     welfare, more than a third of District children still live in \n     poverty. Out-of-wedlock births have reached alarming \n     proportions. Of the District's more than 50,000 children in \n     welfare families, 83 percent were born out of wedlock and 10 \n     percent come from broken homes. Only a mere 1 percent of Aid \n     to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) households contain \n     two parents. * * *\n       While one of the big selling points of the new welfare \n     reform law was its requirement that welfare recipients work \n     in exchange for benefits, the District's waiver defines work \n     activities so liberally as to be meaningless.

Long-term dependency is increasingly the norm as \n     is second- and third-generation welfare dependence.\n       D.C. has followed the liberal route of trying to solve its \n     welfare problems with money. On a per capita basis, the \n     District has the highest federal social welfare program \n     spending in the nation. Of the 50 states and District, the \n     District ranks:\n       First in per capita federal spending on AFDC, food stamps, \n     Medicaid, housing assistance, job training under the Job \n     Training Partnership Act, and community development.\n       Second on Medicare and state employment services.\n       Fourth on compensatory education for disadvantaged \n     children.\n       Fifth on Supplemental Security Income and the social \n     service block grant.\n       Twelfth on child nutrition programs.\n       The value of the full package of welfare benefits in the \n     District (including cash assistance, food stamps and \n     nutrition assistance, housing assistance, Medicaid and so on) \n     totals more than $22,745 per year for a single mother with \n     two children. Because welfare benefits are tax-free, a \n     working person would have to earn nearly $14 per hour to take \n     home an equivalent paycheck. Indeed, the District's welfare \n     package is the fifth-most-generous in the nation. Is it any \n     wonder that so many recipients make the rational choice of \n     welfare over work?\n       The welfare reform bill fell far short of what is necessary \n     to truly end welfare as we know it. But the District, with \n     the complicity of the Clinton administration, seems unwilling \n     to make any change in the status quo.\n       The District government is setting up a social time bomb \n     that the rest of the nation will, most likely, be responsible \n     for defusing. In 10 years, the District's waiver will expire \n     only after it will have promoted and perpetuated a failed and \n     reckless system. And at that time, the federal government \n     will be called upon to bail out the District again. By that \n     time, the damage may be irreversible.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Washington Post today had an \neditorial that was critical of me. Basically, it said, wait a minute, \nwe granted waivers to other areas. Why would you try and take away \nparts of the waiver--they actually said we were repealing the entire \nwaiver. They were wrong. Why would you do this just for the District of \nColumbia if not for other areas?\n  The legislation I introduced, frankly, did not apply just to the \nDistrict of Columbia. It says a 5-year time limit applies to everybody \nin the country. There won't be a single waiver to exempt someone from \nthe 5-year limit. That was the guts of the bill. There would not be a \nwaiver that would undo work requirements. Those were the two major \nelements of the bill. It just so happens that the District of Columbia \nwas the only waiver request that went directly away from welfare \nreform.\n  There are 30 States, plus the District of Columbia, who have received \nwelfare waivers. Guess what? All 30, except for the District of \nColumbia, moved toward work requirements, toward time limits--most of \nwhich had shorter time limits than 5 years. But not the District of \nColumbia; it was a waiver away from welfare reform, a waiver for the \nstatus quo, and it was a waiver, basically, where President Clinton and \nthe Clinton administration was saying: District of Columbia, you are \nexempt from welfare reform. We don't think you need to do it.\n  I am pleased I finally hear that HHS has rescinded the order. I \nbelieve they did it because it is the political season, and they knew \nthey were going to take some heat. They made a serious mistake. But we \nhave to make sure they are not just postponing it for 2 months. We want \nto make absolutely sure that there is no way that sometime after the \nelection, in November or December, they would go ahead and grant a 10-\nyear waiver. We want to make sure that is not up their sleeve. If we \nhave to pass legislation to make sure of that, we will do it. There is \nno reason in the world why we would work as hard as we did for real \nwelfare reform for everybody in the country--to end cash assistance as \nan open-ended entitlement, a perpetual way of living--and not do it in \nthe District of Columbia.\n  I might mention, Mr. President, I think there are some games that \nwere played. This waiver request by the Clinton administration was \ngranted in 14 days. I might tell my colleagues that some areas have had \nwaiver requests pending before the administration for months, some for \nyears, some for 2 years, all of which were trying to have a waiver from \nthe old law, which would not allow time limits. Most of the waivers \nthat States wanted to enact, like Wisconsin, Illinois, Oklahoma, and \nothers, wanted to have time limits and work requirements. They wanted \npeople to get off welfare and go to work. They wanted to have learnfare \nrequirements where children of welfare recipients would be required to \ngo to school, like every other child. If they didn't have their kids in \nschool, they would lose welfare payments; or they have to make sure \ntheir kids receive vaccinations, or they might receive penalties.\n  States have had great initiatives. So this administration has been \nvery slow on many of those States. As a matter of fact, the President, \nin May, made a nationwide radio address complimenting Wisconsin on \ntheir welfare reform and talked about granting their waiver, and this \nis great. Guess what? He hasn't granted the Wisconsin waiver yet. That \nwas months ago. But he granted the DC waiver in 14 days. That was \ngranted right before signing the welfare reform bill. And the DC waiver \nhad no time limits. It has a 10-year exemption. How is that fair to the \npeople in New Hampshire? They are going to have a limitation on how \nlong they can receive cash payments. The State of Hawaii had a waiver \nrequest granted by the administration in just the last couple of \nmonths, since signing the bill. But the State of Hawaii had a 5-year \nlimit. Indiana got a waiver request signed, but it was a 2-year limit, \nnot a 5-year limit. But the District of Columbia comes up and, in 14 \ndays--unbelievable speed for the Department of\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\nHealth Human Services--they get a waiver signed by the President that \nsays you are going to have a 10-year exemption--10 years, no limit, and \nno work requirement. What a sham. What a shame. What a shame that this \nPresident and this administration would be so deceitful as to try to \npull that over on the American people.\n\n  I am pleased that the Department of Health and Human Services \nrealized their mistake. My guess is that the political people said, \n``Hey. This could come back to hurt us, or haunt us. Therefore, let us \nwithdraw it.''\n  I am pleased that the District of Columbia City Council, which never \nrequested a 10-year waiver on work requirements, never requested a 10-\nyear waiver on lifetime benefits--I am pleased that some of the council \nmembers realized that this is terrible. This would be a disaster for \nthe District of Columbia. So I am pleased that evidently not only are \nthey going to have some hearings but some Members think it would be a \nserious mistake, and they don't want the District of Columbia to become \nthe welfare capital of the United States.\n  So I am pleased with the announcement of HHS today. I think the \nadministration got caught in trying to have it both ways on welfare \nreform. To say ``Yes, we need welfare reform with time limits and work \nrequirements'' while at the same time trying to undo welfare reform--to \nexempt work requirements, to exempt time limits--they should be ashamed \nof themselves. I am pleased they reversed themselves for about the \nfourth time on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, in the United States, there are 571 \nFederal wildlife refuges. There is only one State that doesn't have \nany, and that, unfortunately, is the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  To look at a couple of States that are comparable in the size of \npopulation to my State, Oklahoma has 9, Louisiana has 16, Alabama has \n7.\n  Mr. President, it is pretty clear that Kentucky, when it comes to \nFederal wildlife refuges, has not been treated properly down through \nthe years. I have been working on this issue since 1989. I introduced \nthe first bill to create the first Federal wildlife refuge in Kentucky. \nIt is not easy to find appropriate spots in the east. Many of our \nfriends out west have more public land than they want. But in the east, \nit is not so.\n  We isolated--``we,'' working with the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife \nService and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service--identified an area in \nKentucky that makes sense. I introduced a bill which was reported out \nof the Environment and Public Works committee to authorize this refuge. \nIt is my hope that the Interior appropriations bill will include both \nthe authorization and appropriation to begin the acquisition.\n  Let me just say that no land will be condemned under this proposal. \nOnly land will be purchased from willing sellers. That is a little bit \ndifferent from the way some Federal wildlife refuges have been created. \nAs a result of that, there is very minor opposition in our State to the \ncreation of our first Federal wildlife refuge.\n  My dear colleague from Kentucky earlier today took to the floor to \npoint out that this was not needed, and that we had another facility \ncalled the Land Between the Lakes--which is operated by the Tennessee \nValley Authority; it is a wonderful facility; a wonderful place--but \nthat it really needed the money; and, if he were given the opportunity \nto do so, would offer an amendment to take the money away from the \nFederal wildlife refuge and give it to the Land Between the Lakes.\n  Mr. President, the Land Between the Lakes has already been given all \nthe money they asked for. I am on the appropriations Subcommittee of \nEnergy and Water which receives the request. We gave them all they \nasked for. They may ask for more someplace down the road, and it may be \nappropriate to give them more someplace down the road. But I do not \nthink, particularly in these tight times, that it makes sense to throw \nmoney at a group, or a project, or an activity that is not asking for \nit.\n  So, if this amendment is offered at some subsequent time, obviously I \nam going to oppose it. I find it somewhat astonishing that my colleague \nwould find it inappropriate for Kentucky to finally--it came into the \nUnion in 1792--to finally have a Federal wildlife refuge.\n  It was suggested by my colleague that this was an incredibly \ncontroversial proposal. In fact, it is just the opposite. There are few \nwho may oppose it, although if they own land in the area and don't want \nto sell they don't have to. And a wildlife refuge is a good neighbor. \nIf you do not want to sell, it is a great neighbor to have right next \nto you. There is nothing that would keep any landowner in this area \nfrom keeping this property forever in this proposal.\n  There are 57 conservation groups and sportsmen from Kentucky who \nsupport this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOrganizations That Have Endorsed the Creation of the Kentucky National \n                            Wildlife Refuge\n\n       Appalachia Science in the Public Interest.\n       Association of Chenoweth Run Environmentalists.\n       Audubon Society of Kentucky.\n       Bell County Beautification Association.\n       Berea College Biology Club.\n       Brushy Fork Water Watch.\n       Community Farm Alliance.\n       Daviess County Audubon Society & Kentucky Ornithological \n     Society.\n       Department of Parks.\n       Eastern Kentucky University Wildlife Society.\n       Elkhorn Land & Historic Trust Inc.\n       Floyds Fork Environmental Association.\n       Friends of Mill Creek.\n       Gun Powder Creek Water Watch.\n       Harlan County Clean Community Association.\n       Hart County Environmental Group.\n       Highlands Group Cumberland Chapter Sierra Club.\n       Kentucky Academy of Science.\n       Kentucky Association for Environmental Education.\n       Kentucky Audubon Council.\n       Kentucky Citizens Accountability Project.\n       Kentucky Conservation Committee.\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\n       Kentucky Fish & Wildlife Education & Resource Foundation.\n       Kentucky Houndsmen Association.\n       Kentucky Native Plant Society.\n       Kentucky Society of Natural History.\n       Kentucky State Nature Preserve Commission.\n       Lake Cumberland Water Watch.\n       Land & Nature Trust of the Bluegrass.\n       League of Kentucky Sportsman.\n       League of Women Voters of Kentucky.\n       Leslie County KAB System.\n       Little River Audubon Society.\n       Louisville Audobon Society.\n       Louisville Chapter 476 of Trout Unlimited.\n       Louisville Nature Center.\n       Madison County Clean Community Committee.\n       Madison Environment.\n       Mall Interiors.\n       Midway Area Environmental Committee.\n       National Wild Turkey Federation.\n       Oldham Community Center & Nature Preserve, Inc.\n       Peterson's Fault Farm.\n       Pleasant Hill Recreation Association.\n       Pride Inc.\n       Quail Unlimited.\n       Rockcastle River Rebirth.\n       Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation.\n       Ruddles Mill Conservation Project.\n       Scenic Kentucky.\n       Shelby Clean Community Program.\n       Shelby County Clean Community Council.\n       Sierra Club Cumberland Chapter.\n       Steve & Janet Kistler.\n       The Nature Conservancy/Kentucky Chapter.\n       The Wildlife Connection.\n       Trout Unlimited/KYOUA Chapter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my colleague made reference to the \nRocky Mountain Elk Foundation, and said that was a bunch of \n``foreigners'' and didn't have a presence in Kentucky. He might want to \nknow that there are several thousand supporters of this group in \nKentucky. Just because it is called the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation \ndoes not mean it does not have a lot of Kentucky members. Mr. \nPresident, I have a letter from the Kentucky State chairman of the \nRocky Mountain Elk Foundation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation,\n\n                                Bowling Green, KY, March 19, 1996.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Please accept this letter as my \n     support of your intention to propose legislation that would \n     establish and fund the Clark's River National Wildlife Refuge \n     in Western Kentucky. I sincerely appreciate your efforts to \n     establish this area as Kentucky's first National Wildlife \n     Refuge.\n       I am the Kentucky State Chairman for the Rocky Mountain Elk \n     Foundation. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation is one of the \n     cooperating partners that have helped to establish the Elk \n     and Bison Prairie at TVA's Land Between the Lakes. \n     Additionally, I am the Co-Chairman for the fund raising \n     committee charged with the effort of raising $244,000 for the \n     first phases of this very important project at Land Between \n     the Lakes. I am very happy to report to you that this project \n     is not even open to the public yet and we have already raised \n     $222,000 toward our goal. However, I certainly see a \n     distinction and a need for you to create Kentucky's first \n     National Wildlife Refuge at the East Fork of the Clark's \n     River. As you are aware, the NWR site evaluation team \n     determined that not only did this site best fit the Untied \n     States Fish and Wildlife Services biological and feasibility \n     criteria, this area was deemed most worthy of perpetual \n     protection from degradation and development that would be \n     afforded by establishment of a refuge.\n       I am certainly one of the strongest supporters of LBL and \n     am aware of the budget problems that this agency faces. I can \n     assure you, as State Chairman for the RMEF that I donate \n     hundreds of hours of my time in support of LBL and the Elk \n     and Bison Prairie project. The bottom line is both of these \n     projects are very worthy projects and both of these projects \n     are worthy of your support, but in my opinion, the creation \n     of Kentucky's first National Wildlife Refuge should be \n     established at the Clark's River.\n       I would be happy to discuss this issue with you personally \n     if you should have any other questions.\n       Working for Wildlife.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas M. Baker,\n                                          Kentucky State Chairman.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in addition to that we worked with the \nKentucky Farm Bureau. They typically don't endorse these kinds of \nprojects. But what is interesting to note is that they chose not to \noppose this one, and the reason they chose not to is because we worked \nwith them on the ``willing seller provision'' so that nobody involved \nin agriculture in this area would be required to sell. It is very \nimportant to me that we protect farmers property rights.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the Land Between the Lakes, which my \ncolleague would give more funding than they asked for by taking it away \nfrom the Federal wildlife refuge, I would like to place in the Record a \nletter from the chairman of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Mr. Craven \nCrowell, who said, ``I want to express my sincere appreciation for your \nsupport for TVA's fiscal year 1997 budget. You played a significant \nrole in achieving our goals.''\n  In other words, with regard to LBL, TVA got everything it wanted.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, I would like to also have printed \nin the Record a letter I received yesterday from William Kennoy, who is \nthe Director of the Tennessee Valley Authority, and a Kentuckian, who \nalso confirms that the Land Between the Lakes operated by TVA was given \nall they asked for in this year's budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it, along with the letters from Mr. \nCrowell and the Kentucky Farm Bureau, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Kentucky Farm\n\n\n                                             Bureau Federation\n\n                                   Louisville, KY, April 20, 1996.\n     Mr. Don Overby,\n     President, Calloway County Farm Bureau, Almo, KY.\n       Dear Donnie: This is to acknowledge and thank you and \n     Calloway County for your attendance and participation in the \n     Measure the Candidate training session held April 8. Also, I \n     wanted to reply to your question on the proposed Clarks River \n     National Wildlife Refuge.\n       As I had mentioned, Laura Knoth has been working diligently \n     with Senator McConnell's staff to ensure Farm Bureau's policy \n     is contained in the language of the proposed legislation. \n     Specifically, language which protects farmer's property \n     rights. The following provisions, your Farm bureau policy, \n     have been successfully integrated into S. 1611, ``The \n     Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge Authorization Act:''\n       Section 2:6 . . . the refuge should not restrict \n     agricultural and silvicultural activities on private lands.\n       Section 6C(I) no activity carried out in the refuge will \n     result in the obstruction of the flow of water so as to \n     affect any private land adjacent to the refuge; and\n       (ii) no buffer zone regulating any land use (other than \n     hunting and fishing) is established.\n       On March 28, the Environment and Public Works Committee \n     passed S. 1611 by unanimous consent. As of this date, it has \n     not been placed on the Senate calendar to receive floor \n     action.\n       Donnie, I have also enclosed for your review a copy of a \n     letter from Tom Bennett, Commissioner, Kentucky Department of \n     Fish and Wildlife Resources, which outlines significant and \n     unique criteria the Clarks River possesses for the proposed \n     wildlife refuge. I am hopeful that his information is \n     helpful. If you have any further questions, please do not \n     hesitate to contact Laura, or myself.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Timothy A. Cansler,\n\n                                        Director, National Affairs\n     and Political Education.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Tennessee Valley Authority,\n                                Knoxville, TN, September 13, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I want to express my sincere appreciation for \n     your support of TVA's fiscal year 1997 budget. You played a \n     significant role in achieving our goals.\n       We will wisely manage these funds for the benefit of the \n     people of the Tennessee Valley. We hope you will be pleased \n     with the results.\n       Thank you for being a good friend to TVA.\n       With warm regards,\n     Craven Crowell.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Tennessee Valley Authority,\n                                Knoxville, TN, September 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Yesterday an article appeared in \n     the Paducah Sun referring to a letter I sent Congressman \n     Whitfield on funding for LBL. The letter was inadvertently \n     faxed without my authorization or signature.\n       The level of funding provided in the Energy and Water \n     Conference report will fully meet TVA and LBL requirements \n     that we have requested of Congress.\n       I am in the process of preparing an inventory of the needs \n     of LBL's infrastructure for the next few years but this is \n     not yet complete and we have, therefore, made no request to \n     Congress for this future funding.\n       I understand TVA Chairman Crowell recently wrote you \n     expressing his appreciation for your support for TVA's Budget \n     and noted the ``significant role you played in achieving our \n     goals.'' You have been a strong supporter of TVA and we have \n     no desire to jeopardize that relationship because of \n     inaccurate comments through miscommunications. We appreciate \n     your dedication to LBL over the years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           William H. Kennoy, P.E.\n\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in conclusion, let me say that it is \nunusual, to say the least, for two Senators from the same State to \ndiffer on projects of this matter. I am sorry that seems to be the case \nhere. But let me say in conclusion and in summary that there are 571 \nFederal wildlife refuges in the Nation but not one in Kentucky. We are \nlong overdue for our first Federal wildlife refuge. This proposal was \ndeveloped over a number of years in cooperation with the Kentucky Fish \nand Wildlife Service, and over 57 sportsmen and conservation groups \nfrom across Kentucky feel that this great need should be met.\n  No land under this proposal will be taken from anyone--only from \nwilling sellers. It is my hope, Mr. President, that this proposal \nauthorizing and appropriating some money to begin Kentucky's first \nFederal wildlife refuge will be a part of the Interior appropriations \nbill.\n  I hope my colleague will not offer an amendment to strip out the \nmoney provided--whatever money is ultimately provided--for this first \nFederal wildlife refuge in order to give it to the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority which says it does not need it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think it is, \nfrankly, urgent that we go ahead and get this agreement entered into \nmomentarily. We are very close to that. But as usual, we are trying to \ncheck with all the Senators who are interested in the subject matter to \nsee if we can get that worked out.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, before I do a statement, let me again \nobserve the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I do not know about the other bill that was \nattempted to be added to my request for consideration of a bill, but I \nwould just like my colleagues to know that this bill, S. 1174, passed \nunanimously out of committee with bipartisan support. It was placed on \nthe calendar by the majority leader. It has the unanimous support of \neveryone on the Republican side. It has the support of my State of New \nHampshire. It has the support of the individuals who helped to put this \nriver into the wild and scenic bill. It is 12 miles of a beautiful \nriver that we now preserve under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nAct, if this legislation passes.\n  I find it outrageous that, for whatever reasons, political or \notherwise, a piece of legislation that has that much support would be \nobjected to; tying it, linking it to some other legislation. I think \nthe other legislation can rise or fall on its own merit. This is a good \nbill.\n  Mr. President, on August 10, 1995, Senator Gregg and I introduced S. \n1174, the Lamprey Wild and Scenic River Act, to designate a segment of \nthe Lamprey River in New Hampshire as part of the National Wild and \nScenic Rivers System. Since introduction, a hearing was held on the \nlegislation in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and soon \nthereafter, as I said, the bill was reported unanimously out of the \ncommittee.\n  I introduced this legislation after receiving the vote of support \nfrom each of the affected communities along this segment of the River. \nOrdinarily I do not encourage Federal ownership and control of State or \nprivate property, however, this legislation is different.\n  The process for developing this legislation was different for two \nreasons. First, the legislation was developed from the bottom up, from \nenvironmentally conscious communities and local people. It is not a \nWashington initiative. Second, the bill is drafted to allow for maximum \ncontrol at the local level in making land use and conservation \ndecisions.\n  The history of this legislation goes back almost 5 years when Senator \nRudman and I introduced the Lamprey River study bill in February 1991, \nwhich was subsequently signed into law by President Bush later that \nyear. Once the National Park Service determined the Lamprey River's \neligibility for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, a local \nadvisory committee was formed to work with local communities, \nlandowners, the National Park Service and New Hampshire's environment \ndepartment in preparing a comprehensive management plan. This \nmanagement plan was completed in January 1995.\n  The Lamprey River Management Plan was subsequently endorsed by the \nadvisory committee as well as the local governments affected by this \ndesignation. The primary criteria for my sponsorship of this \nlegislation was the support of the local communities. If the affected \ntowns did not vote in favor of designation, I would not be here today \nseeking support for this legislation.\n  In fact, the town of Epping had expressed some reservation about \ndesignating the segment of the Lamprey which runs through the town and, \nout of respect for their concerns, the bill excludes that segment of \nthe river. However, that segment was studied and found to be eligible, \nso we have included a section in our bill that would allow the town of \nEpping to be involved in the implementation of the management plan and, \nupon the town's request, be considered for future designation.\n  The Lamprey River is well deserving of this designation for a number \nof reasons. Not only is the river listed on the 1982 National Park \nService's inventory of outstanding rivers, but it has also been \nrecognized by the State of New Hampshire as the ``most important \ncoastal river for anadromous fish in the State.'' Herring, Shad and \nSalmon are among the anadromous species found in the river. In fact, \nNew Hampshire fishing maps describe the Lamprey as ``a truly \nexceptional river offering a vast variety of fishing. It contains every \ntype of stream and river fish you could expect to find in New \nEngland.''\n  The Lamprey is approximately 60 miles in length and serves as the \nmajor\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\ntributary for the Great Bay, which is part of the National Estuarine \nResearch Reserve System. The Great Bay Refuge is also nearby, which was \nestablished several years ago following the closure of Pease Air Force \nBase. The preservation of the Lamprey is a significant component to \nprotecting this entire ecosystem.\n  The 11.5-mile segment, as proposed by our legislation, has been the \nfocus of local protection efforts for many years. The towns of Lee, \nDurham, and Newmarket, local conservationists, the State government, as \nwell as the congressional delegation have all come together in support \nof this legislation. I believe the management philosophy adopted by the \nAdvisory Committee best articulates our goals for this legislation:\n\n       . . . management of the river must strike a balance among \n     desires to protect the river as an ecosystem, maintain the \n     river for legitimate community use, and protect the interests \n     and property rights of those who own its shorelands.\n  I just cannot understand why, at this hour, with all the work and all \nof the background, that the other side would play politics on this \nissue. It is an outrage. I think everybody should know it. I hope the \npeople in New Hampshire hear me and know it, that this very significant \npiece of environmental legislation is being deliberately held up for \nwhatever purposes. I will leave people to decide.\n  But I do want to recognize two members of the Lamprey River Advisory \nCommittee, Judith Spang of Durham, NH, and Richard Wellington of Lee, \nNH, who worked so hard and so long to pass this legislation.\n  I might say to them, I apologize to you for the outrage that is being \ncommitted here on the floor of the Senate tonight. This is not the way \nwe should do business in the U.S. Senate. This is an environmentally \nsound piece of legislation. It has the support of the communities, \nsupport of the State, support of every single Republican on my side, \nthe support of most Democrats on the other side, and it has been passed \nout of the committee unanimously. And here it is held up deliberately.\n  I find it an outrage. I do not know what I can do about it. \nObviously, Senators have rights and I respect those rights. They have a \nright to object. But, having the right to object and objecting for good \nreason are two different things. There should be a good reason to \nobject. There is no good reason to object to a piece of legislation \nthat has unanimous support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10971-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10972-S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MARITIME SECURITY ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been working very hard to get a \nunanimous consent agreement on a major piece of legislation, maritime \nsecurity. It, I think, is urgent we get this legislation passed. It has \nbipartisan support. It is a major move in making sure that we have an \nAmerican merchant marine. It also actually would save money. We have \nworked very hard to accommodate all of the interests and clear up some \nconcerns about this major legislation.\n  I had hoped we could get an agreement tonight that would allow us to \ncomplete action with a series of votes tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock. \nIt appears now that that may not be possible. I would like to announce \nnow that there will be no further votes tonight. We will continue to \nwork to see if we can get an agreement. We will have debate. Hopefully, \nwe will get an agreement still tonight to have these stacked votes in \nthe morning at 10 o'clock. We have not been able to reach that \nagreement.\n  Senator Grassley has been here. He has made his statements. He has \nidentified seven amendments that he is very interested in. We had an \nagreement that would have said that all debate on all amendments--we \nwere trying to get an agreement that said seven amendments would be \noffered by Senator Grassley, and if votes were necessary, they would \nall occur starting at 10 o'clock in the morning.\n  I think Senator Grassley has had the opportunity to make his points \non the bill in general. I know he would like to be heard on these \namendments. I think that he has been reasonable in working out the \nframework of an agreement here, but we do not yet have it clear. But I \nthink it is important we go ahead and notify Members there will not be \nadditional votes tonight.\n  I will not make this unanimous consent request at this time. The \ndistinguished manager of the bill on the Democratic side of the aisle, \nthe great Senator from Hawaii, will be talking to Senators that are \nconcerned.\n  I just want to emphasize, we are on the verge of passing major \nlegislation. We have an agreement in hand that would limit the \namendments, get it done, and get it to final passage. If we do not get \nthis agreement tonight, I fear this bill will never get passed this \nyear, because Senators will be leaving tomorrow around noon. If we \ncannot get the votes done tomorrow, if we are going to have seven \nvotes--and we have no guarantee that we could even get those on Tuesday \nmorning--plus on Tuesday of next week we are going to be very much into \nthe continuing resolution debate. We need to get that done. That is the \noverall final agreement that will allow the Senate to leave for the \nyear.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let us see if we can come to final closure \non the amendments and a series of votes at 10 o'clock in the morning. \nBut I want to emphasize, no further votes tonight. We do not have an \nagreement at this point that we will definitely have votes at 10 \no'clock in the morning but we will keep working on that. We will notify \nall Members through the rotary announcement and in every other way we \ncan, but you should expect the possibility of votes in the morning at \n10 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I now turn to a statement so that Senators can be \nchecking with their colleagues and see if we can get an agreement on \nthe unanimous consent request.\n  The Senate has been considering this afternoon the Maritime Security \nAct, H.R. 1350. I urge my colleagues, when we do get an agreement, if \nwe get an agreement, to support this critically important national \nsecurity legislation.\n  H.R. 1350 will ensure that our Nation and our Armed Forces will have \navailable a modern fleet of vessels, and reliable, loyal American crews \nto provide a readily available sealift.\n  It also puts at the disposal of the Department of Defense vast \nintermodal and management transportation assets that are essential to \nmodern military logistics.\n  For the Department of Defense to duplicate the capabilities this \nlegislation will provide would cost $800 million a year--eight times \nthe yearly cost of the entire maritime security program.\n  So this legislation is quite simply a cost-effective bargain for our \nNation's security. It is also essential.\n  If any of my colleagues were undecided on this legislation before the \nrecent crisis in the Persian Gulf, they should not be now. What has \nhappened in the last 2 weeks has demonstrated that we must be prepared \nand able to act on our own when our national interest so requires.\n  During the Persian Gulf war in 1990 and 1991, we had the support of a \nworldwide coalition with almost unlimited access to staging areas, to \nmodern ports and infrastructure, and to vessels and crews of many \nnations. Even then, however, some foreign-flag vessels and crews \nrefused to enter the Gulf, or it took weeks to decide whether they \nwould sail or not--delays that could have been catastrophic in certain \ncircumstances or in future conflicts. Still, with U.S.-flag ships and \ncrews carrying nearly 80 percent of all the seaborne cargo, the job did \nget done and, frankly, done quite well.\n\n  During this recent crisis, however, we are seeing that our relatively \ngood fortune in that war was probably the exception rather than what \nmight be the rule in the future.\n  For example, according to press reports, every Arab State, even those \non our side in 1990 and 1991, condemned the strikes on Saddam Hussein.\n  Our B-52 bombers had to fly the long way around--all the way from \nLouisiana to Guam to the Middle East--in\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\norder to avoid overflying countries that disagreed with the U.S. \nactions.\n  Our cruise missiles came from U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf and \ncould not be supplemented by aircraft based in Jordan, Turkey, and even \nSaudi Arabia because these nations could not permit their strikes to \noriginate from their soil.\n  A proposed western-Iraqi no-fly zone was rejected because of our \nability to use Jordanian, Turkish, and Saudi bases.\n  And France--France--refused to participate in the new expanded air \npatrol zone over Iraq.\n  I ask my colleagues tonight, what will happen in some future conflict \nif the issue is not just overflight rights but access to ports, \ntransportation infrastructure, and vessels?\n  What will happen if the crews of foreign-flag vessels refuse to carry \nour supplies for political or even religious reasons?\n  What will happen if foreign vessels and foreign companies are \npressured to take a walk?\n  During the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Arab nations pressured flag-of-\nconvenience vessels not to sail to Israel--and they did not sail. It \nhas happened before--and it will happen again.\n  In the future, we may have allies and vessels--and we may not. H.R. \n1350, the Maritime Security Act, is an insurance policy that we will \nalways have at least the essential minimum of vessels and crews ready \nand able to serve our Nation whenever they are called to do so.\n  We are, after all, the world's only remaining superpower--with global \ninterests and responsibilities.\n  No nation in history has survived very long without a strong \nmaritime, without a strong merchants fleet. The Navy cannot do the job \nunless there are ships to carry the cargo and to carry the men and \nwomen that need to get to a troubled site. I think that is a very \nstrong reason to vote for this bill.\n  This bill is also clearly beneficial in many other respects. First of \nall, it is identical to the one that passed the House, so we can \ncomplete action and send this bill straight to the President for his \nsignature.\n  By authorizing investment in the operation of U.S.-flag vessels, the \nbill would strengthen and improve our economy, also. It achieves the \ndual goals of improving defense and our economy because it is highly \neffective in the way it is set up. The private sealift capability that \nthis program helps make available to DOD would come at a small fraction \nof the cost it would take to the Department of Defense to acquire the \nships and the crews that would be needed.\n  By helping ensure that there is a U.S.-flag merchant fleet, the bill \nalso would help ensure that there is a pool of U.S. citizen mariners to \nman DOD's own Reserve ships in times of emergency. We found out during \nthe Persian Gulf War that if we had not had a lot of old merchant \nmariners to come out of retirement, we could not have had the ships \nmanned. They did come out of retirement, and a lot of them worked long \nhours. Obviously, they did the job.\n  It would help ensure that we will not have to depend on foreign \nvessels or crews to supply these ships overseas.\n  Economically, the bill would help ensure that our Nation's commerce \nis not entirely under the control of foreign-flag vessels. It would \nalso help level the playing field for U.S.-based carriers whose \nforeign-based competitors usually operate under more generous tax codes \nand have other advantages.\n  In my own hometown, when I come over the bridge entering my hometown, \nI look down at the river and I see ships with flags from Panama, \nLiberia, Greece, Russia--no U.S. flags, no U.S. flags. That worries me. \nThey are lined up along the docks, the grain elevators, and the other \ncargo-loading areas, right next to one of the world's most \nsophisticated shipyards where we build cruisers, destroyers, and LHD's, \nand there, right next to those various sophisticated ships and the \nconstruction that goes on, there lies a Russian ship or a Greek ship. \nThere is something that is bent out of sorts in my mind to see that \nsight. I would like there to be a guarantee that we would have at least \na minimum of U.S.-flag ships. This bill would do that.\n  On a program basis, this bill is a major improvement compared to the \npresent support program for U.S.-flag vessels. This bill would reduce--\nI want to emphasize that, reduce--the annual payments per ship by \nperhaps as much as 50 percent and achieve similar reductions in annual \nprogram levels.\n  I worked on this bill for 2 years and I went into it saying we have \nto put the merchant marine fleet on a basis where we can call on them \nif we need them, and also where we will not waste money, and to save \nmoney in the way it is set up. That is what we have done. This will be \na highly efficient program.\n  Let me also say that to the extent anyone has heard loose talk about \nthis bill establishing a new program, that is not the case. A Maritime \nSupport Program exists now. It is not as efficient as it should be, and \nit is not structured the way it should be, but we are changing that \nwith this bill and continuing an existing program. It retains the \nbenefits of the maritime program, but by far more efficiency. This is, \nin terms of real impact, a program streamlining, not creating a new \nprogram.\n  I am also pleased to tell my colleagues this bill would greatly \nreduce regulation accompanying the program. Our American carriers need \nto be able to respond quickly to meet foreign competition. If they have \nto wait for Government rulings before taking steps needed to meet \nforeign competition, it costs them money, it costs them business. So I \nneed hardly say what the commercial consequences would be for these \ncarriers.\n  The Nation, in turn, could lose the benefits of having privately \nowned U.S.-flag merchant ships. This has already happened to a large \ndegree under the outdated present program. The ships are going down to \nnothing, and that is where we are headed.\n  If we do not pass this bill, we will not have a merchant marine in a \nvery few years. If we do not have this program improved and in place \nwhen we go into the next century, there will not be a U.S. merchant \nfleet.\n\n  This bill would promptly end regulation concerning where vessels can \ngo in foreign commerce or how frequently. Some of the regulations that \nhave been on the books do not make any sense at all. Why should we have \nthis kind of regulatory control of where they go in foreign commerce or \nhow frequently?\n  It also would newly ensure the U.S.-flag carriers, like their \nforeign-based competitors, will have the flexibility to respond to \ncommercial needs by time chartering or using space on the vessels of \nothers--without having to ask our Government for approval. Why should \nthey? If space is available and you can save money by using it, why \nshould you have to go through the process of asking the Government's \napproval, and maybe even having it denied?\n  Other provisions eliminate reporting, recordkeeping and other \nrequirements. When you are involved with the Federal program, there is \nplenty of that to be done if you get rid of some of the paperwork. With \nsuch changes, we can expect the executive branch to be able to \nimplement the bill effectively and promptly.\n  The application process, for example, should not be burdensome and \nshould require carriers to provide data only to the extent that it is \nnecessary for decisions which the statute requires the agency to make.\n  The bill will allow our Nation to have the defense and economic \nbenefits of a merchant marine but overhauls the past program so that we \ncan achieve those benefits in a way that is far more cost efficient and \nreduces the regulatory burdens on the carriers.\n  Let me also make clear that, in taking up H.R. 1350, we are taking up \na bill which is virtually identical to S. 1139 as reported by the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Very few provisions differ at all.\n  As a result, the Senate Committee report will be completely \napplicable as to the meaning of provisions of the House bill which are \ncomparable to those in the Senate reported bill.\n  There are only a handful of aspects of the House bill that differ \nfrom the Senate bill. Let me note some of them.\n  Under the bill, carriers participating in the program are to be \navailable to provide assistance to the Nation under certain emergency \ncircumstances.\n  Compensation for providing resources which includes, for the purposes \nof this provision, services is required and is in addition to basic \nprogram payments\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\nmade by the Transportation Department.\n  The House bill differs from the Senate committee bill on a few \naspects of this Emergency Preparedness Program [EPP].\n  One provision added on the House floor would make clear that a \ncarrier's obligations under the emergency preparedness program do not \ncontinue when an operating agreement under the basic program is no \nlonger in effect.\n  Another change made on the House floor would make clear that the \nrange of circumstances in which the Defense Department can activate an \nemergency preparedness agreement is not limited to times of declared \nwar, but also makes clear that the authority to activate an emergency \npreparedness agreement requires a significant event, and a considered \nand carefully coordinated decision.\n  These are both clarifying changes, consistent with the intent set \nforth in the Commerce Committee report.\n  The House bill would also specify, in proposed section 653(c)(3), \nthat the amount of compensation paid under an Emergency Preparedness \nAgreement must be approved by the Secretary of Defense.\n  We support this clarification because it is DOD, not DOT, that is \nexpected to provide this EPP compensation, which is in addition to \nbasic program payments made by DOT. Section 653(c)(3), however, does \nnot authorize the Defense Department to fail to meet the compensation \nrequirements set forth in section 653.\n  Let me note here, in conjunction with the EPP, that we have seen some \nerroneous statements that this bill would eliminate the requirement in \nlaw today that U.S.-flag vessels be made available in times of \nemergency.\n  What the bill does is say that certain of today's statutory \nprovisions would not be in effect for a vessel during such time as that \nvessel is covered by an Emergency Preparedness Agreement.\n  We have developed the EPP because it will provide more flexible, \nbetter sealift service to the Government than is available now.\n  This concept, which focuses on the whole transportation system and \nprocess, not individual vessels, has been worked on by DOD, and the \nindustry for years.\n  That program allows for calling up U.S.-flag vessels to meet true \nemergencies, but it allows other options not expressly available under \ncurrent statute.\n  The creation of this alternative is a plus for the Government. And, \nas I said, at such time as a U.S.-flag vessel is not covered by an \nEmergency Preparedness Agreement, the present statutes continue.\n  So, any statements that this bill removes obligations for vessel \noperators to help the Government in emergency is simply wrong. To the \ncontrary, we have improved the program for the Government.\n  The House bill does not include the Senate bill's provision which \nwould ensure that companies which choose to enroll their modern, \nforeign-flag vessels in this program do not have to incur additional \ncosts to comply with Coast Guard vessel regulations.\n  I intend to continue to pursue legislative reform in this area, but \nthe specific changes may not be enacted before implementation of this \nbill. In that regard, I want to make clear that the Secretary of \nTransportation has the authority, to swiftly take clear and conclusive \nadministrative action in this area.\n  The Secretary can and should ensure that operators of modern vessels, \nvessels which the Coast Guard accepts as safe under international \nstandards, will not incur additional vessel costs if they do what we \nwant them to do--which is to put those vessels under U.S.-flag and \nenter into contracts under this program.\n  I will be looking to the Secretary to ensure that before a carrier \nchanges the registry of a foreign-flag ship meeting international \nstandards to United States to participate in this program, it will not \nbe required to incur additional costs due to U.S.-flag vessel \nstandards.\n  The House bill includes a provision, section 651(b)(4), not in the \nSenate bill. This provision specifies that, to be eligible for the \nprogram, a vessel ``will be'' eligible for U.S. documentation at the \ntime an operating agreement is entered into for the vessel.\n  As a technical matter, this does not mean that the vessel must be \neligible at the time the operating agreement is entered into, but means \nthat it must be determined at the time the operating agreement is \nsigned that the vessel will be eligible at the appropriate later \npoint--as it cannot receive payments under the program until it is \nactually documented as a U.S.-flag vessel.\n  Also, under the Senate bill, a provision for certain vessel operators \nto notify certain U.S. shipyards with respect to certain possible \nconstruction opportunities was to be effectuated by having the vessel \noperator notify the Secretary of Transportation, who would, in turn, \nnotify shipyards. It is our view that, under the bill, DOT has the \nauthority to make an administrative determination to utilize such an \napproach, so that vessel operators would be able to meet the \nrequirement without having to separately notify various shipyards.\n  While there are a handful of other differences between the House \npassed and Senate reported bill, these technical explanations indicate \nhow small those differences are. Their relatively minor scope \nunderscores that it is appropriate for us to proceed to pass the House \nbill and enact this long overdue legislation--so that the American \npeople can receive the defense and economic benefits it provides at \nsuch a low cost.\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues and those that are outside \nfollowing this debate will review all of the remarks I have put in the \nRecord, because I did go into some additional specific changes that we \nhave made. That has been my intent all along, to improve the system and \nto save money while we are doing it. I think we have accomplished that \nin this bill.\n  I have worked with parties on all sides. Obviously, Senator Stevens \nhas been very involved in this, as has Senator Inouye, Senator Breaux, \nand Senator Hutchison has a lot of interest in it. We are this close to \ngetting it done. And yet, because of the objection that we have heard \nso far tonight, we could lose this whole bill. I think it would be a \ngreat mistake. But I am going to yield the floor in a moment. I \nunderstand that Senator Grassley will be back in just a few moments and \nhe will then, hopefully, begin offering amendments. In the meantime, we \nwill continue to work for a unanimous-consent agreement as to how it \nwill be considered.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss some of the concerns I \nhave about the Maritime Security Act, H.R. 1350, pending before the \nSenate today.\n  On March 6, 1996, I joined several of my colleagues in a letter to \nCommerce Committee Chairman Pressler requesting that additional \nhearings be held on this bill. While there had been one hearing, groups \nopposing this legislation did not testify. Since many groups vigorously \noppose H.R. 1350, such as Citizens Against Government Waste, National \nTaxpayers Union, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Heritage Foundation, \nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, CATO, and National Grain and Feed \nAssociation, we believe a hearing should be held to fully air these \nconcerns.\n  That hearing did not occur. Nor did a markup of the Senate companion \nbill occur. We are today taking a controversial House bill from the \ndesk that has not gone through the Senate process. The bill was rushed \nthrough the House in a similar manner and passed by a voice vote. I \nunderstand, however, that there are now many House Members who believe \nthey did not have a good understanding of the bill at the time of the \nvote and would now have preferred a more thorough consideration.\n  Mr. President, maritime subsidies have long been on priority lists \nfor termination by many deficit hawks. They were heralded by \nRepublicans early in the 104th Congress as a prime example of corporate \nwelfare that must be terminated. Correspondingly, it has been\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nknown for some time that operating differential subsidies would be \nterminated. Now that we are closer to termination, the subsidies were \ndusted off and repacked in new authorization legislation called the \n``Maritime Security Bill.'' Now, subsidizing U.S.-flag ships, and their \nnoncompetitive labor rates, is an important U.S. security interest.\n  National security is vitally important to me. But I am not convinced \nthat this bill has raised national security concerns that justify the \nauthorization of $100 million to subsidize 50 U.S. ships to the tune of \n$2 million a piece.\n  During the gulf war, the Government has the authority to call up \ncommercial vessels receiving maritime subsidies. However, three-\nquarters of the ships chartered during the crisis were foreign-\nflagged--and only 20 percent of the cargo rode on these ships. Most of \nthe cargo was carried on Government ships. There is also a ready \ncharter market for commercial cargo vessels when more ships are needed. \nFurther, the few U.S.-flagged ships that were called up didn't even \ndeliver their 8 percent of the total cargo to the war zone. They \ntransferred their cargo to foreign-flagged ships at foreign ports. And \nthey charged the Government far more than the cost incurred by either \nmilitary or foreign-flagged crews--on top of the subsidies.\n  There is no evidence that this continuation of the ODI subsidies \nwould work any differently. Also, there is plenty of room for shipping \ncompanies to continue to substitute foreign flag ships if they are too \nbusy, as they can now. Why subsidize ships that are not even available \nin crisis times? Doesn't that gut the intent of the national security \nargument?\n  Even the Clinton administration has admitted that this program is \njust one which is necessary to preserve union jobs by subsidizing \nhigher U.S. maritime wages. Why not subsidize all union jobs, not just \nthose of the maritime unions?\n  Mr. President, in my judgment, there are many reasons why we should \nterminate maritime subsidies, including cargo preference and Jones Act \npreferences. Since my colleague, Senator Grassley, had done such a good \njob of presenting them, I will not repeat them other than to say that \nit is my preference that all of the maritime subsidies be terminated--\nfor the industry to become competitive on its own without the \nGovernment crutch--and the burdensome Government regulations that come \nwith the subsidies.\n  There is no reason to believe that the Government, during times of \ncrisis, cannot call into service its own vessels, foreign-flagged ships \nowned by American companies, charter vessels or obtain this kind of \nassistance from our allies. These subsidies are not needed and should \nbe terminated, as determined earlier.\n  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review recommended that \nmaritime subsidies be ended. In 1995, the DOT Inspector General \nrecommended termination. A MIT study opposes them. Many deficit hawks \ndecry the waste of taxpayers money.\n  Senator Grassley has also determined that nine retired Navy admirals \nwho originally supported the American Security Council's effort to \npromote this legislation now have questions about it and support \nadditional hearings before further consideration. They were as snowed \nas our colleagues on the House side.\n  The extension of the shipbuilding loan guarantee program has also \nbeen criticized by many and deserves a closer examination as well.\n  The one positive aspect of this bill is the relief it gives the Great \nLakes Ports, including the Port of Duluth, to cargo preference \nrestrictions. While I would prefer to terminate this subsidy as well, \nthe bill does give the ports the ability to compete based on price \nrather than whether the ship is U.S. or foreign flagged. While cargo \npreference laws act to subsidize U.S.-flagged crews, they can actually \njeopardize jobs of dockworkers in ports, such as the Port of Duluth, \nwhere U.S.-flag ships are scarce.\n  Mr. President, I realize that this bill may pass. The proponents \ncarry a lot of weight in this body, and the national security argument, \nflawed as it is, is one that many choose not to challenge. Again, I \nhave great admiration for the good work of my colleague, Senator \nGrassley, who is willing to call a spade a spade.\n\n  For that reason, and because of the great respect Senator Grassley \nholds in this body, I would urge my colleagues to listen carefully as \nhe offers his amendments to this bill. Each one of them attempts to \nameliorate a serious concern in this legislation. They should not be \ndismissed for procedural or substantive reasons. They are not offerred \nto filibuster the bill. They are offerred to improve it. Each one \nshould have been considered in a committee markup, which, again, was \nnever held.\n  In my judgment, the Grassley amendments are no-brainers that should \nnot be controversial. One would ensure that the ships receiving the \nsubsidies are available for service, not foreign-flagged subsitutes. \nWhy would we subsidize ships that don't even have to be available in \nemergencies?\n  Another amendment would force U.S. seafarers to serve in these \ncrises. If the Government is subsidizing sizable seafarer wages, \nshouldn't they be required to serve if called? Right now that is not a \nrequirement. Senator Grassley would include exceptions similar to those \ngranted to military reservists. Again, what is controversial about this \namendment?\n  The next Grassley amendment would equalize seafarer war bonuses to \nthe same rate as military reservists. Right now they receive far more. \nWhy?\n  An amendment would prohibit use of the subsidies for pro-maritime \nlobbying efforts. Last year we voted to restrict use of public funds \nfrom lobbying use. These funds should be restricted as well.\n  Another amendment would prohibit subsidies being used for campaign \ncontributions. Subsidized wages of seafarers have enabled these workers \nto contribute 500 times more than other union workers to campaigns.\n  One amendment will require U.S.-flag ships and crews to deliver their \ncargoes directly to the war zone. Incredibly, now they can, and have, \nshifted their cargo to a foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed vessel at a \nport far from the war zone. They then can charge the Government U.S.-\nflag premium rates while providing lower foreign-flag rates. Or they \ncan use a foreign-flag ship the entire route, receiving the same \npremium rates. Why is this acceptable if all of the proponents of this \nbill claim that we need a U.S.-flag capability.\n  The bill provides for fair and reasonable reimbursement during use by \nthe Government. The Pentagon paid $70,000 to the U.S. cargo ship \noperators to send war materiels to the gulf. The foreign bid was \n$6,000. This is wrong--a betrayal of the taxpayers. The last Grassley \namendment would give the government the right to hire foreign-flag \nvessels if U.S.-flag costs are greater than 6 percent over the foreign \ncost. U.S. flags would also have to charge the government the same rate \nprovided to volume customers.\n  If the amendments offered by Senator Grassley are adopted, it would \nbe easier for me to consider supporting this legislation. However, the \nentire premise for this bill is flawed. There simply is not a good case \nfor this expenditure of taxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before I send an amendment to the desk, \nI am going to talk about the amendment. This is one of those seven \namendments that I had suggested, and it deals with our seafarers being \npaid bonuses during time of war and to equalize the bonuses between \npeople who are seafarers and the bonuses that people in our Navy would \nreceive in the very same part of the world under the very same \nconditions.\n  If seafarers do decide to serve, I think I pointed out in my original \nremarks on the bill, they have many more options than people who are \nmilitary. When the people in Texas were told by the President of the \nUnited States, ``Pack up, you're going to go to Kuwait,'' the families \nhad tears in their eyes, and we saw on television the men and women of \nAmerica who are committed to the defense of our country respond to the \nCommander in Chief.\n  Seafarers have options: to go or not. And if seafarers do decide to \nserve and sail into the designated war zone, they are paid 100-percent \nbase pay as a war-zone bonus. The military sealift command reported to \nme that one seafarer was paid $15,700 for a 2-month Persian\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nGulf war bonus. That is on top of the regular pay that they would get.\n  The most that our men and women in the regular military or Reserve \ncould get for that 2-month period is $300, or $150 a month. So compare \nthis $15,700 for a 2-month war bonus for a seafarer with the $300 that \none of our men or women would have received during that same period of \ntime.\n  But that isn't the end of it. Our seafarers are eligible for much \nmore--much, much more. If their vessel is in a harbor that is attacked, \na seafarer can get an extra $400 per day. If their vessel is actually \nattacked, not just in the harbor that is attacked, they get an extra \n$600 per day.\n  So the amendment that I am offering puts an end to this nonsensical \napproach and inequitable approach between our men and women in the \nregular military or Reserve compared with what the seafarers get. \nTaxpayers' support for seafarers' war bonuses will be limited to the \nlevel provided for the men and women in our Reserves and regular \nmilitary.\n  This amendment makes very certain taxpayers don't pay seafarers \nhigher war bonuses than the active military.\n  Seafarers get this extra 100-percent base pay. I think everybody \nwould agree that this is clearly nonsense and unfair. It ought to be \ndemoralizing to our troops to look at the paycheck of one person and \nhave $300 compared to the paycheck of a person in the same environment \nwith $15,700 and some. We ought to realize that this is inequitable. It \nmight even be considered a huge waste of taxpayers' money, or it could \nbe equitable to pay our men and women in uniform more.\n\n  The seafarers get incredibly large salary and benefits year in and \nyear out from taxpayers supposedly so they will serve Uncle Sam when \nneeded. It seems to me it is not right to gouge the taxpayers a second \ntime when they are actually called into a war zone.\n  It is fair for them to get a bonus, but it is not fair for them to \nget a bonus well beyond what regular military people get who, by the \nway, get paid a lot less than the seafarers get anyway. I want to talk \nabout the biggest war bonus paid to a civilian mariner assigned to an \nMSC ship during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm. On March 27, \n1991, the Department of Defense approved the payment of war zone \nbonuses to those mariners operating in the Persian Gulf area west of 53 \ndegrees east longitude. Civilian mariners were eligible for war zone \nbonuses equal to 100 percent of pay for each day their ships were \nwithin the designated war zone. Payments were effective retroactive to \nJanuary 17, 1991, and ceased on April 11, 1991, the day of the final \ncease-fire.\n  The largest war bonus payment made to a civilian mariner aboard an \nMSC controlled ship was approximately $15,700 for that 2-month period. \nThe ship was anchored within the designated war zone area approximately \n56 consecutive days. Consequently, the crew members earned larger \npayments than those assigned to other MSC controlled ships.\n  The vast majority of the MSC's vessels transported military equipment \nand other supplies from the continental United States and European \nports to the Middle East. These ships were only in the war zone area \nfor approximately 2 to 5 days per voyage. As a result, war bonus \npayments for these civilian mariners averaged approximately $69.50 to \n$1,467 per voyage.\n  The war zone areas for military personnel included the Persian Gulf, \nthe Gulf of Oman, that portion of the Arabian Sea which lies north of \nthe 10 degrees north latitude and west of the 68th degrees east \nlongitude or the Gulf Aden and all of the Red Sea. This made it more \nlikely that active-duty sailors would qualify for hazardous pay.\n  This is the guidance that clarified which bonuses are paid and when \nunder Desert Shield/Desert Storm. The imminent danger pay on applicable \ncontracts, the actual direct costs of a reasonable crew imminent danger \npay mandated by compulsory regulations or collective bargaining \nagreements, not to exceed $130 per month, are payable to each crew \nmember under the following circumstances: Vessels in the Persian Gulf, \nthe Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, the portion of the Arabian Sea that lies \nnorth of the 10 degrees north latitude, west of the 68th degrees east \nlongitude, or the Gulf of Aden, and vessels in this zone for a minimum \nof 6 days within one calendar month or 6 consecutive days beginning in \none month and ending in the next, and vessels in this zone between \nAugust 2, 1990, and until the time in which the Secretary of Defense \ndetermines that an imminent danger no longer exists in the region. And \nthe $130 is not prorated. The full amount is paid to anyone satisfying \nthe above criteria.\n  Time spent in the war bonus zone described below does not count \ntoward the 6 days criteria.\n  Let me point out that my war bonus amendment is supported by the \nretired admirals. These were the admirals that I had named earlier. I \nthink it is fair to say that retired admirals know that it is not fair \nto pay $15,700 to a seafarer for 2 months, but only $300 to our men and \nwomen in the reserve or the regular military and Navy.\n  In regard to the war bonus--because I just told you about the \nimminent danger pay--in regard to the war bonus, on applicable \ncontracts, actual direct costs of the reasonable crew war bonuses, \nmandated by compulsory regulation or collective bargaining agreement \nnot in excess of an extra 100 percent of the crew's base pay, exclusive \nof supply penalties, are payable to each crew member under these \ncircumstances: The vessel is in the Persian Gulf west of the 53 degrees \neast longitude, a bonus is payable for any day or portion of a day in \nthis zone continuing until one day after the vessel passes east of the \nzone, and the vessel then is zoned between January 17, 1991 and the \ntime when the final cease-fire marks an end to the hostilities, as \nreferred to in the U.N. Security Resolution 686 of April 11, 1991.\n\n  Then we have next the war bonus for harbor attack. I gave a slight \ndefinition of this earlier. But this would apply in circumstances where \nwar bonuses are applicable. It would then be $400, payable to each crew \nmember aboard a ship in a harbor which is attacked. This is MARAD's \ndetermination. Only one harbor attack bonus is payable per day. A \nharbor attack bonus is not payable to a crew member earning a vessel \nattack bonus for the same day.\n  Then we have the war bonus that applies, not to the harbor attack, \nbut to the actual attack on the vessel. In circumstances where war \nbonuses are applicable, $600 is payable to each crew member aboard a \nship which is attacked. And that also is MARAD's determination.\n  There are certain document requirements. There is a requirement to \nsubmit imminent danger pay and war bonus invoices to appropriate MARAD \npaying offices in accordance with billing instructions clearly \nidentifying which imminent danger war zone is being built, the \ncorresponding dates and times in the zone. Note that the base wages \nmust be identified for each rating, and MARAD then will request vessel \ndeck logs and payroll sheets and individual pay vouchers containing \ncrew's signatures for reconciliation of crew wages.\n  We have had some instances where seafaring unions sued the U.S. \nGovernment to obtain bonuses for gulf war trips. Seafaring labor unions \nsued the Government. According to this article, they sued the \nGovernment in an effort to win war bonus payments for their members who \nworked on Government cargo ships during the war against Iraq.\n  The Sailors Union of the Pacific, the Marine Firemen's Union, and the \nSeafarers International Union filed suit in Federal District Court \nclaiming the U.S. Maritime Administration unfairly cheated their \nmembers out of hazardous duty pay. War bonus payments, of course, as I \nsaid are extra compensation for ship crews that go into risky shipping \nzones. Generally, crews get twice their regular pay, plus extra lump \nsum payments, should their vessels or harboring areas come under direct \nattack.\n  The shipping areas where war bonus payments apply are usually the \ntraffic lanes within war zone areas designated by the White House. When \nthe Persian gulf conflict began in 1991, the unions and the American \nPresident Line, a primary carrier for U.S. forces agreed to use a war \nzone designated by President Bush as the area where the war bonus \npayments would apply. However, the Maritime Administration later \nestablished a war zone area that was\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nsmaller than the original White House designation.\n  The American President Line which operated 23 of its own ships, 11 \nReady Reserve force ships for MARAD, argued that it had to use a \nsmaller war zone area because it was relying on reimbursement from the \nGovernment for the Ready Reserve force operations.\n  The unions brought the case to an arbitrator from the Federal \nMediation and Conciliation Service. Arbitrator William Eaton ruled that \nbecause of its earlier agreement, APL should pay seafarers on its own \nships at war bonus rates for the entire zone established by the White \nHouse, but seafarers on the RRF ships could not be included, he \ndecided. The union failed in an earlier attempt to get the Federal \ndistrict court here to overturn the arbitration denial of war bonus \npayments to the RRF workers.\n  Another newspaper report on these bonuses says:\n\n       The Defense Department officials have agreed to reimburse \n     civilian ship operators for war bonuses up to 100 percent of \n     normal wages paid to seafarers who crewed scores of military \n     cargo ships supplying the Persian Gulf. Although strict \n     conditions will apply, the Navy notified ship owners this \n     week that it will pay for war bonuses given to men and women \n     who entered the war zone after August 2, 1990, the day that \n     Iraq invaded Kuwait. The higher levels of benefit will be \n     paid for voyages after January 17, 1991, when the United \n     States launched its air war against Iraq. The bonuses will \n     continue to be reimbursed until the formal cease-fire is \n     declared by the United Nations according to a notice from the \n     Military Sealift Command, the Navy agency in charge of the \n     ocean transportation.\n\n  Marge Holtz, director of public affairs for the Sealift Command, said \nshe did not know how many ship crews would be affected or what the \ntotal costs would be. She added that certain military censorship \npolicies are still in effect and will not be relaxed until the cease-\nfire is declared.\n  Sealift commander Admiral Francis Donavan said in early March that \n446 voyages had been made into the gulf during the first 7 months of \nthe operation. Some individual ships, especially those under the U.S. \nflag, have made multiple voyages.\n  At its peek operation, Desert Storm-Desert Shield employed 128 U.S.-\nflag ships, 111 foreign-flag ships; crew sizes of the ship ranged from \nabout 20 to more than 70 on some specialized vessels. According to the \nSealift Command notice, crew members on the ships sailing through much \nof the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman, and portions of the \nArabian Sea will have their war bonuses paid by the U.S. Government. \nThe maximum of $135 a month will be paid for voyages in the period \nleading up to January 17. After that and into the future, until the \nU.N. cease-fire, the war bonuses will be 100 percent of base daily wage \nof each crew member. The notice, however, will not ease one festering \ncontroversy with the U.S. merchant marine. It stems from the fact that \nreimbursement is not yet being made for ships that are part of the \nGovernment's Ready Reserve Fleet, a fleet of aging cargo ships kept for \nuse in military enterprises. Seventy-eight ships for the Ready Reserve \nwere activated to participate in the Persian Gulf buildup, and a fight \nis already on for war bonuses for those crews, said one West Coast \nmaritime labor leader.\n  Whitey Disley, president of the Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders \nand Wipers Association, said that shipping companies that operate Ready \nReserve ships under contract to the Government are not paying war \nbonuses. Companies are refusing to pay, even though some of them have \nlabor contracts that specifically call for war bonuses.\n  One such company is American President Line, Ltd., of Oakland, but \nrepresentatives of the company indicated they will pay if the \nGovernment offers reimbursement.\n  ``It looks like we will have to go to arbitration, a grievance \nprocedure on this,'' the union leader said.\n  The issue is under ``active review'' by the Maritime Administration, \nthe Transportation Department agency responsible for the Ready Reserve \nforce. MARAD officials contacted this newspaper and had not responded \nwith any comment at press time.\n\n  It is pretty complicated, Mr. President, but one thing that stands \nout here is that we do not have an equitable situation between people \nwho are in the full-time military in a war zone with their life just as \nendangered as seafarers who get 100 percent base pay war bonuses. And \nremember, seafarer pay is already higher than what our military people \nget in the first place. It seems to me that we have a responsibility to \nour military personnel that they be treated fairly with the seafarers.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to actual amounts of money that are \npaid for these war bonuses to specific shipping companies. We paid \n$29,197.56 to Gulf Trader of the All Marine Service; to the American \nForeign Shipping Company, war bonuses we paid, $40,512.48; to the \nAmerican Overseas Marine, we paid a total of $599,747.98. That is \nbroken down into separate figures for eight different ships, ranging in \npayment from a small amount of $5,937.58, all the way up to figures \nlike $253,334.18 and $239,430.80 for a couple of other ships.\n  The International Marine Carriers received for two ships $259,642 \ntotal; for the Interocean Management Corporation, war bonuses totaled \n$369,279.27, ranging from a low of $14,276 for one ship to $105,884 for \nanother ship; to the Marine Carriers, we paid $55,299.47, ranging from \na low of $7,553 up to a high of $30,000 for another ship, spread out \nover four ships. Marine Transport Lines received $193,170. OMI Ship \nManagement received a total of $439,646. That is a grand total of \n$1,987,496 war bonuses for these shipping lines.\n  As I stated previously, these are not the only bonuses that are \navailable.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5391\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a uniform system of incentive pay for certain \n             hazardous duties performed by merchant seamen)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5391.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . UNIFORM PAYMENT FOR HAZARDOUS DUTY.\n\n       Title III of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 App. U.S.C. \n     1131), as amended by section 10 of this Act, is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 303. PAYMENT OF MERCHANT SEAMEN FOR HAZARDOUS DUTY.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation, in \n     cooperation with the Secretary of Defense, shall establish a \n     wage scale for hazardous duty applicable to an individual who \n     is employed on a vessel that is used by the United States for \n     a war, armed conflict, national emergency, or maritime \n     mobilization need (including training purposes or testing for \n     readiness and suitability for mission performance).\n       ``(b) Content of Wage Scale.--The wage scale established \n     under this section shall be commensurate with the incentive \n     pay for hazardous duty provided to members of the uniformed \n     services under section 301 of title 37, United States \n     Code.''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is the language, this is the \namendment that is going to bring war bonus parity between our \nseafarers--and added war bonus pay in some instances, 100 percent \nincreases in pay--and regular military. Seafarers ought to get \nadditional pay, because their life is endangered, but it must be \nequalized with that our full-time military personnel, who get a lot \nless for war bonuses for the endangerment that comes from being in a \nwar zone situation.\n  We do this by giving the Secretary of Transportation, in cooperation \nwith the Secretary of Defense, the right and power to establish a wage \nscale for hazardous duty applicable to an individual who is employed on \na vessel that is used by the United States for a war, armed conflict, \nnational emergency, or maritime mobilization need, including training \npurposes for testing for readiness and suitability for mission \nperformance. And the content of the wage scale, then, as established, \nshall be commensurate with incentive pay for hazardous duty provided to \nmembers of the uniformed service under sections 301, title 37 U.S. \nCode.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, most respectfully, I wish to suggest that \nthis\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\namendment is demeaning, unfair, and I say insulting to the civilian \nmerchant mariner of the United States of America.\n  In World War II, I had the great honor and privilege of serving my \ncountry, and it is true that my pay, even as that of a captain, was \nless than that of most of the merchant mariners. But as a result of my \ninjury, for the rest of my life, I will receive a pension. The merchant \nmariner who was injured in World War II is not receiving that pension. \nAs a result of my service in the military, I received the bountiful \ngift of this Nation, the GI Bill of Rights. I received my law degree \nand my baccalaureate through the GI Bill of Rights. The merchant \nmariner who served during World War II did not receive the GI Bill of \nRights. And because of my injury, Mr. President--and this sounds rather \nfacetious--in order to assist me in my mobility throughout the \nneighborhood, my country gave me a car, an automobile. The disabled \nmerchant mariner did not receive a car. Today, as a result of my injury \nin World War II, my wife and I receive full medical benefits for the \nrest of our lives. The merchant mariner doesn't receive that.\n\n  As a result of that, understandably, the merchant mariner said this \nwill never happen again. So, since then, they have organized and they \nhave said, ``Though we cannot get the GI Bill, nor can we get lifetime \npensions and hospitalization and dependents' benefits, we are going to \ninsist that if we are going to stand in harm's way and risk our lives, \nwe should be covered.''\n  Mr. President, we are, by this amendment, comparing apples to \ncoconuts--apples and oranges look alike in some cases, but this is \napples and coconuts. I hope that at the appropriate time tomorrow \nmorning--whatever my leader wishes to do--we will dispose of this with \nan overwhelming vote, because this is not fair. It is insulting to our \nmerchant mariners.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, unfortunately, the amendment that the \nSenator from Iowa has offered deals with another situation. Under this \nbill before the Senate, the U.S. Government will pay a flat fee for the \nuse of the vessel fully crewed. What the shipowners pay the crew is a \nprivate matter. It will not affect the payment at all.\n  As I said in my opening statement, the problem with the Persian Gulf, \nDesert Shield and Desert Storm, was we had to go to get foreign \nshipping. And in most instances, the premiums extracted were 50 percent \nof the total cost, not just the crew cost. In some instances, it was \ndouble the charter price. In spite of that, crews refused to enter the \nwar zone.\n  Now, the Senator's amendment deals with something that happened in \nthe past, which would not be the situation in the future with regard to \nthis bill. But even with regard to what happened under Desert Shield/\nDesert Storm, I think the Senator forgets that we recovered the cost of \nour participation in that crisis, that war, from Kuwait and Saudi \nArabia. This wasn't taxpayer cost that the Senator was talking about at \nall.\n  So, as I indicated, if we had had an agreement, I would not make a \nmotion to table.\n  I now move to table the amendment.\n  Under the leader's direction, there will be no vote on that tonight. \nThe vote will occur tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10972-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, Shakespeare wrote in The Tempest, ``My \nlibrary was dukedom large enough.'' With those few words he expressed \nthe satisfaction, fulfillment and power available through the knowledge \nrecorded and preserved in a well-stocked library.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I rise to pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the establishment of the Senate's own ``dukedom,'' the \nSenate Library.\n  The Library of the Senate is a legislative and general reference \nlibrary that provides a wide variety of information services to Senate \noffices in a prompt and timely fashion.\n  It maintains a comprehensive collection of congressional and \ngovernmental publications, and of materials relating to the specialized \ninformation needs of the Senate: government and politics, history, \npolitical biography, economics, international relations and other \ntopics. The Library's resources and services are dedicated to providing \nthe Members of the Senate and their staffs with critically needed \ninformation on issues affecting legislative deliberation and \ndecisionmaking.\n  The origins of the Senate Library can be traced back as early as 1792 \nwhen the Senate, then meeting in Philadelphia, directed the Secretary \n``to procure, and deposit in his office, the laws of the several \nstates, for the use of the Senate,'' as well as maps of the country. \nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, the Chief Clerk of the \nSenate added to these materials by collecting copies of the bills, \nresolutions and reports of each Congress. By the end of the 1850's, the \nneed for a library to maintain this collection had become evident; \nefforts to establish the library culminated in resolutions in 1870 to \ndesignate rooms to be fitted--and I quote from the Senate Journal--``to \nhold and arrange for the convenience of the Senate books and documents \nnow in charge of the Secretary of the Senate.''\n  Let me say that again: ``to hold and arrange for the convenience of \nthe Senate books and documents now in charge of the Secretary of the \nSenate.''\n  The first librarian to be appointed was George S. Wagner, who \nofficially commenced his duties on July 1, 1871.\n  While today's Senate Library continues to maintain the core \ncollection of legislative materials that necessitated its establishment \n125 years ago, its operations have been transformed by modern \ntechnology. The current Senate Librarian, Roger K. Haley, is a veteran \nof 32 years in the library, and he has witnessed the transition from a \ncompletely paper-based service to one that now relies as well on \nelectronic databases, the Internet, and microform. Another significant \nchange occurring over the last twenty years has been the growth in \nprofessional staffing in response to the more diverse and sophisticated \ninformation needs of Senate patrons.\n  More than half of the current library staff of 22 consists of highly \nskilled librarians trained to meet the special requirements of Senate \noffices. This dedicated team performs an outstanding job in responding \nquickly to the some 70,000 inquiries that were received last year.\n  It is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to commend the \nSenate Library for its vital service to the Senate and to extend a warm \ncongratulations as it celebrates its 125th anniversary year.\n  Thomas Carlyle wrote that, ``All that mankind has done, thought, \ngained or been: it is lying as in magic preservation in the pages of \nbooks.''\n  Especially in this day and age when our Nation faces the turmoil of \ndramatic, far-reaching change, the knowledge, wisdom, and experience \navailable to us through the source of an extensive and efficient in-\nhouse library is critical to helping us make considered judgments.\n  I thank all of the fine personnel involved with the Senate Library \nfor helping us to light the corridors of our minds so that we may \nbetter lead the way for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I know of no Senator--I would not have any reason to \nknow if there were--any Senator who calls upon the Senate library more \nthan I call upon it, more than my staff and I lean upon it and depend \nupon it. And I want to express my gratitude to the people in the Senate \nlibrary who always respond so courteously and are so cooperative.\n  So there is a list of 16 persons who have served the Senate as \nLibrarian\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\nsince 1871. And I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Librarians of the United States Senate\n\n       George S.

Mr. President, recently at the Democratic National \nConvention in Chicago, my colleague, Senator Jay Rockefeller addressed \nthe delegates assembled there. His remarks were, as usual, right on \npoint, discussing some of the most important issues of our times. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of Senator Rockefeller's remarks \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [The Charleston Gazette, Wednesday, Aug. 28, 1996]\n\n                Text of Rockefeller's Convention Speech\n\n                         (The Associated Press)\n\n       Prepared remarks of Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., at the \n     Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Tuesday:\n\n       My name is Jay Rockefeller: I'm from West Virginia. And I'm \n     a Democrat. Let me tell you why.\n       We Democrats understand what makes America different. In \n     America, a lifetime of hard work adds up to something: owning \n     your own home; putting your kids through college; having \n     peace of mind when you retire.\n       And no return on a lifetime of hard work means more to more \n     Americans than the peace of mind provided by Medicare and \n     Medicaid.\n       Medicare--the rock solid guarantee that poor health won't \n     put you in the poor house.\n       Medicare--part of the sacred trust that binds us together.\n       Medicare--conceived by Democrats. Passed by Democrats. \n     Defended by Democrats.\n       In 1964, I went to West Virginia as a VISTA worker--to the \n     small coal camp of Emmons. I worked in Emmons for two years \n     to make a difference, to change some lives. But in the end, I \n     was the one who was transformed. I learned that even the \n     smallest changes can take a lifetime of effort. And I learned \n     that even the smallest efforts count.\n       In 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed the Medicare and Medicaid \n     bills into law. He carried on the work of Harry Truman and \n     Jack Kennedy, fighting to see health security guaranteed for \n     every senior citizen and working family.\n       Today, Democrats are fighting to extend that same peace of \n     mind to every American. Today, we are fighting to protect our \n     legacy from Republican rollbacks.\n       At the Republican convention, Bob Dole talked about going \n     back to the America of his youth. Yes, there is a lot to be \n     said about a time when life was simpler. But nostalgia can \n     play tricks on you * * * not all aspects of the good old days \n     were so good.\n       There was a time in America when our elderly often lived \n     out the end of their lives in poverty and despair. There was \n     a time when widows were left with nothing, when husbands \n     would lose their homes after caring for a terminally ill \n     spouse. There was a time in America when families' college \n     savings could be wiped out and family farms were sold to pay \n     parents' hospital bills.\n       But in 1965, we turned a corner. Because of Medicare and \n     Medicaid, we live in a different America. A better \n     America.\n       Remember, no family is immune to sudden tragedy, old age or \n     illness. The heartbreak is the same for every one of us. That \n     is why we must remember that Medicare and Medicaid are the \n     only safety net protecting working families against \n     impoverishment caused by catastrophic illness.\n       Today, Americans can all look toward their retirement years \n     with hope and confidence, not fear and anxiety. Today, older \n     Americans and people with disabilities can be assured that \n     they will be treated with dignity.\n       Democrats are committed to a balanced budget, but we won't \n     do it on the backs of the people who built this country and \n     made it great.\n       Last year, Republicans tried to give out $245 billion of \n     tax breaks for the rich and cut $270 billion to try to pay \n     for it. And watch out! If the Republicans win, Medicare and \n     Medicaid will be back on the chopping block.\n       Thirty years ago, Republicans fought against the creation \n     of Medicare. Bob Dole voted against it. Remember what he said \n     only a year ago, and I quote, ``I was there, fighting the \n     fight, one of the 12, voting against Medicare in 1965 . . . \n     because it wouldn't work.'' And Newt Gingrich talks of \n     letting Medicare wither on the vine. We will not let that \n     happen.\n       And why will we defend Medicare for the family trying to \n     take care of an aging parent? Because that's what families \n     do.\n       And why will we defend Medicare for senior Americans who \n     have lost their spouses? Because that's what families do.\n       And why will we be there to defend Medicaid for the family \n     of a child with a disability? Because that's what families \n     do.\n       And why will we be there to defend Medicare for the couple \n     approaching retirement who need peace of mind? Because that's \n     what families do.\n       Why will we safeguard Medicaid for children? Because that's \n     what families do.\n       Why do we continue to push for health care for all \n     Americans? Because that's what families do.\n       And why are we going to vote Clinton-Gore in `96?\n       Because that's what families do. And because of what they \n     do for families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10979-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10979-S10980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HELEN RILEY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a special \nSouth Carolinian and well known Charlestonian, Mrs. Helen Schachte \nRiley, who passed away last week at the age of 81.\n  Mrs. Riley was a respected community servant and devoted Christian, \nmother, and wife. Throughout her long and distinguished life, this \nenthusiastic woman was actively involved in her community and many \nlocal and charitable organizations.\n  The strength of a community lies within its citizens, and Helen Riley \ncontributed much to our great city of Charleston. Unquestionably, Mrs. \nRiley is a role model to many South Carolinians, including her son, Joe \nRiley, who serves as the Mayor of Charleston. Her legacy lives on and \nshe leaves her children, grandchildren and great grand-children a proud \nheritage and fond memories of an outstanding and gracious lady.\n  Mr. President, Helen Schachte Riley's family has my deepest \nsympathies and condolences on their loss. I believe an article from \nyesterday's Charleston Post and Courier nicely sums up Mrs. Riley's \nlife and many accomplishments, and I ask unanimous consent that this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [Charleston Post and Courier, Sept. 18, 1996]\n\n                          Helen Schachte Riley\n\n       Helen Schachte Riley didn't make headlines, as did her late \n     husband, prominent civic leader Joseph P. Riley Sr., or her \n     son, the long-time, popular mayor of Charleston. But she was \n     a much-admired force in the community, known for her devotion \n     to her family, the quality of her character and her gracious \n     style.\n       While naturally shy, Helen Riley had long been in the \n     limelight, either at the side of her husband, or as one of \n     her sons staunchest supporters. She handled her public role \n     with dignity and charm.\n       A native of the city in which her family would play such a \n     prominent role, she was a bright student at the College of \n     Charleston, graduating second in her class. Then it was on to \n     Jefferson Medical College where she became a medical \n     technologist.\n       But most of her life was spent as a wife and as a mother to \n     three daughters and a son. Before her death last week at age \n     81, her devotion had extended to 12 grandchildren and one \n     great-grandchild.\n       Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr., who delivered the eulogy at his \n     mother's funeral mass at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of St. \n     John the Baptist, remembered her Tuesday as the ``the best \n     role model'' and as ``the-glue that held us together--our \n     center of gravity.''\n       Helen Riley's parents taught her the importance of \n     community service, the mayor said, noting her involvement \n     with the Association for the Blind and the Florence \n     Crittenton Home. And she was ``a wonderful child to her \n     parents,'' he noted, ``teaching us the joy and responsibility \n     of caring for three generations at one time.''\n       Her husband and her children had no question about their \n     importance in her life. They knew, the mayor said, that they \n     were her ``very center'' . . . ``it was the bedrock of our \n     existence.''

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending September 13, the U.S. imported 7,572,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 393,000 less than the 7,965,000 imported \nduring the same week a year ago.\n  Nevertheless, Americans relied on foreign oil for 54 percent of their \nneeds last week, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will \nabate. Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained about 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil--by \nU.S. producers using American workers? Politicians had better ponder \nthe economic calamity sure to occur in America if and when foreign \nproducers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous cost of \nimported oil flowing into the U.S.--now 7,572,000 barrels a day.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, it appears to me that we find ourselves in a \npleasant predicament when it comes to education appropriations for \nfiscal year 1997. On each side of the aisle we have leadership packages \nthat would add some $2.3 billion in additional funding to education.\n  In several areas, the Democratic package, of which I am a cosponsor, \nis larger than the Republican package. It would, for instance, add $585 \nmillion to the Pell Grant program in order to fund a $2,700 maximum \ngrant for the coming year. It would also add funds to the Goals 2000 \nProgram, to the Professional Development Program for Teachers, to \nEducation Technology, and to important higher education programs, such \nas TRIO and the SSIG Program.\n  In other areas, however, the Republican package is larger. In areas \nsuch as Title I, Adult Education, the SEOG Program, College Work Study, \nand Special Education, the Republican package contains more funding \nthan the Democratic package.\n  Mr. President, there is a solution to the dilemma with which we are \nfaced that is in the best interests of our nation. It is also an \noutcome that would get us out of a bipartisan battle, and bring the \nspirit of bipartisanship back to education policy making and \nappropriations. Very simply, I believe we should take the higher number \nfrom each package, put them together, and pass a package for which we \ncan all take credit.\n  This would mean more money for education, and to my mind, that would \nbe very good news, indeed. It would mean better funding in such \ncritical areas as Pell Grants, Title I, Professional Development for \nTeachers, Special Education, and the campus-based student aid programs.\n  Instead of discussing which proposal is better in which area, we \nshould resolve the dilemma and conclude an agreement that is in the \nbest interests not of one political party or the other but of the \nAmerican people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10980-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10980-S10984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 303 of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1383(b)), a \nnotice of adoption of amendments to procedural rules was submitted by \nthe Office of Compliance, U.S. Congress. The notice publishes adopted \namendments to the rules governing the procedures for the Office of \nCompliance under the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice and the amendments to the rules \nbe printed in the Congressional Record. Therefore I ask unanimous \nconsent that the notice and amendments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n                     Amendments to Procedural Rules\n\n\n          NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n       Summary: After considering comments to the Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking published July 11, 1996 in the \n     Congressional Record, the Executive Director has adopted and \n     is publishing amendments to the rules governing the \n     procedures for the Office of Compliance under the \n     Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 \n     Stat. 3). The amendments to the procedural rules have been \n     approved by the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance.\n       For Further Information Contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, Room LA 200, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Telephone No. 202-724-9250.\n\n\n                       SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\n                             I. Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. Section 303 of the CAA directs that the Executive \n     Director of the Office of Compliance (``Office'') shall, \n     subject to the approval of the Board of Directors (``Board'') \n     of the Office, adopt rules governing the procedures for the \n     Office, and may amend those rules in the same manner. The \n     procedural rules currently in effect, approved by the Board \n     and adopted by the Executive Director, were published \n     December 22, 1995 in the Congressional Record (141 Cong. R. S \n     19239 (daily ed., Dec. 22, 1995)). The revisions and \n     additions that follow amend certain of the existing \n     procedures by which the Office provides for the consideration \n     and resolution of alleged violations of the laws made \n     applicable under Part A of title II of the CAA, and establish \n     procedures for consideration of matters arising under Part D \n     of title II of the CAA, which is generally effective October \n     1, 1996.\n       Pursuant to section 303(b) of the CAA, the Executive \n     Director published for comment a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking in the Congressional Record on July 11, 1996 (142 \n     Cong. R. S7685-88, H7450-54 (daily ed., July 11, 1996)) \n     inviting comments regarding the proposed amendments to the \n     procedural rules. Three comments were received in response to \n     the NPR: two from Congressional offices and one from a labor \n     organization. After full consideration of the comments \n     received, the Executive Director has, with the approval of \n     the Board, adopted these amendments to the procedural rules.\n\n             II. Consideration of Comments and Conclusions\n\n                      A. Definition of participant\n\n       One commenter suggested deleting the terms ``labor \n     organization'' and ``employing office'' from the definition \n     of ``participant'' found at section 1.07(c) of the proposed \n     rules. The commenter noted that a ``party'' is included in \n     the definition of participant and the term ``party'' is \n     defined in section 1.02(i) of the rules as including a labor \n     organization or employing office.\n       The final rule, as adopted and approved, incorporates the \n     modification suggested by the commenter.\n\n           B. Contents or records of confidential proceedings\n\n       One commenter asked that section 1.07(d) of the rules be \n     revised to reflect the commenter s understanding that ``an \n     employing office may acknowledge the existence of a complaint \n     and the general allegations being made by an employee, and \n     the employing office may deny the allegations.'' This \n     commenter further requested that the phrase ``information \n     forming the basis for the allegation,'' found in the same \n     section of the rules, be defined. According to the commenter, \n     the phrase is ambiguous. The commenter did not, however, \n     identify the asserted ambiguity.\n       The statute requires that the filing of a complaint and its \n     subject matter be kept confidential. Thus, it is not \n     permissible under the statute, as enacted--much less the \n     procedural rules implementing the statute--for an employing \n     office to disclose the information described. Moreover, no \n     ambiguity has been identified or is apparent which would \n     warrant modifying the proposed rule. Accordingly, the rule \n     has been adopted and approved without modification.\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\n           C. Requests for extension of the mediation period\n\n       Two commenters correctly point out that, although it was \n     noted in the preamble of the NPR that section 2.04(e)(2) is \n     proposed to be modified to allow oral as well as written \n     requests for the extension of the mediation period, the \n     actual text of the proposed revision was inadvertently \n     omitted. Although neither commenter stated an objection to \n     the substance of the proposed revision, one commenter \n     requested that the text of the proposed amendment be \n     published and the comment period be extended prior to its \n     adoption.\n       The proposed amendment, and its intent, were clearly \n     explained in the NPR so as to give sufficient notice of the \n     proposed modification. And as the adoption of the amended \n     rule will not work a disservice to any party to a mediation, \n     but rather will enable all parties to more fully utilize the \n     mediation process, the proposed modification to the rule has \n     been adopted and approved.\n\n                         D. Answer to complaint\n\n       All three commenters expressed concern that proposed \n     section 5.01(f) could be interpreted to foreclose a \n     respondent from raising certain affirmative defenses or \n     interposing certain denials. One commenter further urged the \n     adoption of a specific rule that would allow the filing of a \n     motion to dismiss or a motion for a more definitive statement \n     in lieu of an answer.\n       With respect to the request that the Executive Director \n     adopt a rule allowing for the filing of the specific motions \n     suggested, it is noted that, although not specifically \n     provided for, such matters are already permitted under the \n     existing procedural rules. Thus, no modification is \n     necessary.\n       As to the commenters' other concerns, the language of \n     section 5.01(f), as adopted and approved, has been clarified \n     to provide that only affirmative defenses that could have \n     reasonably been anticipated based on the facts alleged in the \n     complaint shall be deemed waived if not raised in an \n     answer. In addition, the rule has been modified to \n     describe the circumstances under which motions for leave \n     to amend an answer to raise defenses or interpose denials \n     will be granted.\n\n                      E. Withdrawal of complaints\n\n       One commenter argued that the requirement contained in \n     section 5.03 that the withdrawal of a complaint be approved \n     by a Hearing Officer should be deleted because, according to \n     the commenter, under the CAA a complaint may be withdrawn at \n     any time. In the commenter's view, a rule requiring Hearing \n     Officer approval of such a withdrawal is ``an inappropriate \n     exercise of the Executive Director's authority.'' This \n     commenter further took issue with the distinction made in the \n     rule between approval of the withdrawal of a complaint by a \n     covered employee, which must always be approved by a Hearing \n     Officer, and the withdrawal of a complaint by the General \n     Counsel, which may occur without Hearing Officer approval \n     prior to the opening of a hearing.\n       Contrary to the commenter's assertion, it is entirely \n     appropriate and, indeed, the norm in our legal system to \n     require approval of the withdrawal of an action after formal \n     proceedings have been initiated. See, e.g., Federal Rule of \n     Civil Procedure 41. Moreover, the different restrictions \n     placed on covered employees and the General Counsel are also \n     appropriate. Under section 220 of the CAA, and the \n     regulations adopted by the Board pursuant to section 220(d) \n     to implement section 220, the General Counsel's prosecutorial \n     discretion has been properly acknowledged by permitting the \n     General Counsel to withdraw a complaint without Hearing \n     Officer approval prior to the opening of the hearing. \n     Accordingly, the final rule, as adopted and approved, has not \n     been modified.\n\n                F. Objections not made are deemed waived\n\n       Two commenters expressed the concern that proposed section \n     7.01(e) could operate to work a disservice to unrepresented \n     parties or to preclude Board consideration of appropriate \n     matters on appeal.\n       The rule, as adopted and approved, has been modified. \n     Further, it is noted that a Hearing Officer is always free to \n     consider issues about which objections were not made.\n\n                           G. Reconsideration\n\n       One commenter asked that proposed section 8.02 be clarified \n     to advise parties concerning how the filing of a motion for \n     reconsideration of a Board decision affects the requirements \n     for filing an appeal of that decision.\n       The final rule makes clear that the filing of a motion for \n     reconsideration does not relieve a party of the obligation to \n     file a timely appeal.\n\n                           H. Judicial review\n\n       One commenter asserted that section 8.04 should be deleted \n     either as superfluous because it merely reiterates parts of \n     section 407 of the CAA or as confusing because it does not \n     incorporate all of section 407.\n       Section 8.04 incorporates the provisions of section 407 \n     that are applicable to the provisions of the CAA that are \n     currently in effect. As section 8.04 is neither superfluous \n     nor confusing, the proposed rule has been adopted and \n     approved unmodified.\n\nI. Signing of Pleadings, motions and other filings; violation of rules; \n                               sanctions\n\n       One commenter recommended that ``the Board further \n     elaborate'' on proposed section 9.02 and that there be an \n     extension of time to comment ``after the Board provides \n     further explanation.'' In the event the commenter's \n     recommendation was not accepted, the commenter proposed \n     adding the requirement that a pleading must be warranted by a \n     ``non-frivolous'' argument. Another commenter objected to the \n     possible sanction of attorney s fees, arguing that it could \n     have a chilling effect on individual complainants.\n       Section 9.02 of the rules is virtually identical to Rule 11 \n     of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 11 has a rich \n     history and tradition and is an essential procedural part of \n     any sound dispute resolution scheme. Therefore, further \n     explanation or modification is unnecessary and, the rule, as \n     adopted and approved, is the same as that proposed.\n\n                       J. Ex parte communications\n\n       Two commenters asked for a definition of the term \n     ``interested person'' as used in proposed section 9.04. One \n     of these commenters argued that, as drafted, the proposed \n     rule appeared to be so broad as to restrict access to the \n     Office of Compliance personnel, including the Executive \n     Director and Deputy Executive Directors. The same two \n     commenters also urged the deletion of proposed section \n     9.04(e)(2), which provides that censure or the suspension or \n     revocation of the privilege of practice before the Office is \n     a possible sanction for engaging in prohibited \n     communications. Both commenters considered such sanctions to \n     be too harsh and questioned the authority of the Board to \n     impose such sanctions. The third commenter urged that section \n     9.04(c)(3)(iii) be modified to disallow communications on \n     matters of general significance because, according to the \n     commenter, such communications could have an impact on \n     specific pending matters. This commenter also expressed \n     concern about the imposition of sanctions on unrepresented \n     complainants who might inadvertently violate the prohibitions \n     on ex parte communications.\n       In response to the commenters' concerns, the Executive \n     Director is modifying section 9.04(a)(1) to define \n     ``interested person'' for the purposes of the rule. But, \n     contrary to one commenter s understanding, the rule only \n     prohibits interested persons from engaging in prohibited \n     communications with Hearing Officers and Board members; \n     nothing in the proposed or adopted rule prohibits contact \n     with Office of Compliance personnel, including the Office's \n     statutory appointees. Indeed, interaction between Office \n     personnel and employing offices, covered employees, labor \n     organizations and their agents, as well as other interested \n     individuals or organizations, is encouraged.\n       With respect to proposed section 9.04(e)(2), the sanctions \n     of censure or suspension or revocation of the privilege of \n     practice before the Board, although substantial, may properly \n     be imposed in certain circumstances. However, as they are \n     available to the Board under section 9.04(e)(1), proposed \n     section 9.04(e)(2) has been omitted from the final rule. In \n     addition, to further address concerns, language has been \n     added to section 9.04(e)(1) to confirm that sanctions shall \n     be commensurate with the nature of the offense.\n\n           K. Informal resolutions and settlement agreements\n\n       One commenter offered specific suggested revisions to \n     proposed section 9.05(a). The commenter believed that these \n     revisions are necessary to make it clear that section 9.05 \n     applies only after a covered employee has initiated \n     counseling.\n       The proposed rule, by its terms, applies only in instances \n     where a covered employee has filed a formal request for \n     counseling. Moreover, in the NPR, it was specifically noted \n     that the rule is being amended to make it clear that section \n     9.05 of the rules applies only where covered employees have \n     initiated proceedings under the CAA. Accordingly, the \n     proposed rule has been adopted and approved without \n     modification.\n\n                         L. Additional comments\n\n       Two of the commenters also offered several comments and \n     suggestions on existing procedural rules and other matters \n     that were not the subject of or germane to the proposals in \n     the NPR. For example, the commenters suggested: (1) changes \n     in the special procedures for the Architect of the Capitol \n     and Capitol Police; (2) a rule allowing parties to negotiate \n     changes to the Agreement to Mediate; (3) a procedure by which \n     the parties, instead of the Executive Director, would select \n     Hearing Officers; (4) procedures by which the Office would \n     notify employing offices of various matters; (5) additional \n     requirements for the filing of a complaint; (6) changes in \n     counseling procedures; and (7) a procedure which would allow \n     parties to petition for the recusal of individual Board \n     members.\n       As there was no notice given to the public or interested \n     persons that such amendments to the procedural rules were \n     being considered, it would be inappropriate to amend the \n     rules in the manner requested by the commenters. However, the \n     Office will consider the comments as part of its ongoing \n     review of its operations and, to the extent appropriate, may \n     issue another notice of proposed rulemaking at an appropriate \n     time to address some or all of these comments.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 18th day of September, \n     1996.\n\n                                           R.

The \n     rules include procedures for counseling, mediation, and for \n     electing between filing a complaint with the Office of \n     Compliance and filing a civil action in a district court of \n     the United States. The rules also address the procedures for \n     the conduct of hearings held as a result of the filing of a \n     complaint and for appeals to the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well \n     as other matters of general applicability to the dispute \n     resolution process and to the operations of the Office of \n     Compliance. It is the policy of the Office that these rules \n     shall be applied with due regard to the rights of all parties \n     and in a manner that expedites the resolution of disputes.\n     Sec. 1.02(c)\n       Employee. The term employee includes an applicant for \n     employment and a former employee, except as provided in \n     section 2421.3(b) of the Board s rules under section 220 of \n     the Act.\n     Sec. 1.02(i)\n       Party. The term party means: (1) the employee or the \n     employing office in a proceeding under Part A of title II of \n     the Act; or (2) the labor organization, individual employing \n     office or employing activity, or, as appropriate, the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part D of title II of the \n     Act.\n     Sec. 1.02(j)\n       Respondent. The term ``respondent'' means the party against \n     which a complaint is filed.\n     Sec. 1.05 Designation of Representative.\n       (a) An employee, a witness, a labor organization, or an \n     employing office wishing to be represented by another \n     individual must file with the Office a written notice of \n     designation of representative. The representative may be, but \n     is not required to be, an attorney.\n       (b) Service where there is a representative. All service of \n     documents shall be directed to the representative, unless the \n     represented individual, labor organization, or employing \n     office specifies otherwise and until such time as that \n     individual, labor organization, or employing office notifies \n     the Executive Director of an amendment or revocation of the \n     designation of representative. Where a designation of \n     representative is in effect, all time limitations for receipt \n     of materials by the represented individual or entity shall be \n     computed in the same manner as for unrepresented individuals \n     or entities with service of the documents, however, directed \n     to the representative, as provided.\n     Sec. 1.07(b)\n       Prohibition. Unless specifically authorized by the \n     provisions of the CAA or by order of the Board, the Hearing \n     Officer or a court, or by the procedural rules of the Office, \n     no participant in counseling, mediation or other proceedings \n     made confidential under section 416 of the CAA \n     (``confidential proceedings'') may disclose the contents or \n     records of those proceedings to any person or entity. Nothing \n     in these rules prohibits a bona fide representative of a \n     party under section 1.05 from engaging in communications with \n     that party for the purpose of participation in the \n     proceedings, provided that such disclosure is not made in the \n     presence of individuals not reasonably necessary to the \n     representative's representation of that party. Moreover, \n     nothing in these rules prohibits a party or its \n     representative from disclosing information obtained in \n     confidential proceedings for the limited purposes of \n     investigating claims, ensuring compliance with the Act or \n     preparing its prosecution or defense, to the extent that such \n     disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the \n     aforementioned purposes and provided that the party making \n     the disclosure takes all reasonably appropriate steps to \n     ensure that persons to whom the information is disclosed \n     maintain the confidentiality of such information.\n     Sec. 1.07(c)\n       Participant. For the purposes of this rule, participant \n     means any individual or party, including a designated \n     representative, that becomes a participant in counseling \n     under section 402, mediation under section 403, the complaint \n     and hearing process under section 405, or an appeal to the \n     Board under section 406 of the Act, or any related proceeding \n     which is expressly or by necessity deemed confidential under \n     the Act or these rules.\n     Sec. 1.07(d)\n       Contents or records of confidential proceedings. For the \n     purpose of this rule, the contents or records of counseling, \n     mediation or other proceeding includes the information \n     disclosed by participants to the proceedings, and records \n     disclosed by either the opposing party, witnesses or the \n     Office. A participant is free to disclose facts and other \n     information obtained from any source outside of the \n     confidential proceedings. For example, an employing office or \n     its representatives may disclose information about its \n     employment practices and personnel actions, provided that \n     the information was not obtained in a confidential \n     proceeding. However, an employee who obtains that \n     information in mediation or other confidential proceeding \n     may not disclose such information. Similarly, information \n     forming the basis for the allegation of a complaining \n     employee may be disclosed by that employee, provided that \n     the information contained in those allegations was not \n     obtained in a confidential proceeding. However, the \n     employing office or its representatives may not disclose \n     that information if it was obtained in a confidential \n     proceeding.\n     Sec. 2.04(a)\n       (a) Explanation. Mediation is a process in which employees, \n     employing offices and their representatives, if any, meet \n     separately and/or jointly with a neutral trained to assist \n     them in resolving disputes. As parties to the mediation, \n     employees, employing offices and their representatives \n     discuss alternatives to continuing their dispute, including \n     the possibility of reaching a voluntary, mutually \n     satisfactory resolution. The neutral has no power to impose a \n     specific resolution, and the mediation process, whether or \n     not a resolution is reached, is strictly confidential, \n     pursuant to section 416 of the Act.\n     Sec. 2.04(e)\n       (e) Duration and Extension. (1) The mediation period shall \n     be 30 days beginning on the date the request for mediation is \n     received, unless the Office grants an extension.\n       (2) The Office may extend the mediation period upon the \n     joint request of the parties. The request may be oral or \n     written and shall be noted and filed with the Office no later \n     than the last day of the mediation period. The request shall \n     set forth the joint nature of the request and the reasons \n     therefor, and specify when the parties expect to conclude \n     their discussions. Requests for additional extensions may be \n     made in the same manner. Approval of any extensions shall be \n     within the sole discretion of the Office.\n     Sec. 2.04(f)(2)\n       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the \n     mediation, the neutral will ask the parties to sign an \n     agreement prepared by the Office (``the Agreement to \n     Mediate''). The Agreement to Mediate will set out the \n     conditions under which mediation will occur, including the \n     requirement that the participants adhere to the \n     confidentiality of the process. The Agreement to Mediate will \n     also provide that the parties to the mediation will not seek \n     to have the counselor or the neutral participate, testify or \n     otherwise present evidence in any subsequent civil action \n     under section 408 of the Act or any other proceeding.\n     Sec. 2.04(h)\n       Informal Resolutions and Settlement Agreements. At any time \n     during mediation the parties may resolve or settle a dispute \n     in accordance with section 9.05 of these rules.\n     Sec. 5.01 Complaints\n       (a) Who may file. (1) An employee who has completed \n     mediation under section 2.04 may timely file a complaint with \n     the Office alleging any violation of sections 201 through 207 \n     of the Act.\n       (2) The General Counsel may file a complaint alleging a \n     violation of section 220 of the Act.\n       (b) When to file. (1) A complaint may be filed by an \n     employee no sooner than 30 days after the date of receipt of \n     the notice under section 2.04(i), but no later than 90 days \n     after receipt of that notice.\n       (2) A complaint may be filed by the General Counsel after \n     the investigation of a charge filed under section 220 of the \n     Act.\n       (c) Form and Contents. (1) Complaints filed by covered \n     employees. A complaint shall be written or typed on a \n     complaint form available from the Office. All complaints \n     shall be signed by the covered employee, or his or her \n     representative, and shall contain the following information:\n       (i) the name, mailing address, and telephone number(s) of \n     the complainant;\n       (ii) the name, address and telephone number of the \n     employing office against which the complaint is brought;\n       (iii) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s) \n     involved in the conduct that the employee claims is a \n     violation of the Act;\n       (iv) a description of the conduct being challenged, \n     including the date(s) of the conduct;\n       (v) a brief description of why the complainant believes the \n     challenged conduct is a violation of the Act and the \n     section(s) of the Act involved;\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\n       (vi) a statement of the relief or remedy sought; and\n       (vii) the name, address, and telephone number of the \n     representative, if any, who will act on behalf of the \n     complainant.\n       (2) Complaints filed by the General Counsel. A complaint \n     filed by the General Counsel shall be typed, signed by the \n     General Counsel or his designee and shall contain the \n     following information:\n       (i) the name, address and telephone number of the employing \n     office and/or labor organization alleged to have violated \n     section 220 against which the complaint is brought;\n       (ii) notice of the charge filed alleging a violation of \n     section 220;\n       (iii) a description of the acts and conduct that are \n     alleged to be violations of the Act, including all relevant \n     dates and places and the names and titles of the responsible \n     individuals; and\n       (iv) a statement of the relief or remedy sought.\n       (d) Amendments. Amendments to the complaint may be \n     permitted by the Office or, after assignment, by a Hearing \n     Officer, on the following conditions: that all parties to the \n     proceeding have adequate notice to prepare to meet the new \n     allegations; that the amendments, as appropriate, relate to \n     the violations for which the employee has completed \n     counseling and mediation, or relate to the charge(s) \n     investigated by the General Counsel; and that permitting such \n     amendments will not unduly prejudice the rights of the \n     employing office, the labor organization, or other parties, \n     unduly delay the completion of the hearing or otherwise \n     interfere with or impede the proceedings.\n       (e) Service of Complaint. Upon receipt of a complaint or an \n     amended complaint, the Office shall serve the respondent, or \n     its designated representative, by hand delivery or certified \n     mail, with a copy of the complaint or amended complaint and a \n     copy of these rules. The Office shall include a service list \n     containing the names and addresses of the parties and their \n     designated representatives.\n       (f) Answer. Within 15 days after receipt of a copy of a \n     complaint or an amended complaint, the respondent shall file \n     an answer with the Office and serve one copy on the \n     complainant. The answer shall contain a statement of the \n     position of the respondent on each of the issues raised in \n     the complaint or amended complaint, including admissions, \n     denials, or explanations of each allegation made in the \n     complaint and any affirmative defenses or other defenses \n     to the complaint.\n       Failure to file an answer or to raise a claim or defense as \n     to any allegation(s) shall constitute an admission of such \n     allegation(s). Affirmative defenses not raised in an answer \n     that could have reasonably been anticipated based on the \n     facts alleged in the complaint shall be deemed waived. A \n     respondent's motion for leave to amend an answer to interpose \n     a denial or affirmative defense will ordinarily be granted \n     unless to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the \n     other party or unduly delay or otherwise interfere with or \n     impede the proceedings.\n     Sec. 5.03 Dismissal of complaints\n       (a) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss any claim that the Hearing Officer finds \n     to be frivolous or that fails to state a claim upon which \n     relief may be granted, including, but not limited to, claims \n     that were not advanced in counseling or mediation.\n       (b) A Hearing Officer may, after notice and an opportunity \n     to respond, dismiss a complaint because it fails to comply \n     with the applicable time limits or other requirements under \n     the Act or these rules.\n       (c) If the General Counsel or any complainant fails to \n     proceed with an action, the Hearing Officer may dismiss the \n     complaint with prejudice.\n       (d) Appeal. A dismissal by the Hearing Officer made under \n     section 5.03(a)-(c) or 7.16 of these rules may be subject to \n     appeal before the Board if the aggrieved party files a timely \n     petition for review under section 8.01.\n       (e) Withdrawal of Complaint by Complainant. At any time a \n     complainant may withdraw his or her own complaint by filing a \n     notice with the Office for transmittal to the Hearing Officer \n     and by serving a copy on the employing office or \n     representative. Any such withdrawal must be approved by the \n     Hearing Officer.\n       (f) Withdrawal of Complaint by the General Counsel. At any \n     time prior to the opening of the hearing the General Counsel \n     may withdraw his complaint by filing a notice with the \n     Executive Director and the Hearing Officer and by serving a \n     copy on the respondent. After opening of the hearing, any \n     such withdrawal must be approved by the Hearing Officer.\n     Sec. 7.04(b)\n       Scheduling of the Prehearing Conference. Within 7 days \n     after assignment, the Hearing Officer shall serve on the \n     parties and their designated representatives written notice \n     setting forth the time, date, and place of the prehearing \n     conference.\n     Sec. 7.07(e)\n       (e) Any evidentiary objection not timely made before a \n     Hearing Officer shall, in the absence of clear error, be \n     deemed waived on appeal to the Board.\n     Sec. 7.07(f)\n       (f) If the Hearing Officer concludes that a representative \n     of an employee, a witness, a labor organization, or an \n     employing office has a conflict of interest, he or she may, \n     after giving the representative an opportunity to respond, \n     disqualify the representative. In that event, within the time \n     limits for hearing and decision established by the Act, the \n     affected party will have a reasonable time to retain other \n     representation.\n     Sec. 8.01(i)\n       The Board may invite amicus participation, in appropriate \n     circumstances, in a manner consistent with the requirements \n     of section 416 of the CAA.\n     Sec. 8.02 Reconsideration\n       After a final decision or order of the Board has been \n     issued, a party to the proceeding before the Board, who can \n     establish in its moving papers that reconsideration is \n     necessary because the Board has overlooked or misapprehended \n     points of law or fact, may move for reconsideration of such \n     final decision or order. The motion shall be filed within 15 \n     days after service of the Board's decision or order. No \n     response shall be filed unless the Board so orders. The \n     filing and pendency of a motion under this provision shall \n     not relieve a party of the obligation to file a timely appeal \n     or operate to stay the action of the Board unless so ordered \n     by the Board.\n     Sec. 8.04 Judicial review\n       Pursuant to section 407 of the Act,\n       (a) the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal \n     Circuit shall have jurisdiction over any proceeding commenced \n     by a petition of:\n       (1) a party aggrieved by a final decision of the Board \n     under section 406(e) in cases arising under part A of title \n     II, or\n       (2) the General Counsel or a respondent before the Board \n     who files a petition under section 220(c)(3) of the Act.\n       (b) The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall \n     have jurisdiction over any petition of the General Counsel, \n     filed in the name of the Office and at the direction of the \n     Board, to enforce a final decision under section 405(g) or \n     406(e) with respect to a violation of part A or D of title II \n     of the Act.\n       (c) The party filing a petition for review shall serve a \n     copy on the opposing party or parties or their \n     representative(s).\n     Sec. 9.02 Signing of pleadings, motions and other filings; \n         violation of rules; sanctions\n       Every pleading, motion, and other filing of a party \n     represented by an attorney or other designated representative \n     shall be signed by the attorney or representative. A party \n     who is not represented shall sign the pleading, motion or \n     other filing. The signature of a representative or party \n     constitutes a certificate by the signer that the signer has \n     read the pleading, motion, or other filing; that to the best \n     of the signer's knowledge, information, and belief formed \n     after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is \n     warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the \n     extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and \n     that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as \n     to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase \n     in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other \n     filing is not signed, it shall be stricken unless it is \n     signed promptly after the omission is called to the attention \n     of the person who is required to sign. If a pleading, motion, \n     or other filing is signed in violation of this rule, a \n     Hearing Officer or the Board, as appropriate, upon motion or \n     upon its own initiative, shall impose upon the person who \n     signed it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate \n     sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other \n     party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses \n     incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or \n     other filing, including a reasonable attorney's fee. A \n     Hearing Officer or the Board, as appropriate, upon motion or \n     its own initiative may also impose an appropriate sanction, \n     which may include the sanctions specified in section 7.02, \n     for any other violation of these rules that does not \n     result from reasonable error.\n     Sec. 9.04 Ex parte communications.\n       (a) Definitions. (1) The term interested person outside the \n     Office means any covered employee and agent thereof who is \n     not an employee or agent of the Office, any labor \n     organization and agent thereof, any employing office and \n     agent thereof, and any individual or organization and agent \n     thereof, who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved \n     in a proceeding or a rulemaking, and the General Counsel and \n     any agent thereof when prosecuting a complaint proceeding \n     before the Office pursuant to sections 210, 215, or 220 of \n     the CAA. The term also includes any employee of the Office \n     who becomes a party or a witness for a party other than the \n     Office in proceedings as defined in these rules.\n       (2) The term ex parte communication means an oral or \n     written communication (a) that is between an interested \n     person outside the Office and a Board member or Hearing \n     Officer who is or may reasonably be expected to be involved \n     in a proceeding or a rulemaking; (b) that is related to a \n     proceeding or a rulemaking; (c) that is not made on the \n     public record; (d) that is not made in the presence of all \n     parties to a proceeding or a rulemaking; and (5) that is made \n     without reasonable prior notice to all parties to a \n     proceeding or a rulemaking.\n       (3) For purposes of section 9.04, the term proceeding means \n     the complaint and hearing proceeding under section 405 of the \n     CAA, an appeal to the Board under section 406 of the CAA, a \n     pre-election investigatory hearing under section 220 of the \n     CAA, and any other proceeding of the Office established \n     pursuant to regulations issued by the Board under the CAA.\n       (4) The term period of rulemaking means the period \n     commencing with the issuance of an\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\n     advance notice of proposed rulemaking or of a notice of \n     proposed rulemaking, whichever issues first, and concluding \n     with the issuance of a final rule.\n       (b) Exception to Coverage. The rules set forth in this \n     section do not apply during periods that the Board designates \n     as periods of negotiated rulemaking.\n       (c) Prohibited Ex Parte Communications and Exceptions. (1) \n     During a proceeding, it is prohibited knowingly to make or \n     cause to be made:\n       (i) a written ex parte communication if copies thereof are \n     not promptly served by the communicator on all parties to the \n     proceeding in accordance with section 9.01 of these Rules; or\n       (ii) an oral ex parte communication unless all parties have \n     received advance notice thereof by the communicator and have \n     an adequate opportunity to be present.\n       (2) During the period of rulemaking, it is prohibited \n     knowingly to make or cause to be made a written or an oral ex \n     parte communication. During the period of rulemaking, the \n     Office shall treat any written ex parte communication as a \n     comment in response to the advance notice of proposed \n     rulemaking or the notice of proposed rulemaking, whichever is \n     pending, and such communications will therefore be part of \n     the public rulemaking record.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the prohibitions set forth in (1) and \n     (2), the following ex parte communications are not \n     prohibited:\n       (i) those which relate solely to matters which the Board \n     member or Hearing Officer is authorized by law, Office rules, \n     or order of the Board or Hearing Officer to entertain or \n     dispose of on an ex parte basis;\n       (ii) those which all parties to the proceeding agree, or \n     which the responsible official formally rules, may be made on \n     an ex parte basis;\n       (iii) those which concern only matters of general \n     significance to the field of labor and employment law or \n     administrative practice;\n       (iv) those from the General Counsel to the Office or the \n     Board when the General Counsel is acting on behalf of the \n     Office or the Board under any section of the CAA; and\n       (v) those which could not reasonably be construed to create \n     either unfairness or the appearance of unfairness in a \n     proceeding or rulemaking.\n       (4) It is prohibited knowingly to solicit or cause to be \n     solicited any prohibited ex parte communication.\n       (d) Reporting of Prohibited Ex Parte Communications. (1) \n     Any Board member or Hearing Officer who is or may reasonably \n     be expected to be involved in a proceeding or a rulemaking \n     and who determines that he or she is being asked to receive a \n     prohibited ex parte communication shall refuse to do so and \n     inform the communicator of this rule.\n       (2) Any Board member or Hearing Officer who is or may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding who \n     knowingly receives a prohibited ex parte communication shall \n     (a) notify the parties to the proceeding that such a \n     communication has been received; and (b) provide the parties \n     with a copy of the communication and of any response thereto \n     (if written) or with a memorandum stating the substance of \n     the communication and any response thereto (if oral). If a \n     proceeding is then pending before either the Board or a \n     Hearing Officer, and if the Board or Hearing Officer so \n     orders, these materials shall then be placed in the record of \n     the proceeding. Upon order of the Hearing Officer or the \n     Board, the parties may be provided with a full opportunity to \n     respond to the alleged prohibited ex parte communication and \n     to address what action, if any, should be taken in the \n     proceeding as a result of the prohibited communication.\n       (3) Any Board member involved in a rulemaking who knowingly \n     receives a prohibited ex parte communication shall cause to \n     be published in the Congressional Record a notice that such a \n     communication has been received and a copy of the \n     communication and of any response thereto (if written) or \n     with a memorandum stating the substance of the communication \n     and any response thereto (if oral). Upon order of the Board, \n     these materials shall then be placed in the record of the \n     rulemaking and the Board shall provide interested persons \n     with a full opportunity to respond to the alleged prohibited \n     ex parte communication and to address what action, if any, \n     should be taken in the proceeding as a result of the \n     prohibited communication.\n       (4) Any Board member or Hearing Officer who is or may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding or a \n     rulemaking and who knowingly receives a prohibited ex parte \n     communication and who fails to comply with the requirements \n     of subsections (1), (2), or (3) above, is subject to internal \n     censure or discipline through the same procedures that the \n     Board utilizes to address and resolve ethical issues.\n       (e) Penalties and Enforcement. (1) Where a person is \n     alleged to have made or caused another to make a prohibited \n     ex parte communication, the Board or the Hearing Officer (as \n     appropriate) may issue to the person a notice to show cause, \n     returnable within a stated period not less than seven days \n     from the date thereof, why the Board or the Hearing Officer \n     should not determine that the interests of law or justice \n     require that the person be sanctioned by, where applicable, \n     dismissal of his or her claim or interest, the striking of \n     his or her answer, or the imposition of some other \n     appropriate sanction, including but not limited to the award \n     of attorneys' fees and costs incurred in responding to a \n     prohibited ex parte communication. Sanctions shall be \n     commensurate with the seriousness and unreasonableness of the \n     offense, accounting for, among other things, the advertency \n     or inadvertency of the prohibited communication.\n       (2) Any Board member or Hearing Officer who is or may \n     reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding or a \n     rulemaking and who knowingly makes or causes to be made a \n     prohibited ex parte communication is subject to internal \n     censure or discipline through the same procedures that the \n     Board utilizes to address and resolve ethical issues.\n     Sec. 9.05(a)\n       (a) Informal Resolution. At any time before a covered \n     employee who has filed a formal request for counseling files \n     a complaint under section 405, a covered employee and the \n     employing office, on their own, may agree voluntarily and \n     informally to resolve a dispute, so long as the resolution \n     does not require a waiver of a covered employee's rights or \n     the commitment by the employing office to an enforceable \n     obligation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S10980-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10984-S11027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, pursuant to section 304(b) of the \nCongressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. sec. 1384(b)), a \nnotice of proposed rulemaking was submitted by the Office of \nCompliance, U.S. Congress. The notice publishes proposed regulations to \nimplement section 210 and section 215 of the Congressional \nAccountability Act of 1995.\n  Section 210 concerns the extension of rights and protections under \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 relating to public services \nand accommodations. Section 215 concerns the extension of rights and \nprotections under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the notice \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the notice was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n     Extension of Rights and Protections Under the Americans With \nDisabilities Act of 1990 Relating to Public Services and Accommodations\n\n\n                     notice of proposed rulemaking\n\n       Summary: The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     is publishing proposed regulations to implement Section 210 \n     of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, as applied to covered entities of \n     the House of Representatives, the Senate, and certain \n     Congressional instrumentalities listed below.\n       The CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment and public access statutes to covered entities \n     within the Legislative Branch. Section 210(b) provides that \n     the rights and protections against discrimination in the \n     provision of public services and accommodations established \n     by sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309 of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'') \n     shall apply to certain covered entities. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b). The above provisions of section 210 are \n     effective on January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h).\n       In addition to inviting comment in this Notice, the Board, \n     through the statutory appointees of the Office, sought \n     consultation with the Department of Justice and the Secretary \n     of Transportation regarding the development of these \n     regulations in accordance with section 304(g)(2) of the CAA. \n     The Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and the \n     Department of Transportation provided helpful comments and \n     assistance during the development of these regulations. The \n     Board also notes that the General Counsel of the Office of \n     Compliance has completed an inspection of all covered \n     facilities for compliance with disability access standards \n     under section 210 of the CAA and has submitted his final \n     report to Congress. Based on information gleaned from these \n     consultations and the experience gained from the General \n     Counsel's inspections, the Board is publishing these proposed \n     regulations, pursuant to section 210(e) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(e).\n       The purpose of these regulations is to implement section \n     210 of the CAA. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPRM'' or ``Notice'') the Board proposes that virtually \n     identical regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the seven Congressional \n     instrumentalities. Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in \n     this Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to entities within the Senate, and this proposal \n     regarding the Senate entities is recommended by the Office of \n     Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this Notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to entities within the \n     House of Representatives, and this proposal\n\n[[Page S10985]]\n\n     regarding the House of Representatives entities is \n     recommended by the Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this Notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Capitol Guide Service, the Capitol Police, the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     the Office of the Attending Physician, and the Office of \n     Compliance; and this proposal regarding these six \n     Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance s Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999.

Sec. Sec. 1301-1438. In general, the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     and public access statutes to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       Section 210(b) provides that the rights and protections \n     against discrimination in the provision of public services \n     and accommodations established by the provisions of Titles II \n     and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'') \n     shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Service;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n\n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b).\n       Title II of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on \n     the basis of disability in the provision of services, \n     programs, or activities by any ``public entity''. Section \n     210(b)(2) of the CAA defines the term ``public entity'' for \n     Title II purposes as any entity listed above that provides \n     public services, programs, or activities. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(b)(2).\n       Title III of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on \n     the basis of disability by public accommodations and requires \n     places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to \n     be designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and report to Congress on compliance with \n     disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance established under the CAA to \n     issue regulations implementing the section. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further \n     provides that the regulations shall include a method of \n     identifying, for purposes of this section and for different \n     categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).\n       In developing these proposed regulations, a number of \n     issues have been identified and explored. The Board has \n     proposed to resolve these issues as described below.\n\n                             A. In general\n\n       1. Public services and accommodations regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation that the board will adopt under section 210(e) \n     of the CAA.--Section 210(e) requires the Board to issue \n     regulations that are the same as ``substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred \n     to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may \n     determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the \n     regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).\n       Consistent with its prior decisions on this issue, the \n     Board has determined that all regulations promulgated after a \n     notice and comment by the Attorney General and/or the \n     Secretary of Transportation to implement the provisions of \n     Title II and Title III of the ADA applied by section 210(b) \n     of the CAA are ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning \n     of section 210(e). See, e.g., 142 Cong.Rec. S5070, S5071-72 \n     (daily ed. May 15, 1996) (NPRM implementing section 220(d) \n     regulations); 141 Cong. Rec. S17605 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) \n     (NPRM implementing section 203 regulations). See also Reves \n     v. Ernst & Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 1169 (1993) (where same \n     phrase or term is used in two different places in the same \n     statute, it is reasonable for court to give each use a \n     similar construction); Sorenson v. Secretary of the Treasury, \n     475 U.S. 851, 860 (1986) (normal rule of statutory \n     construction assumes that identical words in different parts \n     of the same act are intended to have the same meaning).\n       In this regard, the Board has reviewed the provisions of \n     section 210 of the CAA, the sections of the ADA applied by \n     that section, and the regulations of the Attorney General \n     and the Secretary of Transportation, to determine whether \n     and to what extent those regulations are substantive \n     regulations which implement the provisions of Title II and \n     Title III of the ADA applied by section 210(b) of the CAA. \n     As explained more fully below, the Board proposes to adopt \n     the following otherwise applicable regulations of the \n     Attorney General published at Parts 35 and 36 of Title 28 \n     of the Code of Federal Regulations (``CFR'') and those of \n     the Secretary of Transportation published at Parts 37 and \n     38 of Title 49 of the CFR:\n       1. Attorney General's regulations at Part 35 of Title 28 of \n     the CFR: The Attorney General's regulations at Part 35 \n     implement subtitle A of Title II of the ADA (sections 201 \n     through 205), the rights and protections of which are applied \n     to covered entities under section 210(b) of the CAA. See 28 \n     CFR Sec. 35.101 (Purpose). Therefore, the Board determines \n     that these regulations will be adopted in the proposed \n     regulations under section 210(e).\n       2. Attorney General's regulations at Part 36 of Title 28 of \n     the CFR: The Attorney General's regulations at Part 36 \n     implement Title III of the ADA (sections 301 through 309). \n     See 28 CFR Sec. 36.101 (Purpose). Section 210(b) only applies \n     the rights and protections of three sections of Title III \n     with respect to public accommodations: prohibitions against \n     discrimination (section 302), provisions regarding new \n     construction and alterations (section 303), and provisions \n     regarding examinations and courses (section 309). Therefore, \n     only those regulations in Part 36 that are reasonably \n     necessary to implement the statutory provisions of sections \n     302, 303, and 309 will be adopted by the Board under section \n     210(e) of the CAA.\n       3. Secretary of Transportation regulations at Parts 37 and \n     38 of Title 49 of the CFR: The Secretary's regulations at \n     Parts 37 and 38 implement the transportation provisions of \n     Title II and Title III of the ADA. See 49 CFR \n     Sec. Sec. 37.101 (Purpose) and 38.1 (Purpose). The provisions \n     of Title II and Title III of the ADA relating to \n     transportation and applied to covered entities by section \n     210(b) of the CAA are subtitle B of Title II (sections 221 \n     through 230) and certain portions of section 302 of Title \n     III. Thus, those regulations of the Secretary that are \n     reasonably necessary to implement the statutory provisions of \n     sections 221 through 230, 302, and 303 of the ADA will be \n     adopted by the Board under section 210(e) of the CAA.\n       The Board proposes not to adopt those regulatory provisions \n     of the regulations of the Attorney General or those of the \n     Secretary that have no conceivable applicability to \n     operations of entities within the Legislative Branch or are \n     unlikely to be invoked. See 141 Cong. Rec. at S17604 (daily \n     ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM implementing section 203 \n     regulations). Unless public comments demonstrate otherwise, \n     the Board intends to include in the adopted regulations a \n     provision stating that the Board has issued substantive \n     regulations on all matters for which section 210(e) requires \n     a regulation. See section 411 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1411.\n       In addition, the Board has proposed to make technical \n     changes in definitions and nomenclature so that the \n     regulations comport with the CAA and the organizational \n     structure of the Office of Compliance. In the Board's \n     judgment, making such changes satisfies the CAA's ``good \n     cause'' requirement. With the exception of these technical \n     and nomenclature changes, the Board does not propose \n     substantial departure from otherwise applicable Secretary's \n     regulations.\n       The Board notes that the General Counsel applied the above-\n     referenced standards of\n\n[[Page S10986]]\n\n     Parts 35 and 36 of the Attorney General's regulations and \n     Parts 37 and 38 of the Secretary's regulations during his \n     initial inspection of all Legislative Branch facilities \n     pursuant to section 210(f) of the CAA. In contrast to other \n     sections of the CAA, which generally give the Office \n     of Compliance only adjudicatory and regulatory \n     responsibilities, the General Counsel has the authority to \n     investigate and prosecute alleged violations of disability \n     standards under section 210, as well as the responsibility \n     for inspecting covered facilities to ensure compliance. \n     According to the General Counsel's final inspection \n     report, the Title II and Title III regulations encompass \n     the following requirements:\n       1. Program accessibility: This standard is applied to \n     ensure physical access to public programs, services, or \n     activities. Under this standard, covered entities must modify \n     policies, practices, and procedures to ensure an equal \n     opportunity for individuals with disabilities. If policy and \n     procedural modifications are ineffective, then structural \n     modifications may be required.\n       2. Effective communication: This standard requires covered \n     entities to make sure that their communications with \n     individuals with disabilities (such as in the context of \n     constituent meetings and committee hearings) are as effective \n     as their communications with others. Covered entities are \n     required to make information available in alternate formats \n     such as large print, Braille, or audio tape, or use methods \n     that provide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to \n     effectively communicate, such as sign language interpreters \n     or the use of pen and paper. Primary consideration must be \n     given to the method preferred by the individual. For \n     telecommunications, the use of text telephones (TTY's) or the \n     use of relay services is required.\n       3. ADA Standards for Accessible Design: These standards are \n     applied to architectural barriers, including structural \n     barriers to communication, such as telephone booths, to \n     ensure that existing facilities, new construction, and new \n     alterations, are accessible to individuals with disabilities.\n\n     See Inspection Report, App. A-3--A-4.\n       The Board recognizes that, as with other obligations under \n     the CAA, covered entities will need information and guidance \n     regarding compliance with these ADA standards as adopted in \n     these proposed regulations, which the Office will provide as \n     part of its education and information activities.\n       2. Modification of regulations of the Attorney General and \n     the Secretary.--The Board has considered whether and to what \n     extent it should modify otherwise applicable substantive \n     public service and accommodation standards of the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary. As the Board has noted in prior \n     rulemakings, the language and legislative history of the CAA \n     leads the Board to conclude that, absent clear statutory \n     language to the contrary, the Board should hew as closely as \n     possible to the text of otherwise applicable regulations \n     promulgated by the appropriate executive branch agency to \n     implement the statutory provisions applied to the Legislative \n     Branch by the CAA. See 142 Cong. Rec. S221, S222 (daily ed. \n     Jan. 22, 1996) (Notice of Adoption of Rules Implementing \n     Section 203 regulations) (``The CAA was intended not only to \n     bring covered employees the benefits of the . . . \n     incorporated laws, but also require Congress to experience \n     the same compliance burdens faced by other employers so that \n     it could more fairly legislate in this area.''). Thus, \n     consistent with its prior decisions, the Board proposes to \n     issue the regulations of the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary with only technical changes in the nomenclature and \n     deletion of those sections clearly inapplicable to the \n     Legislative Branch. See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S17603-S17604 \n     (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM implementing section 203 \n     regulations).\n       This conclusion is supported by the General Counsel's \n     inspection report, which applied the substantive public \n     service and accommodation standards to covered facilities in \n     the course of his initial inspections under section 210(f) of \n     the CAA. Specifically, there was nothing about the reported \n     condition of facilities within the Legislative Branch that \n     suggested that they were so different from comparable private \n     sector and state and local governmental facilities as to \n     require a public service and accommodations standard \n     different than those applied by the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary. See generally Gen. Couns., Off. Compliance, \n     ``Report on Initial Inspections of Facilities for \n     Compliance with Americans With Disability Act Standards \n     Under Section 210'' (1996) (``Disability Access Report''). \n     Thus, with the exception of nonsubstantive technical and \n     nomenclature changes, the Board proposes no departure from \n     the text of otherwise applicable portions of the \n     regulations of the Attorney General and those of the \n     Secretary.\n       3. Specific issues regarding the Attorney General's title \n     II regulations (part 35, 28 CFR).\n       a. Self-evaluation, notice, and designation of responsible \n     employee and adoption of grievance provisions (sections \n     35.105, 35.106, and 35.107).--Section 35.105 of the Attorney \n     General's regulations establishes a requirement that all \n     ``public entities'' evaluate their current policies and \n     practices to identify and correct any that are inconsistent \n     with accessibility requirements under the regulation. Those \n     that employ 50 or more persons are required to maintain the \n     self-evaluation on file and make it available for public \n     inspection for three years. This self-evaluation does not \n     cover activities covered by the Department of Transportation \n     regulations (implementing sections 221 through 230 of the \n     ADA). Section 35.106 requires a public entity to disseminate \n     sufficient information to applicants, participants, \n     beneficiaries, and other interested persons to inform them of \n     the rights and protections afforded by the ADA and the \n     regulations. Methods of providing this information include, \n     for example, the publication of information in handbooks, \n     manuals, and pamphlets that are distributed to the public and \n     that describe a public entity's programs and activities; the \n     display of informative posters in service centers and other \n     public places; or the broadcast of information by television \n     or radio. See 56 Fed. Reg. 35694, 35702 (July 26, 1991) \n     (preamble to final rule regarding Part 35). Section 35.107 \n     requires that public entities with 50 or more employees \n     designate a responsible employee and adopt grievance \n     procedures. This provision establishes an alternative dispute \n     resolution mechanism without requiring the complainant to \n     resort to legal complaint procedures under the ADA. However, \n     the complainant is not required to exhaust these procedures \n     before filing a complaint under the ADA. See 56 Fed. Reg. at \n     35702.\n       The Board has considered whether and to what extent it may \n     and should impose these recordkeeping, notice, and grievance \n     requirements on covered entities. In contrast to the \n     recordkeeping requirements of other laws applied by the CAA \n     (such as the Fair Labor Standards Act) which were not \n     included in sections of the laws applied to covered employees \n     and employing offices by the CAA, the recordkeeping, notice, \n     and grievance requirements in sections 35.105, 35.106, and \n     35.107 of the Attorney General's regulations implement \n     subtitle A of Title II of the ADA, which is applied to \n     covered entities under section 210(b) of the CAA. See 28 CFR \n     Sec. 35.101; see also 28 CFR, pt. 35, App. A at 456-57 \n     (section-by-section analysis). Thus, these regulations have \n     been included in the Board's proposed regulations. Compare \n     141 Cong. Rec. S17603, S17604 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) \n     (recordkeeping requirements of the FLSA not included within \n     the provisions applied by section 203 of the CAA cannot be \n     the subject of Board rulemaking), 142 Cong. Rec. S221, S222 \n     (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996) (Notice of Adoption of Regulations \n     Implementing Section 203) (same), and 141 Cong. Rec. S17628 \n     (same rationale regarding recordkeeping requirements of the \n     Family and Medical Leave Act) with 141 Cong. Rec. at 17657 \n     (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996) (recordkeeping requirements \n     included within portion of Employee Polygraph Protection Act \n     applied by section 204 of the CAA must be included within the \n     proposed rules).\n       The Board also retains the 50 employee cut-off for imposing \n     self-evaluation recordkeeping and grievance requirements on \n     covered entities. Given that state and local government \n     entities covered by Title II of the ADA have agencies of \n     comparable size to entities within the Legislative Branch, \n     the Board at present sees no reason to impose a different \n     threshold for such obligations. Therefore, these provisions \n     will be adopted as written, unless comments establish that \n     there is ``good cause'' for modification.\n       b. Retaliation or coercion (section 35.134).--Section \n     35.134 of the Attorney General's regulations implements \n     section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits retaliation against \n     any individual who exercises his or her rights under the ADA. \n     28 CFR pt. 35, App. A at 464 (section-by-section analysis). \n     Section 35.134 is not a provision which implements a right or \n     protection applied to covered entities under section 210(b) \n     of the CAA and, therefore, it will not be included within the \n     adopted regulations.\n       c. Employment discrimination provisions (section 35.140).--\n     Section 35.140 of the Attorney General's regulations \n     prohibits employment discrimination by covered public \n     entities. Section 35.140 implements Title II of the ADA, \n     which has been interpreted to apply to all activities of a \n     public entity, including employment. See 56 Fed. Reg. at \n     35707 (preamble to final rule regarding Part 35). However, \n     section 210(c) of the CAA states that, ``with respect to any \n     claim of employment discrimination asserted by any covered \n     employee, the exclusive remedy shall be under section 201 of \n     [the CAA].'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(c). The Board proposes to \n     adopt the employment discrimination provisions of section \n     35.140 as part of its regulations under section 210(e), and \n     also to add a statement that, pursuant to section 210(c) of \n     the CAA, section 201 of the CAA provides the exclusive remedy \n     for any such employment discrimination. In the Board's \n     judgment, making such a change satisfies the CAA's ``good \n     cause'' requirement.\n       d. Effective dates.--In several portions of Part 35 of the \n     Attorney General's regulations, references are made to dates \n     such as the effective date of the Part 35 regulations or \n     effective dates derived from the statutory provisions of the \n     ADA. See, e.g., 28 CFR Sec. Sec. 35.150(c), (d), and \n     35.151(a); see also 56 Fed. Reg. at 35710 (preamble to final \n     rule regarding Part 35). The Board proposes to substitute \n     dates which correspond to analogous periods for the purposes \n     of the CAA. In this way covered entities under section 210 \n     may have the same time to come into compliance relative to \n     the effective date of section 210 of the CAA afforded public \n     entities subject to Title II of the ADA. In the Board's \n     judgment, such changes satisfy the CAA's ``good cause'' \n     requirement.\n       e. Compliance procedures.--Subpart F of the Attorney \n     General's regulations (sections 35.170 through 35.189) set \n     forth administrative enforcement procedures under Title II.\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\n     Subpart F implements the provisions of section 203 of the \n     ADA, which is applied to covered entities under section 210 \n     of the CAA. Although procedural in nature, such provisions \n     address the remedies, procedures, and rights under section \n     203 of the ADA, and thus the otherwise applicable provisions \n     of these regulations are ``substantive regulations'' for \n     section 210(e) purposes. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S5071-72 \n     (similar analysis under section 220(d) of the CAA). However, \n     since section 303 reserves to the Executive Director the \n     authority to promulgate regulations that ``govern the \n     procedures of the Office,'' and since the Board believes that \n     the benefit of having one set of procedural rules provides \n     the ``good cause'' for modifying the Attorney General's \n     regulations, the Board proposes to incorporate the provisions \n     of Subpart F into the Office's procedural rules, to omit \n     provisions that set forth procedures which conflict with \n     express provisions of section 210 of the CAA or are \n     already provided for under comparable provisions of the \n     Office s rules, and to omit rules with no applicability to \n     the Legislative Branch (such as provisions covering \n     entities subject to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \n     provisions regarding State immunity, and provisions \n     regarding referral of complaints to the Justice \n     Department). See 142 Cong. Rec. at S5071-72 (similar \n     analysis and conclusion under section 220(d) of the CAA).\n       f. Designated agencies (Subpart G).--Subpart G of the \n     Attorney General's regulations designates the Federal \n     agencies responsible for investigating complaints under Title \n     II of the ADA. Given the structure of the CAA, such \n     provisions are not applicable to covered Legislative Branch \n     entities and, therefore, will not be adopted under section \n     210(e).\n       g. Appendix to Part 35.--The Board proposes not to adopt \n     Appendix A to Part 35, the section-by-section analysis of \n     Part 35. Since the Board has only adopted portions of the \n     Attorney General's Part 35 regulations and modified several \n     provisions to conform to the CAA, it does not appear \n     appropriate to include Appendix A. However, the Board notes \n     that the section-by-section analysis may have some relevance \n     to interpreting sections of Part 35 which the Board has \n     adopted without change.\n       4. Specific issues regarding the Attorney General's title \n     III regulations (part 36, 28 CFR).\n       a. ``Ownership'' or ``leasing'' of places of public \n     accommodation, landlord and tenant obligations (sections \n     36.104 and 36.201(b)).--In section 36.104 of the Attorney \n     General's regulations (Definitions), the term ``public \n     accommodations'' is defined as ``a private entity that owns, \n     leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public \n     accommodation.'' Section 36.201(b) delineates the respective \n     obligations of landlords and tenants under the ADA. It \n     provides that the landlord that owns the building that houses \n     the place of public accommodation, as well as the tenant that \n     owns or operates the place of public accommodation, are \n     public accommodations that have obligations under the \n     regulations. Section 36.201(b) further provides that, as \n     between the parties, allocation of responsibility for \n     compliance may be determined by lease or other contract. See \n     36 CFR, pt. 36, App. B at 593-94 (section-by-section \n     analysis).\n       On its face, these provisions do not apply to facilities \n     within the Legislative Branch. For example, covered entities \n     do not ``own'' the buildings or facilities housing a place of \n     public accommodation in the way that private entities do. \n     Similarly, the Board is unaware of any situations in which an \n     otherwise covered entity within the Legislative Branch may \n     ``lease'' its facilities to another Legislative Branch \n     entity. The only lease agreements of which the Board is aware \n     would be between otherwise covered entities and persons or \n     entities over which the CAA has no jurisdiction. For example, \n     the General Services Administration or a private building \n     owner may lease space to Congressional offices, but neither \n     entity would fall within the CAA's definition of a covered \n     entity.\n       Although the concepts of ``ownership'' or ``leasing'' do \n     not appear to apply to facilities within the Legislative \n     Branch, the Architect of the Capitol does have statutory \n     superintendence responsibility for certain legislative branch \n     buildings and facilities, including the Capitol Building, \n     which includes duties and responsibilities analogous to those \n     of a ``landlord''. See 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  163-166 (Capitol \n     Building), 167-175 and 185a (House and Senate office \n     buildings), 193a (Capitol grounds), and 216b (Botanical \n     Garden). As noted in section B.2 of this Notice, infra, the \n     concept of ``superintendence'' may be relevant to determining \n     whether an entity ``operates'' a place of public \n     accommodation within the meaning of section 210(b). Although \n     the provisions of section 36.201(b) of the Attorney General's \n     regulations are not directly applicable, the Board believes \n     that, where two or more entities may have compliance \n     obligations under section 210(b) as ``responsible entities'' \n     under the proposed regulations, those entities should have \n     the ability to allocate responsibility by agreement similar \n     to the case of landlords and tenants with respect to public \n     accommodations under Title III of the ADA. Thus, the proposed \n     regulations adopt such provisions modeled after section \n     36.201(b) of the Attorney General's regulations. However, by \n     promulgating this provision, the Board does not intend any \n     substantive change in the statutory responsibility of \n     entities under section 210(b) or the applicable substantive \n     rights and protections of the ADA applied thereunder. See 142 \n     Cong. Rec. at S270 (final rule under section 205 of the CAA \n     substitutes the term ``privatization'' for ``sale of \n     business'' in the Secretary of Labor's regulations under the \n     Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act).\n       b. Effective dates.--Section 36.401(a) of the Attorney \n     General's regulations provides generally that all facilities \n     designed and constructed for first occupancy later than \n     January 26, 1993 (30 months after the date of enactment of \n     the ADA) must be readily accessible to and usable by \n     individual with disabilities. Section 36.401 implements \n     section 303 of the ADA, which is applied to covered \n     facilities under section 210(b) of the CAA. Section 303 \n     provides the compliance date regarding new construction is 30 \n     months after the date of enactment. Consistent with its \n     resolution of a similar issue with respect to adoption of the \n     Attorney General's Title II regulations, the Board proposes \n     to substitute a date 30 months after the date of enactment of \n     section 210 of the CAA (i.e., July 23, 1997) in the places \n     that it appears in section 36.401(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(2)(i), \n     and (a)(2)(ii). In the Board's judgment, making such changes \n     satisfies the CAA's ``good cause'' requirement. Similarly, \n     the Board will substitute the effective date of section 210 \n     of the CAA (January 1, 1997) for the effective date of Titles \n     II and III of the ADA (July 26, 1992) wherever it appears in \n     sections 36.151, 36.401, 36.402, and 36.403 to give covered \n     entities the equivalent time benefits under the CAA that \n     public and private entities enjoyed prior to the effective \n     date of their obligations under the ADA. See 56 Fed. Reg. \n     7452, 7472 (Feb. 22, 1991) (preamble to NPRM regarding Part \n     36), and section 3.d. of this Notice (similar resolution of \n     issue under Part 35 regulations). Other dates contained in \n     these regulations are derived from the statutory provisions \n     of the ADA. The Board has determined there is ``good cause'' \n     to substitute dates that correspond to analogous periods for \n     the purposes of the CAA.\n       c. Retaliation or coercion (section 36.206).--Section \n     36.206 of the Attorney General's regulations implements \n     section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits retaliation against \n     any individual who exercises his or her rights under the ADA. \n     56 Fed. Reg. at 7462-63 (preamble to NPRM regarding Part 36); \n     28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 598 (section-by-section analysis). \n     Section 36.206 is not a provision which implements a right \n     or protection applied to covered entities under section \n     210(b) of the CAA and therefore will not be included \n     within the adopted regulations. The Board notes, however, \n     that section 207 of the CAA provides a comprehensive \n     retaliation protection for employees (including applicants \n     and former employees) who may invoke their rights under \n     section 210, although section 207 does not apply to \n     nonemployees who may enjoy rights and protections against \n     discrimination under section 210.\n       d. Places of public accommodations in private residences \n     (section 36.207).--Section 36.207 of the Attorney General's \n     regulations deals with the situation where all or part of a \n     home may be used to house a place of public accommodation. \n     See 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 599 (section-by-section \n     analysis). The Board takes notice that some Members of the \n     Congress may use all or part of their own residences as a \n     District or State office in which they may receive \n     constituents, conduct meetings, and other activities which \n     may result in the area being deemed a place of public \n     accommodation within the meaning of section 210 of the CAA. \n     Therefore, the Board proposes adoption of this provision.\n       e. Insurance provisions (section 36.212).--Section 36.212 \n     of the Attorney General's regulations restates section 501(c) \n     of the ADA, which provides that the ADA shall not be \n     construed to restrict certain insurance practices on the part \n     of insurance companies and employers, so long as such \n     practices are not used to evade the purposes of the ADA. See \n     56 Fed. Reg. at 7464-65 (preamble to NPRM regarding Part 36); \n     28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 603 (section-by-section analysis). \n     As a limitation on the scope of the rights and protections of \n     Title III of the ADA, these provisions may be applied under \n     the CAA. See section 225(f) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1361(f). Although section 36.212 appears intended \n     primarily to cover insurance companies, some of the terms of \n     its provisions may be broad enough to have applicability to \n     covered entities. Accordingly, the Board proposes to adopt, \n     with appropriate modifications, section 36.212.\n       f. Enforcement Procedures (Subpart E).--Subpart E of the \n     Attorney General's regulations (sections 36.501 through \n     36.599) set forth the enforcement procedures under Title III \n     of the ADA. As the Justice Department noted in its NPRM \n     regarding subpart E, the Department of Justice does not have \n     the authority to establish procedures for judicial review and \n     enforcement and, therefore, ``Subpart E generally restates \n     the statutory procedures for enforcement''. 28 CFR pt. 36, \n     App. B at 638 (section-by-section analysis). Additionally, \n     the regulations derive from the provisions of section 308 of \n     the ADA, which is not applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) of the CAA. Thus, the regulations in subpart E \n     are not promulgated by the Attorney General as substantive \n     regulations to implement the statutory provisions of the ADA \n     referred to in section 210(b), within the meaning of section \n     210(e).\n       g. Certification of State Laws or Local Building Codes \n     (subpart F).--Subpart F of the Attorney General's regulations \n     establishes procedures to implement section 308(b)(1)(A)(ii) \n     of the ADA regarding compliance with State laws or building \n     codes as evidence of compliance with accessibility standards \n     under the\n\n[[Page S10988]]\n\n     ADA. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 640 (section-by-section \n     analysis). Section 308 is not one of the laws applied to \n     covered entities under section 210(b) of the CAA and, \n     therefore, these regulations will not be adopted under \n     section 210(e).\n       h. Appendices to Part 36.--Part 36 of the Attorney \n     General's regulations includes two appendices, only one of \n     which the Board proposes to adopt as part of these \n     regulations. The Board proposes to adopt as an appendix to \n     these regulations Appendix A (ADA Accessibility Guidelines \n     for Buildings and Facilities (``ADAAG'')), which provides \n     guidance regarding the design, construction, and \n     alteration of buildings and facilities covered by Titles \n     II and III of the ADA. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. A. The Board \n     also proposes to adopt as Appendix B to these regulations \n     the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) \n     (Appendix A to 41 CFR pt. 101-19.6). Such guidelines, \n     where not inconsistent with express provisions of the CAA \n     or of the regulations adopted by the Board, may be relied \n     upon by covered entities and others in proceedings under \n     section 210 of the CAA to the same extent as similarly \n     situated persons may rely upon them in actions brought \n     under Title III of the ADA. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S222 and \n     141 Cong. Rec. at S17606 (similar resolution regarding \n     Secretary of Labor's interpretative bulletins under the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act for section 203 purposes). \n     Covered entities may also use the Attorney General's ADA \n     Technical Assistance Manual and other similar publications \n     for guidance regarding their obligations under regulations \n     adopted by the Board without change.\n        The Board proposes not to adopt Appendix B, the section-\n     by-section analysis of Part 36. Since the Board has only \n     adopted portions of the Attorney General's Part 36 \n     regulations and modified several provisions to conform to the \n     CAA, it does not appear appropriate to include Appendix B. \n     However, the Board notes that the section-by-section analysis \n     may have some relevance to interpreting the sections of Part \n     36 that the Board has adopted without change.\n       5. Specific issues regarding the Secretary of \n     Transportation's title II and title III regulations (parts 37 \n     and 38, 49 CFR).\n       a. Definitions (section 37.3).--As noted above, the Board \n     will make technical and nomenclature changes to the included \n     regulations to adapt them to the CAA. In addition, certain \n     definitions in section 37.3 of the Secretary's regulations \n     relate strictly to implementation of Part II of Title II of \n     the ADA (sections 241 through 246), dealing with public \n     transportation by intercity and commuter rail. Sections 241 \n     through 246 of the ADA were not within the rights and \n     protections applied to covered entities under section 210(b) \n     and, therefore, the regulations implementing such sections \n     are not substantive regulations of the Secretary required to \n     be adopted by the Board within the meaning of section 210(e). \n     Accordingly, the Board will exclude from its regulations the \n     definitions of terms such as ``commerce,'' ``commuter \n     authority,'' ``commuter rail car,'' ``commuter rail \n     transportation,'' ``intercity rail passenger car,'' and \n     ``intercity rail transportation,'' which relate to sections \n     241 through 246 of the ADA.\n       b. Nondiscrimination (section 37.5).--Subsection (f) of \n     section 37.5 of the Secretary's regulations relates to \n     private entities primarily engaged in the business of \n     transporting people and whose operations affect commerce. \n     This subsection implements section 304 of the ADA, which is \n     not a right or protection applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) of the CAA. See 56 Fed. Reg. 13856, 13858 \n     (April 4, 1991) (preamble to NPRM regarding Part 37). \n     Therefore, it is not a regulation of the Secretary included \n     within the scope of rulemaking under section 210(e) of the \n     CAA and will not be included in these regulations.\n       c. References to the Administrator.--In several provisions \n     of the Secretary's regulations which the Board will include \n     as substantive regulations, reference is made to the \n     Administrator of the Federal Transit Administration \n     (``Administrator'' or ``FTA''). Several regulations \n     provide that entities may make requests to the \n     Administrator for waivers or other relief from the \n     accessibility requirements of the regulations. See, e.g., \n     section 37.7(b) (determination of equivalent \n     facilitation), 37.71 (waiver of accessibility requirements \n     for new buses), 37.135 (submission of paratransit plans), \n     and 37.153 (FTA waiver determinations).\n       These provisions will be invoked rarely, if at all. \n     Nevertheless, the Board proposes to adopt these provisions \n     and has determined that there is ``good cause'' to substitute \n     the General Counsel of the Office of Compliance for the \n     Administrator of the FTA. There is some concern that \n     authorizing the FTA, an executive branch agency, to relieve \n     covered entities from the accessibility requirements of \n     section 210 may be tantamount to executive enforcement of \n     section 210. See section 225(f)(3) (``This Act shall not be \n     construed to authorize enforcement by the executive branch of \n     this Act.''). In this context, the General Counsel, as the \n     officer responsible for investigating and prosecuting \n     complaints under section 210, see section 210(d) and (f) of \n     the CAA, is the appropriate analogue for the Administrator. \n     Moreover, if such a waiver request is made by covered \n     entities which requires FTA expertise, such assistance may be \n     obtained by the Executive Director through the use of \n     detailees or consultants. See CAA sections 210(f)(4) and \n     302(e) and (f).\n       d. State Administering Agencies.-- Several portions of the \n     Secretary's regulations refer to obligations of entities \n     regulated by state agencies administering federal \n     transportation funds. See, e.g., sections 37.77(d) (requires \n     filing of equivalent service certificates with state \n     administering agency), 37.135(f) (submission of paratransit \n     development plan to state administering agency) and 37.145 \n     (State comments on paratransit plans). Any references to \n     obligations not imposed on covered entities, such as state \n     law requirements and laws regulating entities that receive \n     Federal financial assistance, will be excluded from these \n     proposed regulations.\n       e. Dates (sections 37.9, 37.71 through 37.87, 37.91, and \n     37.151).--There are several references in the Secretary's \n     regulations to dates from which duties commence and by which \n     certain action should be taken. See sections 37.9, 37.13, \n     37.41, 37.43, 37.47, 37.71 through 37.87, 37.91, and 37.151. \n     The dates set forth in the regulations are derived from the \n     statutory provisions of the ADA. See, e.g., 49 CFR, pt. 37, \n     App. D at 497, 501-02 (section-by-section analysis). The \n     Board has determined that there is ``good cause'' to \n     substitute dates which correspond to analogous periods for \n     purposes of the CAA.\n       f. Administrative Enforcement (section 37.11).--Section \n     37.11 of the Secretary's regulations does not implement any \n     provision of the ADA applied to covered entities under \n     section 210 of the CAA. Moreover, the enforcement procedures \n     of section 210 are explicitly provided for in section 210(d) \n     (``Available Procedures''). Accordingly, this section will \n     not be included within the Board's proposed regulations. The \n     subject matter of enforcement procedures will be addressed, \n     if necessary, under the Office's procedural rules.\n       g. Applicability and Transportation Facilities (subparts B \n     and C).--Certain sections of Subparts B (Applicability) and C \n     (Transportation Facilities) of the Secretary's regulations \n     were promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the \n     ADA, provisions that are not applied to covered entities \n     under section 210(b) of the CAA or are otherwise inapplicable \n     to Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will \n     exclude the following sections from its substantive \n     regulations on that basis: 37.21(a)(2) and (b) (relating \n     to private entities under section 304 of the ADA and \n     private entities receiving Federal assistance from the \n     Transportation Department), 37.25 (university \n     transportation systems), 37.29 (private taxi services), \n     37.33 (airport transportation systems), 37.37(a) and \n     37.37(e)-(g) (relating to coverage of private entities and \n     other entities under section 304 of the ADA), and 37.49-\n     37.57 (relating to intercity and commuter rail systems). \n     Similarly, the Board proposes modifying sections 37.21(c), \n     37.37(d), and 37.37(h) and other sections where references \n     are made to requirements or circumstances strictly \n     encompassed by the provisions of section 304 of the ADA \n     and, therefore, not applicable to covered entities under \n     the CAA. See, e.g., sections 37.25-37.27 (transportation \n     for elementary and secondary education systems).\n       h. Acquisition of Accessible Vehicles by Public Entities \n     (Subpart D).--Subpart D (sections 37.71 through 37.95) of the \n     Secretary's regulations relate to acquisition of accessible \n     vehicles by public entities. Certain sections of subpart D \n     were promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the \n     ADA, which were not applied to covered entities under section \n     210(b) of the CAA, or are otherwise inapplicable to \n     Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will \n     exclude the following sections from its substantive \n     regulations on that basis: 37.87-37.91 and 37.93(b) (relating \n     to intercity and commuter rail service).\n       i. Acquisition of Accessible Vehicles by Private Entities \n     (Subpart E).--Subpart E (sections 37.101 through 37.109) of \n     the Secretary's regulations relates to acquisition of \n     accessible vehicles by private entities. Section 37.101, \n     relating to acquisition of vehicles by private entities not \n     primarily engaged in the business of transporting people, \n     implements section 302 of the ADA, which is applied to \n     covered entities under section 210(b). Therefore, the Board \n     will adopt section 37.101 as part of its section 210(e) \n     regulations. Sections 37.103, 37.107, and 37.109 of the \n     regulations implement section 304 of the ADA, which is \n     inapplicable to covered entities under the ADA. Therefore, \n     the Board proposes not to include them within its substantive \n     regulations under section 210(e) of the CAA.\n       j. Appendices to Part 37.--Part 37 of the Secretary's \n     regulations includes several appendices, only one of which \n     the Board proposes to adopt as part of these regulations. The \n     Board proposes to adopt as an appendix to these regulations \n     Appendix A (Standards for Accessible Transportation \n     Facilities, ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and \n     Facilities), which provides guidance regarding the design, \n     construction, and alteration of buildings and facilities \n     covered by Titles II and III of the ADA. 49 CFR pt. 37, App. \n     A. Such guidelines, where not inconsistent with express \n     provisions of the CAA or of the regulations adopted by the \n     Board, may be relied upon by covered entities and other in \n     proceedings under section 210 of the CAA to the same extent \n     as similarly situated persons may rely upon them in actions \n     brought under Title II and Title III of the ADA. See 142 \n     Cong. Rec. at S222 and 141 Cong. Rec. at S17606 (similar \n     resolution regarding Secretary of Labor's interpretative \n     bulletins under the Fair Labor Standards Act for section 203 \n     purposes).\n       The Board proposes not to adopt Appendix B, which gives the \n     addresses of FTA regional offices. Such information is not \n     relevant to\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\n     covered entities under the CAA. The Board also proposes to \n     adopt portions of Appendix C, which contain forms for \n     certification of equivalent service. The Board will delete \n     reference to the requirement that public entities receiving \n     financial assistance under the Federal Transit Act submit the \n     certification to their state program office before procuring \n     any inaccessible vehicle. This certification form appears to \n     be irrelevant to entities covered by the CAA and therefore \n     will not be adopted by the Board.\n       Finally, the Board does not adopt Appendix D to Part 37, \n     the section-by-section analysis of Part 37. Since the Board \n     has only adopted portions of the Secretary's Part 37 \n     regulations and has modified several provisions to conform to \n     the CAA, it does not appear appropriate to include Appendix \n     D. However, the Board notes that the section-by-section \n     analysis may have some relevance in interpreting the sections \n     of Part 37 that the Board has adopted without change.\n       k. ADA Accessibility Specifications for Transportation \n     Vehicles (Part 38).--Part 38 of the Secretary's regulations \n     contains accessibility standards for all types of \n     transportation vehicles. Part 38 is divided into vehicle \n     types: Subpart B, Buses, Vans, and Systems; Subpart C, Rapid \n     Rail Vehicles and Systems; Subpart D, Light Rail Vehicles and \n     Systems; Subpart E, Commuter Rail Cars and Systems; Subpart \n     F, Intercity Rail Cars and Systems; Subpart G, Over-the-Road \n     Buses and Systems; and Subpart H, Other Vehicles and Systems. \n     Section 38.2 contains the concept of equivalent facilitation, \n     under which an entity is permitted to request approval for an \n     alternative method of compliance. As noted in section 5.c. of \n     this Notice, the Board proposes that such determinations be \n     made by the General Counsel rather than the Administrator.\n       The Board proposes to adopt, with minimal technical and \n     nomenclature changes, the regulations contained in Part 38 \n     and accompanying appendix, with the exception of the \n     following subparts which the Board has determined implement \n     portions of the ADA not applied to covered entities under \n     section 210(b) of the CAA and/or the Board believe have no \n     conceivable applicability to legislative branch operations: \n     Subpart E, Commuter Rail Cars and Systems; and Subpart F, \n     Intercity Rail Cars and Systems.\n\n                        B. Proposed regulations\n\n       1. General Provisions.--The proposed regulations include a \n     section on matters of general applicability including the \n     purpose and scope of the regulations, definitions, coverage, \n     and the administrative authority of the Board and the Office \n     of Compliance.\n       2. Method for Identifying Responsible Entities and \n     Establishing Categories of Violations.--Section 210(e)(3) of \n     the CAA directs the Board to include in its regulations a \n     method for identifying, for purposes of section 210 and for \n     different categories of violations of subsection (b), the \n     entity responsible for correction of a particular violation. \n     In developing these proposed rules, the Board considered the \n     final Report of the General Counsel, which applied the public \n     services and accommodations standards of section 210 to \n     covered entities during his initial inspections under section \n     210(f). See Disability Access Report.\n       In developing a method for identifying the entity \n     responsible for a correction of a violation of section 210, \n     the Board must consider the terms of section 210 of the CAA \n     and the precise nature of the obligations imposed on covered \n     entities under Titles II and III of the ADA under section \n     210(b). The Board cannot promulgate regulations which purport \n     to expand or limit these obligations contrary to the language \n     of the statute or the intent of Congress. See, e.g., White v. \n     I.N.S., 75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir. 1996) (agency cannot \n     promulgate even substantive rules that are contrary to \n     statute; if intent of Congress is clear, agency must give \n     effect to that unambiguously expressed intent); Conlan v. \n     U.S. Dep't of Labor, 76 F.3d 271, 274 (9th Cir. 1996). As set \n     forth below, the Board has developed a method for identifying \n     the entity responsible for correction of a violation of \n     section 210(b) which includes providing definitions for \n     terms such as ``operate a place of public accommodation,'' \n     and ``public entity'' for the purpose of section 210.\n       Section 210(b) applies the rights and protections of two \n     separate and independent provisions of the ADA to covered \n     entities:\n       The rights and protections of Title II of the ADA (sections \n     201 through 230) applied by section 210(b) of the CAA deals \n     with ``public entities.'' It prohibits discrimination against \n     any qualified individual with a disability by any ``public \n     entity'' regarding all public activities, programs, and \n     services of that entity. Title II imposes an obligation on \n     public entities to make ``reasonable modifications to rules, \n     policies, or practices,'' to achieve ``the removal of \n     architectural, communication, or transportation barriers,'' \n     and to ensure ``provision of auxiliary aids and services.'' \n     Title II also includes provisions regarding accessibility of \n     public transportation systems.\n       The rights and protections of Title III of the ADA applied \n     by section 210(b) of the CAA (sections 302, 303, and 309) \n     deals with ``public accommodations.'' It prohibits \n     discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and \n     equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, \n     privileges, advantages, or accommodations of ``any place of \n     public accommodation.'' Specifically, such discrimination \n     includes: (1) discriminatory eligibility criteria; (2) \n     failure to make reasonable modifications; (3) failure to \n     provide auxiliary aids and services; (4) failure to remove \n     architectural barriers and communication barriers that are \n     structural in nature where removal of such barriers are \n     ``readily achievable''; and (5) failure to make goods, \n     services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n     accommodations available through alternative methods where \n     removal of barriers is not readily achievable. In contrast to \n     Title II, Title III defines a ``place of public \n     accommodation'' as ``private entities'' (which excludes \n     ``public entities'' covered under Title II) falling within \n     twelve specified categories of activities. Title III also \n     contains requirements regarding specified transportation \n     services.\n       As set forth in the ADA, Title II and Title III were \n     designed to impose separate legal obligations (which are \n     expressed in slightly different terms) on two separate and \n     independent classes of actors: ``public entities'' (which \n     have Title II obligations) and private entities that are \n     `places of public accommodation'' (which have Title III \n     obligations). Under the ADA, a public entity, by definition, \n     can never be subjected to Title III of the ADA, which covers \n     only private entities. Conversely, private entities cannot be \n     covered by Title II. See, e.g., 28 CFR, pt. 36, App. B at 587 \n     (section-by-section analysis of Part 36) (``Facilities \n     operated by government agencies or other public entities as \n     defined in this section do not qualify as places of public \n     accommodation. The action of public entities are governed by \n     title II of the ADA''); ADA Title III Technical Assistance \n     Manual at p. 7 (1993).\n       In section 210(b) of the CAA, Congress applied the rights \n     and protections of all of Title II and parts of Title III to \n     specified Legislative Branch entities without making either \n     Title's coverage mutually exclusive. Thus, in contrast to the \n     ADA, under the CAA, a single entity could conceivably have \n     obligations under both Title II and Title III, if it meets \n     the criteria for coverage under both Titles.\n       The method developed by the Board in these regulations to \n     identify the entity responsible for correcting a violation of \n     section 210(b) is set forth in section 1.105 of the proposed \n     regulations. Section 1.105 is based on the Board's \n     interpretation of the statutory coverage for Legislative \n     Branch entities under Title II and Title III, as applied by \n     section 210(b).\n       Under the proposed rule, the entity responsible for \n     correcting a violation of the obligations under Title II of \n     the ADA with respect to the provision of public services, \n     programs, or activities, as applied by section 210(b) is the \n     entity that, with respect to the particular violation, is a \n     covered ``public entity'' within the meaning of section \n     210(b) that provided the particular public service, program, \n     or activity that forms the basis of the violation. Similarly, \n     the entity responsible for correcting a violation of the \n     obligations under Title III of the ADA, as applied by section \n     210(b) is the entity that, with respect to the particular \n     violation, operates the ``place of public accommodation'' \n     within the meaning of section 210(b) that forms the basis of \n     the violation. Thus, the regulations distinguish responsible \n     entities for Title II and Title III purposes as follows:\n       1. The rights and protections of Title II (sections 201 \n     through 203 of the ADA): For the purpose of the rights and \n     protections against discrimination under Title II of the ADA, \n     the entity responsible for a violation would be any entity \n     listed in subsection (a) of section 210 of the CAA that is a \n     ``public entity'' as defined by section 210(b)(2) of the CAA \n     and that provided the public service, program, or activity \n     that formed the basis for the particular violation of Title \n     II set forth in the charge filed with the General Counsel or \n     the complaint filed by the General Counsel with the Office \n     under section 210(d) of the CAA. Conversely, if the entity is \n     not a ``public entity'' (that is, the entity provides no \n     public services, programs, or activities) or did not provide \n     the public service, program, or activity that formed the \n     basis for the particular violation of Title II, the entity is \n     not an ``entity responsible for correction of the violation'' \n     within the meaning of these regulations.\n       2. The rights and protections of Title III (sections 302, \n     303, and 309 of the ADA): For the purpose of the rights and \n     protections against discrimination under Title III of the \n     ADA, the entity responsible for a violation would be any \n     entity listed in subsection (a) of section 210 of the CAA \n     that ``operates a place of public accommodation'' (as defined \n     in these regulations) that forms in whole or in part the \n     basis for the particular violation of Title III.\n       a. ``Place of public accommodation.'' As used in these \n     regulations, the term ``place of public accommodation'' \n     follows the definition of section 301(7) of the ADA, with \n     appropriate modification to delete the phrase ``private'' and \n     the requirement that the activities affect commerce. These \n     modifications conform the definition to the CAA. See section \n     225(f) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f).\n       b. ``Operate (a place of public accommodation).'' As \n     applied by section 210(b) of the CAA, section 302(a) of the \n     ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by \n     any ``[Legislative Branch entity that] owns, leases (or \n     leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.'' On \n     its face, the terms ``owns, leases (or leases to)'' do not \n     apply to entities within the Legislative Branch. For example, \n     the Board is not aware of any individual covered entity that \n     owns the buildings or facilities housing a place of\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\n     public accommodation in the way that private entities do. \n     Similarly, the Board is unaware of any situations in which an \n     otherwise covered entity within the Legislative Branch may \n     ``lease'' its facilities to another Legislative Branch \n     entity. The only lease agreements of which the Board is aware \n     would be between otherwise covered entities and persons or \n     entities over which the CAA has no jurisdiction. For example, \n     the General Services Administration or a private building \n     owner may lease space to Congressional offices, but neither \n     entity would fall within the CAA's definition of covered \n     entity. Thus, the only issue in any case under Title III of \n     the ADA as applied under section 210 would be whether a \n     Legislative Branch entity ``operates'' a place of public \n     accommodation within the meaning of the ADA.\n       The ADA does not define the term ``operate.'' Thus, the \n     Board ``construe[s] it in accord with its ordinary and \n     natural meaning.'' Smith v. United States, 113 S.Ct. 2050, \n     2054 (1993); White v. I.N.S., 75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th Cir. \n     1996), quoting Pioneer Investment Servs. v. Brunswick \n     Assocs., 113 S.Ct. 1489, 1495 (1993) (``Congress intends the \n     words in its enactments to carry their ordinary, \n     contemporary, common meaning.'').\n       To ``operate,'' in the context of a business operation, \n     means ``to put or keep in operation,'' The Random House \n     College Dictionary 931 (Rev. ed. 1980), ``[t]o control or \n     direct the functioning of,'' Webster's II: New Riverside \n     Dictionary 823 (1988), ``[t]o conduct the affairs of; \n     manage,'' The American Heritage Dictionary 1268 (3d ed. \n     1992). Neff v. American Dairy Queen Corp., 58 F.3d 1063, \n     1066 (5th Cir. 1995), cert. denied 116 S.Ct. 704 (1996). \n     See also Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary \n     1253 (2d ed. 1983) (``to superintend; to manage; to direct \n     the affairs of; as, to operate a mine.'').\n       In Neff v. American Dairy Queen Corp., supra, the Fifth \n     Circuit considered the meaning of the term ``operate'' in the \n     ADA in the context of franchise store operations. The \n     plaintiff sued American Dairy Queen (``ADQ'') under Title III \n     of the ADA, arguing that the franchise agreement between ADQ \n     and its franchisee (R & S Dairy Queens), in which ADQ \n     retained the right to set standards for buildings and \n     equipment maintenance and the right to ``veto'' proposed \n     structural changes, made it an ``operator'' of the \n     franchisees' stores within the meaning of section 302. The \n     Fifth Circuit rejected this argument:\n       ``Instead, the relevant question in this case is whether \n     ADQ, according to the terms of the franchise agreements with \n     R & S Dairy Queens, controls modification of the\n       San Antonio Stores to cause them to comply with the ADA. * \n     * *\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``In sum, while the terms of the [agreement] demonstrate \n     that ADQ retains the right to set standards for building and \n     equipment maintenance and to ``veto'' proposed structural \n     changes, we hold that this supervisory authority, without \n     more, is insufficient to support a holding that ADQ \n     ``operates,'' in the ordinary and natural meaning of that \n     term, the [franchisee store].'' 58 F.3d at 1068. The Board \n     finds the reasoning of the Neff court persuasive and adopts \n     its application of the term ``operate'' for Title III \n     purposes in these regulations.\n       Specifically, for the purposes of determining \n     responsibility under Title III, an entity ``operates'' a \n     place of public accommodation if it superintends, directly \n     controls, or directs the functioning of or manages the \n     specific aspects of the public accommodation that constitute \n     an architectural barrier or a communication barrier that is \n     structural in nature or that otherwise forms the basis for a \n     violation of section 302 of the ADA, as applied by section \n     210(b) of the CAA. In addition, an entity ``operates'' a \n     place of public accommodation if it assigns such \n     superintendence, control, direction, or management to another \n     entity or person by means of contract or other arrangement. \n     An entity, whether or not a covered entity under these \n     regulations, which contracts with a covered entity stands in \n     the shoes of the covered entity for purposes of determining \n     the application of Title III requirements. Thus, the \n     definition of ``operate'' in these regulations ``includes \n     operation of the place of public accommodation by a person \n     under a contractual or other arrangement or relationship with \n     a covered entity.''\n       In the absence of such a provision, it is possible that a \n     covered entity, instead of directly controlling the \n     inaccessible features of places of public accommodation, \n     could contract with a private entity, which would then manage \n     the accommodation in such a way as to maintain its \n     inaccessible features. Allowing such self-insulation from \n     liability would clearly conflict with the principles of the \n     ADA as applied by section 210(b) of the CAA. The proposed \n     definition is intended to prevent an otherwise covered entity \n     from ``contracting out'' of its Title III obligations. Where \n     the entity exercises no authority with respect to the \n     modification of the specific aspects of the facilities, \n     programs, activities, or other features of the place of \n     public accommodation that make them inaccessible within the \n     meaning of section 302 of the CAA, the proposed regulation \n     states that the entity does not ``operate'' the place of \n     public accommodation within the meaning of these regulations.\n       Where an entity merely maintains the general authority to \n     set standards regarding a particular facility or condition at \n     issue, and to ``veto'' proposed changes in the facility or \n     condition, this oversight or supervisory authority, \n     without more, is insufficient to support a finding that \n     the entity ``operates'' the facility or condition within \n     the meaning of these regulations. See Neff, 58 F.3d at \n     1068. Conversely, if the correction of a violation of \n     section 210 of the CAA, including the modification of the \n     facility or condition at issue, can only be accomplished \n     with the active approval or permission of a particular \n     entity, then that entity ``operates'' the facility or \n     condition and is otherwise a responsible entity under this \n     section of the regulations, but only to the extent that \n     the entity withholds such approval or permission.\n       3. Future changes in the text of regulations of the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary which have been adopted by \n     the Board.--The Board proposes that the section 210 \n     regulations adopt the text of the referenced portions of \n     parts the regulations of the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of Transportation in effect as of the effective \n     date of these regulations. The Board takes notice that the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary have in recent years made \n     frequent changes, both technical and nontechnical, to their \n     Title II and Title III regulations and to the ADAAG standards \n     incorporated by reference therein. The Board interprets the \n     incorporation by reference in the text of the adopted Title \n     II and Title III regulations of documents (such as the ADAAG \n     standards at appendix A to Part 36) to include any future \n     changes to such documents. As the Office receives notice of \n     such changes by the Attorney General or the Secretary, it \n     will advise covered entities and employees as part of its \n     education and information activities. As to changes in the \n     text of the adopted regulations themselves, however, the \n     Board finds that, under the CAA statutory scheme, additional \n     Board rulemaking under section 210(e) will be required. The \n     Board believes that it should afford covered Legislative \n     Branch entities and employees potentially affected by \n     adoption of such changes the opportunity to comment on the \n     propriety of Board adoption of any such changes, and that the \n     Congress should have the opportunity to specifically approve \n     such adoption by the Board. The Board specifically invites \n     comments on this proposal.\n       4. Technical and nomenclature changes.--The proposed \n     regulations make technical and nomenclature changes, where \n     appropriate, to conform to the provisions of the CAA.\n       Recommended method of approval: The Board recommends that \n     (1) the version of the proposed regulations that shall apply \n     to the Senate and entities and facilities of the Senate be \n     approved by the Senate by resolution; (2) the version of the \n     proposed regulations that shall apply to the House of \n     Representatives and entities and facilities of the House of \n     Representatives be approved by the House of Representatives \n     by resolution; and (3) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to other covered entities and \n     facilities be approved by the Congress by concurrent \n     resolution.

Enacted into law on January 23, \n     1995, the Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') directly \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law and public access statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the legislative \n     branch. Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the rights \n     and protections against discrimination in the provision of \n     public services and accommodations established by the \n     provisions of Title II and III (sections 201 through 230, \n     302, 303, and 309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of \n     1990, 42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and \n     12189 (``ADA'') shall apply to the following entities:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Service;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n\n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b). Title II of the ADA generally \n     prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the \n     provision of public services, programs, activities by any \n     ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the CAA provides\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\n     that for the purpose of applying Title II of the ADA the term \n     ``public entity'' means any entity listed above that provides \n     public services, programs, or activities. Title III of the \n     ADA generally prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n     disability by public accommodations and requires places of \n     public accommodation and commercial facilities to be \n     designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with \n     accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides \n     that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and \n     exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and \n     exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).\n       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel \n     of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least \n     once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all \n     covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance \n     with disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1331(f).\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1, 35, 36, 37, and 38) are the \n     substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the \n     Office of Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section \n     210(e) of the CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions \n     applicable to all regulations under section 210, including \n     the method of identifying entities responsible for correcting \n     a violation of section 210. Part 35 contains the provisions \n     regarding nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in the \n     provision of public services, programs, or activities of \n     covered entities. Part 36 contains the provisions regarding \n     nondiscrimination on the basis of disability by public \n     accommodations. Part 37 contains the provisions regarding \n     transportation services for individuals with disabilities. \n     Part 38 contains the provisions regarding accessibility \n     specifications for transportation vehicles.\n     Sec. 1.102  Definitions.\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189) as \n     applied to covered entities by Section 210 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered entity includes any of the following \n     entities that either provides public services, programs, or \n     activities, and/or that operates a place of public \n     accommodation within the meaning of section 210 of the CAA: \n     (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee; (2) each office of the House of \n     Representatives, including each office of a Member of the \n     House of Representatives and each committee; (3) each joint \n     committee of the Congress; (4) the Capitol Guide Service; (5) \n     the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional Budget Office; (7) \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including the \n     Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden); (8) the Office of \n     the Attending Physician; and (9) the Office of Compliance.\n       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.103  Notice of protection.\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for posting, a notice \n     explaining the provisions of section 210 of the CAA. Copies \n     of such notice may be obtained from the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.104  Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections against discrimination on the basis of disability \n     in the provision of public services and accommodations under \n     the ADA. Section 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 210 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (b) except to the extent that the Board may determine, for \n     good cause shown and stated together with the regulation, \n     that a modification of such regulations would be more \n     effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). The \n     regulations issued by the Board herein are on all matters for \n     which section 210 of the CAA requires a regulation to be \n     issued. Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, \n     based on the information available to it at the time of \n     promulgation of these regulations, that, with the \n     exception of the regulations adopted and set forth herein, \n     there are no other ``substantive regulations promulgated \n     by the Attorney General and the Secretary of \n     Transportation to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (b) [of section 210 of the \n     CAA]'' that need be adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary. \n     Such changes are intended to make the provisions adopted \n     accord more naturally to situations in the Legislative \n     Branch. However, by making these changes, the Board does not \n     intend a substantive difference between these regulations and \n     those of the Attorney General and/or the Secretary from which \n     they are derived. Moreover, such changes, in and of \n     themselves, are not intended to constitute an interpretation \n     of the regulations or of the statutory provisions of the CAA \n     upon which they are based.\n     Sec. 1.105  Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n         correction of violations of section 210.\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under section 210(e) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for \n     categories of violations of section 210(b), the entity \n     responsible for correcting a particular violation. This \n     section 1.105 sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible entities for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of section 210(b).\n       (b) Categories of violations. Violations of the rights and \n     protections established in section 210(b) of the CAA that may \n     form the basis for a charge filed with the General Counsel \n     under section 210(d)(1) of the CAA or for a complaint filed \n     by the General Counsel under section 210(d)(3) of the CAA \n     fall into one (or both) of two categories:\n       (i) Title II violations. A covered entity may violate \n     section 210(b) if it discriminates against a qualified \n     individual with a disability within the meaning of Title II \n     of the ADA (sections 210 through 230), as applied to \n     Legislative Branch entities under section 210(b) of the CAA.\n       (ii) Title III violations. A covered entity may also \n     violate section 210(b) if it discriminates against a \n     qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of \n     Title III of the ADA (sections 302, 303, and 309), as applied \n     to Legislative Branch entities under section 210(b) of the \n     CAA.\n       (c) Entity Responsible for Correcting a Violation of Title \n     II Rights and Protections. Correction of a violation of the \n     rights and protections against discrimination under Title II \n     of the ADA, as applied by section 210(b) of the CAA, is the \n     responsibility of any entity listed in subsection (a) of \n     section 210 of the CAA that is a ``public entity,'' as \n     defined by section 210(b)(2) of the CAA, and that provides \n     the specific public service, program, or activity that forms \n     the basis for the particular violation of Title II rights and \n     protections set forth in the charge of discrimination filed \n     with the General Counsel under section 210(d)(1) of the CAA \n     or the complaint filed by the General Counsel with the Office \n     under section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. As used in this section, \n     an entity provides a public service, program, or activity if \n     it does so itself, or by a person or other entity (whether \n     public or private and regardless of whether that entity is \n     covered under the CAA) under a contractual or other \n     arrangement or relationship with the entity.\n       (d) Entity Responsible for Correction of Title III Rights \n     and Protections. Correction of a violation of the rights and \n     protections against discrimination under Title III of the \n     ADA, as applied by section 210(b) of the CAA, is the \n     responsibility of any entity listed in subsection (a) of \n     section 210 of the CAA that ``operates a place of public \n     accommodation'' (as defined in this section) that forms \n     the basis, in whole or in part, for the particular \n     violation of Title III rights and protections set forth in \n     the charge filed with the General Counsel under section \n     210(d)(1) of the CAA and/or the complaint filed by the \n     General Counsel with the Office under section 210(d)(3) of \n     the CAA.\n       (i) Definitions.\n       As used in this section:\n       Public accommodation has the meaning set forth in Part 36 \n     of these regulations.\n       Operates, with respect to the operations of a place of \n     public accommodation, includes the superintendence, control, \n     management, or direction of the function of the aspects of \n     the public accommodation that constitute an architectural \n     barrier or communication barrier that is structural in \n     nature, or that otherwise forms the basis for a violation of \n     the rights and protections of Title III of the ADA as applied \n     under section 210(b) of the CAA.\n       (ii) As used in this section, an entity operates a place of \n     public accommodation if it does so itself, or by a person or \n     other entity (whether public or private and regardless of \n     whether that entity is covered under the CAA) under a \n     contractual or other arrangement or relationship with the \n     entity.\n       (e) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II \n     and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one entity is \n     deemed an entity responsible for correction of a violation of \n     Title II and/or Title III rights and protections under the \n     method set forth in this section, as between those parties, \n     allocation of responsibility for complying with the \n     obligations of Title II and/or Title III of the ADA as \n     applied by section 210(b), and for correction of violations \n     thereunder, may be determined by contract or other \n     enforceable arrangement or relationship.\n\n    Part 35--Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Public \n                   Services, Programs, or Activities\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec.\n     35.101  Purpose.\n     35.102  Application.\n     35.103  Relationship to other laws.\n     35.104  Definitions.\n     35.105  Self-evaluation.\n     35.106  Notice.\n     35.107  Designation of responsible employee and adoption of \n         grievance procedures.\n     35.108-35.129  [Reserved]\n\n                    Subpart B--General Requirements\n\n     35.130  General prohibitions against discrimination.\n\n[[Page S10992]]\n\n     35.131  Illegal use of drugs.\n     35.132  Smoking.\n     35.133  Maintenance of accessible features.\n     35.134  [Reserved]\n     35.135  Personal devices and services.\n     35.136-35.139  [Reserved]\n\n                         Subpart C--Employment\n\n     35.140  Employment discrimination prohibited.\n     35.141-35.148  [Reserved]\n\n                     Subpart--Program Accessibility\n\n     35.149  Discrimination prohibited.\n     35.150  Existing facilities.\n     35.151  New construction and alterations.\n     35.152-35.159  [Reserved]\n\n                       Subpart E--Communications\n\n     35.160  General.\n     35.161  Text telephones (TTY's).\n     35.162  Telephone emergency services.\n     35.163  Information and signage.\n     35.164  Duties.\n     35.165 35.169-[Reserved]\n     35.170 35.189-[Reserved]\n     35.190 35.999-[Reserved]\n\n\n                           Subpart A--General\n\n     Sec. 35.101 Purpose.\n       The purpose of this part is to effectuate section 210 of \n     the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1331 \n     et seq.) which, inter alia, applies the rights and \n     protections of subtitle A of title II of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131-12150), which \n     prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public \n     entities.\n     Sec. 35.102 Application.\n       (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, \n     this part applies to all public services, programs, and \n     activities provided or made available by public entities as \n     defined by section 210 of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act of 1995.\n       (b) To the extent that public transportation services, \n     programs, and activities of public entities are covered by \n     subtitle B of title II of the ADA, as applied by section 210 \n     of the Congressional Accountability Act, they are not subject \n     to the requirements of this part.\n     Sec. 35.103 Relationship to other laws.\n       (a) Rule of interpretation. Except as otherwise provided in \n     this part, this part shall not be construed to apply a lesser \n     standard than the standards applied under title V of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791) or the regulations \n     issued by Federal agencies pursuant to that title.\n       (b) Other laws. This part does not invalidate or limit the \n     remedies, rights, and procedures of any other Federal laws \n     otherwise applicable to covered entities that provide greater \n     or equal protection for the rights of individuals with \n     disabilities or individuals associated with them.\n     Sec. 35.104 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this part, the term--\n       Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995 (Pub.

A public entity shall operate each public \n     service, program, or activity so that the public service, \n     program, or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. \n     This paragraph does not--\n       (1) Necessarily require a public entity to make each of its \n     existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities;\n       (2) Require a public entity to take any action that would \n     threaten or destroy the historic significance of an historic \n     property; or\n       (3) Require a public entity to take any action that it can \n     demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the \n     nature of a public service, program, or activity or in undue \n     financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances \n     where personnel of the public entity believe that the \n     proposed action would fundamentally alter the public service, \n     program, or activity or would result in undue financial and \n     administrative burdens, a public entity has the burden of \n     proving that compliance with Sec. 35.150(a) of this part \n     would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that \n     compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be \n     made by the head of a public entity or his or her designee \n     after considering all resources available for use in the \n     funding and operation of the service, program, or activity, \n     and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons \n     for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in \n     such an alteration or such burdens, a public entity shall \n     take any other action that would not result in such an \n     alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that \n     individuals with disabilities receive the public benefits or \n     services provided by the public entity.\n       (b) Methods--(1) General. A public entity may comply with \n     the requirements of this section through such means as \n     redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible \n     buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, \n     delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, \n     alteration of existing facilities and construction of new \n     facilities, use of accessible rolling stock or other \n     conveyances, or any other methods that result in making its \n     public services, programs, or activities readily accessible \n     to and usable by individuals with disabilities. A public \n     entity is not required to make structural changes in existing \n     facilities where other methods are effective in achieving \n     compliance with this section. A public entity, in making \n     alterations to existing buildings, shall meet the \n     accessibility requirements of Sec. 35.151. In choosing among \n     available methods for meeting the requirements of this \n     section, a public entity shall give priority to those methods \n     that offer public services, programs, and activities to \n     qualified individuals with disabilities in the most \n     integrated setting appropriate.\n       (2) Historic preservation programs. In meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. 35.150(a) in historic preservation \n     programs, a public entity shall give priority to methods that \n     provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In \n     cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is \n     not required because of paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this \n     section, alternative methods of achieving program \n     accessibility include--\n       (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict \n     those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise \n     be made accessible;\n       (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps \n     into or through portions of historic properties that cannot \n     otherwise be made accessible; or\n       (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.\n       (c) Time period for compliance. Where structural changes in \n     facilities are undertaken to comply with the obligations \n     established under this section, such changes shall be made by \n     within three years of January 1, 1997, but in any event as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       (d) Transition plan. (1) In the event that structural \n     changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program \n     accessibility, a public entity that employs 50 or more \n     persons shall develop, within six months of January 1, 1997, \n     a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to \n     complete such changes. A public entity shall provide an \n     opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with \n     disabilities or organizations representing individuals with \n     disabilities, to participate in the development of the \n     transition plan by submitting comments. A copy of the \n     transition plan shall be made available for public \n     inspection.\n       (2) If a public entity has responsibility or authority over \n     streets, roads, or walkways, its transition plan shall \n     include a schedule for providing curb ramps or other sloped \n     areas where pedestrian walks cross curbs, giving priority to \n     walkways serving entities covered by the CAA, including \n     covered offices and facilities, transportation, places of \n     public accommodation, and employers, followed by walkways \n     serving other areas.\n       (3) The plan shall, at a minimum--\n       (i) Identify physical obstacles in the public entity's \n     facilities that limit the accessibility of its public \n     programs or activities to individuals with disabilities;\n       (ii) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to \n     make the facilities accessible;\n       (iii) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary \n     to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time \n     period of the transition plan is longer than one year, \n     identify steps that will be taken during each year of the \n     transition period; and\n       (iv) Indicate the official responsible for implementation \n     of the plan.\n     Sec. 35.151 New construction and alterations.\n       (a) Design and construction. Each facility or part of a \n     facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a \n     public entity shall be designed and constructed in such \n     manner that the facility or part of the facility is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if \n     the construction was commenced after January 1, 1997.\n       (b) Alteration. Each facility or part of a facility altered \n     by, on behalf of, or for the use of a public entity in a \n     manner that affects or could affect the usability of the \n     facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, be altered in such manner that the altered portion \n     of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, if the alteration was \n     commenced after January 1, 1997.\n       (c) Accessibility standards. Design, construction, or \n     alteration of facilities in conformance with the Uniform \n     Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) (Appendix B to Part 36 \n     of these regulations) or with the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities \n     (ADAAG) (Appendix A to Part 36 of these regulations) shall be \n     deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with \n     respect to those facilities, except that the elevator \n     exemption contained at 4.1.3(5) and 4.1.6(1)(j) of ADAAG \n     shall not apply. Departures from particular requirements \n     of either standard by the use of other methods shall be \n     permitted when it is clearly evident that equivalent \n     access to the facility or part of the facility is thereby \n     provided.\n       (d) Alterations: Historic properties.

(1) Nothing in this part \n     shall be construed to require an individual with a disability \n     to accept an accommodation, aid, service, opportunity, or \n     benefit available under this part that such individual \n     chooses not to accept.\n       (2) Nothing in the CAA or this part authorizes the \n     representative or guardian of an individual with a disability \n     to decline food, water, medical treatment, or medical \n     services for that individual.\n     Sec. 36.204 Administrative methods.\n       A public accommodation shall not, directly or through \n     contractual or other arrangements, utilize standards or \n     criteria or methods of administration that have the effect of \n     discriminating on the basis of disability, or that perpetuate \n     the discrimination of others who are subject to common \n     administrative control.\n     Sec. 36.205 Association.\n       A public accommodation shall not exclude or otherwise deny \n     equal goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, \n     accommodations, or other opportunities to an individual or \n     entity because of the known disability of an individual with \n     whom the individual or entity is known to have a relationship \n     or association.\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\n     Sec. 36.206 [Reserved]\n     Sec. 36.207 Places of public accommodation located in private \n         residences.\n       (a) When a place of public accommodation is located in a \n     private residence, the portion of the residence used \n     exclusively as a residence is not covered by this part, but \n     that portion used exclusively in the operation of the place \n     of public accommodation or that portion used both for the \n     place of public accommodation and for residential purposes is \n     covered by this part.\n       (b) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph \n     (a) of this section extends to those elements used to enter \n     the place of public accommodation, including the homeowner's \n     front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and hallways; \n     and those portions of the residence, interior or exterior, \n     available to or used by customers or clients, including \n     restrooms.\n     Sec. 36.208 Direct threat.\n       (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     permit an individual to participate in or benefit from the \n     goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages \n     and accommodations of that public accommodation when that \n     individual poses a direct threat to the health or safety \n     of others.\n       (b) Direct threat means a significant risk to the health or \n     safety of others that cannot be eliminated by a modification \n     of policies, practices, or procedures, or by the provision of \n     auxiliary aids or services.\n       (c) In determining whether an individual poses a direct \n     threat to the health or safety of others, a public \n     accommodation must make an individualized assessment, based \n     on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical \n     knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to \n     ascertain: the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; \n     the probability that the potential injury will actually \n     occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, \n     practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.\n     Sec. 36.209 Illegal use of drugs.\n       (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of \n     this section, this part does not prohibit discrimination \n     against an individual based on that individual's current \n     illegal use of drugs.\n       (2) A public accommodation shall not discriminate on the \n     basis of illegal use of drugs against an individual who is \n     not engaging in current illegal use of drugs and who--\n       (i) Has successfully completed a supervised drug \n     rehabilitation program or has otherwise been rehabilitated \n     successfully;\n       (ii) Is participating in a supervised rehabilitation \n     program; or\n       (iii) Is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use.\n       (b) Health and drug rehabilitation services. (1) A public \n     accommodation shall not deny health services, or services \n     provided in connection with drug rehabilitation, to an \n     individual on the basis of that individual's current illegal \n     use of drugs, if the individual is otherwise entitled to such \n     services.\n       (2) A drug rehabilitation or treatment program may deny \n     participation to individuals who engage in illegal use of \n     drugs while they are in the program.\n       (c) Drug testing. (1) This part does not prohibit a public \n     accommodation from adopting or administering reasonable \n     policies or procedures, including but not limited to drug \n     testing, designed to ensure that an individual who formerly \n     engaged in the illegal use of drugs is not now engaging in \n     current illegal use of drugs.\n       (2) Nothing in this paragraph (c) shall be construed to \n     encourage, prohibit, restrict, or authorize the conducting of \n     testing for the illegal use of drugs.\n     Sec. 36.210 Smoking.\n       This part does not preclude the prohibition of, or the \n     imposition of restrictions on, smoking in places of public \n     accommodation.\n     Sec. 36.211 Maintenance of accessible features.\n       (a) A public accommodation shall maintain in operable \n     working condition those features of facilities and equipment \n     that are required to be readily accessible to and usable by \n     persons with disabilities by the CAA or this part.\n       (b) This section does not prohibit isolated or temporary \n     interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or \n     repairs.\n     Sec. 36.212 Insurance.\n       (a) This part shall not be construed to prohibit or \n     restrict--\n       (1) A covered entity that administers benefit plans, or \n     similar organizations from underwriting risks, classifying \n     risks, or administering such risks that are based on or \n     not inconsistent with applicable law; or\n       (2) A person or organization covered by this part from \n     establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the \n     terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on \n     underwriting risks, classifying risks, or administering such \n     risks that are based on or not inconsistent with applicable \n     law; or\n       (3) A person or organization covered by this part from \n     establishing, sponsoring, observing or administering the \n     terms of a bona fide benefit plan that is not subject to \n     applicable laws that regulate insurance.\n       (b) Paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section shall \n     not be used as a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the CAA \n     or this part.\n       (c) A public accommodation shall not refuse to serve an \n     individual with a disability because its insurance company \n     conditions coverage or rates on the absence of individuals \n     with disabilities.\n     Sec. 36.213  Relationship of subpart B to subparts C and D of \n         this part.\n       Subpart B of this part sets forth the general principles of \n     nondiscrimination applicable to all entities subject to this \n     part. Subparts C and D of this part provide guidance on the \n     application of the statute to specific situations. The \n     specific provisions, including the limitations on those \n     provisions, control over the general provisions in \n     circumstances where both specific and general provisions \n     apply.\n     Sec. Sec. 36.214-36.299  [Reserved]\n\n\n                    subpart c specific requirements\n\n     Sec. 36.301  Eligibility criteria.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall not impose or \n     apply eligibility criteria that screen out or tend to screen \n     out an individual with a disability or any class of \n     individuals with disabilities from fully and equally enjoying \n     any goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n     accommodations, unless such criteria can be shown to be \n     necessary for the provision of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered.\n       (b) Safety. A public accommodation may impose legitimate \n     safety requirements that are necessary for safe operation. \n     Safety requirements must be based on actual risks and not on \n     mere speculation, stereotypes, or generalizations about \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       (c) Charges. A public accommodation may not impose a \n     surcharge on a particular individual with a disability or any \n     group of individuals with disabilities to cover the costs of \n     measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids, barrier \n     removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable \n     modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, that are \n     required to provide that individual or group with the \n     nondiscriminatory treatment required by the CAA or this part.\n     Sec. 36.302  Modifications in policies, practices, or \n         procedures.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall make reasonable \n     modifications in policies, practices, or procedures, when the \n     modifications are necessary to afford goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations to \n     individuals with disabilities, unless the public \n     accommodation can demonstrate that making the modifications \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\n       (b) Specialties--(1) General. A public accommodation may \n     refer an individual with a disability to another public \n     accommodation, if that individual is seeking, or requires, \n     treatment or services outside of the referring public \n     accommodation's area of specialization, and if, in the \n     normal course of its operations, the referring public \n     accommodation would make a similar referral for an \n     individual without a disability who seeks or requires the \n     same treatment or services.\n       (2) Illustration--medical specialties. A health care \n     provider may refer an individual with a disability to another \n     provider, if that individual is seeking, or requires, \n     treatment or services outside of the referring provider's \n     area of specialization, and if the referring provider would \n     make a similar referral for an individual without a \n     disability who seeks or requires the same treatment or \n     services. A physician who specializes in treating only a \n     particular condition cannot refuse to treat an individual \n     with a disability for that condition, but is not required to \n     treat the individual for a different condition.\n       (c) Service animals--(1) General. Generally, a public \n     accommodation shall modify policies, practices, or procedures \n     to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a \n     disability.\n       (2) Care or supervision of service animals. Nothing in this \n     part requires a public accommodation to supervise or care for \n     a service animal.\n       (d) Check-out aisles. A store with check-out aisles shall \n     ensure that an adequate number of accessible check-out aisles \n     is kept open during store hours, or shall otherwise modify \n     its policies and practices, in order to ensure that an \n     equivalent level of convenient service is provided to \n     individuals with disabilities as is provided to others. If \n     only one check-out aisle is accessible, and it is generally \n     used for express service, one way of providing equivalent \n     service is to allow persons with mobility impairments to make \n     all their purchases at that aisle.\n     Sec. 36.303 Auxiliary aids and services.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall take those steps \n     that may be necessary to ensure that no individual with a \n     disability is excluded, denied services, segregated or \n     otherwise treated differently than other individuals because \n     of the absence of auxiliary aids and services, unless the \n     public accommodation can demonstrate that taking those steps \n     would fundamentally alter the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered or would result in an undue burden, i.e., significant \n     difficulty or expense.\n       (b) Examples. The term ``auxiliary aids and service'' \n     includes--\n       (1) Qualified interpreters, notetakers, computer-aided \n     transcription services, written materials, telephone handset \n     amplifiers, assistive listening devices, assistive listening \n     systems, telephones compatible with hearing aids, closed \n     caption decoders, open and closed captioning, text telephones \n     (TTY's), videotext displays, or other effective methods of \n     making aurally delivered materials available to individuals \n     with hearing impairments;\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n       (2) Qualified readers, taped texts, audio recordings, \n     Brailled materials, large print materials, or other effective \n     methods of making visually delivered materials available to \n     individuals with visual impairments;\n       (3) Acquisition or modification of equipment or devices; \n     and\n       (4) Other similar services and actions.\n       (c) Effective communication. A public accommodation shall \n     furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where \n     necessary to ensure effective communication with individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       (d) Text telephones (TTY's). (1) A public accommodation \n     that offers a customer, client, patient, or participant the \n     opportunity to make outgoing telephone calls on more than \n     an incidental convenience basis shall make available, upon \n     request, a TTY for the use of an individual who has \n     impaired hearing or a communication disorder.\n       (2) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     use a TTY for receiving or making telephone calls incident to \n     its operations.\n       (f) Alternatives. If provision of a particular auxiliary \n     aid or service by a public accommodation would result in a \n     fundamental alteration in the nature of the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations being \n     offered or is an undue burden, i.e., significant difficulty \n     or expense, the public accommodation shall provide an \n     alternative auxiliary aid or service, if one exists, that \n     would not result in such an alteration or such burden but \n     would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent \n     possible, individuals with disabilities receive the goods, \n     services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or \n     accommodations offered by the public accommodation.\n     Sec. 36.304 Removal of barriers.\n       (a) General. A public accommodation shall remove \n     architectural barriers in existing facilities, including \n     communication barriers that are structural in nature, where \n     such removal is readily achievable, i.e., easily \n     accomplishable and able to be carried out without much \n     difficulty or expense.\n       (b) Examples. Examples of steps to remove barriers include, \n     but are not limited to, the following actions--\n       (1) Installing ramps;\n       (2) Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrances;\n       (3) Repositioning shelves;\n       (4) Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display \n     racks, and other furniture;\n       (5) Repositioning telephones;\n       (6) Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons;\n       (7) Installing flashing alarm lights;\n       (8) Widening doors;\n       (9) Installing offset hinges to widen doorways;\n       (10) Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative \n     accessible path;\n       (11) Installing accessible door hardware;\n       (12) Installing grab bars in toilet stalls;\n       (13) Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering \n     space;\n       (14) Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent \n     burns;\n       (15) Installing a raised toilet seat;\n       (16) Installing a full-length bathroom mirror;\n       (17) Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom;\n       (18) Creating designated accessible parking spaces;\n       (19) Installing an accessible paper cup dispenser at an \n     existing inaccessible water fountain;\n       (20) Removing high pile, low density carpeting; or\n       (21) Installing vehicle hand controls.\n       (c) Priorities. A public accommodation is urged to take \n     measures to comply with the barrier removal requirements of \n     this section in accordance with the following order of \n     priorities.\n       (1) First, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to a place of public accommodation from public \n     sidewalks, parking, or public transportation. These measures \n     include, for example, installing an entrance ramp, widening \n     entrances, and providing accessible parking spaces.\n       (2) Second, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to those areas of a place of public \n     accommodation where goods and services are made available to \n     the public. These measures include, for example, adjusting \n     the layout of display racks, rearranging tables, providing \n     Brailled and raised character signage, widening doors, \n     providing visual alarms, and installing ramps.\n       (3) Third, a public accommodation should take measures to \n     provide access to restroom facilities. These measures \n     include, for example, removal of obstructing furniture or \n     vending machines, widening of doors, installation of ramps, \n     providing accessible signage, widening of toilet stalls, and \n     installation of grab bars.\n       (4) Fourth, a public accommodation should take any other \n     measures necessary to provide access to the goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a \n     place of public accommodation.\n       (d) Relationship to alterations requirements of subpart D \n     of this part. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of \n     this section, measures taken to comply with the barrier \n     removal requirements of this section shall comply with the \n     applicable requirements for alterations in Sec. 36.402 and \n     Sec. Sec. 36.404-36.406 of this part for the element being \n     altered. The path of travel requirements of Sec. 36.403 shall \n     not apply to measures taken solely to comply with the barrier \n     removal requirements of this section.\n       (2) If, as a result of compliance with the alterations \n     requirements specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, \n     the measures required to remove a barrier would not be \n     readily achievable, a public accommodation may take other \n     readily achievable measures to remove the barrier that do not \n     fully comply with the specified requirements. Such measures \n     include, for example, providing a ramp with a steeper slope \n     or widening a doorway to a narrower width than that mandated \n     by the alterations requirements. No measure shall be taken, \n     however, that poses a significant risk to the health or \n     safety of individuals with disabilities or others.\n       (e) Portable ramps. Portable ramps should be used to comply \n     with this section only when installation of a permanent ramp \n     is not readily achievable. In order to avoid any significant \n     risk to the health or safety of individuals with disabilities \n     or others in using portable ramps, due consideration shall be \n     given to safety features such as nonslip surfaces, railings, \n     anchoring, and strength of materials.\n       (f) Selling or serving space. The rearrangement of \n     temporary or movable structures, such as furniture, \n     equipment, and display racks is not readily achievable to the \n     extent that it results in a significant loss of selling or \n     serving space.\n       (g) Limitation on barrier removal obligations. (1) The \n     requirements for barrier removal under Sec. 36.304 shall not \n     be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations in \n     subpart D of this part.\n       (2) To the extent that relevant standards for alterations \n     are not provided in subpart D of this part, then the \n     requirements of Sec. 36.304 shall not be interpreted to \n     exceed the standards for new construction in subpart D of \n     this part.\n       (3) This section does not apply to rolling stock and other \n     conveyances to the extent that Sec. 36.310 applies to rolling \n     stock and other conveyances.\n     Sec. 36.305 Alternatives to barrier removal.\n       (a) General. Where a public accommodation can demonstrate \n     that barrier removal is not readily achievable, the public \n     accommodation shall not fail to make its goods, services, \n     facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \n     available through alternative methods, if those methods are \n     readily achievable.\n       (b) Examples. Examples of alternatives to barrier removal \n     include, but are not limited to, the following actions--\n       (1) Providing curb service or home delivery;\n       (2) Retrieving merchandise from inaccessible shelves or \n     racks;\n       (3) Relocating activities to accessible locations;\n       (c) Multiscreen cinemas. If it is not readily achievable to \n     remove barriers to provide access by persons with mobility \n     impairments to all of the theaters of a multiscreen cinema, \n     the cinema shall establish a film rotation schedule that \n     provides reasonable access for individuals who use \n     wheelchairs to all films. Reasonable notice shall be provided \n     to the public as to the location and time of accessible \n     showings.\n     Sec. 36.306 Personal devices and services.\n       This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     provide its customers, clients, or participants with personal \n     devices, such as wheelchairs; individually prescribed \n     devices, such as prescription eyeglasses or hearing aids; or \n     services of a personal nature including assistance in eating, \n     toileting, or dressing.\n     Sec. 36.307 Accessible or special goods.\n       (a) This part does not require a public accommodation to \n     alter its inventory to include accessible or special goods \n     that are designed for, or facilitate use by, individuals with \n     disabilities.\n       (b) A public accommodation shall order accessible or \n     special goods at the request of an individual with \n     disabilities, if, in the normal course of its operation, it \n     makes special orders on request for unstocked goods, and if \n     the accessible or special goods can be obtained from a \n     supplier with whom the public accommodation customarily does \n     business.\n       (c) Examples of accessible or special goods include items \n     such as Brailled versions of books, books on audio cassettes, \n     closed-captioned video tapes, special sizes or lines of \n     clothing, and special foods to meet particular dietary needs.\n     Sec. 36.308 Seating in assembly areas.\n       (a) Existing facilities. (1) To the extent that it is \n     readily achievable, a public accommodation in assembly areas \n     shall--\n       (i) Provide a reasonable number of wheelchair seating \n     spaces and seats with removable aisle-side arm rests; and\n       (ii) Locate the wheelchair seating spaces so that they--\n        (A) Are dispersed throughout the seating area;\n        (B) Provide lines of sight and choice of admission prices \n     comparable to those for members of the general public;\n        (C) Adjoin an accessible route that also serves as a means \n     of egress in case of emergency; and\n        (D) Permit individuals who use wheelchairs to sit with \n     family members or other companions.\n       (2) If removal of seats is not readily achievable, a public \n     accommodation shall provide, to the extent that it is readily \n     achievable to do so, a portable chair or other means to \n     permit a family member or other companion to sit with an \n     individual who uses a wheelchair.\n       (3) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section shall \n     not be interpreted to exceed the standards for alterations in \n     subpart D of this part.\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\n       (b) New construction and alterations. The provision and \n     location of wheelchair seating spaces in newly constructed or \n     altered assembly areas shall be governed by the standards for \n     new construction and alterations in subpart D of this part.\n     Sec. 36.309 Examinations and courses.\n       (a) General. Any covered entity that offers examinations or \n     courses related to applications, licensing, certification, or \n     credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, \n     professional, or trade purposes shall offer such examinations \n     or courses in a place and manner accessible to persons with \n     disabilities or offer alternative accessible arrangements for \n     such individuals.\n       (b) Examinations. (1) Any covered entity offering an \n     examination covered by this section must assure that--\n       (i) The examination is selected and administered so as to \n     best ensure that, when the examination is administered to an \n     individual with a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or \n     speaking skills, the examination results accurately reflect \n     the individual's aptitude or achievement level or whatever \n     other factor the examination purports to measure, rather than \n     reflecting the individual's impaired sensory, manual, or \n     speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors \n     that the examination purports to measure);\n       (ii) An examination that is designed for individuals with \n     impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills is offered at \n     equally convenient locations, as often, and in as timely a \n     manner as are other examinations; and\n       (iii) The examination is administered in facilities that \n     are accessible to individuals with disabilities or \n     alternative accessible arrangements are made.\n       (2) Required modifications to an examination may include \n     changes in the length of time permitted for completion of the \n     examination and adaptation of the manner in which the \n     examination is given.\n       (3) A covered entity offering an examination covered by \n     this section shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids for \n     persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, \n     unless that covered entity can demonstrate that offering a \n     particular auxiliary aid would fundamentally alter the \n     measurement of the skills or knowledge the examination is \n     intended to test or would result in an undue burden. \n     Auxiliary aids and services required by this section may \n     include taped examinations, interpreters or other effective \n     methods of making orally delivered materials available to \n     individuals with hearing impairments, Brailled or large print \n     examinations and answer sheets or qualified readers for \n     individuals with visual impairments or learning disabilities, \n     transcribers for individuals with manual impairments, and \n     other similar services and actions.\n       (4) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for \n     example, provision of an examination at an individual's home \n     with a proctor if accessible facilities or equipment are \n     unavailable. Alternative arrangements must provide comparable \n     conditions to those provided for nondisabled individuals.\n       (c) Courses. (1) Any covered entity that offers a course \n     covered by this section must make such modifications to that \n     course as are necessary to ensure that the place and \n     manner in which the course is given are accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) Required modifications may include changes in the \n     length of time permitted for the completion of the course, \n     substitution of specific requirements, or adaptation of the \n     manner in which the course is conducted or course materials \n     are distributed.\n       (3) A covered entity that offers a course covered by this \n     section shall provide appropriate auxiliary aids and services \n     for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking \n     skills, unless the covered entity can demonstrate that \n     offering a particular auxiliary aid or service would \n     fundamentally alter the course or would result in an undue \n     burden. Auxiliary aids and services required by this section \n     may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective \n     methods of making orally delivered materials available to \n     individuals with hearing impairments, Brailled or large print \n     texts or qualified readers for individuals with visual \n     impairments and learning disabilities, classroom equipment \n     adapted for use by individuals with manual impairments, and \n     other similar services and actions.\n       (4) Courses must be administered in facilities that are \n     accessible to individuals with disabilities or alternative \n     accessible arrangements must be made.\n       (5) Alternative accessible arrangements may include, for \n     example, provision of the course through videotape, \n     cassettes, or prepared notes. Alternative arrangements must \n     provide comparable conditions to those provided for \n     nondisabled individuals.\n     Sec. 36.310 Transportation provided by public accommodations.\n       (a) General. (1) A public accommodation that provides \n     transportation services, but that is not primarily engaged in \n     the business of transporting people, is subject to the \n     general and specific provisions in subparts B, C, and D of \n     this part for its transportation operations, except as \n     provided in this section.\n       (2) Examples. Transportation services subject to this \n     section include, but are not limited to, shuttle services \n     operated between transportation terminals and places of \n     public accommodation and customer shuttle bus services \n     operated by covered entities\n       (b) Barrier removal. A public accommodation subject to this \n     section shall remove transportation barriers in existing \n     vehicles and rail passenger cars used for transporting \n     individuals (not including barriers that can only be removed \n     through the retrofitting of vehicles or rail passenger cars \n     by the installation of a hydraulic or other lift) where such \n     removal is readily achievable.\n       (c) Requirements for vehicles and systems. A public \n     accommodation subject to this section shall comply with the \n     requirements pertaining to vehicles and transportation \n     systems in the regulations issued by the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. Sec. 36.311-36.400 [Reserved]\n\n\n              Subpart D--New Construction and Alterations\n\n     Sec. 36.401 New construction.\n       (a) General. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and \n     (c) of this section, discrimination for purposes of this part \n     includes a failure to design and construct facilities for \n     first occupancy after July 23, 1997, that are readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) For purposes of this section, a facility is designed \n     and constructed for first occupancy after July 23, 1997, \n     only--\n       (i) If the last application for a building permit or permit \n     extension for the facility is certified to be complete, by an \n     appropriate governmental authority after January 1, 1997 (or, \n     in those jurisdictions where the government does not certify \n     completion of applications, if the last application for a \n     building permit or permit extension for the facility is \n     received by the appropriate governmental authority after \n     January 1, 1997); and\n       (ii) If the first certificate of occupancy for the facility \n     is issued after July 23, 1997.\n       (b) Place of public accommodation located in private \n     residences. (1) When a place of public accommodation is \n     located in a private residence, the portion of the residence \n     used exclusively as a residence is not covered by this \n     subpart, but that portion used exclusively in the operation \n     of the place of public accommodation or that portion used \n     both for the place of public accommodation and for \n     residential purposes is covered by the new construction and \n     alterations requirements of this subpart.\n       (2) The portion of the residence covered under paragraph \n     (b)(1) of this section extends to those elements used to \n     enter the place of public accommodation, including the \n     homeowner's front sidewalk, if any, the door or entryway, and \n     hallways; and those portions of the residence, interior or \n     exterior, available to or used by employees or visitors of \n     the place of public accommodation, including restrooms.\n       (c) Exception for structural impracticability. (1) Full \n     compliance with the requirements of this section is not \n     required where an entity can demonstrate that it is \n     structurally impracticable to meet the requirements. Full \n     compliance will be considered structurally impracticable only \n     in those rare circumstances when the unique characteristics \n     of terrain prevent the incorporation of accessibility \n     features.\n       (2) If full compliance with this section would be \n     structurally impracticable, compliance with this section is \n     required to the extent that it is not structurally \n     impracticable. In that case, any portion of the facility that \n     can be made accessible shall be made accessible to the extent \n     that it is not structurally impracticable.\n       (3) If providing accessibility in conformance with this \n     section to individuals with certain disabilities (e.g., those \n     who use wheelchairs) would be structurally impracticable, \n     accessibility shall nonetheless be ensured to persons with \n     other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use crutches or \n     who have sight, hearing, or mental impairments) in accordance \n     with this section.\n       (d) Elevator exemption. (1) For purposes of this paragraph \n     (d)--\n       Professional office of a health care provider means a \n     location where a person or entity regulated by a State to \n     provide professional services related to the physical or \n     mental health of an individual makes such services available \n     to the public. The facility housing the ``professional office \n     of a health care provider'' only includes floor levels \n     housing at least one health care provider, or any floor level \n     designed or intended for use by at least one health care \n     provider.\n       (2) This section does not require the installation of an \n     elevator in a facility that is less than three stories or has \n     less than 3000 square feet per story, except with respect to \n     any facility that houses one or more of the following:\n       (i) A professional office of a health care provider.\n       (ii) A terminal, depot, or other station used for specified \n     public transportation. In such a facility, any area housing \n     passenger services, including boarding and debarking, loading \n     and unloading, baggage claim, dining facilities, and other \n     common areas open to the public, must be on an accessible \n     route from an accessible entrance.\n       (3) The elevator exemption set forth in this paragraph (d) \n     does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply \n     with the other accessibility requirements established in \n     paragraph (a) of this section. For example, in a facility \n     that houses a professional office of a health care provider, \n     the floors that are above or below an accessible ground floor \n     and that do not house a professional office of a health care \n     provider, must meet the requirements of this section but for \n     the elevator.\n     Sec. 36.402 Alterations.\n       (a) General. (1) Any alteration to a place of public \n     accommodation, after January 1, 1997,\n\n[[Page S11000]]\n\n     shall be made so as to ensure that, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, the altered portions of the facility are readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n       (2) An alteration is deemed to be undertaken after January \n     1, 1997, if the physical alteration of the property begins \n     after that date.\n       (b) Alteration. For the purposes of this part, an \n     alteration is a change to a place of public accommodation \n     that affects or could affect the usability of the building or \n     facility or any part thereof.\n       (1) Alterations include, but are not limited to, \n     remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, \n     historic restoration, changes or rearrangement in structural \n     parts or elements, and changes or rearrangement in the plan \n     configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal \n     maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos \n     removal, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are \n     not alterations unless they affect the usability of the \n     building or facility.\n       (2) If existing elements, spaces, or common areas are \n     altered, then each such altered element, space, or area shall \n     comply with the applicable provisions of appendix A to this \n     part.\n       (c) To the maximum extent feasible. The phrase ``to the \n     maximum extent feasible,'' as used in this section, applies \n     to the occasional case where the nature of an existing \n     facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with \n     applicable accessibility standards through a planned \n     alteration. In these circumstances, the alteration shall \n     provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any \n     altered features of the facility that can be made accessible \n     shall be made accessible. If providing accessibility in \n     conformance with this section to individuals with certain \n     disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be \n     feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons \n     with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who use \n     crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or those \n     who have other impairments).\n     Sec. 36.403 Alterations: Path of travel.\n       (a) General. An alteration that affects or could affect the \n     usability of or access to an area of a facility that contains \n     a primary function shall be made so as to ensure that, to the \n     maximum extent feasible, the path of travel to the altered \n     area and the restrooms, telephones, and drinking fountains \n     serving the altered area, are readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the cost and scope of \n     such alterations is disproportionate to the cost of the \n     overall alteration.\n       (b) Primary function. A primary function is a major \n     activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that \n     contain a primary function include, but are not limited to, \n     the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a \n     cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, as well \n     as offices and other work areas in which the activities of \n     the public accommodation or other covered entity using the \n     facility are carried out. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, \n     supply storage rooms, employee lounges or locker rooms, \n     janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms \n     are not areas containing a primary function.\n       (c) Alterations to an area containing a primary function. \n     (1) Alterations that affect the usability of or access to an \n     area containing a primary function include, but are not \n     limited to--\n       (i) Remodeling merchandise display areas or employee work \n     areas in a department store;\n       (ii) Replacing an inaccessible floor surface in the \n     customer service or employee work areas of a bank;\n       (iii) Redesigning the assembly line area of a factory; or\n       (iv) Installing a computer center in an accounting firm.\n       (2) For the purposes of this section, alterations to \n     windows, hardware, controls, electrical outlets, and signage \n     shall not be deemed to be alterations that affect the \n     usability of or access to an area containing a primary \n     function.\n       (d) Path of travel. (1) A ``path of travel'' includes a \n     continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means \n     of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and \n     exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior \n     approach (including sidewalks, streets, and parking areas), \n     an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility.\n       (2) An accessible path of travel may consist of walks and \n     sidewalks, curb ramps and other interior or exterior \n     pedestrian ramps; clear floor paths through lobbies, \n     corridors, rooms, and other improved areas; parking access \n     aisles; elevators and lifts; or a combination of these \n     elements.\n       (3) For the purposes of this part, the term ``path of \n     travel'' also includes the restrooms, telephones, and \n     drinking fountains serving the altered area.\n       (e) Disproportionality. (1) Alterations made to provide an \n     accessible path of travel to the altered area will be deemed \n     disproportionate to the overall alteration when the cost \n     exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary \n     function area.\n       (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to \n     provide an accessible path of travel may include:\n       (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance \n     and an accessible route to the altered area, for example, the \n     cost of widening doorways or installing ramps;\n       (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible, \n     such as installing grab bars, enlarging toilet stalls, \n     insulating pipes, or installing accessible faucet controls;\n       (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible \n     telephones, such as relocating the telephone to an accessible \n     height, installing amplification devices, or installing a \n     text telephone (TTY);\n       (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible \n     drinking fountain.\n       (f) Duty to provide accessible features in the event of \n     disproportionality. (1) When the cost of alterations \n     necessary to make the path of travel to the altered area \n     fully accessible is disproportionate to the cost of the \n     overall alteration, the path of travel shall be made \n     accessible to the extent that it can be made accessible \n     without incurring disproportionate costs.\n       (2) In choosing which accessible elements to provide, \n     priority should be given to those elements that will provide \n     the greatest access, in the following order:\n       (i) An accessible entrance;\n       (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;\n       (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a \n     single unisex restroom;\n       (iv) Accessible telephones;\n       (v) Accessible drinking fountains; and\n       (vi) When possible, additional accessible elements such as \n     parking, storage, and alarms.\n       (g) Series of smaller alterations. (1) The obligation to \n     provide an accessible path of travel may not be evaded by \n     performing a series of small alterations to the area served \n     by a single path of travel if those alterations could have \n     been performed as a single undertaking.\n       (2)(i) If an area containing a primary function has been \n     altered without providing an accessible path of travel to \n     that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a \n     different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken \n     within three years of the original alteration, the total cost \n     of alterations to the primary function areas on that path of \n     travel during the preceding three year period shall be \n     considered in determining whether the cost of making that \n     path of travel accessible is disproportionate.\n       (ii) Only alterations undertaken after January 1, 1997, \n     shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing \n     an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the \n     overall cost of the alterations.\n     Sec. 36.404 Alterations: Elevator exemption.\n       (a) This section does not require the installation of an \n     elevator in an altered facility that is less than three \n     stories or has less than 3,000 square feet per story, except \n     with respect to any facility that houses the professional \n     office of a health care provider, a terminal, depot, or other \n     station used for specified public transportation.\n       For the purposes of this section, ``professional office of \n     a health care provider'' means a location where a person or \n     entity employed by a covered entity and/or regulated by a \n     State to provide professional services related to the \n     physical or mental health of an individual makes such \n     services available to the public.

In these circumstances, the entity shall \n     provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any \n     altered features of the facility or portion of the facility \n     that can be made accessible shall be made accessible. If \n     providing accessibility to certain individuals with \n     disabilities (e.g., those who use wheelchairs) would not be \n     feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to \n     individuals with other types of disabilities (e.g., those who \n     use crutches, those who have impaired vision or hearing, or \n     those who have other impairments).\n       (c) As used in this section, a primary function is a major \n     activity for which the facility is intended. Areas of \n     transportation facilities that involve primary functions \n     include, but are not necessarily limited to, ticket purchase \n     and collection areas, passenger waiting areas, train or bus \n     platforms, baggage checking and return areas and employment \n     areas (except those involving non-occupiable spaces accessed \n     only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, vary narrow \n     passageways, or freight [non-passenger] elevators which are \n     frequented only by repair personnel).\n       (d) As used in this section, a path of travel includes a \n     continuous, unobstructed way of pedestrian passage by means \n     of which the altered area may be approached, entered, and \n     exited, and which connects the altered area with an exterior \n     approach (including sidewalks, parking areas, and streets), \n     an entrance to the facility, and other parts of the facility. \n     The term also includes the restrooms, telephones, and \n     drinking fountains serving the altered area. An accessible \n     path of travel may include walks and sidewalks, curb ramps \n     and other interior or exterior pedestrian ramps, clear \n     floor paths through corridors, waiting areas, concourses, \n     and other improved areas, parking access aisles, elevators \n     and lifts, bridges, tunnels, or other passageways between \n     platforms, or a combination of these and other elements.\n       (e)(1) Alterations made to provide an accessible path of \n     travel to the altered area will be deemed disproportionate to \n     the overall alteration when the cost exceeds 20 percent of \n     the cost of the alteration to the primary function area \n     (without regard to the costs of accessibility modifications).\n       (2) Costs that may be counted as expenditures required to \n     provide an accessible path of travel include:\n       (i) Costs associated with providing an accessible entrance \n     and an accessible route to the altered area (e.g., widening \n     doorways and installing ramps);\n       (ii) Costs associated with making restrooms accessible \n     (e.g., grab bars, enlarged toilet stalls, accessible faucet \n     controls);\n       (iii) Costs associated with providing accessible telephones \n     (e.g., relocation of phones to an accessible height, \n     installation of amplification devices or TTYs);\n       (iv) Costs associated with relocating an inaccessible \n     drinking fountain.\n       (f)(1) When the cost of alterations necessary to make a \n     path of travel to the altered area fully accessible is \n     disproportionate to the cost of the overall alteration, then\n\n[[Page S11005]]\n\n     such areas shall be made accessible to the maximum extent \n     without resulting in disproportionate costs;\n       (2) In this situation, the public entity should give \n     priority to accessible elements that will provide the \n     greatest access, in the following order:\n       (i) An accessible entrance;\n       (ii) An accessible route to the altered area;\n       (iii) At least one accessible restroom for each sex or a \n     single unisex restroom (where there are one or more \n     restrooms);\n       (iv) Accessible telephones;\n       (v) Accessible drinking fountains;\n       (vi) When possible, other accessible elements (e.g., \n     parking, storage, alarms).\n       (g) If a public entity performs a series of small \n     alterations to the area served by a single path of travel \n     rather than making the alterations as part of a single \n     undertaking, it shall nonetheless be responsible for \n     providing an accessible path of travel.\n       (h)(1) If an area containing a primary function has been \n     altered without providing an accessible path of travel to \n     that area, and subsequent alterations of that area, or a \n     different area on the same path of travel, are undertaken \n     within three years of the original alteration, the total cost \n     of alteration to the primary function areas on that path of \n     travel during the preceding three year period shall be \n     considered in determining whether the cost of making that \n     path of travel is disproportionate;\n       (2) For the first three years after January 1, 1997, only \n     alterations undertaken between that date and the date of the \n     alteration at issue shall be considered in determining if the \n     cost of providing accessible features is disproportionate to \n     the overall cost of the alteration.\n       (3) Only alterations undertaken after January 1, 1997, \n     shall be considered in determining if the cost of providing \n     an accessible path of travel is disproportionate to the \n     overall cost of the alteration.\n     Sec. 37.45  Construction and alteration of transportation \n         facilities by covered entities.\n       In constructing and altering transit facilities, covered \n     entities shall comply with the regulations of the Board \n     implementing title III of the ADA, as applied by section 210 \n     of the CAA (part 36).\n     Sec. 37.47  Key stations in light and rapid rail systems.\n       (a) Each public entity that provides designated public \n     transportation by means of a light or rapid rail system shall \n     make key stations on its system readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs. This requirement is separate \n     from and in addition to requirements set forth in Sec. 37.43 \n     of this part.\n       (b) Each public entity shall determine which stations on \n     its system are key stations. The entity shall identify key \n     stations, using the planning and public participation process \n     set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, and taking into \n     consideration the following criteria:\n       (1) Stations where passenger boardings exceed average \n     station passenger boardings on the rail system by at least \n     fifteen percent, unless such a station is close to another \n     accessible station;\n       (2) Transfer stations on a rail line or between rail lines;\n       (3) Major interchange points with other transportation \n     modes, including stations connecting with major parking \n     facilities, bus terminals, intercity or commuter rail \n     stations, passenger vessel terminals, or airports;\n       (4) End stations, unless an end station is close to another \n     accessible station; and\n       (5) Stations serving major activity centers, such as \n     employment or government centers, institutions of higher \n     education, hospitals or other major health care facilities, \n     or other facilities that are major trip generators for \n     individuals with disabilities.\n       (c) (1) Unless an entity receives an extension under \n     paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the public entity shall \n     achieve accessibility of key stations as soon as practicable, \n     but in no case later than January 1, 2000, except that an \n     entity is not required to complete installation of detectable \n     warnings required by section 10.3.2(2) of appendix A to this \n     part until January 1, 2001.\n       (2) The General Counsel may grant an extension of this \n     completion date for key station accessibility for a period up \n     to January 1, 2025, provided that two-thirds of key stations \n     are made accessible by January 1, 2015. Extensions may be \n     granted as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.\n       (d) The public entity shall develop a plan for compliance \n     for this section. The plan shall be submitted to the General \n     Counsel's office by July 1, 1997.\n       (1) The public entity shall consult with individuals with \n     disabilities affected by the plan. The public entity also \n     shall hold at least one public hearing on the plan and \n     solicit comments on it. The plan submitted to General Counsel \n     shall document this public participation, including summaries \n     of the consultation with individuals with disabilities and \n     the comments received at the hearing and during the comment \n     period. The plan also shall summarize the public entity's \n     responses to the comments and consultation.\n       (2) The plan shall establish milestones for the achievement \n     of required accessibility of key stations, consistent with \n     the requirements of this section.\n       (e) A public entity wishing to apply for an extension of \n     the January 1, 2000, deadline for key station accessibility \n     shall include a request for an extension with its plan \n     submitted to the General Counsel under paragraph (d) of this \n     section. Extensions may be granted only with respect to key \n     stations which need extraordinarily expensive structural \n     changes to, or replacement of, existing facilities (e.g., \n     installations of elevators, raising the entire passenger \n     platform, or alterations of similar magnitude and cost). \n     Requests for extensions shall provide for completion of key \n     station accessibility within the time limits set forth in \n     paragraph (c) of this section. The General Counsel may \n     approve, approve with conditions, modify, or disapprove any \n     request for an extension.\n     Sec. Sec. 37.49-37.59  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 37.61  Public transportation programs and activities in \n         existing facilities.\n       (a) A public entity shall operate a designated public \n     transportation program or activity conducted in an existing \n     facility so that, when viewed in its entirety, the program or \n     activity is readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities.\n       (b) This section does not require a public entity to make \n     structural changes to existing facilities in order to make \n     the facilities accessible by individuals who use wheelchairs, \n     unless and to the extent required by Sec. 37.43 (with respect \n     to alterations) or Sec. 37.47 of this part (with respect to \n     key stations). Entities shall comply with other applicable \n     accessibility requirements for such facilities.\n       (c) Public entities, with respect to facilities that, as \n     provided in paragraph (b) of this section, are not required \n     to be made accessible to individuals who use wheelchairs, are \n     not required to provide to such individuals services made \n     available to the general public at such facilities when the \n     individuals could not utilize or benefit from the services.\n     Sec. Sec. 37.63-37.69  [Reserved]\n\n\n   Subpart D--Acquisition of Accessible Vehicles by Public Entities.\n\n     Sec. 37.71  Purchase or lease of new non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating fixed route systems.\n       (a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each \n     public entity operating a fixed route system making a \n     solicitation after January 31, 1997, to purchase or lease a \n     new bus or other new vehicle for use on the system, shall \n     ensure that the vehicle is readily accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who \n     use wheelchairs.\n       (b) A public entity may purchase or lease a new bus that is \n     not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, if \n     it applies for, and the General Counsel grants, a waiver as \n     provided for in this section.\n       (c) Before submitting a request for such a waiver, the \n     public entity shall hold at least one public hearing \n     concerning the proposed request.\n       (d) The General Counsel may grant a request for such a \n     waiver if the public entity demonstrates to the General \n     Counsel's satisfaction that--\n       (1) The initial solicitation for new buses made by the \n     public entity specified that all new buses were to be lift-\n     equipped and were to be otherwise accessible to and usable \n     by individuals with disabilities;\n       (2) Hydraulic, electromechanical, or other lifts for such \n     new buses could not be provided by any qualified lift \n     manufacturer to the manufacturer of such new buses in \n     sufficient time to comply with the solicitation; and\n       (3) Any further delay in purchasing new buses equipped with \n     such necessary lifts would significantly impair \n     transportation services in the community served by the public \n     entity.\n       (e) The public entity shall include with its waiver request \n     a copy of the initial solicitation and written documentation \n     from the bus manufacturer of its good faith efforts to obtain \n     lifts in time to comply with the solicitation, and a full \n     justification for the assertion that the delay in bus \n     procurement needed to obtain a lift-equipped bus would \n     significantly impair transportation services in the \n     community. This documentation shall include a specific date \n     at which the lifts could be supplied, copies of \n     advertisements in trade publications and inquiries to trade \n     associations seeking lifts, and documentation of the public \n     hearing.\n       (f) Any waiver granted by the General Counsel under this \n     section shall be subject to the following conditions:\n       (1) The waiver shall apply only to the particular bus \n     delivery to which the waiver request pertains;\n       (2) The waiver shall include a termination date, which will \n     be based on information concerning when lifts will become \n     available for installation on the new buses the public entity \n     is purchasing. Buses delivered after this date, even though \n     procured under a solicitation to which a waiver applied, \n     shall be equipped with lifts;\n       (3) Any bus obtained subject to the waiver shall be capable \n     of accepting a lift, and the public entity shall install a \n     lift as soon as soon as one becomes available;\n       (4) Such other terms and conditions as the General Counsel \n     may impose.\n       (g)(1) When the General Counsel grants a waiver under this \n     section, he/she shall promptly notify any appropriate \n     committees of Congress.\n       (2) If the General Counsel has reasonable cause to believe \n     that a public entity fraudulently applied for a waiver under \n     this section, the General Counsel shall:\n\n[[Page S11006]]\n\n       (i) Cancel the waiver if it is still in effect; and\n       (ii) Take other appropriate action.\n     Sec. 37.73  Purchase or lease of used non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating a fixed route system.\n       (a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each \n     public entity operating a fixed route system purchasing or \n     leasing, after January 31, 1997, a used bus or other used \n     vehicle for use on the system, shall ensure that the vehicle \n     is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n       (b) A public entity may purchase or lease a used vehicle \n     for use on its fixed route system that is not readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if, \n     after making demonstrated good faith efforts to obtain an \n     accessible vehicle, it is unable to do so.\n       (c) Good faith efforts shall include at least the following \n     steps:\n        (1) An initial solicitation for used vehicles specifying \n     that all used vehicles are to be lift-equipped and otherwise \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     or, if an initial solicitation is not used, a documented \n     communication so stating;\n        (2) A nationwide search for accessible vehicles, involving \n     specific inquiries to used vehicle dealers and other transit \n     providers; and\n        (3) Advertising in trade publications and contacting trade \n     associations.\n        (d) Each public entity purchasing or leasing used vehicles \n     that are not readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities shall retain documentation of the specific \n     good faith efforts it made for three years from the date the \n     vehicles were purchased. These records shall be made \n     available, on request, to the General Counsel and the public.\n      Sec. 37.75  Remanufacture of non-rail vehicles and purchase \n         or lease of remanufactured non-rail vehicles by public \n         entities operating fixed route systems.\n        (a) This section applies to any public entity operating a \n     fixed route system which takes one of the following actions:\n       (1) After January 31, 1997, remanufactures a bus or other \n     vehicle so as to extend its useful life for five years or \n     more or makes a solicitation for such remanufacturing; or\n        (2) Purchases or leases a bus or other vehicle which has \n     been remanufactured so as to extend its useful life for five \n     years or more, where the purchase or lease occurs after \n     January 31, 1997, and during the period in which the useful \n     life of the vehicle is extended.\n        (b) Vehicles acquired through the actions listed in \n     paragraph (a) of this section shall, to the maximum extent \n     feasible, be readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n        (c) For purposes of this section, it shall be considered \n     feasible to remanufacture a bus or other motor vehicle so as \n     to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with \n     disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, \n     unless an engineering analysis demonstrates that including \n     accessibility features required by this part would have a \n     significant adverse effect on the structural integrity of the \n     vehicle.\n        (d) If a public entity operates a fixed route system, any \n     segment of which is included on the National Register of \n     Historic Places, and if making a vehicle of historic \n     character used solely on such segment readily accessible to \n     and usable by individuals with disabilities would \n     significantly alter the historic character of such vehicle, \n     the public entity has only to make (or purchase or lease a \n     remanufactured vehicle with) those modifications to make the \n     vehicle accessible which do not alter the historic character \n     of such vehicle, in consultation with the National Register \n     of Historic Places.\n        (e) A public entity operating a fixed route system as \n     described in paragraph (d) of this section may apply in \n     writing to the General Counsel for a determination of the \n     historic character of the vehicle. The General Counsel shall \n     refer such requests to the National Register of Historic \n     Places, and shall rely on its advice in making determinations \n     of the historic character of the vehicle.\n      Sec. 37.77  Purchase or lease of new non-rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating a demand responsive system for \n         the general public.\n        (a) Except as provided in this section, a public entity \n     operating a demand responsive system for the general public \n     making a solicitation after January 31, 1997, to  purchase or \n     lease a new bus or other new vehicle for use on the \n     system, shall ensure that the vehicle is readily \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     including individuals who use wheelchairs.\n        (b) If the system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a \n     level of service to individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, equivalent to the level of \n     service it provides to individuals without disabilities, it \n     may purchase new vehicles that are not readily accessible to \n     and usable by individuals with disabilities.\n        (c) For purposes of this section, a demand responsive \n     system, when viewed in its entirety, shall be deemed to \n     provide equivalent service if the service available to \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs, is provided in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate to the needs of the individual and is equivalent \n     to the service provided other individuals with respect to the \n     following service characteristics:\n        (1) Response time;\n        (2) Fares;\n        (3) Geographic area of service;\n        (4) Hours and days of service;\n        (5) Restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose;\n        (6) Availability of information and reservations \n     capability; and\n        (7) Any constraints on capacity or service availability.\n        (d) A public entity, which determines that its service to \n     individuals with disabilities is equivalent to that provided \n     other persons shall, before any procurement of an \n     inaccessible vehicle, make a certificate that it provides \n     equivalent service meeting the standards of paragraph (c) of \n     this section. A public entity shall make such a certificate \n     and retain it in its files, subject to inspection on request \n     of the General Counsel. All certificates under this paragraph \n     may be made in connection with a particular procurement or in \n     advance of a procurement; however, no certificate shall be \n     valid for more than one year.\n        (e) The waiver mechanism set forth in Sec. 37.71(b)-(g) \n     (unavailability of lifts) of this subpart shall also be \n     available to public entities operating a demand responsive \n     system for the general public.\n      Sec. 37.79  Purchase or lease of new rail vehicles by public \n         entities operating rapid or light rail systems.\n        Each public entity operating a rapid or light rail system \n     making a solicitation after January 31, 1997, to purchase or \n     lease a new rapid or light rail vehicle for use on the system \n     shall ensure that the vehicle is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs.\n      Sec. 37.81  Purchase or lease of used rail vehicles by \n         public entities operating rapid or light rail systems.\n        (a) Except as provided elsewhere in this section, each \n     public entity operating a rapid or light rail system which, \n     after January 31, 1997, purchases or leases a used rapid or \n     light rail vehicle for use on the system shall ensure that \n     the vehicle is readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs.\n        (b) A public entity may purchase or lease a used rapid or \n     light rail vehicle for use on its rapid or light rail system \n     that is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals \n     if, after making demonstrated good faith efforts to obtain an \n     accessible vehicle, it is unable to do so.\n       (c) Good faith efforts shall include at least the following \n     steps:\n       (1) The initial solicitation for used vehicles made by the \n     public entity specifying that all used vehicles were to be \n     accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, \n     or, if a solicitation is not used, a documented communication \n     so stating;\n       (2) A nationwide search for accessible vehicles, involving \n     specific inquiries to manufacturers and other transit \n     providers; and\n       (3) Advertising in trade publications and contacting trade \n     associations.\n       (d) Each public entity purchasing or leasing used rapid or \n     light rail vehicles that are not readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities shall retain \n     documentation of the specific good faith efforts it made for \n     three years from the date the vehicles were purchased.

If the \n     entity operates a fixed route system and purchases or leases \n     a vehicle with a seating capacity of over 16 passengers \n     (including the driver) for use on the system, it shall ensure \n     that the vehicle is readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use \n     wheelchairs.\n       (c) Fixed Route System, Vehicle Capacity of 16 or Fewer. If \n     the entity operates a fixed route system and purchases or \n     leases a vehicle with a seating capacity of 16 or fewer \n     passengers (including the driver) for use on the system, it \n     shall ensure that the vehicle is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the system, when \n     viewed in its entirety, meets the standard for equivalent \n     service of Sec. 37.105 of this part.\n       (d) Demand Responsive System, Vehicle Capacity Over 16. If \n     the entity operates a demand responsive system, and purchases \n     or leases a vehicle with a seating capacity of over 16 \n     passengers (including the driver) for use on the system, it \n     shall ensure that the vehicle is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities, including \n     individuals who use wheelchairs, unless the system, when \n     viewed in its entirety, meets the standard for equivalent \n     service of Sec. 37.105 of this part.\n       (e) Demand Responsive System, Vehicle Capacity of 16 or \n     Fewer. Entities providing demand responsive transportation \n     covered under this section are not specifically required to \n     ensure that new vehicles with seating capacity of 16 or fewer \n     are accessible to individuals with wheelchairs. These \n     entities are required to ensure that their systems, when \n     viewed in their entirety, meet the equivalent service \n     requirements of Sec. Sec. 37.171 and 37.105, regardless of \n     whether or not the entities purchase a new vehicle.\n     Sec. 37.103  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 37.105  Equivalent service standard.\n       For purposes of Sec.  37.101 of this part, a fixed route \n     system or demand responsive system, when viewed in its \n     entirety, shall be deemed to provide equivalent service if \n     the service available to individuals with disabilities, \n     including individuals who use wheelchairs, is provided in \n     the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of \n     the individual and is equivalent to the service provided \n     other individuals with respect to the following service \n     characteristics:\n       (a) (1) Schedules/headways (if the system is fixed route);\n       (2) Response time (if the system is demand responsive);\n       (b) Fares;\n       (c) Geographic area of service;\n       (d) Hours and days of service;\n       (e) Availability of information;\n       (f) Reservations capability (if the system is demand \n     responsive);\n       (g) Any constraints on capacity or service availability;\n       (h) Restrictions priorities based on trip purpose (if the \n     system is demand responsive).\n     Sec.

Sec. 37.123-37.133 of this subpart. The requirement \n     to comply with Sec. 37.131 may be modified in accordance with \n     the provisions of this subpart relating to undue financial \n     burden.\n       (c) Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply \n     to commuter bus systems.\n     Sec. 37.123  CAA paratransit eligibility--standards.\n       (a) Public entities required by Sec. 37.121 of this subpart \n     to provide complementary paratransit service shall provide \n     the service to the CAA paratransit eligible individuals \n     described in paragraph (e) of this section.\n       (b) If an individual meets the eligibility criteria of this \n     section with respect to some trips but not others, the \n     individual shall be CAA paratransit eligible only for those \n     trips for which he or she meets the criteria.\n       (c) Individuals may be CAA paratransit eligible on the \n     basis of a permanent or temporary disability.\n       (d) Public entities may provide complementary paratransit \n     service to persons other than CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals. However, only the cost of service to CAA \n     paratransit eligible individuals may be considered in a \n     public entity's request for an undue financial burden waiver \n     under Sec. Sec. 37.151-37.155 of this part.\n       (e) The following individuals are CAA paratransit eligible:\n       (1) Any individual with a disability who is unable, as the \n     result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision \n     impairment), and without the assistance of another individual \n     (except the operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding \n     assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any \n     vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities.\n       (2) Any individual with a disability who needs the \n     assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance \n     device and is able, with such assistance, to board, ride and \n     disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and \n     usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual \n     wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of \n     operation of the system at a time, or within a reasonable \n     period of such time, when such a vehicle is not being used to \n     provide designated public transportation on the route.\n       (i) An individual is eligible under this paragraph with \n     respect to travel on an otherwise accessible route on which \n     the boarding or disembarking location which the individual \n     would use is one at which boarding or disembarking from the \n     vehicle is precluded as provided in Sec.  37.167(g) of this \n     part.\n       (ii) An individual using a common wheelchair is eligible \n     under this paragraph if the individual's wheelchair cannot be \n     accommodated on an existing vehicle (e.g., because the \n     vehicle's lift does not meet the standards of part 38 of \n     these regulations), even if that vehicle is accessible to \n     other individuals with disabilities and their mobility \n     wheelchairs.\n       (iii) With respect to rail systems, an individual is \n     eligible under this paragraph if the individual could use an \n     accessible rail system, but\n       (A) there is not yet one accessible car per train on the \n     system; or\n       (B) key stations have not yet been made accessible.\n       (3) Any individual with a disability who has a specific \n     impairment-related condition which prevents such individual \n     from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking \n     location on such system.\n       (i) Only a specific impairment-related condition which \n     prevents the individual from traveling to a boarding location \n     or from a disembarking location is a basis for eligibility \n     under this paragraph. A condition which makes traveling to \n     boarding location or from a disembarking location more \n     difficult for a person with a specific impairment-related \n     condition than for an individual who does not have the \n     condition, but does not prevent the travel, is not a basis \n     for eligibility under this paragraph.\n       (ii) Architectural barriers not under the control of the \n     public entity providing fixed route service and environmental \n     barriers (e.g., distance, terrain, weather) do not, standing \n     alone, form a basis for eligibility under this paragraph. The \n     interaction of such barriers with an individual's specific \n     impairment-related condition may form a basis for eligibility \n     under this paragraph, if the effect is to prevent the \n     individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a \n     disembarking location.\n       (f) Individuals accompanying a CAA paratransit eligible \n     individual shall be provided service as follows:\n       (1) One other individual accompanying the CAA paratransit \n     eligible individual shall be provided service.\n       (i) If the CAA paratransit eligible individual is traveling \n     with a personal care attendant, the entity shall provide \n     service to one other individual in addition to the attendant \n     who is accompanying the eligible individual.\n       (ii) A family member or friend is regarded as a person \n     accompanying the eligible individual, and not as a personal \n     care attendant, unless the family member or friend registered \n     is acting in the capacity of a personal care attendant;\n       (2) Additional individuals accompanying the CAA paratransit \n     eligible individual shall be provided service, provided that \n     space is available for them on the paratransit vehicle \n     carrying the CAA paratransit eligible individual and that \n     transportation of the additional individuals will not result \n     in a denial of service to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals.\n       (3) In order to be considered as ``accompanying'' the \n     eligible individual for purposes of this paragraph, the other \n     individual(s) shall have the same origin and destination as \n     the eligible individual.\n     Sec. 37.125  CAA paratransit eligibility: process.\n       Each public entity required to provide complementary \n     paratransit service by Sec.  37.121 of this part shall \n     establish a process for determining CAA paratransit \n     eligibility.\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\n       (a) The process shall strictly limit CAA paratransit \n     eligibility to individuals specified in Sec. 37.123 of this \n     part.\n       (b) All information about the process, materials necessary \n     to apply for eligibility, and notices and determinations \n     concerning eligibility shall be made available in accessible \n     formats, upon request.\n       (c) If, by a date 21 days following the submission of a \n     complete application, the entity has not made a determination \n     of eligibility, the applicant shall be treated as eligible \n     and provided service until and unless the entity denies the \n     application.\n       (d) The entity's determination concerning eligibility shall \n     be in writing. If the determination is that the individual is \n     ineligible, the determination shall state the reasons for the \n     finding.\n       (e) The public entity shall provide documentation to each \n     eligible individual stating that he or she is ``CAA \n     Paratransit Eligible.'' The documentation shall include the \n     name of the eligible individual, the name of the transit \n     provider, the telephone number of the entity's paratransit \n     coordinator, an expiration date for eligibility, and any \n     conditions or limitations on the individual's eligibility \n     including the use of a personal care attendant.\n       (f) The entity may require recertification of the \n     eligibility of CAA paratransit eligible individuals at \n     reasonable intervals.\n       (g) The entity shall establish an administrative appeal \n     process through which individuals who are denied eligibility \n     can obtain review of the denial.\n       (1) The entity may require that an appeal be filed within \n     60 days of the denial of an individual's application.\n       (2) The process shall include an opportunity to be heard \n     and to present information and arguments, separation of \n     functions (i.e., a decision by a person not involved with the \n     initial decision to deny eligibility), and written \n     notification of the decision, and the reasons for it;\n       (3) The entity is not required to provide paratransit \n     service to the individual pending the determination on \n     appeal. However, if the entity has not made a decision within \n     30 days of the completion of the appeal process, the entity \n     shall provide paratransit service from that time until and \n     unless a decision to deny the appeal is issued.\n       (h) The entity may establish an administrative process to \n     suspend, for a reasonable period of time, the provision of \n     complementary paratransit service to CAA eligible individuals \n     who establish a pattern or practice of missing scheduled \n     trips.\n       (1) Trips missed by the individual for reasons beyond his \n     or her control (including, but not limited to, trips which \n     are missed due to operator error) shall not be a basis for \n     determining that such a pattern or practice exists.\n       (2) Before suspending service, the entity shall take the \n     following steps:\n       (i) Notify the individual in writing that the entity \n     proposes to suspend service, citing with specificity the \n     basis of the proposed suspension and setting forth the \n     proposed sanction;\n       (ii) Provide the individual an opportunity to be heard and \n     to present information and arguments;\n       (iii) Provide the individual with written notification of \n     the decision and the reasons for it.\n       (3) The appeals process of paragraph (g) of this section is \n     available to an individual on whom sanctions have been \n     imposed under this paragraph. The sanction is stayed pending \n     the outcome of the appeal.\n       (i) In applications for CAA paratransit eligibility, the \n     entity may require the applicant to indicate whether or not \n     he or she travels with a personal care attendant.\n     Sec. 37.127  Complementary paratransit service for visitors.\n       (a) Each public entity required to provide complementary \n     paratransit service under Sec.  37.121 of this part shall \n     make the service available to visitors as provided in this \n     section.\n       (b) For purposes of this section, a visitor is an \n     individual with disabilities who does not reside in the \n     jurisdiction(s) served by the public entity or other entities \n     with which the public entity provides coordinated \n     complementary paratransit service within a region.\n       (c) Each public entity shall treat as eligible for its \n     complementary paratransit service all visitors who present \n     documentation that they are CAA paratransit eligible, under \n     the criteria of Sec.  37.125 of this part, in the \n     jurisdiction in which they reside.\n       (d) With respect to visitors with disabilities who do not \n     present such documentation, the public entity may require the \n     documentation of the individual's place of residence and, if \n     the individual's disability is not apparent, of his or her \n     disability. The entity shall provide paratransit service to \n     individuals with disabilities who qualify as visitors under \n     paragraph (b) of this section. The entity shall accept a \n     certification by such individuals that they are unable to use \n     fixed route transit.\n       (e) A public entity shall make the service to a visitor \n     required by this section available for any combination of 21 \n     days during any 365-day period beginning with the visitor's \n     first use of the service during such 365-day period. In no \n     case shall the public entity require a visitor to apply for \n     or receive eligibility certification from the public entity \n     before receiving the service required by this section.\n     Sec. 37.129  Types of service.\n       (a) Except as provided in this section, complementary \n     paratransit service for CAA paratransit eligible persons \n     shall be origin-to-destination service.\n       (b) Complementary paratransit service for CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons described in Sec. 37.123(e)(2) of this part \n     may also be provided by on-call bus service or paratransit \n     feeder service to an accessible fixed route, where such \n     service enables the individual to use the fixed route bus \n     system for his or her trip.\n       (c) Complementary paratransit service for CAA eligible \n     persons described in Sec. 37.123 (e)(3) of this part also may \n     be provided by paratransit feeder service to and/or from an \n     accessible fixed route.\n     Sec. 37.131  Service criteria for complementary paratransit.\n       The following service criteria apply to complementary \n     paratransit required by Sec. 37.121 of this part.\n       (a) Service Area--(1) Bus. (i) The entity shall provide \n     complementary paratransit service to origins and destinations \n     within corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on \n     each side of each fixed route. The corridor shall include an \n     area with a three-fourths of a mile radius at the ends of \n     each fixed route.\n       (ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall \n     provide service to small areas not inside any of the \n     corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.\n       (iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may \n     designate corridors with widths from three-fourths of a mile \n     up to one and one-half miles on each side of a fixed route, \n     based on local circumstances.\n       (iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area \n     is that area in which corridors with a width of three-fourths \n     of a mile on each side of each fixed route merge together \n     such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and \n     destinations within the area would be served.\n       (2) Rail. (i) For rail systems, the service area shall \n     consist of a circle with a radius of a mile around each \n     station.\n       (ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, \n     the entity may designate circles with radii of up to 1\\1/2\\ \n     miles as part of its service area, based on local \n     circumstances.\n       (3) Jurisdictional Boundaries. Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this paragraph, an entity is not required to \n     provide paratransit service in an area outside the boundaries \n     of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity \n     does not have legal authority to operate in that area. The \n     entity shall take all practicable steps to provide \n     paratransit service to any part of its service area.\n       (b) Response Time. The entity shall schedule and provide \n     paratransit service to any CAA paratransit eligible person at \n     any requested time on a particular day in response to a \n     request for service made the previous day. Reservations may \n     be taken by reservation agents or by mechanical means.\n       (1) The entity shall make reservation service available \n     during at least all normal business hours of the entity's \n     administrative offices, as well as during times, comparable \n     to normal business hours, on a day when the entity's offices \n     are not open before a service day.\n       (2) The entity may negotiate pickup times with the \n     individual, but the entity shall not require a CAA \n     paratransit eligible individual to schedule a trip to begin \n     more than one hour before or after the individual's desired \n     departure time.\n       (3) The entity may use real-time scheduling in providing \n     complementary paratransit service.\n       (4) The entity may permit advance reservations to be made \n     up to 14 days in advance of a CAA paratransit eligible \n     individual's desired trips. When an entity proposes to change \n     its reservations system, it shall comply with the public \n     participation requirements equivalent to those of \n     Sec. 37.131(b) and (c).\n       (c) Fares. The fare for a trip charged to a CAA paratransit \n     eligible user of the complementary paratransit service shall \n     not exceed twice the fare that would be charged to an \n     individual paying full fare (i.e., without regard to \n     discounts) for a trip of similar length, at a similar time of \n     day, on the entity's fixed route system.\n       (1) In calculating the full fare that would be paid by an \n     individual using the fixed route system, the entity may \n     include transfer and premium charges applicable to a trip of \n     similar length, at a similar time of day, on the fixed route \n     system.\n       (2) The fares for individuals accompanying CAA paratransit \n     eligible individuals, who are provided service under \n     Sec. 37.123 (f) of this part, shall be the same as for the \n     CAA paratransit eligible individuals they are accompanying.\n       (3) A personal care attendant shall not be charged for \n     complementary paratransit service.\n       (4) The entity may charge a fare higher than otherwise \n     permitted by this paragraph to a social service agency or \n     other organization for agency trips (i.e., trips guaranteed \n     to the organization).\n       (d) Trip Purpose Restrictions. The entity shall not impose \n     restrictions or priorities based on trip purpose.\n       (e) Hours and Days of Service. The complementary \n     paratransit service shall be available throughout the same \n     hours and days as the entity's fixed route service.\n       (f) Capacity Constraints. The entity shall not limit the \n     availability of complementary paratransit service to CAA \n     paratransit eligible individuals by any of the following:\n\n[[Page S11009]]\n\n       (1) Restrictions on the number of trips an individual will \n     be provided;\n       (2) Waiting lists for access to the service; or\n       (3) Any operational pattern or practice that significantly \n     limits the availability of service to CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons.\n       (i) Such patterns or practices include, but are not limited \n     to, the following:\n       (A) Substantial numbers of significantly untimely pickups \n     for initial or return trips;\n       (B) Substantial numbers of trip denials or missed trips;\n       (C) Substantial numbers of trips with excessive trip \n     lengths.\n       (ii) Operational problems attributable to causes beyond the \n     control of the entity (including, but not limited to, weather \n     or traffic conditions affecting all vehicular traffic that \n     were not anticipated at the time a trip was scheduled) shall \n     not be a basis for determining that such a pattern or \n     practice exists.\n       (g) Additional Service. Public entities may provide \n     complementary paratransit service to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals exceeding that provided for in this section. \n     However, only the cost of service provided for in this \n     section may be considered in a public entity's request for an \n     undue financial burden waiver under Sec. Sec. 37.151-37.155 \n     of this part.\n     Sec. 37.133  Subscription Service.\n       (a) This part does not prohibit the use of subscription \n     service by public entities as part of a complementary \n     paratransit system, subject to the limitations in this \n     section.\n       (b) Subscription service may not absorb more than fifty \n     percent of the number of trips available at a given time of \n     day, unless there is excess non-subscription capacity.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the \n     entity may establish waiting lists or other capacity \n     constraints and trip purpose restrictions or priorities for \n     participation in the subscription service only.\n     Sec. 37.135  Submission of paratransit plan.\n       (a) General. Each public entity operating fixed route \n     transportation service, which is required by Sec. 37.121 to \n     provide complementary paratransit service, shall develop a \n     paratransit plan.\n       (b) Initial Submission. Except as provided in Sec. 37.141 \n     of this part, each entity shall submit its initial plan for \n     compliance with the complementary paratransit service \n     provision by June 1, 1998, to the appropriate location \n     identified in paragraph (f) of this section.\n       (c) Annual Updates. Except as provided in this paragraph, \n     each entity shall submit its annual update to the plan on \n     June 1 of each succeeding year.\n       (1) If an entity has met and is continuing to meet all \n     requirements for complementary paratransit in \n     Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133 of this part, the entity may submit \n     to the General Counsel an annual certification of continued \n     compliance in lieu of a plan update. Entities that have \n     submitted a joint plan under Sec. 37.141 may submit a joint \n     certification under this paragraph. The requirements of \n     Sec. Sec. 37.137(a) and (b), 37.138 and 37.139 do not apply \n     when a certification is submitted under this paragraph.\n       (2) In the event of any change in circumstances that \n     results in an entity which has submitted a certification of \n     continued compliance falling short of compliance with \n     Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133, the entity shall immediately notify \n     the General Counsel in writing of the problem. In this case, \n     the entity shall also file a plan update meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. Sec. 37.137-37.139 of this part on the \n     next following June 1 and in each succeeding year until the \n     entity returns to full compliance.\n       (3) An entity that has demonstrated undue financial burden \n     to the General Counsel shall file a plan update meeting the \n     requirements of Sec. Sec. 37.137-37.139 of this part on each \n     June 1 until full compliance with Sec. Sec. 37.121-37.133 is \n     attained.\n       (4) If the General Counsel reasonably believes that an \n     entity may not be fully complying with all service criteria, \n     the General Counsel may require the entity to provide an \n     annual update to its plan.\n       (d) Phase-in of Implementation. Each plan shall provide for \n     full compliance by no later than June 1, 2003, unless the \n     entity has received a waiver based on undue financial burden. \n     If the date for full compliance specified in the plan is \n     after June 1, 1999, the plan shall include milestones, \n     providing for measured, proportional progress toward full \n     compliance.\n       (e) Plan Implementation. Each entity shall begin \n     implementation of its plan on June 1, 1998.\n       (f) Submission Locations.

Each \n     entity shall contact individuals with disabilities and groups \n     representing them in the community. Consultation shall begin \n     at an early stage in the plan development and should involve \n     persons with disabilities in all phases of plan development. \n     All documents and other information concerning the planning \n     procedure and the provision of service shall be available, \n     upon request, to members of the pubic, except where \n     disclosure would be an unwarranted invasion of personal \n     privacy.\n       (3) Opportunity for public comment. The submitting entity \n     shall make its plan available for review before the plan is \n     finalized. In making the plan available for public review, \n     the entity shall ensure that the plan is available upon \n     request in accessible formats.\n       (4) Public hearing. The entity shall sponsor at a minimum \n     one public hearing and shall provide adequate notice of the \n     hearing, including advertisement in appropriate media, such \n     as newspapers of general and special interest circulation and \n     radio announcements; and\n       (5) Special requirements. If the entity intends to phase-in \n     its paratransit service over a multi-year period, or request \n     a waiver based on undue financial burden, the public hearing \n     shall afford the opportunity for interested citizens to \n     express their views concerning the phase-in, the request, and \n     which service criteria may be delayed in implementation.\n       (c) Ongoing requirement. The entity shall create an ongoing \n     mechanism for the participation of individuals with \n     disabilities in the continued development and assessment of \n     services to persons with disabilities.

If more than one entity is submitting the \n     plan there must be an authorizing resolution from each board. \n     If the entity does not function with a board, a statement \n     shall be submitted by the entity's chief executive;\n       (2) a certification that the survey of existing paratransit \n     service was conducted as required in Sec.  37.137(a) of this \n     part;\n       (3) To the extent service provided by other entities is \n     included in the entity's plan for comparable paratransit \n     service, the entity must certify that:\n       (i) CAA paratransit eligible individuals have access to the \n     service;\n       (ii) The service is provided in the manner represented; and\n       (iii) Efforts will be made to coordinate the provision of \n     paratransit service by other providers.\n       (i) a request for a waiver based on undue financial burden, \n     if applicable. The waiver request should include information \n     sufficient for the General Counsel to consider the factors in \n     Sec.  37.155 of this part. If a request for an undue \n     financial burden waiver is made, the plan must include a \n     description of additional paratransit services that would be \n     provided to achieve full compliance with the requirement for \n     comparable paratransit in the event the waiver is not \n     granted, and the timetable for the implementation of these \n     additional services.\n       (j) Annual plan updates. (1) The annual plan updates \n     submitted June 1, 1999, and annually thereafter, shall \n     include information necessary to update the information \n     requirements of this section. Information submitted annually \n     must include all significant changes and revisions to the \n     timetable for implementation;\n       (2) If the paratransit service is being phased in over more \n     than one year, the entity must demonstrate that the \n     milestones identified in the current paratransit plans have \n     been achieved. If the milestones have not been achieved, the \n     plan must explain any slippage and what actions are being \n     taken to compensate for the slippage.\n       (3) The annual plan must describe specifically the means \n     used to comply with the public participation requirements, as \n     described in Sec.  37.137 of this part.\n     Sec. 37.141  Requirements for a joint paratransit plan.\n       (a) Two or more public entities with overlapping or \n     contiguous service areas or jurisdictions may develop and \n     submit a joint plan providing for coordinated paratransit \n     service. Joint plans shall identify the participating \n     entities and indicate their commitment to participate in the \n     plan.\n       (b) To the maximum extent feasible, all elements of the \n     coordinated plan shall be submitted on June 1, 1998. If a \n     coordinated plan is not completed by June 1, 1998, those \n     entities intending to coordinate paratransit service must \n     submit a general statement declaring their intention to \n     provide coordinated service and each element of the plan \n     specified in Sec.  37.139 to the extent practicable. In \n     addition, the plan must include the following certifications \n     from each entity involved in the coordination effort:\n       (1) a certification that the entity is committed to \n     providing CAA paratransit service as part of a coordinated \n     plan.\n       (2) a certification from each public entity participating \n     in the plan that it will maintain current levels of \n     paratransit service until the coordinated plan goes into \n     effect.\n       (c) Entities submitting the above certifications and plan \n     elements in lieu of a completed plan on June 1, 1998, must \n     submit a complete plan by December 1, 1998.\n       (d) Filing of an individual plan does not preclude an \n     entity from cooperating with other entities in the \n     development or implementation of a joint plan. An entity \n     wishing to join with other entities after its initial \n     submission may do so by meeting the filing requirements of \n     this section.\n     Sec. 37.143  Paratransit plan implementation.\n       (a) Each entity shall begin implementation of its \n     complementary paratransit plan, pending notice from the \n     General Counsel. The implementation of the plan shall be \n     consistent with the terms of the plan, including any \n     specified phase-in period.\n       (b) If the plan contains a request for a waiver based on \n     undue financial burden, the entity shall begin implementation \n     of its plan, pending a determination on its waiver request.\n     Sec. 37.145  [Reserved]\n     Sec. 37.147  Considerations during General Counsel review.\n       In reviewing each plan, at a minimum the General Counsel \n     will consider the following:\n       (a) Whether the plan was filed on time;\n       (b) Comments submitted by the state, if applicable;\n       (c) Whether the plan contains responsive elements for each \n     component required under Sec.  37.139 of this part;\n       (d) Whether the plan, when viewed in its entirety, provides \n     for paratransit service comparable to the entity's fixed \n     route service;\n       (e) Whether the entity complied with the public \n     participation efforts required by this part; and\n       (f) The extent to which efforts were made to coordinate \n     with other public entities with overlapping or contiguous \n     service areas or jurisdictions.\n     Sec. 37.149  Disapproved plans.\n       (a) If a plan is disapproved in whole or in part, the \n     General Counsel will specify which provisions are \n     disapproved. Each entity shall amend its plan consistent with \n     this information and resubmit the plan to the General \n     Counsel's office within 90 days of receipt of the disapproval \n     letter.\n       (b) Each entity revising its plan shall continue to comply \n     with the public participation requirements applicable to the \n     initial development of the plan (set out in Sec. 37.137 of \n     this part).\n     Sec. 37.151  Waiver for undue financial burden.\n       If compliance with the service criteria of Sec. 37.131 of \n     this part creates an undue financial burden, an entity may \n     request a waiver from all or some of the provisions if the \n     entity has complied with the public participation \n     requirements in Sec. 37.137 of this part and if the following \n     conditions apply:\n       (a) At the time of submission of the initial plan on June \n     1, 1998\n       (1) The entity determines that it cannot meet all of the \n     service criteria by June 1, 2003; or\n       (2) The entity determines that it cannot make measured \n     progress toward compliance in any year before full compliance \n     is required. For purposes of this part, measured progress \n     means implementing milestones as scheduled, such as \n     incorporating an additional paratransit service criterion or \n     improving an aspect of a specific service criterion.\n       (b) At the time of its annual plan update submission, if \n     the entity believes that circumstances have changed since its \n     last submission, and it is no longer able to comply by June \n     1, 2003, or make measured progress in any year before 2003, \n     as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n     Sec. 37.153  General Counsel waiver determination.\n       (a) The General Counsel will determine whether to grant a \n     waiver for undue financial burden on a case-by-case basis, \n     after considering the factors identified in Sec. 37.155 of \n     this part and the information accompanying the request. If \n     necessary, the General Counsel will return the application \n     with a request for additional information.\n       (b) Any waiver granted will be for a limited and specified \n     period of time. (c) If the General Counsel grants the \n     applicant a waiver, the General Counsel will do one of the \n     following:\n       (1) Require the public entity to provide complementary \n     paratransit to the extent it can do so without incurring an \n     undue financial burden. The entity shall make changes in its \n     plan that the General Counsel determines are appropriate to \n     maximize the complementary paratransit service that is \n     provided to CAA paratransit eligible individuals. When making \n     changes to its plan, the entity shall use the public \n     participation process specified for plan development and \n     shall consider first a reduction in number of trips provided \n     to each CAA paratransit eligible person per month, while \n     attempting to meet all other service criteria.\n       (2) Require the public entity to provide basic \n     complementary paratransit services to all CAA paratransit \n     eligible individuals, even if doing so would cause the public \n     entity to incur an undue financial burden. Basic \n     complementary paratransit service shall include at least \n     complementary paratransit service in corridors defined as \n     provided in Sec.  37.131(a) along the public entity's key \n     routes during core service hours.\n       (i) For purposes of this section, key routes are defined as \n     routes along which there is service at least hourly \n     throughout the day.\n       (ii) For purposes of this section, core service hours \n     encompass at least peak periods, as these periods are defined \n     locally for fixed route service, consistent with industry \n     practice.\n       (3) If the General Counsel determines that the public \n     entity will incur an undue financial burden as the result of \n     providing basic complementary paratransit service, such that \n     it is infeasible for the entity to provide basic \n     complementary paratransit service, the Administrator shall \n     require the public entity to coordinate with other available \n     providers of demand responsive service in\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n     the area served by the public entity to maximize the service \n     to CAA paratransit eligible individuals to the maximum extent \n     feasible.\n     Sec. 37.155  Factors in decision to grant an undue financial \n         burden waiver.\n       (a) In making an undue financial burden determination, the \n     General Counsel will consider the following factors:\n       (1) Effects on current fixed route service, including \n     reallocation of accessible fixed route vehicles and potential \n     reduction in service, measured by service miles;\n       (2) Average number of trips made by the entity's general \n     population, on a per capita basis, compared with the average \n     number of trips to be made by registered CAA paratransit \n     eligible persons, on a per capita basis;\n       (3) Reductions in other services, including other special \n     services;\n       (4) Increases in fares;\n       (5) Resources available to implement complementary \n     paratransit service over the period covered by the plan;\n       (6) Percentage of budget needed to implement the plan, both \n     as a percentage of operating budget and a percentage of \n     entire budget;\n       (7) The current level of accessible service, both fixed \n     route and paratransit;\n       (8) Cooperation/coordination among area transportation \n     providers;\n       (9) Evidence of increased efficiencies, that have been or \n     could be effectuated, that would benefit the level and \n     quality of available resources for complementary paratransit \n     service; and\n       (10) Unique circumstances in the submitting entity's area \n     that affect the ability of the entity to provide paratransit, \n     that militate against the need to provide paratransit, or in \n     some other respect create a circumstance considered \n     exceptional by the submitting entity.\n       (b)(1) Costs attributable to complementary paratransit \n     shall be limited to costs of providing service specifically \n     required by this part to CAA paratransit eligible \n     individuals, by entities responsible under this part for \n     providing such service.\n       (2) If the entity determines that it is impracticable to \n     distinguish between trips mandated by the CAA and other trips \n     on a trip-by-trip basis, the entity shall attribute to CAA \n     complementary paratransit requirements a percentage of its \n     overall paratransit costs. This percentage shall be \n     determined by a statistically valid methodology that \n     determines the percentage of trips that are required by this \n     part. The entity shall submit information concerning its \n     methodology and the data on which its percentage is based \n     with its request for a waiver. Only costs attributable to \n     CAA-mandated trips may be considered with respect to a \n     request for an undue financial burden waiver.\n       (3) Funds to which the entity would be legally entitled, \n     but which, as a matter of state or local funding \n     arrangements, are provided to another entity and used by that \n     entity to provide paratransit service which is part of a \n     coordinated system of paratransit meeting the requirements of \n     this part, may be counted in determining the burden \n     associated with the waiver request.\n\n\n                    Subpart G--Provision of Service\n\n     Sec. 37.161  Maintenance of accessible features: general.\n       (a) Public and covered entities providing transportation \n     services shall maintain in operative condition those features \n     of facilities and vehicles that are required to make the \n     vehicles and facilities readily accessible to and usable by \n     individuals with disabilities. These features include, but \n     are not limited to, lifts and other means of access to \n     vehicles, securement devices, elevators, signage and systems \n     to facilitate communications with persons with impaired \n     vision or hearing.\n       (b) Accessibility features shall be repaired promptly if \n     they are damaged or out of order. When an accessibility \n     feature is out of order, the entity shall take reasonable \n     steps to accommodate individuals with disabilities who would \n     otherwise use the feature.\n       (c) This section does not prohibit isolated or temporary \n     interruptions in service or access due to maintenance or \n     repairs.\n     Sec. 37.163  Keeping vehicle lifts in operative condition: \n         public entities.\n       (a) This section applies only to public entities with \n     respect to lifts in non-rail vehicles.\n       (b) The entity shall establish a system of regular and \n     frequent maintenance checks of lifts sufficient to determine \n     if they are operative.\n       (c) The entity shall ensure that vehicle operators report \n     to the entity, by the most immediate means available, any \n     failure of a lift to operate in service.\n       (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, \n     when a lift is discovered to be inoperative, the entity shall \n     take the vehicle out of service before the beginning of the \n     vehicle's next service day and ensure that the lift is \n     repaired before the vehicle returns to service.\n       (e) If there is no spare vehicle available to take the \n     place of a vehicle with an inoperable lift, such that taking \n     the vehicle out of service will reduce the transportation \n     service the entity is able to provide, the public entity may \n     keep the vehicle in service with an inoperable lift for no \n     more than five days (if the entity serves an area of 50,000 \n     or less population) or three days (if the entity serves an \n     area of over 50,000 population) from the day on which the \n     lift is discovered to be inoperative.\n       (f) In any case in which a vehicle is operating on a fixed \n     route with an inoperative lift, and the headway to the next \n     accessible vehicle on the route exceeds 30 minutes, the \n     entity shall promptly provide alternative transportation to \n     individuals with disabilities who are unable to use the \n     vehicle because its lift does not work.\n     Sec. 37.165  Lift and securement use.\n       (a) This section applies to public and covered entities.\n       (b) All common wheelchairs and their users shall be \n     transported in the entity's vehicles or other conveyances. \n     The entity is not required to permit wheelchairs to ride in \n     places other than designated securement locations in the \n     vehicle, where such locations exist.\n       (c)(1) For vehicles complying with part 38 of these \n     regulations, the entity shall use the securement system to \n     secure wheelchairs as provided in that part.\n       (2) For other vehicles transporting individuals who use \n     wheelchairs, the entity shall provide and use a securement \n     system to ensure that the wheelchair remains within the \n     securement area.\n       (3) The entity may require that an individual permit his or \n     her wheelchair to be secured.\n       (d) The entity may not deny transportation to a wheelchair \n     or its user on the ground that the device cannot be secured \n     or restrained satisfactorily by the vehicle's securement \n     system.\n       (e) The entity may recommend to a user of a wheelchair that \n     the individual transfer to a vehicle seat. The entity may not \n     require the individual to transfer.\n       (f) Where necessary or upon request, the entity's personnel \n     shall assist individuals with disabilities with the use of \n     securement systems, ramps and lifts. If it is necessary for \n     the personnel to leave their seats to provide this \n     assistance, they shall do so.\n       (g) The entity shall permit individuals with disabilities \n     who do not use wheelchairs, including standees, to use a \n     vehicle's lift or ramp to enter the vehicle. Provided that an \n     entity is not required to permit such individuals to use a \n     lift Model 141 manufactured by EEC, Inc.

Departures \n     are to be considered on a case-by-case basis by the Office of \n     Compliance under the procedure set forth in Sec. 37.7 of \n     these regulations.\n     Sec. 38.3 Definitions.\n       See Sec. 37.3 of these regulations.\n     Sec. 38.4 Miscellaneous instructions.\n       (a) Dimensional conventions. Dimensions that are not noted \n     as minimum or maximum are absolute.\n       (b) Dimensional tolerances. All dimensions are subject to \n     conventional engineering tolerances for material properties \n     and field conditions, including normal anticipated wear not \n     exceeding accepted industry-wide standards and practices.\n       (c) Notes. The text of these guidelines does not contain \n     notes or footnotes. Additional information, explanations, and \n     advisory materials are located in the Appendix.\n       (d) General terminology. (1) Comply with means meet one or \n     more specification of these guidelines.\n       (2) If, or if * * * then denotes a specification that \n     applies only when the conditions described are present.\n       (3) May denotes an option or alternative.\n       (4) Shall denotes a mandatory specification or requirement.\n       (5) Should denotes an advisory specification or \n     recommendation and is used only in the appendix to this part.\n\n\n                   Subpart B--Buses, Vans and Systems\n\n     Sec. 38.21 General.\n       (a) New, used or remanufactured buses and vans (except \n     over-the-road buses covered by subpart G of this part), to be \n     considered accessible by regulations issued by the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance in part 37 of these \n     regulations, shall comply with the applicable provisions of \n     this subpart.\n       (b) If portions of the vehicle are modified in a way that \n     affects or could affect accessibility, each such portion \n     shall comply, to the extent practicable, with the applicable \n     provisions of this subpart. This provision does not require \n     that inaccessible buses be retrofitted with lifts, ramps or \n     other boarding devices.\n     Sec. 38.23 Mobility aid accessibility.\n       (a) General. All vehicles covered by this subpart shall \n     provide a level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., \n     lift or ramp) complying with paragraph (b) or (c) of this \n     section and sufficient clearances to permit a wheelchair or \n     other mobility aid user to reach a securement location. At \n     least two securement locations and devices, complying with \n     paragraph (d) of this section, shall be provided on \n     vehicles in excess of 22 feet in length; at least one \n     securement location and device, complying with paragraph \n     (d) of this section, shall be provided on vehicles 22 feet \n     in length or less.\n       (b) Vehicle lift--(1) Design load. The design load of the \n     lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as \n     cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, \n     and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, \n     shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the \n     ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as \n     platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be \n     expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least \n     three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.\n       (2) Controls--(i) Requirements. The controls shall be \n     interlocked with the vehicle brakes, transmission, or door, \n     or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or systems, to \n     ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the lift is not \n     stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless the \n     interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy to \n     all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate positions) \n     normally encountered in the operating environment. Where \n     provided, each control for deploying, lowering, raising, and \n     stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off barrier shall be \n     of a momentary contact type requiring continuous manual \n     pressure by the operator and shall not allow improper lift \n     sequencing when the lift platform is occupied. The controls \n     shall allow reversal of the lift operation sequence, such as \n     raising or lowering a platform that is part way down, without \n     allowing an occupied platform to fold or retract into the \n     stowed position.\n       (ii) Exception. Where the lift is designed to deploy with \n     its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis and which \n     pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied (i.e., \n     ``rotary lift''), the requirements of this paragraph \n     prohibiting the lift from being stowed while occupied shall \n     not apply if the stowed position is within the passenger \n     compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while \n     occupied.\n       (3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an \n     emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with \n     a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if \n     the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or \n     otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner \n     that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the \n     operator when operated according to manufacturer's \n     instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed \n     or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift and \n     is intended to be stowed while occupied.\n       (4) Power or equipment failure. Platforms stowed in a \n     vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, \n     shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or \n     folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of \n     an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load \n     carrying component.\n       (5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped \n     with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or \n     mobility aid from rolling off the platform during its \n     operation. A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall \n     prevent a wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the \n     edge closest to the vehicle until the platform is in its \n     fully raised position. Each side of the lift platform which \n     extends beyond the vehicle in its raised position shall have \n     a barrier a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches high. Such barriers shall \n     not interfere with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The \n     loading-edge barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a \n     loading ramp when the lift is at ground level, shall be \n     sufficient when raised or closed, or a supplementary system \n     shall be provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility \n     aid from riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of \n     the lift shall automatically raise or close, or a \n     supplementary system shall automatically engage, and \n     remain raised, closed, or engaged at all times that the \n     platform is more than 3 inches above the roadway or \n     sidewalk and the platform is occupied. Alternatively, a \n     barrier or system may be raised, lowered, opened, closed, \n     engaged, or disengaged by the lift operator, provided an \n     interlock or inherent design feature prevents the lift \n     from rising unless the barrier is raised or closed or the \n     supplementary system is engaged.\n       (6) Platform surface. The platform surface shall be free of \n     any protrusions over \\1/4\\ inch high and shall be slip \n     resistant. The platform shall have a minimum clear width of \n     28\\1/2\\ inches at the platform, a minimum clear width of 30 \n     inches measured from 2 inches above the platform surface to \n     30 inches above the platform, and a minimum clear length of \n     48 inches measured from 2 inches above the surface of the \n     platform to 30 inches above the surface of the platform. (See \n     Fig. 1)\n       (7) Platform gaps.  Any openings between the platform \n     surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch \n     in width. When the platform is at vehicle floor height with \n     the inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps \n     between the forward lift platform edge and the vehicle floor \n     shall not exceed \\1/2\\ inch horizontally and \\5/8\\ inch \n     vertically. Platforms on semiautomatic lifts may have a hand \n     hold not exceeding 1\\1/2\\ inches by 4\\1/2\\ inches located \n     between the edge barriers.\n       (8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-\n     edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8, \n     measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and \n     the transition from roadway or sidewalk to ramp may be \n     vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/4\\ inch. Thresholds \n     between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch high shall be beveled with \n     a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including \n     the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees \n     (exclusive of vehicle roll or pitch) in any direction between \n     its unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 \n     pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at \n     the centroid of the platform.\n       (10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move \n     at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and \n     lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second \n     during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply \n     to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are \n     manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal \n     and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.\n       (11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard \n     and outboard facing of wheelchair and mobility aid users.\n       (12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using \n     walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have \n     difficulty using steps. The platform may be marked to \n     indicate a preferred standing position.\n       (13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with \n     handrails on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift, \n     and which shall be graspable and provide support to standees \n     throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a \n     usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest \n     portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the \n     highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional \n     diameter between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall \n     provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased \n     edges with corner radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. \n     Handrails shall be placed to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ \n     inches knuckle clearance from the nearest adjacent \n     surface. Handrails shall not interfere with wheelchair or \n     mobility aid maneuverability when entering or leaving the \n     vehicle.\n       (c) Vehicle ramp--(1) Design load.

The International Symbol of Accessibility \n     shall be displayed on the exterior of each vehicle operating \n     on an accessible light rail system unless all vehicles are \n     accessible and are not marked by the access symbol. (See Fig. \n     6)\n       (c) Signals. Auditory and visual warning signals shall be \n     provided to alert passengers of closing doors.\n       (d) Coordination with boarding platform--(1) Requirements. \n     The design of level-entry vehicles shall be coordinated with \n     the boarding platform or mini-high platform design so that \n     the horizontal gap between a vehicle at rest and the platform \n     shall be no greater than 3 inches and the height of the \n     vehicle floor shall be within plus or minus \\5/8\\ inch of the \n     platform height. Vertical alignment may be accomplished by \n     vehicle air suspension, automatic ramps or lifts, or any \n     combination.\n       (2) Exception. New vehicles operating in existing stations \n     may have a floor height within plus or minus 1\\1/2\\ inches of \n     the platform height. At key stations, the horizontal gap \n     between at least one door of each such vehicle and the \n     platform shall be no greater than 3 inches.\n       (3) Exception. Retrofitted vehicles shall be coordinated \n     with the platform in new and key stations such that the \n     horizontal gap shall be no greater than 4 inches and the \n     height of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, shall \n     be within plus or minus 2 inches of the platform height.\n       (4) Exception. Where it is not operationally or \n     structurally practicable to meet the horizontal or vertical \n     requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (2) or (3) of this \n     section, platform or vehicle devices complying with \n     Sec. 38.83(b) or platform or vehicle mounted ramps or \n     bridge plates complying with Sec. 38.83(c) shall be \n     provided.\n     Sec. 38.75 Priority seating signs.\n       (a) Each vehicle shall contain sign(s) which indicate that \n     certain seats are priority seats for persons with \n     disabilities, and that other passengers should make such \n     seats available to those who wish to use them.\n       (b) Where designated wheelchair or mobility aid seating \n     locations are provided, signs shall indicate the location and \n     advise other passengers of the need to permit wheelchair and \n     mobility aid users to occupy them.\n       (c) Characters on signs required by paragraphs (a) or (b) \n     of this section shall have a width-to-height ratio between \n     3:5 and 1:1 and a stroke width-to-height ratio between 1:5 \n     and 1:10, with a minimum character height (using an upper \n     case X'') of \\5/8\\ inch, with wide spacing (generally, the \n     space between letters shall be \\1/16\\ the height of upper \n     case letters), and shall contrast with the background, either \n     light-on-dark or dark-on-light.\n     Sec. 38.77 Interior circulation, handrails and stanchions.\n       (a) Handrails and stanchions shall be sufficient to permit \n     safe boarding, on-board circulation, seating and standing \n     assistance, and alighting by persons with disabilities.\n       (b) At entrances equipped with steps, handrails and \n     stanchions shall be provided in the entrance to the vehicle \n     in a configuration which allows passengers to grasp such \n     assists from outside the vehicle while starting to board, and \n     to continue using such handrails or stanchions throughout the \n     boarding process. Handrails shall have a cross-sectional \n     diameter between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall \n     provide an equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges \n     with corner radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails \n     shall be placed to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle \n     clearance from the nearest adjacent surface. Where on-board \n     fare collection devices are used, a horizontal passenger \n     assist shall be located between boarding passengers and the \n     fare collection device and shall prevent passengers from \n     sustaining injuries on the fare collection device or \n     windshield in the event of a sudden deceleration. Without \n     restricting the vestibule space, the assist shall provide \n     support for a boarding passenger from the door through the \n     boarding procedure. Passengers shall be able to lean against \n     the assist for security while paying fares.\n       (c) At all doors on level-entry vehicles, and at each \n     entrance accessible by lift, ramp, bridge plate or other \n     suitable means, handrails, stanchions, passenger seats, \n     vehicle driver seat platforms, and fare boxes, if applicable, \n     shall be located so as to allow a route at least 32 inches \n     wide so that at least two wheelchair or mobility aid users \n     can enter the vehicle and position the wheelchairs or \n     mobility aids in areas, each having a minimum clear space of \n     48 inches by 30 inches, which do not unduly restrict movement \n     of other passengers. Space to accommodate wheelchairs and \n     mobility aids may be provided within the normal area used by \n     standees and designation of specific spaces is not required. \n     Particular attention shall be given to ensuring maximum \n     maneuverability immediately inside doors. Ample vertical \n     stanchions from ceiling to seat-back rails shall be provided. \n     Vertical stanchions from ceiling to floor shall not interfere \n     with wheelchair or mobility aid circulation and shall be kept \n     to a minimum in the vicinity of accessible doors.\n     Sec. 38.79 Floors, steps and thresholds.\n       (a) Floor surfaces on aisles, step treads, places for \n     standees, and areas where wheelchair and mobility aid users \n     are to be accommodated shall be slip-resistant.\n       (b) All thresholds and step edges shall have a band of \n     color(s) running the full width of the step or threshold \n     which contrasts from the step tread and riser or adjacent \n     floor, either light-on-dark or dark-on-light.\n     Sec. 38.81 Lighting.\n       (a) Any stepwell or doorway with a lift, ramp or bridge \n     plate immediately adjacent to the driver shall have, when the \n     door is open, at least 2 footcandles of illumination measured \n     on the step tread or lift platform.\n       (b) Other stepwells, and doorways with lifts, ramps or \n     bridge plates, shall have, at all times, at least 2 \n     footcandles of illumination measured on the step tread or \n     lift or ramp, when deployed at the vehicle floor level.\n       (c) The doorways of vehicles not operating at lighted \n     station platforms shall have outside lights which provide at \n     least 1 foot candle of illumination on the station platform \n     or street surface for a distance of 3 feet perpendicular to \n     all points on the bottom step tread. Such lights shall be \n     located below window level and shielded to protect the eyes \n     of entering and exiting passengers.\n     Sec. 38.83 Mobility aid accessibility.\n       (a)(1) General. All new light rail vehicles, other than \n     level entry vehicles, covered by this subpart shall provide a \n     level-change mechanism or boarding device (e.g., lift, ramp \n     or bridge plate) complying with either paragraph (b) or (c) \n     of this section and sufficient clearances to permit at least \n     two wheelchair or mobility aid users to reach areas, each \n     with a minimum clear floor space of 48 inches by 30 inches, \n     which do not unduly restrict passenger flow. Space to \n     accommodate wheelchairs and mobility aids may be provided \n     within the normal area used by standees and designation of \n     specific spaces is not required.\n       (2) Exception. If lifts, ramps or bridge plates meeting the \n     requirements of this section are provided on station \n     platforms or other stops required to be accessible, or mini-\n     high platforms complying with Sec. 38.73(d) of this part are \n     provided, the vehicle is not required to be equipped with a \n     car-borne device. Where each new vehicle is compatible with a \n     single platform-mounted access system or device, additional \n     systems or devices are not required for each vehicle provided \n     that the single device could be used to provide access to \n     each new vehicle if passengers using wheelchairs or mobility \n     aids could not be accommodated on a single vehicle.\n       (b) Vehicle lift--(1) Design load. The design load of the \n     lift shall be at least 600 pounds. Working parts, such as \n     cables, pulleys, and shafts, which can be expected to wear, \n     and upon which the lift depends for support of the load, \n     shall have a safety factor of at least six, based on the \n     ultimate strength of the material. Nonworking parts, such as \n     platform, frame, and attachment hardware which would not be \n     expected to wear, shall have a safety factor of at least \n     three, based on the ultimate strength of the material.\n       (2) Controls--(i) Requirements. The controls shall be \n     interlocked with the vehicle brakes, propulsion system, or \n     door, or shall provide other appropriate mechanisms or \n     systems, to ensure that the vehicle cannot be moved when the \n     lift is not stowed and so the lift cannot be deployed unless \n     the interlocks or systems are engaged. The lift shall deploy \n     to all levels (i.e., ground, curb, and intermediate \n     positions) normally encountered in the operating environment. \n     Where provided, each control for deploying, lowering, \n     raising, and stowing the lift and lowering the roll-off \n     barrier shall be of a momentary contact type requiring \n     continuous manual pressure by the operator and shall not \n     allow improper lift sequencing when the lift platform is \n     occupied. The controls shall allow reversal of the lift\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\n     operation sequence, such as raising or lowering a \n     platform that is part way down, without allowing an \n     occupied platform to fold or retract into the stowed \n     position.\n       (ii) Exception. Where physical or safety constraints \n     prevent the deployment at some stops of a lift having its \n     long dimension perpendicular to the vehicle axis, the \n     transportation entity may specify a lift which is designed to \n     deploy with its long dimension parallel to the vehicle axis \n     and which pivots into or out of the vehicle while occupied \n     (i.e., ``rotary lift''). The requirements of paragraph \n     (b)(2)(i) of this section prohibiting the lift from being \n     stowed while occupied shall not apply to a lift design of \n     this type if the stowed position is within the passenger \n     compartment and the lift is intended to be stowed while \n     occupied.\n       (iii) Exception. The brake or propulsion system interlocks \n     requirement does not apply to a station platform mounted lift \n     provided that a mechanical, electrical or other system \n     operates to ensure that vehicles do not move when the lift is \n     in use.\n       (3) Emergency operation. The lift shall incorporate an \n     emergency method of deploying, lowering to ground level with \n     a lift occupant, and raising and stowing the empty lift if \n     the power to the lift fails. No emergency method, manual or \n     otherwise, shall be capable of being operated in a manner \n     that could be hazardous to the lift occupant or to the \n     operator when operated according to manufacturer's \n     instructions, and shall not permit the platform to be stowed \n     or folded when occupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift \n     intended to be stowed while occupied.\n       (4) Power or equipment failure. Lift platforms stowed in a \n     vertical position, and deployed platforms when occupied, \n     shall have provisions to prevent their deploying, falling, or \n     folding any faster than 12 inches/second or their dropping of \n     an occupant in the event of a single failure of any load \n     carrying component.\n       (5) Platform barriers. The lift platform shall be equipped \n     with barriers to prevent any of the wheels of a wheelchair or \n     mobility aid from rolling off the lift during its operation. \n     A movable barrier or inherent design feature shall prevent a \n     wheelchair or mobility aid from rolling off the edge closest \n     to the vehicle until the lift is in its fully raised \n     position. Each side of the lift platform which extends beyond \n     the vehicle in its raised position shall have a barrier a \n     minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches high. Such barriers shall not interfere \n     with maneuvering into or out of the aisle. The loading-edge \n     barrier (outer barrier) which functions as a loading ramp \n     when the lift is at ground level, shall be sufficient when \n     raised or closed, or a supplementary system shall be \n     provided, to prevent a power wheelchair or mobility aid from \n     riding over or defeating it. The outer barrier of the lift \n     shall automatically rise or close, or a supplementary system \n     shall automatically engage, and remain raised, closed, or \n     engaged at all times that the lift is more than 3 inches \n     above the station platform or roadway and the lift is \n     occupied. Alternatively, a barrier or system may be raised, \n     lowered, opened, closed, engaged or disengaged by the lift \n     operator provided an interlock or inherent design feature \n     prevents the lift from rising unless the barrier is raised or \n     closed or the supplementary system is engaged.\n       (6) Platform surface. The lift platform surface shall be \n     free of any protrusions over \\1/4\\ inch high and shall be \n     slip resistant. The lift platform shall have a minimum clear \n     width of 28\\1/2\\ inches at the platform, a minimum clear \n     width of 30 inches measured from 2 inches above the lift \n     platform surface to 30 inches above the surface, and a \n     minimum clear length of 48 inches measured from 2 inches \n     above the surface of the platform to 30 inches above the \n     surface. (See Fig. 1)\n       (7) Platform gaps. Any openings between the lift platform \n     surface and the raised barriers shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch \n     wide. When the lift is at vehicle floor height with the \n     inner barrier (if applicable) down or retracted, gaps \n     between the forward lift platform edge and vehicle floor \n     shall not exceed \\1/2\\ inch horizontally and \\5/8\\ inch \n     vertically. Platforms on semi-automatic lifts may have a \n     hand hold not exceeding 1\\1/2\\ inches by 4\\1/2\\ inches \n     located between the edge barriers.\n       (8) Platform entrance ramp. The entrance ramp, or loading-\n     edge barrier used as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope of 1:8 \n     measured on level ground, for a maximum rise of 3 inches, and \n     the transition from the station platform or roadway to ramp \n     may be vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/4\\ inch. \n     Thresholds between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch high shall be \n     beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (9) Platform deflection. The lift platform (not including \n     the entrance ramp) shall not deflect more than 3 degrees \n     (exclusive of vehicle roll) in any direction between its \n     unloaded position and its position when loaded with 600 \n     pounds applied through a 26 inch by 26 inch test pallet at \n     the centroid of the lift platform.\n       (10) Platform movement. No part of the platform shall move \n     at a rate exceeding 6 inches/second during lowering and \n     lifting an occupant, and shall not exceed 12 inches/second \n     during deploying or stowing. This requirement does not apply \n     to the deployment or stowage cycles of lifts that are \n     manually deployed or stowed. The maximum platform horizontal \n     and vertical acceleration when occupied shall be 0.3g.\n       (11) Boarding direction. The lift shall permit both inboard \n     and outboard facing of wheelchairs and mobility aids.\n       (12) Use by standees. Lifts shall accommodate persons using \n     walkers, crutches, canes or braces or who otherwise have \n     difficulty using steps. The lift may be marked to indicate a \n     preferred standing position.\n       (13) Handrails. Platforms on lifts shall be equipped with \n     handrails, on two sides, which move in tandem with the lift \n     which shall be graspable and provide support to standees \n     throughout the entire lift operation. Handrails shall have a \n     usable component at least 8 inches long with the lowest \n     portion a minimum 30 inches above the platform and the \n     highest portion a maximum 38 inches above the platform. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. Handrails shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall be placed \n     to provide a minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle clearance from the \n     nearest adjacent surface. Handrails shall not interfere with \n     wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability when entering or \n     leaving the vehicle.\n       (c) Vehicle ramp or bridge plate--(1) Design load. Ramps or \n     bridge plates 30 inches or longer shall support a load of 600 \n     pounds, placed at the centroid of the ramp or bridge plate \n     distributed over an area of 26 inches by 26 inches, with a \n     safety factor of at least 3 based on the ultimate strength of \n     the material. Ramps or bridge plates shorter than 30 inches \n     shall support a load of 300 pounds.\n       (2) Ramp surface. The ramp or bridge plate surface shall be \n     continuous and slip resistant, shall not have protrusions \n     from the surface greater than \\1/4\\ inch, shall have a clear \n     width of 30 inches, and shall accommodate both four-wheel and \n     three-wheel mobility aids.\n       (3) Ramp threshold. The transition from roadway or station \n     platform and the transition from vehicle floor to the ramp or \n     bridge plate may be vertical without edge treatment up to \\1/\n     4\\ inch. Changes in level between \\1/4\\ inch and \\1/2\\ inch \n     shall be beveled with a slope no greater than 1:2.\n       (4) Ramp barriers. Each side of the ramp or bridge plate \n     shall have barriers at least 2 inches high to prevent \n     mobility aid wheels from slipping off.\n       (5) Slope. Ramps or bridge plates shall have the least \n     slope practicable. If the height of the vehicle floor, under \n     50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 3 \n     inches or less above the station platform a maximum slope of \n     1:4 is permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under \n     50% passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is 6 \n     inches or less, but more than 3 inches, above the station \n     platform a maximum slope of 1:6 is permitted; if the height \n     of the vehicle floor, under 50% passenger load, from which \n     the ramp is deployed is 9 inches or less, but more than 6 \n     inches, above the station platform a maximum slope of 1:8 is \n     permitted; if the height of the vehicle floor, under 50% \n     passenger load, from which the ramp is deployed is greater \n     than 9 inches above the station platform a slope of 1:12 \n     shall be achieved. Folding or telescoping ramps are permitted \n     provided they meet all structural requirements of this \n     section.\n       (6) Attachment.--(i) Requirement. When in use for boarding \n     or alighting, the ramp or bridge plate shall be attached to \n     the vehicle, or otherwise prevented from moving such that it \n     is not subject to displacement when loading or unloading a \n     heavy power mobility aid and that any gaps between vehicle \n     and ramp or bridge plate, and station platform and ramp or \n     bridge plate, shall not exceed \\5/8\\ inch.\n       (ii) Exception. Ramps or bridge plates which are attached \n     to, and deployed from, station platforms are permitted in \n     lieu of vehicle devices provided they meet the displacement \n     requirements of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section.\n       (7) Stowage. A compartment, securement system, or other \n     appropriate method shall be provided to ensure that stowed \n     ramps or bridge plates, including portable ramps or bridge \n     plates stowed in the passenger area, do not impinge on a \n     passenger's wheelchair or mobility aid or pose any hazard to \n     passengers in the event of a sudden stop.\n       (8) Handrails. If provided, handrails shall allow persons \n     with disabilities to grasp them from outside the vehicle \n     while starting to board, and to continue to use them \n     throughout the boarding process, and shall have the top \n     between 30 inches and 38 inches above the ramp surface. The \n     handrails shall be capable of withstanding a force of 100 \n     pounds concentrated at any point on the handrail without \n     permanent deformation of the rail or its supporting \n     structure. The handrail shall have a cross-sectional diameter \n     between 1\\1/4\\ inches and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an \n     equivalent grasping surface, and have eased edges with corner \n     radii of not less than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall not \n     interfere with wheelchair or mobility aid maneuverability \n     when entering or leaving the vehicle.\n     Sec. 38.85 Between-car barriers\n       Where vehicles operate in a high-platform, level-boarding \n     mode, devices or systems shall be provided to prevent, deter \n     or warn individuals from inadvertently stepping off the \n     platform between cars. Appropriate devices include, but are \n     not limited to, pantograph gates, chains, motion detectors or \n     other suitable devices.\n     Sec. 38.87 Public information system.\n       (a) Each vehicle shall be equipped with an interior public \n     address system permitting transportation system personnel, or \n     recorded or digitized human speech messages, to announce \n     stations and provide other passenger\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\n     information. Alternative systems or devices which \n     provide equivalent access are also permitted.\n       (b) [Reserved].\n     38.91-38.127 [Reserved]\n\n\n               Subpart F--Over-the-Road Buses and Systems\n\n     Sec. 38.151 General.\n       (a) New, used and remanufactured over-the-road buses, to be \n     considered accessible by regulations in part 37 of these \n     regulations, shall comply with this subpart.\n       (b) Over-the-road buses covered by Sec. 37.7(c) of these \n     regulations shall comply with Sec. 38.23 and this subpart.\n     Sec. 38.153 Doors, steps and thresholds.\n       (a) Floor surfaces on aisles, step treads and areas where \n     wheelchair and mobility aid users are to be accommodated \n     shall be slip-resistant.\n       (b) All step edges shall have a band of color(s) running \n     the full width of the step which contrasts from the step \n     tread and riser, either dark-on-light or light-on-dark.\n       (c) To the maximum extent practicable, doors shall have a \n     minimum clear width when open of 30 inches, but in no case \n     less than 27 inches.\n     Sec. 38.155 Interior circulation, handrails and stanchions.\n        (a) Handrails and stanchions shall be provided in the \n     entrance to the vehicle in a configuration which allows \n     passengers to grasp such assists from outside the vehicle \n     while starting to board, and to continue using such handrails \n     or stanchions throughout the boarding process. Handrails \n     shall have a cross-sectional diameter between 1\\1/4\\ inches \n     and 1\\1/2\\ inches or shall provide an equivalent grasping \n     surface, and have eased edges with corner radii of not less \n     than \\1/8\\ inch. Handrails shall be placed to provide a \n     minimum 1\\1/2\\ inches knuckle clearance from the nearest \n     adjacent surface. Where on-board fare collection devices are \n     used, a horizontal passenger assist shall be located between \n     boarding passengers and the fare collection device and shall \n     prevent passengers from sustaining injuries on the fare \n     collection device or windshield in the event of a sudden \n     deceleration. Without restricting the vestibule space, the \n     assist shall provide support for a boarding passenger from \n     the door through the boarding procedure.

Each entry is \n     applicable to all subparts of this part except where noted. \n     Nothing in this appendix shall in any way obviate any \n     obligation to comply with the requirements of the guidelines \n     themselves.\n\n  I. Slip Resistant Surfaces--Aisles, Steps, Floor Area Where People \n    Walk, Floor Areas in Securement Locations, Lift Platforms, Ramps\n\n       Slip resistance is based on the frictional force necessary \n     to keep a shoe heel or crutch tip from slipping on a walking \n     surface under conditions likely to be found on the surface. \n     While the dynamic coefficient of friction during walking \n     varies in a complex and non-uniform way, the static \n     coefficient of friction, which can be measured in several \n     ways, provides a close approximation of the slip resistance \n     of a surface. Contrary to popular belief, some slippage is \n     necessary to walking, especially for persons with restricted \n     gaits; a truly ``non-slip'' surface could not be negotiated.\n       The Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     recommends that walking surfaces have a static coefficient of \n     friction of 0.5. A research project sponsored by the \n     Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n     (Access Board) conducted tests with persons with disabilities \n     and concluded that a higher coefficient of friction was \n     needed by such persons. A static coefficient of friction of \n     0.6 is recommended for steps, floors, and lift platforms and \n     0.8 for ramps.\n       The coefficient of friction varies considerably due to the \n     presence of contaminants, water, floor finishes, and other \n     factors not under the control of transit providers and may be \n     difficult to measure. Nevertheless, many common materials \n     suitable for flooring are now labeled with information on the \n     static coefficient of friction. While it may not be possible \n     to compare one product directly with another, or to guarantee \n     a constant measure, transit operators or vehicle designers \n     and manufacturers are encouraged to specify materials with \n     appropriate values. As more products include information on \n     slip resistance, improved uniformity in measurement and \n     specification is likely. The Access Board's advisory \n     guidelines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides additional \n     information on this subject.\n\n          II. Color Contrast--Step Edges, Lift Platform Edges\n\n       The material used to provide contrast should contrast by at \n     least 70%. Contrast in percent is determined by:\n       Contrast = [(B1-B2)/B1] 100\n       Where B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \n     lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value (LRV) of \n     the darker area.\n       Note that in any application both white and black are never \n     absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and B2 is \n     always greater than 0.\n\n                     III. Handrails and Stanchions\n\n       In addition to the requirements for handrails and \n     stanchions for rapid, light, and commuter rail vehicles, \n     consideration should be given to the proximity of handrails \n     or stanchions to the area in which wheelchair or mobility aid \n     users may position themselves. When identifying the clear \n     floor space where a wheelchair or mobility aid user can be \n     accommodated, it is suggested that at least one such area \n     be adjacent or in close proximity to a handrail or \n     stanchion. Of course, such a handrail or stanchion cannot \n     encroach upon the required 32 inch width required for the \n     doorway or the route leading to the clear floor space \n     which must be at least 30 by 48 inches in size.\n\n              IV. Priority Seating Signs and Other Signage\n\n       A. Finish and Contrast. The characters and background of \n     signs should be eggshell,\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\n     matte, or other non-glare finish. An eggshell finish (11 to \n     19 degree gloss on 60 degree glossimeter) is recommended. \n     Characters and symbols should contrast with their background \n     either light characters on a dark background or dark \n     characters on a light background. Research indicates that \n     signs are more legible for persons with low vision when \n     characters contrast with their background by at least 70 \n     percent. Contrast in percent is determined by:\n       Contrast = [(B1-B2)/B1] 100\n       Where B1 = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \n     lighter area and B2 = light reflectance value (LRV) of \n     the darker area.\n       Note that in any application both white and black are never \n     absolute; thus, B1 never equals 100 and B2 is \n     always greater than 0.\n       The greatest readability is usually achieved through the \n     use of light-colored characters or symbols on a dark \n     background.\n       B. Destination and Route Signs. The following \n     specifications, which are required for buses (Sec. 38.39), \n     are recommended for other types of vehicles, particularly \n     light rail vehicles, where appropriate.\n       1. Where destination or route information is displayed on \n     the exterior of a vehicle, each vehicle should have \n     illuminated signs on the front and boarding side of the \n     vehicle.\n       2. Characters on signs covered by paragraph IV.B.1 of this \n     appendix should have a width-to-height ratio between 3:5 and \n     1:1 and a stroke width-to-height ratio between 1:5 and 1:10, \n     with a minimum character height (using an upper case ``X'') \n     of 1 inch for signs on the boarding side and a minimum \n     character height of 2 inches for front ``headsigns,'' with \n     ``wide'' spacing (generally, the space between letters shall \n     be \\1/16\\ the height of upper case letters), and should \n     contrast with the background, either dark-on-light or light-\n     on-dark, or as recommended above.\n       C. Designation of Accessible Vehicles. The International \n     Symbol of Accessibility should be displayed as shown in \n     Figure 6.\n\n                     V. Public Information Systems\n\n       There is currently no requirement that vehicles be equipped \n     with an information system which is capable of providing the \n     same or equivalent information to persons with hearing loss. \n     While the Department of Transportation assesses available and \n     soon-to-be available technology during a study conducted \n     during Fiscal Year 1992, entities are encouraged to employ \n     whatever services, signage or alternative systems or devices \n     that provide equivalent access and are available. Two \n     possible types of devices are visual display systems and \n     listening systems. However, it should be noted that while \n     visual display systems accommodate persons who are deaf or \n     are hearing impaired, assistive listening systems aid only \n     those with a partial loss of hearing.\n       A. Visual Display Systems. Announcements may be provided in \n     a visual format by the use of electronic message boards or \n     video monitors.\n       Electronic message boards using a light emitting diode \n     (LED) or ``flip-dot'' display are currently provided in some \n     transit stations and terminals and may be usable in \n     vehicles. These devices may be used to provide real time \n     or pre-programmed messages; however, real time message \n     displays require the availability of an employee for \n     keyboard entry of the information to be announced.\n       Video monitor systems, such as visual paging systems \n     provided in some airports (e.g., Baltimore-Washington \n     International Airport), are another alternative. The \n     Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board \n     (Access Board) can provide technical assistance and \n     information on these systems (``Airport TDD Access: Two Case \n     Studies,'' (1990)).\n       B. Assistive Listening Systems. Assistive listening systems \n     (ALS) are intended to augment standard public address and \n     audio systems by providing signals which can be received \n     directly by persons with special receivers or their own \n     hearing aids and which eliminate or filter background noise. \n     Magnetic induction loops, infra-red and radio frequency \n     systems are types of listening systems which are appropriate \n     for various applications.\n       An assistive listening system appropriate for transit \n     vehicles, where a group of persons or where the specific \n     individuals are not known in advance, may be different from \n     the system appropriate for a particular individual provided \n     as an auxiliary aid or as part of a reasonable accommodation. \n     The appropriate device for an individual is the type that \n     individual can use, whereas the appropriate system for a \n     station or vehicle will necessarily be geared toward the \n     ``average'' or aggregate needs of various individuals. \n     Earphone jacks with variable volume controls can benefit only \n     people who have slight hearing loss and do not help people \n     who use hearing aids. At the present time, magnetic induction \n     loops are the most feasible type of listening system for \n     people who use hearing aids equipped with ``T-coils'', but \n     people without hearing aids or those with hearing aids not \n     equipped with inductive pick-ups cannot use them without \n     special receivers. Radio frequency systems can be extremely \n     effective and inexpensive. People without hearing aids can \n     use them, but people with hearing aids need a special \n     receiver to use them as they are presently designed. If \n     hearing aids had a jack to allow a by-pass of microphones, \n     then radio frequency systems would be suitable for people \n     with and without hearing aids. Some listening systems may be \n     subject to interference from other equipment and feedback \n     from hearing aids of people who are using the systems. Such \n     interference can be controlled by careful engineering design \n     that anticipates feedback sources in the surrounding area.\n       The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance \n     Board (Access Board) has published a pamphlet on Assistive \n     Listening Systems which lists demonstration centers across \n     the country where technical assistance can be obtained in \n     selecting and installing appropriate systems. The state of \n     New York has also adopted a detailed technical specification \n     which may be useful.\n\n  Office of Compliance--The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: \n Extension of Rights and Protections Under the Occupational Safety and \n                           Health Act of 1970\n\n\n                     NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING\n\n       Summary: The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance \n     is publishing proposed regulations to implement Section 215 \n     of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), \n     Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, as applied to covered employing \n     offices and employees of the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate, and certain Congressional instrumentalities listed \n     below.\n       The CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven labor \n     and employment and public access statutes to covered \n     employees within the Legislative Branch. Section 215(a) \n     provides that each employing office and each covered employee \n     shall comply with the provisions of section 5 of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 654 (``OSHAct''). 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a). The provisions \n     of section 215 are effective on January 1, 1997 for all \n     employing offices except the General Accounting Office and \n     the Library of Congress. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(g). Accordingly, \n     the rules included in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``NPRM or Notice'') do not apply to the General Accounting \n     Office or the Library of Congress at this time.\n       In addition to inviting comment in this NPRM, the Board, \n     through the statutory appointees of the Office, sought \n     consultation with the Secretary of Labor with regard to the \n     development of these regulations in accordance with section \n     304(g) of the CAA. Specifically, the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration provided helpful suggestions during the \n     development of the proposed regulations. The Board also notes \n     that the General Counsel of the Office has completed an \n     inspection of all covered facilities for compliance with \n     safety and health standards under section 215 of the CAA and \n     has submitted his final report to Congress. Based on the \n     information gleaned from these consultations and the \n     experience gained from the inspections, the Board of \n     Directors of the Office of Compliance is publishing these \n     proposed regulations, pursuant to section 215(d) of the CAA, \n     2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(d).\n       The purpose of these regulations is to implement section \n     215 of the CAA. This Notice proposes that virtually identical \n     regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the seven Congressional \n     instrumentalities; and their employees. Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in \n     this Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate, and this \n     proposal regarding the Senate and its employees is \n     recommended by the Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     regulations as described in this Notice be included in the \n     body of regulations that shall apply to the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of \n     Representatives, and this proposal regarding the House of \n     Representatives and its employees is recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that regulations as described in this Notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the \n     Capitol Guide Service, the Capitol Police, the Congressional \n     Budget Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, \n     the Office of the Attending Physician, and the Office of \n     Compliance, and their employees; and this proposal regarding \n     these six Congressional instrumentalities is recommended \n     by the Office of Compliance's Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n       Addresses: Submit written comments (an original and 10 \n     copies) to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Office of \n     Compliance, Room LA 200, John Adams Building, 110 Second \n     Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999.

L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, was enacted on January 23, 1995. \n     2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438. In general, the CAA applies the \n     rights and protections of eleven federal labor and employment \n     and public access statutes to covered employees and employing \n     offices.\n       Section 215(a) of the CAA provides that each employing \n     office and each covered employee shall comply with the \n     provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(a). Section 5(a) of the OSHAct provides that every \n     covered employer has a general duty to furnish each employee \n     with employment and a place of employment free from \n     recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause \n     death or serious physical harm to those employees and a \n     specific duty to comply with occupational safety and health \n     standards promulgated under the law. Section 5(b) requires \n     covered employees to comply with occupational safety and \n     health standards and with all rules, regulations and orders \n     issued which are applicable to their actions and conduct.\n       Section 215(c) of the CAA provides that, upon the written \n     request of any employing office or covered employee, the \n     General Counsel of the Office shall exercise the authorities \n     granted to the Secretary of Labor by subsections (a), (d), \n     (e), and (f) of section 8 of the OSHAct to inspect and \n     investigate places of employment under the jurisdiction of \n     employing offices. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(c). For the purposes of \n     section 215, the General Counsel shall exercise the \n     authorities granted to the Secretary of Labor in sections 9 \n     and 10 of the OSHAct to issue a citation or notice to any \n     employing office responsible for correcting a violation, or a \n     notification to any employing office that the General Counsel \n     believes has failed to correct a violation for which a \n     citation has been issued within the period permitted for \n     its correction. Id. Section 215(e) also requires that the \n     General Counsel of the Office of Compliance on a regular \n     basis, and at least once each Congress, conduct periodic \n     inspections of all covered facilities and report to \n     Congress on compliance with health and safety standards. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1341(e).\n       Section 215(d) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors \n     of the Office of Compliance established under the CAA to \n     issue regulations implementing the section. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(d). Section 215(d) further states that such \n     regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except to \n     the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated together with the regulation, that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' Id. Section 215(d) further provides that the \n     regulations ``shall include a method of identifying, for \n     purposes of this section and for different categories of \n     violations of subsection (a), the employing office \n     responsible for correction of a particular violation.'' Id.\n       In developing these proposed regulations, a number of \n     issues have been identified and explored. The Board has \n     proposed to resolve these issues as described below.\n\n                             A. In general\n\n       1. Substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor.--Section 215(d)(2) requires the Board to issue \n     regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except to \n     the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated together with the regulation, that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(d)(2).\n       Consistent with its prior decisions on this issue, the \n     Board has determined that all regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor after notice and comment to implement \n     section 5 of the OSHAct are ``substantive regulations'' \n     within the meaning of section 215(d). See, e.g., 142 Cong. \n     Rec. S5070, S5071-72 (daily ed. May 15, 1996) (NPRM \n     implementing section 220(d)); 141 Cong. Rec. S17605 (daily \n     ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM implementing section 203); see also \n     Reves v. Ernst & Young, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 1169 (1993) (where \n     same phrase or term is used in two different places in the \n     same statute, reasonable for court to give each use a similar \n     construction); Sorenson v. Secretary of the Treasury, 475 \n     U.S. 851, 860 (1986) (normal rule of statutory construction \n     assumes that identical words in different parts of same act \n     are intended to have the same meaning).\n       In this regard, the Board has reviewed the provisions of \n     section 215 of the CAA, the provisions of the OSHAct applied \n     by that section, and the regulations of the Secretary of \n     Labor to determine whether and to what extent those \n     regulations are substantive regulations promulgated to \n     implement the substantive safety and health standards of \n     section 5 of the OSHAct. As explained more fully below, the \n     Board proposes to adopt otherwise applicable substantive \n     health and safety standards of the Secretary's regulations \n     published at Parts 1910 and 1926 of Title 29 of the Code of \n     Federal Regulations (``29 CFR'') with only limited \n     modifications. The Board proposes not to adopt as substantive \n     regulations under section 215(d) of the CAA those provisions \n     of the Secretary's regulations that were not promulgated \n     to implement provisions of section 5 of the OSHAct.\n       In addition, the Board has proposed to make technical \n     changes in definitions and nomenclature so that the \n     regulations comport with the CAA and the organizational \n     structure of the Office of Compliance. In the Board's \n     judgment, making such changes satisfies the Act's ``good \n     cause'' requirement. With the exception of such technical and \n     nomenclature changes, however, the Board does not propose \n     substantial departure from otherwise applicable regulations \n     of the Secretary.\n       2. The board will adopt the substantive safety and health \n     standards contained in Parts 1910 and 1926 of title 29 of the \n     Code of Federal Regulations.--Section 215(a) requires each \n     employing office and covered employee to comply with the \n     provisions of section 5 of the OSHAct, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654. 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1341(a). Section 5(a) of the OSHAct provides that \n     every covered employer has a general duty to furnish each \n     employee with employment and a place of employment free from \n     recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause \n     death or serious physical harm to those employees, and a \n     specific duty to comply with occupational safety and health \n     standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration (``OSHA'') under the law. Section 5(b) \n     requires covered employees to comply with occupational safety \n     and health standards and with all rules, regulations and \n     orders issued which are applicable to their actions and \n     conduct.\n       The substantive occupational safety and health standards \n     promulgated by OSHA which the Board intends to adopt are set \n     forth at 29 CFR, Parts 1910 (general industry standards) and \n     1926 (construction industry standards). Although Part 1926 \n     was originally promulgated by the Secretary under section 107 \n     of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, the \n     substantive safety and health standards (subparts C through \n     Z) are adopted and incorporated by reference into Part 1910. \n     See 29 CFR Sec. 1910.12. These regulations implement the \n     substantive safety and health standards referred to in \n     section 5 of the OSHAct and thus are ``substantive \n     regulations'' which the Board proposes to adopt under section \n     215(d) of the CAA. However, the Board proposes not to adopt \n     those regulatory provisions in Parts 1910 and 1926 that have \n     no conceivable applicability to operations of employing \n     offices within the Legislative Branch or are unlikely to be \n     invoked. See 141 Cong. Rec. at S17604 (Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM \n     implementing section 203).\n       Adoption of the substantive safety and health standards of \n     Parts 1910 and 1926 is consistent with the language and \n     legislative history of section 215, which confirms that \n     Congress expected the law as enacted to require that covered \n     employing offices and covered employees comply with the \n     existing substantive occupational safety and health standards \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor. 141 Cong. Rec. S621, \n     S625 (Jan. 9, 1995) (section 215 ``requires employees and \n     employing offices . . . to comply with . . . the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Standards promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor under section 6 of that act.''). Similarly, the \n     section-by-section analysis of H.R. 4822, a precursor to the \n     CAA, clearly states that Congress expected the Board to adopt \n     OSHA occupational safety and health standards promulgated \n     under section 6 of the OSHAct as its own:\n       ``It is not intended that the Board will replicate the work \n     of the Secretary of Labor by promulgating its own standards \n     similar to those promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under \n     section 6 of the OSHA [citation omitted]. Rather, it is \n     intended that the Board will adopt the Secretary's \n     [occupational safety and health] standards, and only where \n     the Board believes different rules would better serve the \n     interests of OSHA and this Act will it adopt different \n     rules.'' S.Rep. 103-396 (Oct. 3, 1994).\n        Adoption of the substantive safety and health standards of \n     Parts 1910 and 1926 is also consistent with existing safety \n     and health practices of employing entities within the \n     Legislative Branch. For example, the Architect of the \n     Capitol, which has direct superintendence responsibility for \n     the majority of facilities subject to section 215, has \n     maintained a policy of voluntary compliance with the safety \n     and health standards under Parts 1910 and 1926 through its \n     safety and health program. See Congressional Coverage \n     Legislation: Applying Laws to Congress: Hearings on S.29, \n     S.103, S.357, S.207, and S.2194, Before the Senate Comm. on \n     Govt. Affairs, 103d Cong., 3d Sess. 55-56 (1995) (testimony \n     of J. Raymond Carroll, Director of Engineering, Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol).\n        The Board also notes that the General Counsel applied the \n     occupational safety and health standards under Parts 1910 and \n     1926 in his initial inspection of Legislative Branch \n     facilities pursuant to section 215(c) of the CAA. In contrast \n     to other sections of the CAA, which generally give the Office \n     of Compliance only adjudicatory and regulatory \n     responsibilities, the General Counsel has the authority to \n     investigate and prosecute alleged violations of safety and \n     health standards under section 215, as well as the \n     responsibility for inspecting covered facilities to\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\n     ensure compliance. In his final inspection report, the \n     General Counsel stated his view that application of Parts \n     1910 and 1926 standards appeared appropriate for such \n     operations. See Report on Initial Inspections of Facilities \n     for Compliance with the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Standards Under Section 215 (``Safety and Health Report''), \n     p. I-2 (June 28, 1996).\n       For all of these reasons, the Board proposes to adopt all \n     otherwise applicable sections of Parts 1910 and 1926 as \n     substantive regulations under section 215(d).\n       3. Modification of Parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR.--The Board \n     has considered whether and to what extent it should modify \n     otherwise applicable substantive safety and health standards \n     at 29 CFR, Parts 1910 and 1926. As the Board has noted in \n     prior rulemakings, the language and legislative history of \n     the CAA leads the Board to conclude that, absent clear \n     statutory language to the contrary, the Board should hew as \n     closely as possible to the text of otherwise applicable \n     regulations implementing the statutory provisions applied to \n     the Legislative Branch. See, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. S221, S222 \n     (Jan. 22, 1996) (Notice of Adoption of Rules Implementing \n     Section 203) (``The CAA was intended not only to bring \n     covered employees the benefits of the . . . incorporated \n     laws, but also require Congress to experience the same \n     compliance burdens faced by other employers so that it could \n     more fairly legislate in this area.''). Thus, consistent with \n     its prior decisions, the Board proposes to issue Parts 1910 \n     and 1926 of the Secretary's regulations with only technical \n     changes in the nomenclature and deletion of those sections \n     clearly inapplicable to the Legislative Branch. See, e.g., \n     141 Cong. Rec. S17603-S17604 (Nov. 28, 1995) (preamble to \n     NPRM under section 203 of the CAA).\n        This conclusion is also supported by the General Counsel's \n     inspection report, which applied the substantive safety and \n     health standards to covered facilities in the course of his \n     initial inspections under section 215(e) of the CAA. \n     Specifically, the report found nothing about work operations \n     within facilities of the Legislative Branch that suggested \n     that they were so different from those in comparable private \n     sector facilities as to require a different safety and health \n     standard. See generally Safety and Health Report. Thus, with \n     the exception of nonsubstantive technical and nomenclature \n     changes, the Board proposes no departure from the text of \n     otherwise applicable portions of Parts 1910 and 1926.\n       4. Secretary of Labor's regulations that the board proposes \n     not to adopt.--In reviewing the remaining parts of the \n     Secretary's regulations, it is apparent that they either were \n     not promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     safety and health standards referred to in section 5 of the \n     OSHAct and/or have no application to employing offices or \n     other facilities within the Legislative Branch. For this \n     reason, the Board is not including them within its \n     substantive regulations. Among the excluded regulations are \n     the following parts of 29 CFR: Part 1902 (adoption of health \n     and safety standards and enforcement plans by States); Part \n     1908 (cooperative agreements between OSHA and the States); \n     Parts 1911 and 1912 (procedure for promulgating, modifying or \n     revoking occupational safety and health standards by OSHA); \n     Parts 1915-1922 (occupational safety and health standards and \n     procedures for shipyards, marine terminals, and longshoring \n     operations); Part 1914 (safety and health standards \n     applicable to workshops and rehabilitation facilities \n     assisted by federal grants); Part 1925 (safety and health \n     requirements under the Service Contract Act of 1965); Part \n     1928 (occupational safety and health standards applicable to \n     agricultural operations); Part 1949 (OSHA Office of Training \n     and Education regulations); Parts 1950-1956 (State \n     occupational safety and health regulation and enforcement \n     plans and planning grants to States); Part 1960 (occupational \n     safety and health regulation of Federal executive branch \n     employees and agencies, implementing section 19 of the \n     OSHAct); Part 1975 (regulations clarifying the definition of \n     employer under the OSHAct); Part 1978 (regulations \n     implementing section 405 of the Surface Transportation \n     Assistance Act of 1982); Part 1990 (regulations relating to \n     identification, classification, and regulation of potential \n     occupational carcinogens); Part 2201 (regulations \n     implementing the Freedom of Information Act); Part 2202 \n     (rules of ethics and conduct of Occupational Safety and \n     Health Review Commission employees); Part 2203 (regulations \n     implementing the Government in the Sunshine Act); Part 2204 \n     (regulations implementing the Equal Access to Justice Act in \n     Proceedings before the Occupational Safety and Health Review \n     Commission); Part 2205 (regulations enforcing the provisions \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of handicap in \n     programs or activities conducted by the OSHRC); and Part 2400 \n     (regulations implementing the Privacy Act). Unless public \n     comments demonstrate otherwise, the Board intends to include \n     in the adopted regulations a provision stating that the Board \n     has issued substantive regulations on all matters for which \n     section 215(d) requires a regulation. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1411.\n       The Board will also not adopt as part of its regulations \n     under section 215(d) of the CAA the rules of agency practice \n     and procedure for the Occupational Safety and Health Review \n     Commission (Part 2200), rules of agency practice and \n     procedure regarding OSHA access to employee medical records \n     (Part 1913), and rules implementing the rights and procedures \n     regarding the antidiscrimination and anti-retaliation \n     provisions of section 11 of the OSHAct (Part 1977). Although \n     not within the scope of rulemaking under section 215(d), the \n     Board has determined that the subject matter of these \n     provisions may have general applicability to Board and Office \n     proceedings under the CAA. Thus, these matters should be \n     addressed, if at all, in the Office's development of \n     appropriate changes in the procedural rules for section 215 \n     cases that the Executive Director promulgates pursuant to \n     section 303 of the CAA.\n       5. Variance procedures.--Section 215(c)(4) of the CAA \n     authorizes the Board to consider and act on requests for \n     variances by employing offices from otherwise applicable \n     safety and health standards applied to them under this \n     section, consistent with sections 6(b)(6) and 6(d) of the \n     OSHAct. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(c)(4). Part 1905, 29 CFR, contains \n     the Secretary's rules of practice and procedure for variances \n     under the OSHAct. Part 1905 was not promulgated to implement \n     the health and safety standards referred to in section 5 of \n     the OSHAct. Accordingly, it will not be adopted as part of \n     the Board's section 215(d) regulations. However, the Board \n     has determined that these regulations may concern matters \n     ``governing the procedure of the Office'' and, therefore, may \n     be addressed as part of a rulemaking under section 303 of the \n     CAA.\n       6. Procedure regarding inspections, citations, and \n     notices.--Section 215(c) of the CAA grants the General \n     Counsel of the Office the authority under sections 8 and 9 of \n     the OSHAct to inspect and investigate places of employment \n     and issue citations and notices to employing offices \n     responsible for correcting violations. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(c). \n     Part 1903 of the Secretary's regulations, which relates to \n     the procedure for conducting inspections, and for issuing and \n     contesting citations and proposed penalties, implements \n     sections 8 and 9 of the OSHAct. The purpose of Part 1903, \n     according to the Secretary, is to prescribe rules and to set \n     forth general policies for enforcement of the inspection, \n     citation, and proposed penalty provisions of the OSHAct. See \n     29 CFR 1903.1. Part 1903 does not implement any substantive \n     right or protection under section 5 of the OSHAct or of any \n     substantive health and safety standard thereunder. \n     Accordingly, the Board will not adopt part 1903 as part of \n     its section 215(d) regulations. However, the Executive \n     Director may consider adopting some or all of the rules \n     contained in Part 1903 as part of the procedural rules of the \n     Office, as applicable and appropriate.\n       7. Notice posting and recordkeeping requirements.--Section \n     215(c)(1) of the CAA grants to the General Counsel of the \n     Office of Compliance the authorities of the Secretary of \n     Labor under the following subsections of section 8 of the \n     OSHAct: (a) (authority of Secretary to enter, inspect, and \n     investigate places of employment), (d) (methods of obtaining \n     information), (e) (employer and employee representatives \n     authorized to accompany inspectors), and (f) (requests for \n     inspections), 29 U.S.C. section 657(a), (d), (e), and (f). 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1341(c)(1). Section 215 does not incorporate or \n     make reference to section 8(c) of the OSHAct (requiring \n     safety and health recordkeeping and posting of notices). More \n     specifically, section 8(c) of the OSHAct is not a part of the \n     rights and protections of section 5 of the OSHAct, nor is it \n     a substantive safety and health standard referred to therein. \n     Thus, section 215(d) of the CAA does not authorize the Board \n     to incorporate the general notice and recordkeeping \n     requirements promulgated by the Secretary to implement \n     section 8(c) of the OSHAct and, consequently, such \n     requirements (set forth at Part 1904) will not be imposed at \n     this time. See 141 Cong. Rec. at S17604 (NPRM implementing \n     section 203); 141 Cong. Rec. at S17656 (Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM \n     implementing section 204); 142 Cong. Rec. S221, S222 (Jan. \n     22, 1996) (Notice of Adoption of Regulations Implementing \n     Section 203).\n       The Board also notes that there are certain recordkeeping \n     requirements that are part of the substantive safety and \n     health standards under parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR, such as \n     employee exposure records under subpart Z. Thus, these \n     regulations have been included in the Board's proposed \n     regulations. See 141 Cong. Rec. at 17657 (daily ed. Jan. 22, \n     1996) (recordkeeping requirements included within portion of \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act applied by section 204 \n     of the CAA must be included within the proposed rules).\n       The Board is also aware that Congress has enacted two \n     special statutory provisions regarding safety and health that \n     may already apply to some covered employing offices. Section \n     19(a) of the OSHAct, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 668(a), requires the head \n     of each federal agency to ``establish and maintain an \n     effective and comprehensive occupational safety and health \n     program which is consistent with the standards promulgated \n     [by OSHA] under section 655.'' Agency heads are also required \n     to submit annual reports to the Secretary on occupational \n     accidents and injuries and on the agency programs established \n     under section 668. However, the statute itself gives the \n     Secretary no enforcement authority against federal agencies. \n     OSHA regulations implementing section 668 are not binding on \n     Legislative Branch agencies unless by agreement between OSHA \n     and the head of the agency. See 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1960.2(b).\n       The related provisions of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7902 cover an \n     agency in ``any branch of the Government of the United \n     States.'' Section 7902 imposes recordkeeping and report \n     requirements on each agency similar to the requirements of 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 668. There is no apparent\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\n     mechanism for enforcement of section 7902 obligations \n     regarding Legislative Branch agencies.\n       The above two provisions may arguably impose general \n     recordkeeping requirements with respect to occupational \n     accidents and injuries on some covered employing offices \n     independent of the CAA, to the extent that such employing \n     offices are found to be ``agencies'' within the meaning of \n     those statutory provisions. The Board's resolution of the \n     recordkeeping issue under section 215(e) of the CAA is not an \n     attempt to modify the statutory provisions of 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 668 and 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7902 and their applicability to \n     Legislative Branch entities. Whether section 215 of the CAA \n     and the regulations the Board proposes to implement \n     thereunder can be harmonized with these preexisting statutory \n     requirements not within the scope of the CAA that might \n     independently apply to Legislative Branch entities is an \n     issue that the Board has no occasion to address. See 142 \n     Cong. Rec. at S224 (daily ed., Jan. 22, 1996) (Notice of \n     Adoption of Regulations and Submission for Approval and \n     Issuance of Interim Regulations under section 203 of the CAA) \n     (declining to address issue of harmonizing regulations \n     regarding overtime exemption for law enforcement officers \n     under section 203 with preexisting statutory overtime \n     exemption for Capitol Police under 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 206b-\n     206c).\n\n                        B. Proposed regulations\n\n       1. General provisions.--The proposed regulations include a \n     section on matters of general applicability including the \n     purpose and scope of the regulations, definitions, coverage, \n     and the administrative authority of the Board and the Office \n     of Compliance.\n       2. Incorporation by Reference of Part 1910 and Part 1926 \n     Standards.--The Board will incorporate by reference the \n     portions of 29 CFR, Parts 1910 and 1926, it proposes to \n     adopt, rather than setting forth the full text of those \n     provisions in this Notice.\n       Incorporation by reference of the safety and health \n     standards set forth in Parts 1910 and 1926 is appropriate \n     under the circumstances and meets the ``good cause'' \n     requirement of the CAA. The portions of Parts 1910 and 1926 \n     that the Board proposes to adopt by reference contain only \n     substantive safety and health standards that are published in \n     Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations and that are thus \n     reasonably available to commenters and to affected employing \n     offices and covered employees. Moreover, incorporation by \n     reference of Parts 1910 and 1926 would substantially reduce \n     the volume of material published in the Congressional \n     Record: Part 1910 and 1926 are set forth in three volumes \n     of the Code of Federal Regulations. If restated herein, \n     the material would consist of almost 6,500 pages of text \n     and accompanying illustrations. Given that these standards \n     are proposed to be adopted without change by the Board and \n     are readily accessible to potential commenters, \n     incorporation by reference is appropriate.\n       3. Method for Identifying Responsible Employing Offices and \n     Establishing Categories of Violations.--Section 215(d)(3) of \n     the CAA directs the Board to include in its regulations a \n     method for identifying, for purposes of section 215 and for \n     different categories of violations of subsection (a), the \n     employing office responsible for correction of a particular \n     violation. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(d)(3). The method developed by \n     the Board to identify entities responsible for correcting a \n     violation of section 215(a) is set forth in section 1.106 of \n     the proposed regulations. Section 1.106 is based in large \n     part on the methods adopted and applied by the General \n     Counsel during his initial inspections of covered employing \n     offices under section 215(e). See Safety and Health Report, \n     App. V.\n       a. Identifying the employing office responsible for \n     correcting violations. In considering rules for identifying \n     the employing office responsible for correcting violations \n     under section 215, the Board is mindful that any regulation \n     that it promulgates should neither expand nor contract the \n     statutory safety and health obligations of employing offices \n     under section 215. See White v. I.N.S., 75 F.3d 213, 215 (5th \n     Cir. 1996) (agency cannot promulgate even substantive rules \n     that are contrary to statute; if intent of Congress is clear, \n     agency must give effect to that unambiguously expressed \n     intent); Conlan v. U.S. Dep't of Labor, 76 F.23 271, 274 (9th \n     Cir. 1996). Therefore, the Board has considered the nature of \n     the safety and health obligations imposed on employing \n     offices under the OSHAct, as applied by the terms of section \n     215(a). Specifically, the Board notes that section \n     215(a)(2)(C) expressly assigns liability to the employing \n     office responsible for correcting the violation, \n     ``irrespective of whether the particular employing office has \n     an employment relationship with any covered employee in any \n     employing office in which such violation occurs.''\n       In many cases, the primary employing office responsible for \n     correcting the hazards identified under section 215 and for \n     addressing the recommendations made by the General Counsel is \n     the Architect of the Capitol, given the Architect's statutory \n     responsibility for superintendence and control over the \n     Capitol Building, House and Senate office buildings, and \n     other similar facilities. See, e.g., 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 163-\n     166 (Capitol Building), 167-175 and 185a (House and Senate \n     office buildings), 185 (Capitol Power Plant), 193a (Capitol \n     grounds), and 216b (Botanical Garden). However, it is \n     recognized that in some cases other employing offices, \n     particularly the staff or occupants of office buildings under \n     the Architect's superintendence, may have varying degrees of \n     actual or apparent jurisdiction, authority, and \n     responsibility for correction of violations. In other cases, \n     the employing office may have a responsibility to notify or \n     coordinate abatement of the hazard with the Architect of the \n     Capitol or other employing office actually responsible for \n     implementing the correction. Accordingly, proposed section \n     1.106 assigns responsibility to employing offices in four \n     situations:\n       1. The employing office that actually created the hazard or \n     condition identified. Frequently, the employing office that \n     created the hazard is in the best position to correct the \n     hazard, and has control over the manner and method of \n     operations sufficient to avoid the hazard in the first place \n     or reduce the hazard once created.\n       2. The employing office that is exposing its employees to \n     the hazard or condition. Under the OSHAct, an employer has \n     responsibility for the safety of its own employees and is \n     required to instruct them about the hazards that might be \n     encountered, including what protective measures to use. In \n     the case of hazardous conditions, facilities, or equipment \n     over which the employer has no control, it has a duty to at \n     least warn its employees of the hazard and/or to prevent the \n     employees exposure to the hazard by utilizing alternative \n     locations or means to perform the work. See Secretary of \n     Labor v. Baker Tank Co., 17 OSHC 1177, 1180 (OSHRC April 10, \n     1995).\n       3. The employing office that is responsible for safety and \n     health conditions in the workplace and has day-to-day \n     control, in whole or in part, of the area where the hazard or \n     condition is found. For example, a Member has effective \n     control over his or her own office area, and has the \n     responsibility for notifying the Architect or other \n     responsible offices, when hazards are identified in his or \n     her spaces, even though the Member may have no direct \n     responsibility in many cases for carrying out the correction \n     of the condition.\n       4. The employing office that is responsible for actually \n     carrying out the correction (or for contacting other offices \n     or otherwise arranging for correction of the hazard or \n     condition). In many cases, the Architect is responsible for \n     repairing and correcting physical hazards identified in his \n     area of superintendence, such as electrical hazards. In some \n     cases, other employing offices may have responsibility to \n     actually carry out the correction, such as the Chief \n     Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives with \n     respect to carpet repair in House office buildings. In other \n     cases, an employing office may have responsibility for \n     arranging for such corrections. For example, in House office \n     buildings, repair of carpeting falls within the jurisdiction \n     of the Chief Administrative Officer. However, the \n     Superintendent of the House Office buildings, an Architect \n     official, may have some responsibility for notifying the \n     Chief Administrative Officer that such repairs are needed, if \n     the Member or office staff does not do so.\n       The above rules are derived from the so-called multi-\n     employer doctrine applied by OSHA as a means of apportioning \n     liability for abatement and penalties at multi-employer \n     worksites where one employer created the hazard and some \n     employees, but not necessarily its own, are exposed to it. \n     See generally Brennan v. OSHRC (Underhill Construction \n     Corp.), 513 F.2d 1032, 1038 (2d Cir. 1975); Mark A. \n     Rothstein, Occupational Safety and Health Law Sec. Sec. 161-\n     169 (3d ed. 1990). Under this doctrine, an employer at a \n     multi-employer worksite is responsible, even in the absence \n     of exposure of its own employees, for any hazardous \n     conditions which it creates or controls. Id. See also H.B. \n     Zachry Co., 8 OSHC 1669, 1980 OSHD para. 25,588 (1980), \n     affirmed 638 F.2d 812 (5th Cir. 1981); OSHA Field Inspection \n     Reference Manual III-28 (1994).\n       There is an issue whether application of the multi-employer \n     doctrine by OSHA in the private sector context is in all \n     situations authorized by the OSHAct. Compare Teal v. E.I. Du \n     Pont de Nemours & Co., 728 F.2d 799, 804-05 (6th Cir. 1984) \n     (``Once an employer is deemed responsible for complying with \n     OSHA regulations, it is obligated to protect every employee \n     who works at its workplace.'') and Beatty Equip. Leasing v. \n     Secretary of Labor,  F.2d 534, 537 (9th Cir. 1978) \n     (subcontractor who supplied and erected scaffolding liable \n     even where his own employees not exposed) with Melerine v. \n     Avondale Shipyards, Inc.,  659 F.2d 706, 712 (5th Cir. 1981) \n     (``In this circuit, therefore, the class protected by OSHA \n     regulations comprises only employer's own employees.''). \n     However, the Board need not address this issue because the \n     CAA expressly imposes responsibility for correction of health \n     and safety violations on an otherwise covered Legislative \n     Branch entity ``irrespective of whether the entity has an \n     employment relationship with any covered employee in any \n     employing office in which such a violation occurs.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(a)(2)(C). Accordingly, the above regulations are \n     consistent with the OSHAct as modified by the express terms \n     of section 215 of the CAA.\n       b. Classifying the level of risk/seriousness of the \n     violation. The proposed regulations do not include a \n     provision classifying categories of violations. The method \n     for identifying the employing offices responsible for \n     correcting a violation of section 215(a) set forth in section \n     1.106 of the proposed regulations is not affected by the \n     category or type of violation. Moreover, such categories of \n     violations are not set forth in any substantive regulations \n     of the Secretary required to be adopted under section \n     215(d). Therefore, the Board does not propose any \n     substantive regulations which set forth categories of \n     violations.\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\n       The Board notes that the General Counsel has developed, as \n     part of his authority to inspect covered facilities under \n     section 215(e), classifications of violations to guide \n     employing offices and covered employees in assigning priority \n     for correction and abatement of hazards. The General \n     Counsel's guidelines are based on those issued by OSHA in \n     determining the amount of proposed penalties in cases \n     involving private employers. See generally 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 666(j) and (k). Although neither the General \n     Counsel nor the Office has authority to impose monetary \n     penalties under section 215 of the CAA, see 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1341(b) and 1361(c) (limiting remedy under section \n     215 to injunctive provisions of section 13(a) of the OSHAct \n     and providing that no civil penalty may be awarded with \n     respect to any claim under the CAA), the factors considered \n     by OSHA in determining the amount of penalty may be useful as \n     an expression of the gravity of the deficiency involved. A \n     further description of these categories is set forth in the \n     General Counsel's inspection report. See Safety and Health \n     Report, App. I.\n       4. Future changes in the text of the health and safety \n     standards which the Board has adopted.--The Board proposes \n     that the section 215 regulations incorporate the text of the \n     referenced health and safety standards of parts 1910 and 1926 \n     in effect as of the effective date of these regulations. The \n     Board takes notice that OSHA has in recent years made \n     frequent changes, both technical and nontechnical, to its \n     part 1910 and 1926 regulations, and is in the process of \n     developing additional safety and health standards in some \n     areas. The Board interprets the incorporation by reference of \n     external documents or standards in the text of the adopted \n     Parts 1910 and 1926 regulations (such as the provisions of \n     the National Electrical Code) to include any future changes \n     to such documents or standards. As the Office receives notice \n     of such changes by OSHA, it will advise covered employing \n     offices and employees of them as part of its education and \n     information activities. As to changes in the text of the \n     adopted regulations themselves, however, the Board finds \n     that, under the CAA statutory scheme, additional Board \n     rulemaking under section 215(d) will be required. The Board \n     believes that it should afford Legislative Branch entities \n     and employees potentially affected by adoption of such \n     changes the opportunity to comment on the propriety of Board \n     adoption of any such changes, and that the Congress should \n     have the opportunity to specifically approve such adoption by \n     the Board. The Board specifically invites comments on this \n     proposal.\n       5. Technical and nomenclature changes.--The proposed \n     regulations make technical and nomenclature changes, where \n     appropriate, to conform to the provisions of the CAA.\n       Recommended method of approval: The Board recommends that \n     (1) the version of the proposed regulations that shall apply \n     to the Senate and employees of the Senate be approved by the \n     Senate by resolution; (2) the version of the proposed \n     regulations that shall apply to the House of Representatives \n     and employees of the House of Representatives be approved by \n     the House of Representatives by resolution; and (3) the \n     version of the proposed regulations that shall apply to other \n     covered employees and employing offices be approved by the \n     Congress by concurrent resolution.\n\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 18th day of September, \n     1996.\n                                                    Glen D.

Enacted into law on January 23, \n     1995, the Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') directly \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven federal labor \n     and employment law and public access statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the Legislative \n     Branch. Section 215(a) of the CAA provides that each \n     employing office and each covered employee shall comply with \n     the provisions of section 5 of the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654. Section \n     5(a) of the OSHAct provides that every covered employer has a \n     general duty to furnish each employee with employment and a \n     place of employment free from recognized hazards that are \n     causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm \n     to those employees, and a specific duty to comply with \n     occupational safety and health standards promulgated under \n     the law. Section 5(b) requires covered employees to comply \n     with occupational safety and health standards and with all \n     rules, regulations and orders which are applicable to their \n     actions and conduct. Set forth herein are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section 215(d) of the \n     CAA.\n       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set \n     forth herein (Parts 1 and 1900) are the substantive \n     regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance has promulgated pursuant to section 215(d) of the \n     CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all \n     regulations under section 215, including the method of \n     identifying entities responsible for correcting a violation \n     of section 215. Part 1900 contains the substantive safety and \n     health standards which the Board has adopted as substantive \n     regulations under section 215(e).\n     Sec. 1.102  Definitions.\n       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these \n     regulations, as used in these regulations:\n       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act \n     of 1995 (Pub.L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-\n     1438).\n       (b) OSHAct means the Williams-Steiger Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 651, et seq.), as \n     applied to covered employees and employing offices by Section \n     215 of the CAA.\n       (c) The term covered employee means any employee of (1) the \n     House of Representatives; (2) the Senate; (3) the Capitol \n     Guide Service; (4) the Capitol Police; (5) the Congressional \n     Budget Office; (6) the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol; (7) the Office of the Attending Physician; and (8) \n     the Office of Compliance.\n       (d) The term employee includes an applicant for employment \n     and a former employee.\n       (e) The term employee of the Office of the Architect of the \n     Capitol includes any employee of the Office of the Architect \n     of the Capitol, the Botanic Gardens, or the Senate \n     Restaurants.\n       (f) The term employee of the Capitol Police includes any \n     member or officer of the Capitol Police.\n       (g) The term employee of the House of Representatives \n     includes an individual occupying a position the pay for which \n     is disbursed by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, or \n     another official designated by the House of Representatives, \n     or any employment position in an entity that is paid with \n     funds derived from the clerk-hire allowance of the House of \n     Representatives but not any such individual employed by any \n     entity listed in subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph \n     (c) above.\n       (h) The term employee of the Senate includes any employee \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, but \n     not any such individual employed by any entity listed in \n     subparagraphs (3) through (8) of paragraph (c) above.\n       (i) The term employing office means: (1) the personal \n     office of a Member of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee; (2) a committee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate or a joint committee; (3) any \n     other office headed by a person with the final authority to \n     appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, conditions, or \n     privileges of the employment of an employee of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate; or (4) the Capitol Guide \n     Board, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the \n     Architect of the Capitol, the Office of the Attending \n     Physician, and the Office of Compliance.\n       (j) The term employing office includes any of the following \n     entities that is responsible for correction of a violation of \n     this section, irrespective of whether the entity has an \n     employment relationship with any covered employee in any \n     employing office in which such violation occurs: (1) each \n     office of the Senate, including each office of a Senator and \n     each committee; (2) each office of the House of \n     Representatives, including each office of a Member of the \n     House of Representatives and each committee; (3) each joint \n     committee of the Congress; (4) the Capitol Guide Service; (5) \n     the Capitol Police; (6) the Congressional Budget Office; (7) \n     the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including the \n     Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden); (8) the Office of \n     the Attending Physician; and (9) the Office of Compliance.\n       (k) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance.\n       (l) Office means the Office of Compliance.\n       (m) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office \n     of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.103  Coverage.\n       The coverage of Section 215 of the CAA extends to any \n     ``covered employee.'' It also extends to any ``covered \n     employing office,'' which includes any of the following \n     entities that is responsible for correcting a violation of \n     section 215 (as determined under section 1.106), irrespective \n     of whether the entity has an employment relationship with any \n     covered employee in any employing office in which such a \n     violation occurs:\n       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a \n     Senator and each committee;\n       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including \n     each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and \n     each committee;\n       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;\n       (4) the Capitol Guide Service;\n       (5) the Capitol Police;\n       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;\n       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including \n     the Senate Restaurants and the Botanic Garden);\n       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and\n       (9) the Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.104  Notice of protection.\n       Pursuant to section 301(h) of the CAA, the Office shall \n     prepare, in a manner suitable for\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\n     posting, a notice explaining the provisions of section 215 of \n     the CAA. Copies of such notice may be obtained from the \n     Office of Compliance.\n     Sec. 1.105  Authority of the Board.\n       Pursuant to section 215 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is \n     authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and \n     protections of section 215(a). Section 215(d) of the CAA \n     directs the Board to promulgate regulations implementing \n     section 215 that are ``the same as substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement the \n     statutory provisions referred to in subsection (a) except to \n     the extent that the Board may determine, for good cause shown \n     and stated together with the regulation, that a modification \n     of such regulations would be more effective for the \n     implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(d). The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 215 of \n     the CAA requires a regulation to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of the regulations \n     adopted and set forth herein, there are no other \n     ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Labor to implement the statutory provisions referred to in \n     subsection (a) [of section 215 of the CAA]'' that need be \n     adopted.\n       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the Legislative Branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     Sec. 1.106  Method for identifying the entity responsible for \n         correction of violations of section 215.\n       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 215(d)(3) of the CAA \n     provides that regulations under section 215(d) include a \n     method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for \n     categories of violations of section 215(a), the employing \n     office responsible for correcting a particular violation. \n     This section sets forth the method for identifying \n     responsible employing offices for the purpose of allocating \n     responsibility for correcting violations of section 215(a) of \n     the CAA. These rules apply to the General Counsel in the \n     exercise of his authority to issue citations or notices to \n     employing offices under sections 215(c)(2)(A) and (B), and to \n     the Office and the Board in the adjudication of complaints \n     under section 215(c)(3).\n       (b) Employing Office(s) Responsible for Correcting a \n     Violation of Section 215(a) of the CAA. With respect to the \n     safety and health standards and other obligations imposed \n     upon employing offices under section 215(a) of the CAA, \n     correction of a violation of section 215(a) is the \n     responsibility of any employing office that is an exposing \n     employing office, a creating employing office, a \n     controlling employing office, and/or a correcting \n     employing office, as defined in this subsection, to the \n     extent that the employing office is in a position to \n     correct or abate the hazard or to ensure its correction or \n     abatement.\n       (i) Creating employing office means the employing office \n     that actually created the hazard forming the basis of the \n     violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (ii) Exposing employing office means the employing office \n     whose employees are exposed to the hazard forming the basis \n     of the violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (iii) Controlling employing office means the employing \n     office that is responsible, by agreement or legal authority \n     or through actual practice, for safety and health conditions \n     in the location where the hazard forming the basis for the \n     violation or violations of section 215(a) occurred.\n       (iv) Correcting employing office means the employing office \n     that has the responsibility for actually performing (or the \n     authority or power to order or arrange for) the work \n     necessary to correct or abate the hazard forming the basis of \n     the violation or violations of section 215(a).\n       (c) Exposing Employing Office Duties. Employing offices \n     have direct responsibility for the safety and health of their \n     own employees and are required to instruct them about the \n     hazards that might be encountered, including what protective \n     measures to use. An employing office may not contract away \n     these legal duties to its employees or its ultimate \n     responsibilities under section 215(a) of the CAA by requiring \n     another party or entity to perform them. In addition, if \n     equipment or facilities to be used by an employing office, \n     but not under the control of the employing office, do not \n     meet applicable health and safety standards or otherwise \n     constitutes a violation of section 215(a), it is the \n     responsibility of the employing office not to permit its \n     employees to utilize such equipment or facilities. In such \n     circumstances, the employing office is in violation if, and \n     only if, it permits its employees to utilize such equipment \n     or facilities. It is not the responsibility of an employing \n     office to effect the correction of any such deficiencies \n     itself, but this does not relieve it of its duty to use only \n     equipment or facilities that meet the requirements of section \n     215(a).\n\n    Part 1900--Adoption of Occupational Safety and Health Standards\n\n     Sec.\n     1900.1  Purpose and scope\n     1900.2  Definitions; provisions regarding scope, \n         applicability, and coverage; and exemptions\n     1900.3  Adoption of occupational safety and health standards\n     Sec. 1900.1  Purpose and scope.\n       (a) The provisions of this subpart B adopt and extend the \n     applicability of occupational safety and health standards \n     established and promulgated by the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration (``OSHA'') and set forth at Parts 1910 \n     and 1926 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations, with \n     respect to every employing office, employee, and employment \n     covered by section 215 of the Congressional Accountability \n     Act.\n       (b) It bears emphasis that only standards (i.e., \n     substantive rules) relating to safety or health are adopted \n     by any incorporations by reference of standards prescribed in \n     this Part. Other materials contained in the referenced parts \n     are not adopted. Illustrations of the types of materials \n     which are not adopted are these. The incorporation by \n     reference of part 1926, 29 CFR, is not intended to include \n     references to interpretative rules having relevance to the \n     application of the Construction Safety Act, but having no \n     relevance to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. \n     Similarly, the incorporation by reference of part 1910, 29 \n     CFR, is not intended to include any reference to the \n     Assistant Secretary of Labor and the authorities of the \n     Assistant Secretary. The authority to adopt, promulgate, and \n     amend or revoke standards applicable to covered employment \n     under the CAA rests with the Board of Directors of the Office \n     of Compliance pursuant to sections 215(d) and 304 of the CAA. \n     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in \n     the incorporated standards, the exclusive means for \n     enforcement of these standards with respect to covered \n     employment are the procedures and remedies provided for in \n     section 215 of the CAA.\n       (c) This part incorporates the referenced safety and health \n     standards in effect as of the effective date of these \n     regulations.\n     Sec. 1900.2  Definitions, provisions regarding scope, \n         applicability and coverage, and exemptions.\n       (a) Except where inconsistent with the definitions, \n     provisions regarding scope, application and coverage, and \n     exemptions provided in the CAA or other sections of these \n     regulations, the definitions, provisions regarding scope, \n     application and coverage, and exemptions provided in Parts \n     1910 and 1926, 29 CFR, as incorporated into these \n     regulations, shall apply under these regulations. For \n     example, any reference to ``employer'' in Parts 1910 and 1926 \n     shall be deemed to refer to ``employing office.'' Similarly, \n     any limitation on coverage in Parts 1910 and 1926 to \n     employers engaged ``in a business that affects commerce'' \n     shall not apply in these regulations.\n       (b) The provisions of section 1910.6, 29 CFR, regarding the \n     force and effect of standards of agencies of the U.S. \n     Government and organizations that are not agencies of the \n     U.S. Government, which are incorporated by reference in Part \n     1910, shall apply to the standards incorporated into these \n     regulations.\n       (c) It is the Board's intent that the standards adopted in \n     these regulations shall have the same force and effect as \n     applied to covered employing offices and employees under \n     section 215 of the CAA as those standards have when applied \n     by OSHA to employers, employees, and places of employment \n     under the jurisdiction of OSHA and the OSHAct.\n     Sec. 1900.3  Adoption of occupational safety and health \n         standards.\n       (a) Part 1910 Standards. The standards prescribed in 29 CFR \n     part 1910, Subparts B through S, and Subpart Z, as \n     specifically referenced and set forth herein at Appendix A, \n     are adopted as occupational safety and health standards under \n     Section 215(d) of the CAA and shall apply, according to the \n     provisions thereof, to every employment and place of \n     employment of every covered employee engaged in work in an \n     employing office. Each employing office shall protect the \n     employment and places of employment of each of its covered \n     employees by complying with the appropriate standards \n     described in this paragraph.\n        (b) Part 1926 Standards. The standards prescribed in 29 \n     CFR part 1926, Subparts C through X and Subpart Z, as \n     specifically referenced and forth herein at Appendix B, are \n     adopted as occupational safety and health standards under \n     Section 215(d) of the CAA and shall apply, according to the \n     provisions thereof, to every employment and place of \n     employment of every covered employee engaged in work in an \n     employing office. Each employing office shall protect the \n     employment and places of employment of each of its covered \n     employees by complying with the appropriate standards \n     described in this paragraph.\n       (c) Standards not adopted. This section adopts as \n     occupational safety and health standards under section 215(d) \n     of the CAA the standards which are prescribed in Parts 1910 \n     and 1926 of 29 CFR. Thus, the standards (substantive rules) \n     published in subparts B through S and Z of part 1910 and \n     subparts C through X and Z of part 1926 are applied. As set \n     forth in Appendix A and Appendix B to this Part, this section \n     does not incorporate all sections contained in these \n     subparts. For example, this section does not incorporate \n     sections 1910.15, 1910.16, and 1910.142, relating\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\n     to shipyard employment, longshoring and marine terminals, and \n     temporary labor camps, because such provisions have no \n     application to employment within entities covered by the \n     CAA.\n       (d) Copies of the standards which are incorporated by \n     reference may be examined at the Office of Compliance, Room \n     LA 200, 110 Second Street, S.E., Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. \n     The OSHA standards may also be found at 29 CFR Parts 1910 and \n     1926. Copies of the standards may also be examined at the \n     national office of the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. \n     20210, and their regional offices. Copies of private \n     standards may be obtained from the issuing organizations. \n     Their names and addresses are listed in the pertinent \n     subparts of Parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR.\n        (e) Any changes in the standards incorporated by reference \n     in the portions of Parts 1910 and 1926, 29 CFR, adopted \n     herein and an official historic file of such changes are \n     available for inspection at the national office of the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. \n     Department of Labor, Washington, D.C. 20210.\n\n Appendix A To Part 1900--References to Sections of Part 1910, 29 CFR, \n   Adopted as Occupational Safety and Health Standards Under Section \n                           215(d) of the CAA\n\n       The following is a reference listing of the sections and \n     subparts of Part 1910, 29 CFR, which are adopted as \n     occupational safety and health standards under section 215(d) \n     of the Congressional Accountability Act.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that this bill will soon \nbecome law. I commend my cosponsor, Senator Hatch. And I also commend \nRepresentative Conyers, who championed this bill over in the House, and \nwith whom I was proud to work on it.\n  A few months ago, the first circuit court of appeals made a mistake. \nIt made, in my view, a very big mistake: It said that the term \n``serious bodily injury'' in one of our federal statutes does not \ninclude rape.\n  Let me tell you about the case. One night near midnight, a woman went \nto her car after work. While she was getting something out of the back \nseat, a man with a knife came up from behind and forced her back into \nthe car. He drive her to a remote beach, ordered her to take off her \nclothes, and made her squat down on her hands-and-knees.\n  Then he raped her. After the rape, he drove off in her car, leaving \nher alone on the side of the road.\n  This man was convicted under the federal carjacking statute. That \nstatute provides an enhanced sentence of up to 25 years if the \ndefendant inflicts serious bodily injury in the course of a carjacking.\n  When it got time to sentence the defendant, the prosecutor asked the \ncourt to enhance the sentence because of the rape. Mind you, there was \nno dispute that the defendant had, in fact, raped the victim.\n  The trial judge agreed with the prosecutor, and gave the defendant \nthe statutory 25 years maximum, finding that the rape constituted \nserious bodily injury.\n  But when the case went up to the first circuit, that court said \n`no'--rape is not serious bodily injury. To support its ruling, and I'm \nnow quoting the opinion, the court said that ``there was no evidence of \nany cuts or bruises in her vaginal area.''\n  That, in my view, is absolutely outrageous--and Senator Hatch and I \nproposed this bill to set matters straight.\n  Under the code, ``seriously bodily injury'' has several definitions. \nIt includes: a substantial risk of death; protracted and obvious \ndisfigurement; protracted loss or impairment of a bodily part or mental \nfaculty; and it also includes extreme physical pain.\n  It takes no great leap of logic to see that a rape involves extreme \nphysical pain. And I would go so far as to say that only a panel of \nmale judges could fail to make that leap and even think--let alone \nrule--that rape does not involve extreme pain.\n  Rape is one of the most brutal and serious crimes any woman can \nexperience. It is a violation of the first order, but it has all too \noften been treated like a second-class crime. According to a report I \nissued a few years ago, a robber is 30 percent more likely to be \nconvicted than a rapist; a rape prosecution is more than twice as \nlikely as a murder prosecution to be dismissed; a convicted rapist is \n50 percent more likely to receive probation than a convicted robber.\n  No crime carries a perfect record of arrest, prosecution, and \nincarceration--but the record for rape is especially wanting.\n  And this first circuit decision helps explain why: too often, our \ncriminal justice system just doesn't get it.\n  If the first circuit decision were allowed to stand, it would mean \nthat a criminal would spend more time behind bars for breaking a man's \narm than for raping a woman.\n  For 5 long years, I worked to pass a piece of legislation that I have \ncared about like no other: The Violence Against Women Act. The act does \na great many practical things:\n  It funds more police and prosecutors specially trained and devoted to \ncombating rape and family violence.\n  It trains police, prosecutors, and judges in the ways of rape and \nfamily violence--so they can better understand and respond to the \nproblem;\n  It provides shelters for more than 60,000 battered women and their \nchildren;\n  It provides extra lighting and emergency phones in subways, bus stops \nand parks;\n  It provides for more rape crises centers;\n  It set up a national hotline that battered women can call around the \nclock--to get advice and counseling when they are in the throes of a \ncrisis;\n  And we're getting rape education efforts going with our young \npeople--so we can break the cycle of violence before it gets started.\n  But the Violence Against Women Act also meant to do something else, \nbeyond these concrete measures: it also sent a clarion call across our \nland that crimes against women will no longer be treated as second \nclass crimes.\n  For too long, the victims of these crimes have been seen not as \ninnocent targets of brutality, but as participants who somehow bear \nshame or even some responsibility for the violence.\n  This is especially true when it comes to victims who know their \nassailants. For too long, we have been quick to call theirs a private \nmisfortune rather than a public disgrace. We have viewed the crime as \nless than criminal, the abuser less than culpable, and the victim less \nthan worthy of justice.\n  We must remain ever vigilant in our efforts to make our streets and \nour neighborhoods and our homes safe for women.\n  And we need to make sure--right now--that no judge ever misreads the \ncarjacking statute again. With this bill, we are telling them that we \nintend, that we always intended, for those words ``serious bodily \ninjury'' to mean rape--no if's, and's or but's.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support.\n  The bill (S. 2007) was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed; as follows:\n\n                                S. 2007\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Consistent with \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 864, dated September 15, \n1993, the order prohibited the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare parts, and \npetroleum and petroleum products to the territory of Angola other than \nthrough designated points of entry. The order also prohibited such sale \nor supply to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola \n(``UNITA''). United States persons are prohibited from activities that \npromote or are calculated to promote such sales or supplies, or from \nattempted violations, or from evasion or avoidance or transactions that \nhave the purpose of evasion or avoidance, of the stated prohibitions. \nThe order authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to take such actions, including the \npromulgation of rules and regulations, as might be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order.\n  1. On December 10, 1993, the Department of the Treasury's Office of \nForeign Assets Control (OFAC) issued the UNITA (Angola) Sanctions \nRegulations (the ``Regulations'') (58 Fed. Reg. 64904) to implement the \nPresident's declaration of a national emergency and imposition of \nsanctions against Angola (UNITA). There have been no amendments to the \nRegulations since my report of March 25, 1996.\n\n  The Regulations prohibit the sale or supply by United States persons \nor from the United States, or using U.S.-registered vessels or \naircraft, of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons \nand ammunition, military vehicles, equipment and spare\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nparts, and petroleum and petroleum products to UNITA or to the \nterritory of Angola other than through designated points. United States \npersons are also prohibited from activities that promote or are \ncalculated to promote such sales or supplies to UNITA or Angola, or \nfrom any transaction by any United States persons that evades or \navoids, or has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to \nviolate, any of the prohibitions set forth in the Executive order. Also \nprohibited are transactions by United States persons, or involving the \nuse of U.S.-registered vessels or aircraft, relating to transportation \nto Angola or UNITA of goods the exportation of which is prohibited.\n  The Government of Angola has designated the following points of entry \nas points in Angola to which the articles otherwise prohibited by the \nRegulations may be shipped: Airports: Luanda and Katumbela, Benguela \nProvince; Ports: Luanda and Lobito, Benguela Province; and Namibe, \nNamibe Province; and Entry Points: Malongo, Cabinda Province. Although \nno specific license is required by the Department of the Treasury for \nshipments to these designated points of entry (unless the item is \ndestined for UNITA), any such exports remain subject to the licensing \nrequirements of the Departments of State and/or Commerce.\n  2. The OFAC has worked closely with the U.S. financial community to \nassure a heightened awareness of the sanctions against UNITA--through \nthe dissemination of publications, seminars, and notices to electronic \nbulletin boards. This educational effort has resulted in frequent calls \nfrom banks to assure that they are not routing funds in violation of \nthese prohibitions. United States exporters have also been notified of \nthe sanctions through a variety of media, including special fliers and \ncomputer bulletin board information initiated by OFAC and posted \nthrough the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Government \nPrinting Office. There have been no license applications under the \nprogram.\n  3. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from March 26, 1996, through September 25, 1996, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nAngola (UNITA) are reported to be about $227,000, most of which \nrepresents wage and salary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs \nwere largely centered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly \nin the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the \nOffice of the Under Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the \nGeneral Counsel) and the Department of State (particularly the Office \nof Southern African Affairs).\n  I will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments, pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

A bill to prohibit further extension or establishment of any \nnational monument in Idaho without full public participation and an \nexpress Act of Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  IDAHO NATIONAL MONUMENT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, yesterday afternoon President Clinton stood \non the edge of the Grand Canyon and proclaimed, by Executive order, \nthrough the National Antiquities Act, the designation of a national \nmonument in southern Utah of 1.7 million acres.\n  Was his action illegal? No. It certainly was not, or it does not \nappear to be at this moment. What is frustrating to those of us in the \nWest who have large expanses of public land is that the President \nsought no counsel, did not even consult with the Senators from Utah \nuntil the very last minute, did not talk to the Governor, to the State \nlegislators or to the county commissioners in whose counties this large \nexpanse of 1.7 million acres was involved. He simply stood on the banks \nor the edge of the Grand Canyon and proclaimed--yes, this is a device \nthat was used by President Roosevelt who set aside the Grand Canyon \nyears ago; it was a device that was oftentimes used prior to the \nenactment of the National Environmental Policy Act or the Federal Land \nUse Management Act, NEPA and FLMPA, because there was no certain public \nprocess to ensure the protection of valuable lands or, more \nimportantly, to involve the public in them. The Congress simply had not \nmoved in that direction at that time when the National Antiquities Act \ncame about.\n  That is not the case today. In my opinion, the President yesterday \nstanding on the edge of the Grand Canyon violated his public trust in \nfailing to openly and publicly involve all of the necessary people in \nmaking this decision and making sure that private rights, property \nrights, water rights, grazing rights, mining rights, all of those kinds \nof things, were taken into consideration.\n  In fact, I stood at a press conference yesterday afternoon in which \nthe Democrat Congressman from whose district this large expanse of land \nwas proclaimed by the President yesterday, and he said that at 11 \no'clock the night before he was on the phone with the President saying, \n``But, Mr. President,'' and the President was saying, ``Oh, don't \nworry. We will take care of you here and we will take care of you \nthere. We will protect hunting rights.''\n  Well, Mr. President, those kind of things do not exist in a national \nmonument. You do not allow hunting. You do not allow grazing. You do \nnot allow mining. Yet, this President, in the dark of night, in the wee \nhours before he was planning this great publicity event for his \nreelection, was telling the Democrat Congressman, ``I will take care of \nyou,'' after the fact.\n\n  Now, the reason that was happening is because this President sought \nno public process. As certainly the Presiding Officer knows, over the \nlast good number of years we have looked at a lot of public properties. \nWe spent 10 years designating over 5 million acres of land in southern \nCalifornia as wilderness. I went to California three times in public \nhearings. It was thoroughly debated on the floor. All of the rights \nwere taken care of.\n  Finally, this Congress acted and designated as wilderness a large \nchunk of the southern California desert. However, every issue was taken \ninto consideration prior to that happening. That simply did not happen \nyesterday with this President. He was interested in the sound bite and \nthe evening news and his politics and the campaign. He trampled all \nover the rights of citizens and all over the public process. I am \nsaddened by that.\n  It is for that reason today I am introducing legislation that would \ndeny him that right in the State of Idaho. I hope other Senators would \njoin with me who have large expanses of public land that now might be \nat risk, because this President, for his environmental political gains, \nwould select another piece of property. All I am saying is that the \nNational Antiquities Act does not apply in Idaho unless there is a \npublic process and unless the Congress agrees or consents or \nauthorizes.\n  What is important here is that I am not denying what the President \ndid. What I am denying is his right to do it in the back rooms in the \ndark of night, even with his own Secretary of Interior last Friday and \nthrough the weekend not being able to say that this, in fact, was going \nto happen.\n  It was the chief of staff of the White House, Leon Panetta, who \nfinally called the Senators from Utah just before it happened and \nannounced that it was going to happen. That should not happen. We want \npublic process. This President has pounded us on public process. We \nwill have public process in Idaho. I am not denying that some lands in \nIdaho might one day be selected as a national monument. But what I am \nsaying is that the citizens of the State of Idaho, the Governor of the \nState of Idaho, the county commissioners, the congressional delegation, \nand this Congress, because it's public land, will participate in the \nprocess of making those decisions. We don't want this President, or any \nPresident, running roughshod over the State of Idaho, or any other \nState for that matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 2093. A bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nto rescind approval of the District of Columbia's welfare reform \nwaiver; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                district of columbia welfare legislation\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would rescind the approval granted in August to the District of \nColumbia's welfare waiver.\n  I would first like to acknowledge and I want to recognize the \nleadership of my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, who recently \nintroduced similar legislation which would require the enforcement of a \n5-year time limit on welfare benefits in the district.\n  Senator Nickles' approach requires that the District live by the 5-\nyear requirement. My legislation simply repeals the entire waiver.\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\n  Madam President, today's Washington Post reports that the waiver was \ncompleted just 2 days before the welfare bill became law. In fact, on \nJuly 31 when the District was given notice that the President was going \nto sign the welfare bill, the District sent its waiver application in \nwithin one week. Now, this is the fastest anything has ever happened in \nthe District of Columbia. This is the one efficient thing they have \never done, getting their waiver papers in. The waiver application was \ngranted within 2 weeks. Now, have you ever heard of the bureaucrats at \nHHS doing anything in 2 weeks? But they got this out.\n  Madam President, the whole episode is a sham. The District of \nColumbia is a flat joke that is not funny and its government is a \nlaughingstock. Its welfare system is worse.\n  Madam President, it is apparent that the Clinton administration is \nnot serious about welfare reform. The President signed the bill with \nhis fingers crossed behind his back. He signed it because, according to \nTime magazine, the man who had his ear, his political consultant guru \nand advisor, Dick Morris, told him to sign it and got him to sign it.\n  It is crystal clear that should the Democrats regain control of \nCongress--which is not going to happen, but if they should--the welfare \nbill would be repealed immediately, and they as much as said so at the \nChicago convention.\n  Madam President, it has gotten so bad in the District of Columbia you \nwill be able to collect welfare for 15 years--for 15 years, as long as \nyou are making a good-faith effort to find work.\n  Let me give you just an example or two of what finding work in the \nDistrict of Columbia involves: Getting your driver's license is finding \nwork; attending self-esteem classes is work. Now, where else in this \ncountry could attending self-esteem classes be called work?\n  Madam President, only in the District of Columbia would such a \nlaughingstock of a welfare system continue. And only with the Clinton \nadministration in power could it continue. Sadly, the joke is on us. \nThe joke is on the people of this Nation. The joke is on the people of \nKansas and North Carolina. They are the ones that are subsidizing and \npaying for the District of Columbia's folly.\n  We just passed a bill giving the District of Columbia $660 million. \nWe do so every year. Now, how is the money used? It is not used. It is \nmisused and it is thrown away at a rate that the average American could \nnot understand.\n  They cannot open the schools on time. Only 52 percent of high school \nstudents actually graduate despite the fact they spend more money per \nstudent than any city in the United States--52 percent graduate. The \nDistrict has the same number of public employees as the City of \nChicago--which is five times larger. And Chicago is 5 times larger. Can \nyou imagine a city when 1 of every 8 citizens is a city employee? It's \na disaster. It has more employees per resident than any city in the \nNation. They don't pave their roads, and they don't fix their roads. In \nfact, they are required, by law, to have a local match for Federal road \nmoney. But we had to waive that, too. Why did we have to waive it? \nBecause they have thrown away their money on welfare, graft, and \ngiveaway programs, and they simply don't have the money to match it. \nThey have thrown it away in every conceivable way, such as fake \nemployees and employees that don't work. One out of every 8 citizens is \nemployed. They paid Medicaid payments to 20,00 people who weren't \neligible; 20,000 people who weren't eligible, they paid it to. The \nwater is contaminated. You have to get up in the morning and boil your \nwater before you can drink it.\n\n  The prison system is notorious for its numerous escapes. In fact, it \nis not a prison system, it is a sieve. Mr. President, our capital is a \ndisaster.\n  Now comes the mother of all bad ideas for the capital, and that is to \ngive the District a massive tax cut. The concept is that people will \nmove to the district, revenue will increase, and all will be fine.\n  First, the tax break will give a cushy tax break to the wealthy \npeople who seek a nice tax shelter by maintaining a phony residence in \nWashington and living in Palm Beach.\n  Second, it will give all the overpaid bureaucrats that live here a \ntax break. But most important, the tax cut ignores what happens to the \nrevenue. Will it be somehow be better spent, or will it be wasted, \nstolen, abused, and thrown away, as it is now? Of course, it will \nbecause we have done nothing to get to the root of the problem, which \nis the District's government and the people running it.\n  Mr. President, it has gotten so bad that a Los Angeles Times article \non conditions in Washington opened with a quote from an Egyptian \ndiplomat. He said:\n\n       Every day here in Washington reminds me more and more of \n     Cairo.\n\n  Doesn't that say it all? There isn't any way the city could be run \nworse.\n  Mr. President, the Nation's capital is just that. It belongs to the \nNation. It was set apart as the District of Columbia by the Founding \nFathers so that it would not become involved in local politics, and it \nhas become a mishmash of bad local politics.\n  We need a capital that the people of America can be proud of, a \ncapital that visitors from my State and every State can come to and \nfeel safe. That isn't the case today. Rather than a massive tax cut, we \nneed to seriously consider another form of government for the \nDistrict--not home rule, not congressional rule, but input from the 50 \nStates who are paying for the operation of this Capital City. It should \nbe one we can be proud of, and it's one that we have to make continuous \napologies for.\n  It is time for the people of this country to take control of it, as \nwas intended by our forefathers. I think the sooner we do it the \nbetter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2094. A bill to inform and empower consumers in the United States \nthrough a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and sporting \ngoods made without abusive and exploitative child labor, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         The Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Child Labor Free \nConsumer Information Act of 1996, legislation to establish a voluntary \nlabeling system to help inform American consumers whether wearing \napparel or sporting goods they see on the store shelves are made \nwithout the use of abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Although it is late in the session, I believe we should begin a \nsubstantive dialog about ending child labor right now. That is why I am \nintroducing this legislation today. And I intend on reintroducing this \nmeasure at the beginning of the next Congress.\n\n\n                          A Worldwide Scourge\n\n  When I speak about child labor, I am not talking about children \nhelping out on the family farm or running errands after school. I am \nspeaking about children who are forced to work in hazardous and \ndangerous conditions--children denied the classroom and driven into the \nworkrooms.\n  Child labor is a scourge around the world. But we can't dismiss the \nproblem simply because it may occur an ocean away. We cannot ease our \nconscience by declaring it a ``them'' problem, because it is not. It is \nan ``us'' problem. And all of us can do something to stop it.\n  Take a moment to look around. Maybe it's the shirt you have on right \nnow. Or the silk tie or blouse. Or the soccer ball you kick around with \nthe kids in the backyard. Or the tennis shoes you wear on weekends.\n  Chances are that you have purchased something--perhaps many things--\nmade with abusive and exploitative child labor. And chances are you \nwere completely unaware that was the case. That is hardly surprising. \nBecause the tag we see for items in our stores tell us how much we have \nto pay to buy it. But it doesn't tell us how much someone else had to \npay to make it.\n  For example, the price tag on a soccer ball doesn't tell us that a \nyoung child in South Asia--perhaps no older than 5 years of age--paid \nto make it by working in cramped conditions, stitching together balls \nfor hours at a time and a dollar a day.\n  Last year, the United States imported almost 50 percent of the \nwearing\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\napparel sold in America and the garment industry netted $34 billion. \nAccording to the Department of Commerce, last year the United States \nimported 494.1 million pairs of athletic footwear and produced only \n65.3 million here at home.\n  Americans may ask, ``What does this have to do with us?'' It is quite \nsimple. By protecting the rights of workers everywhere, we will be \nprotecting jobs and opportunities here at home. A U.S. worker cannot \ncompete with a 12 year old working 12 hours a day for 12 cents an hour.\n\n\n                             Public Support\n\n  As I have traveled around the country and spoken with people about \nthe issue of abusive and exploitative child labor, I have found that \nconsumers--ordinary Americans--want to get involved. They want \ninformation. They want to know if products on the shelves are made by \nchildren. And they do not want to buy it if it is.\n  Public opinion polls back that up. According to a survey sponsored by \nMarymount University last year, more than three out of four Americans \nsaid they would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware that the \ngoods sold there were made by exploitative and abusive child labor. \nConsumers also said that they would be willing to pay an extra $1 on a \n$20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made under legitimate \ncircumstances.\n  Mr. President, consumers have spoken. They do not want to reward \ncompanies with their hard earned dollars by buying products made with \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  This body has also spoken. On September 23, 1993, the Senate put \nitself on record in opposition to the abhorrent practice of exploiting \nchildren for commercial gain. This body passed a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that I introduced which asserted that it should be the \npolicy of the United States to prohibit the importation of products \nmade with the use of abusive and exploitative child labor. This was the \nfirst step to ending child labor. Now it's time for the next.\n\n\n                         Let the Buyer Be Aware\n\n  The Child Labor Free Consumer Information Act of 1996 will inform and \nempower American consumers by establishing a voluntary labeling system \nfor wearing apparel and sporting goods made without abusive and \nexploitative child labor.\n  In my view, a system of voluntary labeling holds the best promise of \ngiving consumers the information they want--and giving the companies \nthat manufacture these products the recognition they deserve.\n  The centerpiece of this legislation is the establishment of a working \ngroup of members from the wearing apparel and sporting goods \nindustries; labor organizations; consumer advocacy and human rights \ngroups; along with the Secretaries of Commerce, Treasury, and Labor. \nThis Child Labor Free Commission would establish a labeling standard \nand develop a system to assure compliance that items were not made with \nabusive and exploitative child labor.\n  In my view, Congress cannot do it alone through legislation. The \nDepartment of Labor cannot do it alone through enforcement. It takes \nall of us--from the private sector to labor and human rights groups--to \ntake responsibility and work together to end abusive and exploitative \nchild labor.\n\n\n                           Voluntary Approach\n\n  Let me be clear, companies can choose whether to use the label. This \nbill is not about big government telling the private sector what to do. \nIt is based on the commonsense approach that a fully informed American \nconsumer will make the right and moral choice and vote against abusive \nand exploitative child labor with their pocketbook.\n  We have seen such an approach work effectively with the Rugmark label \nfor hand-knotted oriental carpets. It is operating in some European \ncountries. Consumers who want to buy child labor-free carpets can just \nlook for the Rugmark label.\n  Over 150,000 carpets have received the Rugmark label and been shipped \nto Germany. Rugmark licenses already provide 30 percent of German \ncarpet imports from India. And I am pleased to say that there are now \ntwo wholesalers in New York that offer carpets with the Rugmark label.\n\n\n                          Building on Progress\n\n  Mr. President, the progress that has been made on eradicating abusive \nand exploitative child labor is irreversible. We must continue working \ntogether to end child labor for all. And I believe my bill provides a \nroad map to reaching that goal.\n  It allows the consumer to know more about the products they buy and \nit gives companies that use the label the recognition they deserve. I \nurge my colleagues to support my bill.\n  Our Nation began this century by working to end abusive and \nexploitative child labor in America, let us close this century by \nending child labor around the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Marymount University Center for Ethical Concerns\n\n\n new garment workers study finds americans intolerant of sweatshops in \n                            garment industry\n\n       Arlington, VA--Retailers selling clothing made in \n     sweatshops operating in the United States could feel the ire \n     of American consumers, suggests a new survey sponsored by \n     Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia. The new study \n     shows that consumers would avoid stores that sell goods made \n     in sweatshops and be more inclined to shop at stores working \n     actively to prevent garment worker abuses.\n       According to the survey, more than three-fourths of \n     Americans would avoid shopping at stores if they were aware \n     that the stores sold goods made in sweatshops. Consumers also \n     are willing to pay a price for assurances that the goods they \n     buy are not made in sweatshops. An overwhelming majority (84 \n     percent) say they would be willing to pay up to an extra $1 \n     on a $20 garment if were guaranteed to be made in a \n     legitimate shop.\n       The study, sponsored by Marymount's Center for Ethical \n     Concerns and the Department of Fashion Design and \n     Merchandising, was prompted by the recent discovery of \n     sweatshops operating in the United States in which illegal \n     aliens smuggled into the country were forced to produce \n     garments under almost slave labor conditions. In one factory, \n     raided earlier this year by U.S. officials, workers had been \n     confined in a barbed wire-enclosed compound and forced to \n     work between 16 and 22 hours a day. Workers were paid less \n     than $1 an hour and essentially held captive until they had \n     repaid the cost of their passage to the United States, a \n     process that took years in some cases.\n       Since these revelations, the U.S. Department of Labor has \n     been working with retailers to encourage greater diligence in \n     policing the industry voluntarily and plans in the near \n     future to release a list of companies that have agreed to \n     cooperate in these efforts. The new study shows that a \n     substantial majority of Americans (66 percent) would be more \n     likely to patronize stores that they know are cooperating \n     with law enforcement officials to prevent sweatshops. If such \n     a list were published, more than two-thirds (69 percent) of \n     consumers say they would take this information into account \n     when deciding where to do their shopping this holiday season.\n       ``It is gratifying to know that Americans condemn these \n     sweatshop conditions and are willing to demonstrate that \n     commitment when they shop, even if it costs them a few \n     pennies. The industry, including retailers, has a \n     responsibility to make sure it is not selling garments made \n     in sweatshops, and the public is willing to hold them \n     accountable,'' said Sr. Eymard Gallagher, RSHM, president of \n     Marymount University. ``Despite the competitiveness in the \n     industry, we can't close our eyes to these kinds of \n     conditions that we thought had disappeared years ago,'' she \n     said.\n       The telephone survey of 1,008 randomly selected adults, was \n     conducted by ICR Survey Research Group of Media, PA, at the \n     request of Marymount. The survey has a margin of error of \n     plus or minus 3 percentage points.\n       Marymount University's fashion design and fashion \n     merchandising programs are among the leaders in this field in \n     the United States. Marymount is an independent, Catholic \n     university, emphasizing excellence in teaching, attention to \n     the individual, and values and ethics across the curriculum. \n     Located in Arlington, Virginia, Marymount enrolls 4,200 men \n     and women in its 34 undergraduate and 24 master's degree \n     programs.\n\n\n                    study background and objectives\n\n       United States officials recently discovered that workers \n     who had been smuggled into this country were making garments \n     in sweatshops where they were forced to work long hours under \n     extremely poor working conditions for less than the minimum \n     wage. As a result, this research was conducted to determine:\n       Whether respondents would avoid shopping at retailers if \n     aware they sold garments made in sweatshops;\n       Whether respondents would be more inclined to shop in \n     retail stores cooperating with law enforcement officials to \n     prevent sweatshops;\n       Whether respondents would be willing to pay $1 more for a \n     $20 garment if it were guaranteed to be made in a legitimate \n     shop;\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\n       Whether respondents would be more likely this holiday \n     season to shop in retail stores on a forthcoming list of \n     retailers assisting authorities in their effort to end abuse \n     of United States garment workers; and\n       Whether the manufacturers or the retailers should have the \n     responsibility of preventing sweatshops.\n\n\n                          research methodology\n\n       The research entailed a telephone interview insert in ICR \n     Survey Research Group's EXCEL Omnibus. Each EXCEL includes a \n     national random sample of approximately 1,000 adults (18+), \n     half male and half female.\n       Interviewing was conducted from Friday, October 27 through \n     Tuesday, October 31. A total of 1008 interviews were \n     completed. Data has been weighted to reflect the U.S. \n     population 18 years of age and older (188,700,000).\n\n\n    in a nutshell . . . here are the findings; retailers--beware of \n                           sweatshop garments\n\n       Americans overwhelmingly support the idea of officials \n     publishing a list of retailers who assist law enforcement \n     agencies in their effort to end abuse of United States \n     garment workers. Seven-in-ten respondents indicate they would \n     be more likely to shop at the stores this holiday season that \n     cooperate to end garment worker abuse. Consumers are willing \n     to pay a price for assurances that goods they buy are not \n     made in sweathshops. 84% of consumers would pay an additional \n     $1 on a $20 item if they knew the garment was guaranteed to \n     be made in a legitimate shop.\n       Most Americans (76%) blame the existence of sweatshops on \n     the manufacturers who employ the contractors or workers. \n     However, if consumers knew a retailer sold garments that were \n     made in sweatshops, nearly eight-in-ten would avoid shopping \n     there. As the holiday season starts to kick-off, retailers \n     would be wise to ensure their garments were in fact made in \n     legitimate shops. Given the potential for enticing customers \n     with legitimately made garments, and the potential for losing \n     customers if caught selling sweatshop-made garments, \n     promoting legitimately made garments provides a strategic \n     business opportunity for retailers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SIMON (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 2095. A bill to promote the capacity and accountability of \nGovernment corporations and Government sponsored enterprises; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n    The Government Corporation and Government Sponsored Enterprise \n                             Standards Act\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my involvement in the issue of \nstudent aid over the past few years has given me a greater \nunderstanding of so-called government-sponsored enterprises. I have \nbeen critical of Sallie Mae, the Student Loan Marketing Association, \nfor its lobbying activities and its high salaries. Five years ago I \nbegan calling for the elimination of Sallie Mae's ties to the \nGovernment.\n  But I would like to go further in addressing this question of \ncorporations that are connected in some way with the Federal \ngovernment. How do they know when their purpose has been achieved, and \ntheir ties to the government should be cut? How do we make sure that \nthey do not become so strong politically that the ties can never be \ncut? Should they be exempt from federal, state, and local taxes? Should \nthe securities laws apply them?\n  Today, along with my colleague, Senator Pryor, I am introducing a \nbill that would address these and other questions. The bill would \nestablish standards for the creation of new Government-sponsored \nenterprises, those corporations that are created by Congress but are \nowned by private investors. The bill also would set guidelines for a \nvery different type of corporation: those that are actually owned by \ntaxpayers as a part of the Federal Government structure.\n  This legislation is the result of concerns raised by the National \nAcademy of Public Administration. Harold Seidman, in House testimony on \nbehalf of the Academy last year, pointed out that the Congress has not \nused any consistent criteria for determining when a government \ncorporation is appropriate and when it is not. He also raised questions \nabout some of the privileges that have been granted to Government-\nsponsored enterprises.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that, as Congress \nconsiders the creation of new government corporations and government-\nsponsored enterprises, it does so with its eyes wide open. It would \nalso require some of these entities to plan for eventual privatization, \nand would force Congress to review their status on a regular basis.\n  I know that it is not possible for Congress to act on this \nlegislation in these final weeks. But I hope some of my colleagues will \ntake up where I have left off, and work to establish much-needed \nstandards where Government intersects with business.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kerry):\n\n  S. 2096. A bill entitled the ``Environmental Crimes and Enforcement \nAct of 1996''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n          The Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act of 1996\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator \nKerry in introducing legislation, the Environmental Crimes and \nEnforcement Act of 1996, to increase penalties and strengthen \nenforcement for environmental crimes.\n  Mr. President, most Americans consider themselves environmentalists. \nMillions of Americans participate in voluntary recycling and do what \nthey can to save the environment. Similarly, many companies spend \nsubstantial amounts to comply with environmental laws, and many do much \nmore than required.\n  Mr. President, expenditures for environmental controls are a cost of \nbusiness that, in the short run, can adversely affect a company's \nbottom line. But these controls benefit all Americans. They lead to \ncleaner water, cleaner air, safer employees and healthier children.\n  Mr. President, when a business invests in environmental protection to \ncomply with our laws, it should not be placed at a competitive \ndisadvantage as a result. That is, it shouldn't have to compete against \nother firms that save costs by disregarding their environmental \nresponsibilities. But to protect against that kind of unfairness, Mr. \nPresident, Government must strongly enforce environmental laws. And \nthat is what this bill will help ensure.\n  Mr. President, this bill was developed by the Department of Justice \nafter consultation with State, local and Federal prosecutors from \naround the country. It is aimed at bad actors who violate our \nenvironmental laws purposely, intentionally, or with knowing disregard \nfor the impact of their actions. These are not people who accidently \nmiss a deadline or even negligently forget to file for a needed permit.\n  They are criminals who know what they're doing, and who generally are \nflouting our laws simply to make a buck.\n  Mr. President, we need to get tough with those who intentionally \nviolate environmental laws. This bill would help in several ways.\n  The bill would make it a federal crime to attempt to violate our \nenvironmental laws. This would make it much easier to enforce these \nlaws, and to prevent environmental degradation before it happens. Most \nfederal laws, other than criminal environmental laws now include \nprovisions for attempted criminality.\n  The legislation also would give federal prosecutors tools to work \nmore effectively with their state counterparts. It would improve \ntraining of law enforcement personnel in the investigation of \nenvironmental crimes. It also would facilitate prosecution by extending \nthe statute of limitations when a violator has tried to conceal \nenvironmental crimes.\n  Another provision in the legislation would allow judges to force \nenvironmental criminals to pay to clean up the mess they made. That, \nMr. President, is only fair. If a child has to clean up his own room, \nsurely a corporation should have to clean up their own mess when they \nintentionally dump toxic chemicals.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation would give judges the \nauthority to increase penalties when an environmental crime leads to \nserious injury or death. This should help deter the most serious abuses \nof our laws.\n  Mr. President, none of these proposals, by itself, will solve the \nproblem of environmental crime. But, together, they would make a real \ndifference. They would help improve the quality of our environment. And \nthey would help protect the majority of law-abiding businesses that \ninvest in environmental protection, and that abide by our laws in good \nfaith.\n  Mr. President, over the past 20 years, our economy has grown \nconsiderably, but pollution has been reduced. This has occurred not \nonly because Congress passed environmental legislation.\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\n  It has also occurred because of the creativity of our scientists and \nthe commitment of American businesses. These law-abiding businesses, as \nI have said, deserve to be treated fairly. They should be rewarded for \ntheir diligence, not placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage.\n  Mr. President, I recognize, given the limited time remaining in the \n104th Congress, that this legislation will not become law this year. \nHowever, I intend to work in the next Congress to have hearings on this \nbill, and I would welcome input from any interested parties.\n  Next year, I am hopeful that we can move in a bipartisan manner to \nmake any needed improvements, and to enact this legislation into law as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill, S. \n2096, and a section-by-section analysis be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2096\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Crimes and \n     Enforcement Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal investigation and prosecution of environmental \n     crimes play a critical role in the protection of human \n     health, public safety, and the environment;\n       (2) the effectiveness of environmental criminal enforcement \n     efforts is greatly strengthened by close cooperation and \n     coordination among Federal, State, local, and tribal \n     authorities; and\n       (3) legislation is needed to facilitate Federal \n     investigation and prosecution of environmental crimes and to \n     increase the effectiveness of joint Federal, State, local, \n     and tribal criminal enforcement efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Specifically, the findings are that \n     environmental criminal enforcement plays a critical role in \n     the protection of human health, public safety, and the \n     environment, and that these efforts are greatly enhanced by \n     close cooperation and coordination among Federal, State, \n     local, and tribal authorities. The purpose of the legislation \n     is to increase protection of the environment by strengthening \n     Federal law enforcement and by increasing the effectiveness \n     of joint Federal, State, local, and tribal criminal \n     environmental enforcement efforts.\n\n                               Section 3\n\n       Section 3 authorizes Federal district courts to order \n     convicted criminals to reimburse States, localities, and \n     tribes for costs they incur during Federal environmental \n     prosecutions. Moneys paid to State, local, and tribal \n     governments under this provision may be used solely for \n     environmental law enforcement. This reimbursement provision \n     applies to prosecutions under the Federal Insecticide, \n     Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); the Toxic Substances \n     Control Act (TSCA); the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act \n     of 1899; the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; the Marine \n     Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; the Act to Prevent \n     Pollution from Ships; the Shore Protection Act; the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery \n     Act; the Clean Air Act; the Comprehensive Environmental \n     Response, Compensation, and Liability Act; the Emergency \n     Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; the Federal Land \n     Policy and Management Act; and 49 U.S.C. Sec. 5124, relating \n     to transportation of hazardous materials.\n       This provision will strengthen criminal environmental \n     enforcement by fostering cooperative efforts among Federal, \n     State, local, and tribal officials. State and local \n     inspectors, and investigators often initiate what become \n     Federal enforcement actions, and they continue to work with \n     Federal officials through the trial stage. For example, State \n     laboratories provide analytical support. Many State and \n     local prosecutors participate in joint task forces and \n     they sometimes are cross-designated as special assistant \n     U.S. attorneys. Although certain State courts may award \n     costs to State and local governments in State criminal \n     proceedings, Federal courts are not now expressly \n     authorized to order such reimbursement. Providing for \n     reimbursement will greatly increase the ability of State, \n     local, and tribal officials to cooperate in Federal \n     criminal proceedings to address violations of \n     environmental law. Joint enforcement efforts also make the \n     Federal program more responsive to local communities.\n       Because the court may order reimbursement only upon motion \n     of the United States, the discretion of both the Federal \n     prosecutor and the court will serve as a check against \n     unwarranted cost awards. Allowable costs are limited to those \n     incurred by a State, local, or tribal government or agency \n     for assistance to the Federal Government's investigation and \n     prosecution of a case. Costs imposed on a defendant are \n     payable directly to the State or local government in a manner \n     analogous to the payment of restitution directly to the \n     victims of a crime, thus obviating the need for a separate \n     Federal fund or Federal administrator to collect and transfer \n     the moneys.\n\n                               Section 4\n\n       Section 4 provides for enhanced punishment where a criminal \n     violation of specified environmental laws directly or \n     proximately causes serious bodily injury or death to any \n     person, including any Federal, State, local, or tribal \n     government official.\n       Police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other public \n     safety and public health personnel often are the first on the \n     scene of an environmental crime. In their efforts to protect \n     others from harm, they themselves may suffer serious injury \n     or death resulting from other people's criminal mishandling \n     of dangerous materials or failure to comply with their legal \n     duty to notify the government of releases of dangerous \n     substances. Members of the public can also be injured or \n     killed as a result of environmental crimes.\n       Section 4 will ensure that the criminals who cause this \n     suffering will face an appropriately severe, enhanced \n     punishment upon conviction. It does not establish a new or \n     different crime, but instead provides for enhanced terms of \n     imprisonment and enhanced fines for persons convicted of \n     felony violations under specified Federal environmental laws \n     where death or serious injury results. The laws covered by \n     this provision are: the Federal Water Pollution Control Act; \n     the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; the \n     Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; \n     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, \n     and Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community \n     Right-to-Know Act; and 49 U.S.C. Sec. 5124. The section \n     also provides for enhanced penalties for environmental \n     misdemeanors under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and \n     Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act where \n     death or serious injury results, thereby transforming \n     those violations into felonies.\n       For enhanced punishment to be imposed, section 4 requires \n     that the defendant commit the underlying environmental crime \n     and that the crime be the direct or proximate\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\n     cause of serious bodily injury or death. The requirement of \n     ``direct or proximate'' causation is in line with language \n     used in other criminal provisions, see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 844 (personal injury resulting from arson), and limits \n     the sentence enhancement to appropriate cases. Those who \n     commit environmental crimes, for example, by illegally \n     storing hazardous waste, are on notice that their actions may \n     cause serious injury or death to other persons. Unlike \n     existing endangerment provisions in certain environmental \n     statutes that apply to threatened injuries, Section 4 \n     requires actual injury or death, but does not require that \n     the defendant intend or know of the injury or death that the \n     defendant's crime causes.\n       For the most part, the definition of ``serious bodily \n     injury'' in Section 4 follows similar definitions in 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 113 (assaults within maritime and territorial \n     jurisdiction) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1365(g)(3) (tampering with \n     consumer products). The definition in Section 4, however, \n     does not include ``substantial risk of death.'' In other \n     words, actual serious bodily injury or death (not just the \n     risk of injury or death) must occur for enhanced punishment \n     to be imposed under Section 4. Section 4 also includes \n     ``unconsciousness'' within the definition of ``serious bodily \n     injury,'' thereby conforming to the definition of that term \n     in the Federal hazardous waste laws at 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 6928(f)(6).\n       Section 4 specifically lists certain government employees \n     whose death or injury could trigger enhanced punishment. This \n     listing is not intended to exclude other persons, including \n     other government employees, from the provision's coverage, \n     but rather to emphasize that the specified government \n     employees are exposed to special risks and are thus \n     especially likely to benefit from the added deterrence and \n     protection engendered by this provision.\n\n                               Section 5\n\n       Section 5 responds to the urgent need expressed by State, \n     local, and tribal officials for additional Federal training \n     on environmental criminal enforcement. It establishes within \n     the Environmental Protection Agency a separate program \n     dedicated to the training of State, local, and tribal law \n     enforcement personnel in the investigation of \n     environmental crimes.\n       States and local governments are undertaking an expanded \n     role in environmental enforcement, not only of their own laws \n     but also of Federal statutes pursuant to delegated authority. \n     The Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990 mandated that EPA \n     deploy 200 criminal investigators across the country and \n     establish the National Enforcement Training Institute (NETI) \n     to train State, local, and tribal law enforcement in safe and \n     effective investigation of environmental crimes. Section 5 \n     will increase training for State, local, and tribal law \n     enforcement officials and strengthen cooperative enforcement \n     of the Nation's environmental laws. Under the mandate of the \n     Pollution Prosecution Act of 1990, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency has regularly trained State, local, and \n     tribal investigators and regulatory personnel in courses \n     conducted at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center \n     (FLETC) in Glynco, GA. The need and demand for such training, \n     however, has been greatly increasing.\n\n                               Section 6\n\n       Section 6 provides for an extension of the statute of \n     limitations where a violator has engaged in affirmative acts \n     of concealment of specified environmental crimes.\n       As is the case for most Federal crimes, Federal \n     environmental crimes are currently subject to a five-year \n     statute of limitations, which runs from the time the offense \n     is committed. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3282. Some environmental crimes, \n     including some of the most egregious ones, involve \n     affirmative acts of concealment by the wrongdoers. Criminals \n     who are the most deceptive, and thus able to hide their \n     wrongdoing the longest, are most likely to escape the legal \n     consequences of their acts through expiration of the statute \n     of limitations.\n       Section 6 addresses this problem for a specified list of \n     felony violations of environmental statutes by extending the \n     limitations period for up to three years beyond the \n     traditional 5-year period when the defendant commits an \n     affirmative act of concealment. In these circumstances, the \n     limitation period extends to three years after discovery of \n     the crime by the government. In no event does the limitations \n     period extend beyond eight years after the offense was \n     committed. This extended limitations period covers violations \n     of various provisions under the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries \n     Act; the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships; the Shore \n     Protection Act; the Safe Drinking Water Act; the Resource \n     Conservation and Recovery Act; the Clean Air Act; the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and \n     Liability Act; the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\n     to-Know Act; and 49 U.S.C. Sec. 5124.\n       For example, if a violator committed an affirmative act of \n     concealment and the environmental crime were not discovered \n     until three, four, or five years after it was committed, \n     Section 6 would extend the statute of limitations to 6, 7, or \n     8 years after the crime was committed, respectively--that is, \n     up to three years after the time of discovery with an eight \n     year cap. If a violator committed an affirmative act of \n     concealment, but the crime were nevertheless discovered by \n     any Federal, State, local, or tribal government agency \n     immediately after it was committed, there would be no \n     extension under Section 6, and the limitations period would \n     be the 5-year period running from the time the crime was \n     committed. Similarly, where there was no affirmative act of \n     concealment, the five-year period would apply and would run \n     from commission of the crime.\n       The burden rests on the government to prove an affirmative \n     act of concealment under Section 6.\n\n                               Section 7\n\n       Section 7 amends specified environmental statutes to add \n     attempt provisions. Under these new provisions, any person \n     who attempts to commit an offense shall be subject to the \n     same penalties as those prescribed for the offense itself.\n       The rationale for these new attempt provisions is similar \n     to that for comparable provisions in other Federal criminal \n     statutes. Under these existing attempt laws, when law \n     enforcement authorities uncover planned criminal activity and \n     a substantial step is taken towards the commission of the \n     crime, the crime can be stopped before it is completed and \n     the perpetrator may still be prosecuted. For example, Federal \n     law makes attempted bank robbery a crime, punishable the same \n     as bank robbery. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2113(a). Similar attempt \n     provisions exist for numerous other crimes, such as uttering \n     a Treasury check with forged endorsement (18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 510); bank fraud (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1344); damage to \n     government property (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1361); obstruction of \n     court orders (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1509); and obtaining mail by \n     fraud or deception (18 U.S.C. Sec. 1708).\n       There has been only one attempt provision in Federal \n     environmental criminal enforcement statutes. As a result, \n     Federal agents can be placed in the untenable situation of \n     choosing between obtaining evidence necessary for a criminal \n     prosecution and preventing pollution from occurring. For \n     example, without an attempt statute, if agents stop a would-\n     be environmental criminal from dumping hazardous waste, the \n     perpetrator cannot be prosecuted for illegal dumping because \n     no environmental crime has occurred. Only if the agents allow \n     the dumping to occur, with the possibility of damage to the \n     environment and risk to the public health, could the \n     perpetrator be prosecuted for illegal dumping. These \n     attempt provisions allow law enforcement personnel to stop \n     environmental crimes before they are completed and still \n     bring the wrongdoer to justice.\n       Attempt statutes serve another very important purpose in \n     law enforcement, related to undercover investigations. \n     Attempt statutes allow prosecution where a defendant \n     purposely engages in conduct that would constitute the crime \n     if the circumstances were as the defendant believes them to \n     be. Undercover operations are widely recognized as a valuable \n     tool to ferret out serious crimes, and attempt provisions \n     will make undercover environmental investigations safer to \n     the public by allowing the government to substitute benign \n     substances for the dangerous substances that make the conduct \n     illegal, but still prosecute for attempt the person who \n     believes he is engaging in the illegal conduct.\n       The new language added by Section 7 is analogous to the \n     attempt provision contained in the Federal drug laws. 21 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 846. An attempt to commit the conduct \n     constituting one of specified environmental criminal offenses \n     is punished in the same manner as the offense itself.\n\n                               Section 8\n\n       Section 8 amends the Federal restitution statutes to \n     clarify the authority of the courts to provide for \n     restitution to victims in environmental crimes cases.\n       Existing restitution statutes provide for restitution for \n     bodily injury and property loss. Those categories of \n     restitution address the harm suffered by victims of violent \n     and economic crimes and are intended to make them whole for \n     their physical injuries and pecuniary damages. The victims of \n     environmental crimes also may suffer physical injuries and \n     pecuniary losses. Indeed, environmental crimes often are \n     economic crimes. At the same time, however, an environmental \n     crime also may cause more widespread and longstanding damage, \n     with the harm inflicted on all members of a community or \n     communities affected by the environmental pollution or \n     damage.\n       Section 8 clarifies the existing authority of the courts by \n     including environmental offenses among the crimes explicitly \n     enumerated in the restitution statutes. It makes plain that \n     the costs of removal and remediation of environmental \n     pollution or damage, and required restoration of the \n     environment, are included within the coverage of that \n     statute, to the extent of the pollution or damage resulting \n     from the offense. This section recognizes that environmental \n     crimes can harm entire communities and clarifies that the \n     definition of ``victim'' in the restitution statutes may \n     include all members of a community or communities, whether \n     or not they are individually identified.\n\n                               Section 9\n\n       Section 9 authorizes the government, after notice to the \n     defendant, to seek an order from the court to prevent a \n     defendant charged with an environmental crime from dealing \n     with its assets in a manner that would impair its ability to \n     pay for the harm caused by its environmental violations. The \n     government bears the burden of establishing the costs \n     involved, and the defendant may\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\n     avert such an order by showing that it retains sufficient \n     assets to cover those costs or that it already has paid such \n     costs. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure govern any \n     proceedings under this section for an order to prevent the \n     disposal or alienation of assets. Such an order expires at \n     the point of sentencing, or of dismissal or acquittal of the \n     prosecution.\n       This section expressly codifies the authority already \n     available to a court under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1651. It will prevent a defendant, during the pendency \n     of criminal environmental charges, from concealing, disposing \n     of, or otherwise dealing with its assets in such a manner \n     that, if it is convicted and is ordered to pay the costs of \n     the harm caused by its actions, sufficient assets no longer \n     will be available for that purpose. If such authority were \n     not available, defendants could easily thwart the purposes of \n     the restitution provisions of this act and those found \n     elsewhere in the law. Similar authority, to prevent the \n     disposal of assets to pay for violations of law, can be found \n     at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1345 (Injunctions against Fraud). At the \n     same time, the section allows a defendant that can show that \n     defendant's other assets will be sufficient to pay for such \n     harm, or that such costs already have been paid, to avoid \n     being burdened by such an order.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Prejudgment orders to secure payment for \n     environmental damage.''.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today with my good \nfriend Senator Lautenberg the Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act \nof 1996. The American people have every right to expect their \nGovernment to protect their health and safety, and take swift action \nagainst those who choose to do harm. Our bill would strengthen efforts \nto ensure a safer, cleaner environment for the future and would enhance \nthe Federal-State-local government partnership in fighting \nenvironmental crimes.\n  This administration has the strongest record in taking action against \nintransigent polluters, and it has collected among the biggest fines \nlevied on those polluters in American history. However, for too long, \nmany industrial polluters have gone largely unchecked and have \nconsistently evaded responsibility for the severe damage they have done \nto our environment.\n  I would like to review quickly some of the more important provisions \ncontained in our legislation.\n  One of the ground-breaking measures contained in this legislation is \nthe provision amending existing environmental statutes to define the \nattempt to commit an offense as a crime, subject to the penalties of \nthe offense itself. This makes environmental law consistent with other \nFederal criminal statutes. With only one exception, attempting to \ncommit an environmental crime is itself not a Federal crime. It is this \narea of law enforcement that would greatly benefit from such \nprovisions, which would in turn have the effect of better protecting \nthe public's health and safety and our environment. Furthermore, this \nprovision closes the gap between prosecution and environmental \nprotection. In the past, law enforcement officials could not prosecute \nviolators of environmental law until the crime was committed, causing \ndamage to the environment and jeopardizing public health and safety. \nNow, would-be wrong-doers can be stopped and prosecuted before they do \nharm.\n  Let me provide you with a good example of how this would work, using \na hypothetical case of hazardous waste dumping. While haulers are \nrequired by law to dispose of toxic materials in a permitted hazardous \nwaste disposal facility, often renegade transporters dump in vacant \nlots, remote areas, and other unauthorized locales. Once they have \nreceived information that illegal dumping is occurring, Federal agents \nconduct surveillance of hazardous waste transporters. But, because \nthere is no attempt provision in statutes defining environmental \ncrimes, if agents prevent a transporter from dumping hazardous waste, \nthe perpetrator cannot be prosecuted for illegal dumping because no \nenvironmental crime has occurred. Under current law, only by damaging \nthe environment by allowing the hazardous waste dumping to occur, can \nthe Government build a case to prosecute a person for illegal dumping. \nThis does not make sense and we must change these laws.\n  This provision adds a new dimension to the protection of the \nenvironment: the capability of officials to engage in undercover \noperations. These investigations will allow Federal officials to \nconduct ``sting'' operations by substituting benign substances for the \nactual pollutants, and prosecute, to the fullest extent of the law, \nthose violators who engaged in behavior they know to be illegal.\n\n  Another provision, and arguably the most important for cleaning up \nthe environment in a fiscally responsible way, is the authority granted \nto Federal district courts to order convicted criminals to reimburse \nStates, localities, and tribes for costs they incur during Federal \nenvironmental prosecutions. These recovered costs will be used \nexclusively for funding the enhancement of environmental law \nenforcement required in this bill.\n  Greater protection is also given to the first line of defense in many \nenvironmental crime scenes: police, firefighters, and public health \npersonnel. This measure will strengthen the existing penalties for \nviolations of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Community \nRight-to-Know Act, Superfund, the Marine Sanctuaries Act, and other key \nenvironmental statutes.\n  Our legislation also addresses the increasing need for additional \ntraining of law enforcement personnel. In response to the urgent \nrequests of State, local, and tribal authorities, the Environmental \nCrimes and Enforcement Act would establish, under the Environmental \nProtection Agency, a separate program for environmental crimes \ninvestigations.\n  In addition, the act limits the effect of the affirmative acts of \nconcealment that violators commit to prevent prosecution during the \ncurrent statute of limitations for environmental crimes, which is 5 \nyears. This bill extends the limitations period for up to 3 years \nbeyond the traditional 5 years for cases in which the defendant \ndeliberately conceals the original infraction.\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\n  This bill also adds environmental crimes to the list of statutes that \nprovide for restitution to victims, such as violent and economic crime. \nThe act recognizes that longstanding and widespread damage, in addition \nto the physical injuries and financial losses, may be caused by an \nenvironmental crime. The restitution provision includes the costs of \nremoval and remediation of pollution and the necessary restoration of \nthe environment.\n  Finally, the Environmental Crimes and Enforcement Act would authorize \nprosecutors to seize the assets of environmental criminals before \nconviction so that the defendant retains sufficient assets to make \nreparations. This measure ensures that environmental criminals cannot \nhide behind bankruptcy, or hide their assets so that the Government \nbears the burden of the cost of repairs.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying that although this \nlegislation is long overdue, the effects of it will be far-reaching. \nThis issue is not only about the environment, it is about fiscal \nresponsibility and taking responsibility for one's actions. This bill \ndoes not propose newer, stricter regulations, it does not call for any \nburdensome Federal mandates; it merely closes loopholes through which \npolluters have slipped for many years. Furthermore, it reduces the \nburden placed of Government to pay for environmental clean-ups and \nplaces it firmly on the shoulders of the criminals, where it belongs. \nOnce again, I complement the leadership of the Senator from New Jersey. \nIt was a pleasure working together to develop this legislation, and I \nlook forward to working with him to pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11033-4", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1243\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1243, a bill to provide \neducational assistance to the dependents of Federal law enforcement \nofficials who are killed or disabled in the performance of their \nduties.\n\n\n                                S. 1385\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1385, a bill \nto amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage \nof periodic colorectal screening services under Part B of the Medicare \nprogram.\n\n\n                                S. 1628\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the names of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Gregg] and the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 1628, a bill to amend title 17, United \nStates Code, relating to the copyright interests of certain musical \nperformances, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Alaska [Mr. \nMurkowski] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2047, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the application of the pension \nnondiscrimination rules to governmental plans.\n\n\n                                S. 2064\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Kansas \n[Mrs. Frahm] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2064, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to extend the program of research on breast \ncancer.\n\n\n                                S. 2089\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Simpson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 2089, a bill to transfer \nland administered by the Bureau of Land Management to the States in \nwhich the land is located.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 274\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Bingaman] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution \n274, a resolution to express the sense of the Senate regarding the \noutstanding achievements of NetDay96.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 292\n\n  At the request of Mr. Graham, the names of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan], the Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston], the \nSenator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], and the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd] were added as cosponsors of Senate Resolution 292, \na resolution designating the second Sunday in October 1996 as \n``National Children's Day,'' and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5383\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Hutchison, the name of the Senator from \nAlabama [Mr. Shelby] was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 5383 \nproposed to S. 39, a bill to amend the Magnuson Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to authorize appropriations, to provide for \nsustainable fisheries, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11041-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   THE MARITIME SECURITY ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 5391\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 1350) a bill to \namend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 to revitalize the United States-\nflag merchant marine, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

BRUCE DEMARS\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor \nAdm. Bruce DeMars, U.S. Navy, as he prepares to retire upon completion \nof over 40 years of faithful service to our Nation.\n  During his distinguished career, he played a pivotal role in ensuring \nthe effective and efficient employment of nuclear powered warships in \nproviding for the security of this Nation. Over the past 8 years, \nAdmiral DeMars provided invaluable leadership to the Naval Nuclear \nPropulsion Program, enabling Navy aircraft carriers, submarines, and \ncruisers to protect a strong, forward-deployed strategic defense force.\n  Among his many successes in the Navy, Admiral DeMars served as the \ncommanding officer of the USS Cavalla (SSN 684), commander, U.S. Naval \nForces Marianas-U.S. Naval Base Guam, and the deputy chief of Naval \nOperations for Submarine Warfare. Ultimately, he was appointed \nDirector, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, where he was instrumental in \naddressing the worldwide Soviet threat. With the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union, Admiral DeMars answered the challenge to maintain the \ntechnical excellence and uncompromising safety of the Naval Nuclear \nPropulsion Program, while adhering to the new fiscal realities of the \npost-cold-war era.\n  Admiral DeMars' leadership was crucial to the continued exceptional \nperformance, safety, and environmental record of the Navy's nuclear-\npowered ships. Under his oversight, the Nation's nuclear-powered \nwarships steamed over 40 million miles reliably and safely. Moreover, \nmore than 20,000 sailors and officers were trained as nuclear plant \noperators. The success of the program was recognized by the President \nin April 1994, as he wrote, ``* * * The Naval Nuclear Propulsion \nProgram, with its high standards and efficiency, exemplifies the level \nof excellence we are working toward throughout our government.'' I \nheartily agree with the President's assessment, and encourage all to \nfollow the example set by the admiral.\n  Admiral DeMars modernized our nuclear-powered fleet. Thirty-five new \nnuclear-powered warships were completed on his watch, as well as the \noverhaul, refueling, or decommissioning of 98 ships. I commend him for \nmeeting two diverse goals: achieving long-cost savings, while \nsustaining the industrial base in this highly specialized area.\n  Looking toward the future, the admiral steadfastly oversaw the \ndevelopment of the Seawolf attack submarine class. The recent, highly \nsuccessful sea trials of the lead ship substantiate the high \nexpectations for that class. The revolutionary developments embodied in \nthe Seawolf will keep our Nation in the forefront of this critical \narea, and ongoing developments promise to further reduce the cost of \nthe next generation of highly capable nuclear attack submarines.\n  Unfortunately, men of Admiral DeMars' caliber are few and far \nbetween.\n  Mr. President, I commend Admiral DeMars for a career of faithful \nservice to his Nation. I wish him ``Fair Winds and Following Seas'' as \nhe completes his honorable and distinguished service in the U.S. \nNavy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11042-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY'S NATIONAL SECURITY STUDIES PROGRAM AS \n                   IT CELEBRATES ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, this year marks the 20th anniversary \nof the National Security Studies Program at Georgetown University. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate Dr. Stephen Gibert, \nthe founder and current director of the National Security Studies \nProgram, for his vision in establishing and running this highly \nsuccessful program. In addition, I want to add my best wishes to the \nfaculty, the administration, the program's graduates, and the current \nstudents as they celebrate this important milestone in the program's \nhistory.\n  The National Security Studies Program was started to provide military \nofficers and civilian officials concerned with defense issues a high-\nquality graduate education with a concentration in national security \nstudies. It represented an innovative and needed approach at that time. \nIn the ensuing 20 years, the National Security Studies Program has kept \npace with the changes that have occurred in the international security \nenvironment. As we move further along in the post-cold war era and \nencounter new types of threats to our Nation's security, it is \nencouraging to see that this program is sponsoring lectures on such \ntimely issues as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \ninformation warfare, terrorism, and computer security. The focus on new \nsecurity threats complements a strong selection of courses offered by \nthe National Security Studies Program in the categories of area \nstudies, economics, and national security, as well as functional \nissues.\n  I have kept up with this program since its inception as a number of \nmy staff have been students. In fact, my Armed Services Committee staff \ndirector, Arnold Punaro, is not only a graduate of the program but is \nalso a member of its adjunct faculty. I want to extend my best wishes \nfor continued success to the National Security Studies Program at \nGeorgetown University as it prepares a future generation of America's \nnational security leaders to meet the challenges of the 21st \ncentury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11043-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO WBEJ RADIO ON THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute WBEJ Radio \nfor 50 great years of broadcasting excellence in Elizabethton and upper \neast Tennessee. This radio station has stood the test of time and has \nserved its community as a source of entertainment, election coverage, \nlocal news, and national events. Over the years, WBEJ has undergone \nmany technological and managerial changes and has become a pioneer in \nradio broadcasting by combining innovative technology with a genuine \ndesire to provide reliable service to a growing community.\n  WBEJ made its debut in 1946 with the ``Swap and Shop'' show, which \nwas sponsored by a local furniture store and acted as a radio-operated \nclassified ad for the Elizabethton community. That show is still \npopular today and continues to bring citizens together to buy and trade \nitems. Along with ``Swap and Shop,'' news broadcasts and local \nentertainment combined to form the early roots of success for the radio \nstation. In the early days, local news was broadcast three times a day. \nToday, the news is broadcast more often and provides a wide range of \ncoverage from across the State and the Nation. Outdoor enthusiasts have \nrelied on WBEJ to provide accurate reports on the hunting and fishing \nconditions in the Elizabethton area, and families have sat glued to the \nradio waiting for details and information on events like Elvis' death, \nthe blizzard of 1993 and the Challenger crash of 1986.\n  Mr. President, budding local musicians found a welcome studio and a \nreceptive audience when they performed live on WBEJ decades ago. And \nlisteners were entertained by the station's many radio personalities, \nsuch as ``Curley'' the postman and his sidekick ``Sgt. Jack.''\n  Bill Wilkins was a sportscaster for WBEJ and his catchy phrases and \nnicknames for local players became slogans for community athletic \nevents. Phrases like ``get your tranquilizers ready,'' and ``the little \nblond bomber'' became popular terms for teams and athletes alike, and \nWBEJ sportcasters became regulars at the local high school athletic \nevents with their play-by-play coverage. Over the years, the joy, \nsorrow, humor, and insight from all of these programs have been woven \ninto the community's heart.\n  Mr. President, since 1946, WBEJ has been a part of every major event \nthat has occurred in Tennessee and in the Nation. WBEJ has covered it \nall in a span of 50 years and has only gotten better with time. As such \nan important member of the Elizabethton community, WBEJ can celebrate \nits golden anniversary among many good and loyal friends. As \nElizabethton continues to grow, I am certain that WBEJ will grow with \nit. It will maintain its high standards and strong foundation as it \ncrosses the threshold into the 21st century. Dedication, philanthropy, \nforesight, and innovation have kept this Elizabethton station golden \nfor 50 years and those same traits will carry it successfully into the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11043-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\n\n\n     REPEAL OF SECTION 434 OF THE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK \n                 OPPORTUNITY RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on September 16, I introduced \nlegislation to repeal section 434 of the recently enacted Personal \nResponsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. Section \n434 provides that:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal, State, or \n     local law, no State or local government entity may be \n     prohibited, or in any way restricted, from sending to or \n     receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     (INS) information regarding the immigration status, lawful or \n     unlawful, of an alien in the United States.\n\n  This provision conflicts with an executive order, issued by the mayor \nof New York in 1985, prohibiting city employees from reporting \nsuspected illegal aliens to the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nunless the alien has been charged with a crime. The executive order, \nwhich according to a report in the September 12, 1996, New York Times \nis similar to local laws in other States and cities, was intended to \nensure that fear of deportation does not deter illegal aliens from \nseeking emergency medical attention, reporting crimes, and so forth.\n  On September 8, 1995, during Senate consideration of H.R. 4, the Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995, Senators Santorum and Nickles offered this \nprovision as an amendment. The amendment was adopted by a vote of 91 to \n6. The Senators who voted ``no'' were: Akaka, Campbell, Inouye, \nMoseley-Braun, Moynihan, and Simon.\n  Four of these six--Senators Akaka, Moseley-Braun, Simon, and the \nSenator from New York--were also among the 11 Democrats who voted \nagainst H.R. 4 when it passed the Senate 11 days later on September 19, \n1995. The provision remained in H.R. 3734, the welfare bill recently \nsigned by President Clinton.\n  Last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York announced that the \ncity planned to challenge section 434 of the new welfare law in \ncourt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11044-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FISCAL YEAR 1997 TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS--HIGHWAY OBLIGATION \n                               AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Senate completed action on the \nconference report for the Department of Transportation and related \nagencies appropriations bill yesterday, voting out the legislation 85 \nto 14. That bill, H.R. 3675, contained funding for the various \ntransportation programs that this Nation undertakes--aviation, Coast \nGuard, highways, railroads, and transit. All in all, H.R. 3675 is a \ngood bill for the United States and for the State of New York. However, \nMr. President, as occurs in most pieces of legislation, it is not \nentirely perfect. In this respect, I must raise issue with a provision \nthat was contained in the final version of this bill that will have \nserious adverse consequences on the State of New York.\n  When we considered this bill on the Senate floor in July, an \namendment was debated and ultimately adopted that would require the \nSecretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Treasury to \ninvestigate and report back to the Congress on the impact of and need \nto remedy an accounting error that was made in 1994 with respect to the \ncrediting of receipts to the Highway Trust Fund. If uncorrected, this \nerror had the potential to change the Federal highway obligation \nauthority in a manner that would reconfigure highway funding for a \nnumber of States, allocating more dollars to States where the dollars \nwere not supposed to go and away from States where the dollars were \nsupposed to be allocated. The amendment that passed in the Senate \ncorrected this error.\n  During the conference with the House of Representatives, this \nprovision was not supported by a majority of conferees and was \nsubsequently dropped. Even efforts to hold States harmless for the \ncoming fiscal year because of this error were not agreed upon. Because \nof this, we are back where we started before the adoption of the \namendment, with this accounting glitch in place and certain States in \nour Nation facing the denial of funding they deserve.\n  Unfortunately, New York is one of those States that will be denied \nits rightful amount of highway funding. The calculations that I have \nseen indicate that this uncorrected error will cost New York more than \n$100 million in Federal highway dollars that it should rightfully \nreceive. This is not a small amount of money by any stretch. It is \nroughly 11 percent of the total highway funding New York should receive \nin the coming fiscal year. However, because of this accounting error, \nand because efforts to correct this error were not agreed upon in \nconference, those who travel New York's roadways will bear the brunt of \nthis 11-percent cut.\n  It would be an understatement to say that I am displeased that this \nsimple error was not able to be corrected in order to prevent any \nadverse impact on highway users in New York. However, the members of \nthe conference committee were not inclined to accept the Senate \namendment. While I do not agree with the decision by the conferees it \nis by no means an issue that has been solved.\n  In 1997, the Congress will be facing a multitude of issues involving \nthe reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct [ISTEA]. Issues involving funding allocations for the individual \nStates will most assuredly be heavily discussed in the course of \nnegotiations over any reauthorization bill. Perhaps this particular \nissue may need to be revisited in the context of that reauthorization. \nIn the meantime, it still demands the attention and the action of the \nadministration. Therefore, I intend to work with my colleagues whose \nStates are similarly impacted as New York in an effort to remedy this \nTreasury Department accounting error.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11044-2", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11044-S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NIH REVITALIZATION ACT OF 1996\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM.

Bill purpose: S. 1897 would extend expiring provisions, \n     eliminate duplicated or unnecessary advisory boards and \n     reports, codify certain existing programs, and create new \n     programs within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary funds, CBO estimates that the \n     federal government would spend $31.6 billion over the fiscal \n     years 1997-2002 period to implement the provisions of S. \n     1897.\n       Table 1 summaries the estimated authorizations and outlays \n     that would result from S. 1897. The table provides the total \n     authorizations and outlays under two different sets of \n     assumptions. The first set of assumptions adjusts the \n     estimated amounts for projected inflation after 1996, while \n     the second set makes no allowance for projected inflation.\n       The bill could not affect direct spending by establishing \n     the National Fund for Health Research. But S. 1897 does not \n     specify a revenue source for this new trust fund, and no \n     direct spending could occur until it receives funding.\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\n\n\n                                                     TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 1897                                                    \n                                                        [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]                                                        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1996            1997            1998            1999            2000            2001            2002     \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATIONS ACTION                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                        \nSpending under current law:                                                                                                                             \n    Budget authority....................           8,042              36              37  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Estimated outlays...................           7,673           4,518             756              34              10  ..............  ..............\n                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                              WITH ADJUSTMENT FOR INFLATION                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                        \nProposed changes:                                                                                                                                       \n    Authorization level.................  ..............          10,222          10,518          10,858  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Estimated outlays...................  ..............           4,431           9,394          10,607           6,103           1,016              33\nSpending under S. 1897                                                                                                                                  \n    Authorization level.................           8,042          10,258          10,556          10,858  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Estimated outlays...................           7,673           8,950          10,150          10,641           6,113           1,016              33\n                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                            WITHOUT ADJUSTMENT FOR INFLATION                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                        \nProposed changes:                                                                                                                                       \n    Authorization level.................  ..............          10,132          10,132          10,169  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Estimated outlays...................  ..............           4,390           9,183          10,118           5,745             953              31\nSpending under S. 1897:                                                                                                                                 \n    Authorization level.................           8,042          10,168          10,169          10,169  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Estimated outlays...................           7,673           8,909           9,939          10,152           5,755             953              31\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The cost of this bill fall within function 550.\n       6. Basis of the estimate: Most of the authorizations in the \n     bill are for ``such sums as may be necessary.'' For these, \n     the estimated costs for 1997-1999 are based on 1996 \n     appropriations (with and without adjustments for inflation). \n     The authorization for general activities of the National \n     Cancer Institute and the authorizations for the National \n     Institute on Aging, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \n     and Alcoholism, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the \n     National Institute of Mental Health, the National Library of \n     Medicine, and Parkinson's reearch are for specified amounts \n     for 1997 and such sums as may be necessary for 1998 and 1999. \n     For these programs, the estimated costs in 1998 and 1999 are \n     based on the 1997 authorization, with and without adjustments \n     for inflation.\n       1The authorized amount for the pediatric research \n     initiative is 450 million over the whole 1997-1999 period. \n     Finally, S. 1897 would authorize for diabetes research each \n     year from 1997 through 1999 the amount appropriated for this \n     purpose in 1996 increased by 25 percent.\n       The estimate reflects these specific authorizations.

In addition, the bill would provide the    \n  authorization estimated above.                                        \n\\2\\ The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the\n  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences also participate  \n  in the DES program. However, approximately 80 percent of the program's\n  spending is attributable to the National Cancer Institute.            \n\\3\\ The amounts shown include both the costs that would result from the \n  expansion of the loan programs in Title IV as well as their           \n  authorization under Title VI. In addition, the bill currently         \n  authorizes the loan program regarding clinical researchers            \n  indefinitely. However, it is CBO's understanding that the committee   \n  intended to provide authorization only through 1999.                  \n\\4\\ Costs of less than $500,000.                                        \n\n                            Titles I and II\n\n       Director's Discretionary Fund. S. 1897 would authorize \n     appropriations, of such sums as may be necessary over the \n     1997-1999 period for the Director's discretionary fund within \n     the Office of the Director of NIH. The fund enables the \n     Director to respond to emerging research opportunities and \n     health priorities. In addition, the Director uses the funds \n     to support several awards and seminars. Funding for these \n     activities in 1996 was $11 million.\n       Children Vaccine Initiative. The bill would also \n     reauthorize the Children's Vaccine Initiative, extending \n     funding through 1999. The National Institute on Allergy and \n     Infectious Disease (NIAID), the National Institute on Child \n     Health and Human Development, and the National Institute on \n     Aging are also included in this initiative, but currently \n     NIAID is the only institute participating. If funding at the \n     1996 level adjusted for inflation, CBO estimates this program \n     would cost $57 million over the three-year period.\n       Osteoporosis, Paget's Disease and Related Bone Disorders. \n     The bill would also reauthorize through 1999 the coordinated \n     research program on osteoporosis, Paget's disease, and \n     related bone disorders. This program is coordinated by the \n     Directors of the National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute on \n     Aging, the National Institute of Dental Research, and the \n     National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \n     Diseases, and includes participation by several of the other \n     institutes and centers. If funded at the 1996 level adjusted \n     for inflation, this program would cost $372 million over the \n     three-year period.\n       National Human Genome Research Institute. S. 1897 would \n     create the National Human Genome Research Institute and \n     transfer to it all functions, employees, assets, liabilities, \n     contracts, and records that the National Center for Human \n     Genome Research (NCHGR) performed and held before the \n     enactment of this legislation. Giving the NCHGR the status of \n     an institute would allow it to make awards of $100,000 or \n     less without Advisory Council approval, to establish less \n     extensive and time-consuming clearance requirements in the \n     publication process: to complete for funds solely designated \n     for research performed by institutes; and other freedoms. The \n     bill would authorize this institute from 1997 through 1999. \n     Based on the 1996 appropriation for the NCHGR adjusted for \n     inflation, CBO estimates this authorization would cost $450 \n     million over the three-year period.\n\n                               Title III\n\n       Reauthorizations. This title would reauthorize all of the \n     institutes and centers of NIH through 1999. The estimated \n     authorizations with adjustments for inflation are shown in \n     Table 2. They total $23.3 billion over the 1997-1999 period.\n       DES Program. S. 1897 would reauthorize from 1997 through \n     1999 the DES program, which conducts and supports research \n     and training, the dissemination of health information, and \n     other programs with respect to the diagnosis and treatment of \n     conditions associated with exposure to the drug \n     diethylstilbestrol (DES). Participating institutes include \n     the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of \n     Child Health and Human Development, and the National \n     Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. In 1996, 80 \n     percent of the spending occurred in the National Cancer \n     Institute. CBO estimates this provision would cost $26 \n     million over the three-year period, assuming appropriations \n     at the 1996 level adjusted for inflation.\n       General Clinical Research Centers. The bill would codify \n     the existing General Clinical Research Centers and authorize \n     them from 1997 through 1999. The Director of the National \n     Center for Research Resources (NCRR) awards grants for these \n     centers, which provide the infrastructure for clinical \n     research. The centers support clinical studies and career \n     development in all settings of the hospital or academic \n     medical center involved. Funding for this program in 1996 was \n     $146 million.\n       Enhancement Awards. The bill would also require the \n     Director of NCRR to create two grant programs called the \n     Clinical Research Career Enhancement Award and the Innovative \n     Medical Science Award. The Clinical Research Enhancement \n     Awards would support\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\n     individual careers in clinical research, with grants not to \n     exceed $130,000 per year per grant. The Innovative Medical \n     Science Awards would support individual clinical research \n     projects, with grants not to exceed $100,000 per year per \n     grant. The Director of NIH, together with the Director of the \n     NCRR, would establish a peer review mechanism to evaluate \n     applications for clinical research fellowships, Clinical \n     Research Enhancement Awards, and Innovative Medical Science \n     Awards. The bill would authorize these programs from 1997 \n     through 1999. Based on information provided by the NCRR, CBO \n     estimates these grants would cost $3 million over the three-\n     year period.\n\n                          Titles IV, V, and VI\n\n       Loan Repayment Programs. S. 1897 would raise the maximum \n     amount given to NIH to repay the educational loans of \n     qualified health professionals who agree to conduct AIDS \n     research, contraception and infertility research, and \n     research generally as employees of NIH. The maximum loan \n     repayment amount for clinical researchers would also be \n     raised. The maximum loan repayment for each year of service \n     would be increased from $20,000 to $35,000. Based on the \n     number of researchers that would be affected by the loan \n     repayment increase, CBO estimates increasing the maximum loan \n     amount would cost $1 million over the three-year period. In \n     addition, the bill would reauthorize from 1997-1999 the loan \n     repayment program fro research with respect to AIDS. \n     If funded at the 1996 level, CBO estimates the \n     authorization would cost $2 million over the three-year \n     period.\n       The bill would also establish a general loan repayment \n     program. Like the other loan repayment programs, the \n     Secretary of HHS would act through the Director of NIH and \n     enter into agreements with qualified health professionals to \n     conduct research identified by the Director. The Federal \n     government would repay not more than $35,000 of the principal \n     and interest of the educational loans of such professionals \n     for each year of service. The loan repayment agreement would \n     be for a minimum of two years. The bill authorizes funding \n     for this program from 1997 through 1999. The Office of the \n     Director projects that it would spend approximately $1.5 \n     million per year as a result of this program. Based on this \n     information, CBO estimates this new loan repayment program \n     would cost $5 million over the three-year period.\n       S. 1897 would increase the cumulative number of contracts \n     permitted for scholarships and loan repayments for the \n     undergraduate scholarship program of the National Research \n     Institutes and the loan repayment program for clinical \n     researchers. Under current law, 50 such contracts are \n     authorized from 1994 through 1996; the bill would increase \n     the cumulative limit to 100 for the 1994 through 1999 period. \n     It would also reauthorize these programs from 1997 through \n     1999. Based on past spending by these programs, CBO estimates \n     that adding 50 contracts would cost $3 million over the 1997-\n     1999 period.\n       AIDS Research. S. 1897 would reauthorize comprehensive AIDS \n     research by the institutes and the AIDS emergency \n     discretionary fund from 1997 through 1999. The emergency \n     discretionary fund is used by the Director of the Office of \n     AIDS Research to fund additional AIDS research the Director \n     determines is needed. Assuming that appropriations are \n     provided at the 1996 level adjusted for inflation, CBO \n     estimates this provision would cost a total of $4,530 million \n     over the three-year period.\n       National Research Service Awards. The bill would \n     reauthorize the National Research Service Awards from 1997 \n     through 1999. These awards are given for biomedical and \n     behavioral research and training at NIH, at public and \n     nonprofit entities, and for pre-doctoral and post-doctoral \n     training of individuals to undertake biomedical and \n     behavioral research. The Office of the Director estimates \n     that NIH will spend $395 million on these awards in 1996. \n     Assuming this level of spending adjusted for inflation, CBO \n     estimates this provision would cost $1,265 million over the \n     three-year period.\n       National Foundation for Biomedical Research. The bill would \n     reauthorize the National Foundation of Biomedical Research, a \n     nonprofit corporation, from 1997 through 1999. It was \n     established by the Secretary of HHS to support NIH and \n     advance collaboration with biomedical researchers from \n     universities, industry, and nonprofit organizations. The \n     foundation is currently in the initial stages of operation. \n     NIH is requesting $200,000 for 1997 for this foundation and \n     expects to need a similar level of funding for each of the \n     fiscal years 1998 and 1999. Based on this information, CBO \n     estimates the cost of this proposal would be less than $1 \n     million over the three-year period.\n       National Fund for Health Research. The bill would establish \n     the National Fund for Health Research. This fund would \n     consist of amounts transferred to it and interest earned on \n     it. The amount in the fund would be distributed each year to \n     all of the research institutes and centers of NIH, \n     provided that appropriations in that year are not less \n     than those of the prior year. This provision would set up \n     this account in the Treasury, but would not establish a \n     source of funding for it. When and if a source of income \n     is established for this trust fund, NIH would apparently \n     have the authority to spend amounts in the fund, including \n     interest earnings, without appropriations action. This \n     would be direct spending, but CBO has no basis for \n     estimating the amount of such spending until the source of \n     revenues for the fund is established.\n       Pediatric Research Initiative. S. 1897 would require the \n     Secretary to establish, within the Office of the Director of \n     NIH, a Pediatric Research Initiative that would be headed by \n     the Director. The initiative would encourage increased \n     support for pediatric biomedical research within the NIH, \n     enhance collaborative multi-disciplinary research among the \n     institutes, increase pediatric research demonstrating how to \n     improve the quality of children's health care while reducing \n     cost, and develop clinical trials and information to promote \n     the safe and effective use of prescription drugs in the \n     pediatric population. The Director would have discretion in \n     the allocation of assistance among the institutes, among the \n     types of grants, and between basic and clinical research. The \n     bill would authorize $50 million for the 1997-1999 period.\n       Diabetes Research. The bill would reauthorize and expand \n     funding for the conduct and support of research related to \n     diabetes by the NIH. The majority of this spending occurs \n     within the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive \n     Kidney Diseases. S. 1897 would provide for each year from \n     1997 through 1999 the amount appropriated for this purpose in \n     1996 increased by 25 percent. In 1996, NIH spent $309 million \n     on research related to diabetes. if appropriations are made \n     for the full authorized amount, this research would cost \n     $1,160 million over the three-year period.\n       Program for Parkinson's Disease. The bill would also \n     require the Director of NIH to establish a program for the \n     conduct and support of research and training concerning \n     Parkinson's disease. The Director would coordinate research \n     among all of the national research institutes conducting \n     Parkinson's research and would convene a research planning \n     conference at least every two years.\n       The Director would also be required to establish two grant \n     programs pertaining to Parkinson's disease. The first would \n     award up to 10 Core Center Grants to encourage the \n     development of innovative multi-disciplinary research and \n     provide training concerning Parkinson's disease. Support for \n     a center would not be provided for a period longer than five \n     years, but support could be extended after a review. The \n     second grant program would support innovative proposals \n     leading to significant breakthroughs in Parkinson's research.\n       S. 1897 would authorize $80 million for 1997 and such sums \n     as necessary for 1998 and 1999 for the Parkinson's disease \n     program. CBO estimates the cost of this provision to be $248 \n     million over the three-year period, assuming adjustments for \n     inflation.\n       7. Pay-as-you-go considerations: S. 1897 could affect \n     direct spending by establishing the National Fund for Health \n     Research. The bill does not establish a source of funding for \n     it, but when and if a source of income is established, NIH \n     would have the authority to spend amounts in the fund. Such \n     spending would include any interest earned by the fund and \n     would occur without appropriations action. This would be \n     direct spending, but CBO has no basis for estimating the \n     amount of such spending until the source of revenues for the \n     fund is established.\n       8. Estimated cost to State and local governments: This bill \n     contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the \n     Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Public Law 104-4) and \n     would impose no cost on state, local, or tribal governments. \n     Some of the funds made available by this bill for research \n     activities would go to state and local governments, \n     particularly public universities.\n       9. Estimated cost to the private sector: The bill would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in Public \n     Law 104-4.\n       10. Estimate comparison: None.\n       11. Previous estimate: None.\n       12. Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost Estimate: Cyndi \n     Dudzinski (226-9010); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal \n     Governments: John Patterson (225-3220); Impact on the Private \n     Sector: Linda Bilheimer (225-2673).\n       13. Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, for Paul N. \n     Van de Water, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11044-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11046-S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO GEORGE SHAFFER ON COMPLETION OF HIS TERM AS PRESIDENT OF THE \n                INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfellow New Mexican and personal friend, George Shaffer of Albuquerque, \nwho is nearing completion of his 1-year term as president of the \nIndependent Insurance Agents of America [IIAA]. The closure of Mr. \nShaffer's term as the elected leader of the Nation's largest insurance \ntrade association will be the crowning accomplishment of a career \nfilled with many years of distinguished service to IIAA, and to its \n300,000 members across the country.\n  George has enjoyed an outstanding career as an independent insurance \nagent. After holding several elective offices in the New Mexico State \nassociation of IIAA, George became New Mexico's representative to \nIIAA's national board of State directors in 1982,\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nand continued to serve in that position until 1990.\n  George served on IIAA's government affairs committee for 6 years, \nincluding 3 years as chairman. In 1990, IIAA presented him with its \nprestigious Sidney O. Smith Award, presented to an individual for \nexcellence in government affairs activities. George was elected to \nIIAA's executive committee in Chicago in 1990, and was selected by his \npeers to become IIAA's 90th president last September in Las Vegas.\n  George's commitment to public service extends to his involvement in \nState and local community activities. He has served as a New Mexico \nState senator and as chairman of New Mexico's Better Business Bureau. \nIn addition, George served a 4-year term as the lay member of the New \nMexico Real Estate Commission, and for the past 16 years has served as \na trustee of the Albuquerque Academy, a 6th-12th grade privately \nendowed school.\n  I congratulate my fellow New Mexican, public-spirited citizen, and \nfriend for a job extremely well done. I am confident that George's \nadmirable service to IIAA, his colleagues, and his fellow citizens of \nAlbuquerque will continue well into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n2512, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust Fund \nAct of 1996. This bill provides for the long-delayed fulfillment of \npromises made by Congress to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe of South \nDakota. These promises were for compensation for the impacts on the \nTribe that resulted from the inundation of more than 15,000 acres of \nthe best land on the Crow Creek reservation, including the relocation \nof Fort Thompson, the principal community on the reservation. The \ninundation was caused by the construction of Fort Randall and Big Bend \ndams on the Missouri River pursuant to the Flood Control Act of 1944, \notherwise known as the Missouri River Basin Pick-Sloan Project.\n  H.R. 2512 provides for creation of a trust fund in the United States \nTreasury for the benefit of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe that would be \nfunded with $27,500,000 from receipts of deposits from the Pick-Sloan \npower program of the Western Area Power Administration. Only the \ninterest on the fund would be made available to the Tribe, without \nfiscal year limitations, to spend on implementing a plan for \nsocioeconomic recovery and cultural preservation. This plan will \ninclude a variety of infrastruture and related projects that Congress \nin 1962 directed the Interior Department and the United States Corps of \nEngineers to provide to the Tribe, but which were either inadequately \nprovided or not provided at all. Among these projects is a high school, \na water system, and a community center with a gymnasium and auditorium.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs and the House Resources Committee \nconducted a joint hearing on H.R. 2512 and on a Senate companion bill, \nS. 1264. The record of that hearing includes extensive historical \ninformation on the Big Bend and Fort Randall dam projects, the \ncommitments made by the United States to the Crow Creek Tribe for \ncompensation with respect to these projects, and the extent to which \nthose commitments were not fulfilled. The record is clear that the \nadditional compensation that would be provided by H.R. 2512 is not only \nwell-justified but also long overdue.\n  It should be noted that the Crow Creek trust fund that would be \nprovided by this legislation is proportionate to trust funds \nestablished by Congress in 1992 for the Standing Rock Sioux and Fort \nBerthold Tribes. The 1992 Standing Rock and Fort Berthold legislation \nwas enacted based on the findings and recommendations of a \ncongressionally mandated joint tribal-Federal task force. This task \nforce studied the impacts of the construction of Oahe and Garrison dams \non the Standing Rock and Fort Berthold Reservations, including the \ninundation of a combined total of more than 200,000 acres of the best \nlands on those reservations.\n  Mr. President, the construction of huge, multipurpose dam projects by \nthe Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation earlier in this \ncentury brought major economic and other benefits to large numbers of \npeople and interests in various parts of the United States. However, \nthese benefits often came at a very high price to others. In the case \nof the dam projects authorized under the Pick-Sloan Project, the \ngreatest price was paid by Indian tribes whose reservations lie along \nthe Missouri River in North and South Dakota. These tribes saw much of \ntheir best farm land flooded, long-established communities relocated, \nfamilies disrupted, and a way of life changed forever. The human price \nthey paid is beyond calculation.\n  Regrettably, the conduct of the agencies of the United States \ngovernment, including the Congress, with respect to the Indian tribes \naffected by Pick-Sloan Project construction often did not live up to \nthe fair and honorable dealings standard that the tribes had a right \nand reason to expect from the United States as their trustee. In light \nof the well-documented history of this conduct with respect to the Crow \nCreek Sioux Tribe, I believe that enacting H.R. 2512 is a fair and \nhonorable course for this Congress to take.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is supported by the State of South \nDakota, its congressional delegation, and the Administration, in \naddition to the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe. The House recently passed H.R. \n2512 by voice vote, and the Committee on Indian Affairs has favorably \nreported companion legislation to the Senate. Accordingly, I strongly \nurge the Senate to pass H.R.\n\n[[Page S11050]]\n\n2512 and send it to the President for signature.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Trust \nFund Act of 1995. This measure, which is sponsored by Congressman Tim \nJohnson, is very important to South Dakota and the Crow Creek Tribe. I \ncommend the Senate Indian Affairs Committee for its leadership in \npromoting the bill's companion measure, S. 1264, which I introduced. I \nalso want to publicly thank the members of the Crow Creek Tribe for \ntheir many years of hard work. The tribe has worked closely with \nCongressman Johnson and I to shape this legislation that will help \nrealize, at long last, the goals outlined in the Big Bend Act over 30 \nyears ago.\n  This bill will provide for the development of certain tribal \ninfrastructure projects funded by a trust fund set up for the Crow \nCreek Tribe within the Department of the Treasury. The trust fund would \nbe capitalized within 1 to 2 years from a percentage of hydropower \nrevenues and would be capped at $27.5 million. The tribe would then \nreceive the interest from the fund and use it for economic development \npurposes according to a plan prepared in conjunction with the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.\n  It is instructive to review the long historic journey that has \nbrought us to this point. The Flood Control Act of 1944 created five \nmassive earthen dams on the Missouri River. This public works project, \nknown as the Pick-Sloan Plan, provides the region with flood control, \nirrigation and hydropower. Four of the Pick-Sloan dams are located in \nSouth Dakota.\n  The impact of the Pick-Sloan plan on the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe has \nbeen devastating. The Big Bend and Fort Randall dams created losses to \nthe Crow Creek Tribe for which they have not been adequately \ncompensated. Over 15,000 acres of the tribe's most fertile and \nproductive land, the Missouri River wooded bottomlands, were inundated \nas a result of the Fort Randall and Big Bend components of the Pick-\nSloan project.\n  By and through the Big Bend Act of 1962, Congress directed the U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers and the Department of the Interior to take \ncertain actions to alleviate the problems caused by the dislocation of \ncommunities and inundation of tribal resources. These directives were \neither carried out inadequately or not carried out at all.\n  Congress established precedent for H.R. 2512 in 1992 with the passage \nof the Three Affiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Equitable \nCompensation Act, which I cosponsored. At that time, Congress \ndetermined that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had failed to provide \nadequate compensation to the tribes when their land was acquired for \nthe Pick-Sloan projects. There is little question that the tribes bore \nan inordinate share of the cost of implementing the Pick-Sloan program. \nThe Secretary of the Interior established the Joint Tribal Advisory \nCommittee to resolve the inequities and find ways to finance the \ncompensation of tribal claims. As a result, the Three Affiliated Tribes \nand Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Equitable Compensation Act set up a \nrecovery fund financed entirely from a percentage of Pick-Sloan power \nrevenues.\n  The Crow Creek Sioux Tribe Infrastructure Development Fund Act of \n1995 is the next step in honoring commitments made when the Pick-Sloan \ndams were constructed in a fiscally sound manner while giving local \nentites the latitude to determine their own development priorities. \nThis legislation not only benefits the tribe, but the entire State of \nSouth Dakota, since a sound infrastructure is essential to regional \neconomic development.\n  This legislation has broad support in South Dakota. Gov. Bill Janklow \nstrongly endorses this proposal to develop the infrastructure at the \nCrow Creek Indian reservation.\n  Mr. President, the impact of the Pick-Sloan projects have been \ndevastating to other Missouri River tribes as well. I look forward to \nworking with the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Sioux \nTribe to address their claims.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, and any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2512) was deemed read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11049-3", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11050-S11051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UTAH SCHOOLS AND LANDS IMPROVEMENT ACT AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 558, H.R. 2464.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2464) to amend Public Law 103-93 to provide \n     additional land within the State of Utah for the Indian \n     reservation and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n2464, a bill to amend Public Law 103-93 to add certain State and \nFederal lands to the Goshute Indian Reservation in Utah.\n  Public Law 103-93 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nabout 200,000 acres of Utah school trust land located within the \nboundaries of national parks, forests, and Indian reservations in Utah. \nIn exchange, the school trust will receive other Federal land and \nmineral rights of equal value.\n  H.R. 2464 amends the 1993 act to make an additional 7,000 acres of \nState land eligible for exchange for Federal lands or interests of \nequal value and their addition in trust to the Goshute Reservation. The \nbill also provides for about 1,280 acres of Federal land and mineral \ninterests to be added to the reservation.\n  The addition of these lands to the Goshute Reservation will provide a \nmore clearly defined and manageable reservation boundary. This will \ngreatly improve the tribe's ability to deal with poaching, trespassing, \nand other problems along the reservation boundary.\n  Enactment of the legislation will also further assist the State of \nUtah and the Federal Government in consolidating their respective \nlandholdings and thus contribute to more effective, environmentally \nresponsible land management.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing on H.R. 2464 in July \nof this year. Hearing testimony established that the bill is without \ncontroversy and clearly in the beneficial interest of the Goshute \nTribe, the State of Utah, and the United States. The Congressional \nBudget Office subsequently reported that enactment of the bill would \nhave no significant impact on the Federal budget, nor would it affect \ndirect spending or receipts.\n  I commend Utah's Senators Orrin Hatch and Robert Bennett for their \ncooperative efforts with the tribe, the State, and the administration \nthat led to development of H.R. 2464 and its Senate counterpart, S. \n1766.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 2464 is meritorious legislation, and I urge its \npassage by the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate has scheduled \nconsideration of H.R. 2464.\n  This legislation amends the Utah Schools and Lands Improvement Act of \n1993 (Public Law 103-93) which provides a vehicle by which school trust \nlands located within Federal reservations in Utah--such as national \nparks, national forests, wilderness, and Indian reservations--could be \nexchanged for lands located elsewhere in Utah.\n  The act helps to ensure that Utah's schools receive the full and \nintended benefit of the trust lands by resolving Federal and State land \nmanagement problems resulting from interspersed land ownership within \nUtah.\n  H.R. 2464 would amend the 1993 act to provide for the exchange of \napproximately 8,000 acres of additional State land, located within the \nGoshute Reservation boundaries, for Federal lands, or interests, of \nequal value.\n  The Goshute Tribe's reservation is located in a remote valley \nsouthwest of the Great Salt Lake and astride the border between Utah \nand Nevada with approximately half of the reservation within each \nState.\n  This bill will resolve a long standing problem associated with the \nsouthern\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nboundary of the tribe's reservation. When Congress initially considered \nPublic Law 103-93, the Goshute Tribe requested a resolution of the \nirregular configuration on the reservation's southern boundary. The \nirregular configuration and remote location of about 8,000 acres of \nland along that boundary make proper land management virtually \nimpossible. In fact, the State of Utah, the Bureau of Land Management \nand the tribe have been unable to prevent trespassing and poaching in \nthis area.\n  This measure will improve the tribe's ability to manage and preserve \nthat land.\n  H.R. 2464 was introduced in the House by my good friend Congressman \nJim Hansen of Utah, and has wide support from many diverse groups \nincluding the Bureau of Land Management, the State of Utah, the Goshute \nTribe, Juab County, and the Utah Wilderness Coalition.\n  This legislation is very important to the people of Utah--to our \nschool system--and to the tribal members of the Goshute Tribe.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support its passage.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to ask my friend, the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain], the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, \nif he would engage in a colloquy with me and the Senator from Idaho \n[Mr. Craig], the chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public \nLand Management, on the bill H.R. 2464?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be pleased to have a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Alaska and the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator. As he knows, H.R. 2464 amends the \nUtah Schools and Lands Improvement Act of 1993, an Act which, in the \n103rd Congress, was considered exclusively by the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  I was therefore surprised to learn that on May 15th of this year the \nParliamentarian referred H.R. 2464 to the Committee on Indian Affairs. \nI was further surprised to learn that on the very next day, May 16th, \nthe Parliamentarian referred an identical Senate bill, S. 1766, \nintroduced by our colleague, Senator Bennett, to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, which then referred it to Senator Craig's \nSubcommittee.\n  So I ask my friend, the Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, \nwhether he would agree with me and Senator Craig that it would have \nbeen appropriate for the Parliamentarian to refer H.R. 2464 to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I agree with the Senators from Alaska and Idaho that \nreferral of H.R. 2464 to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nwould have been appropriate. The rules of the Senate are clear that \nissues pertaining to the management of the public lands are within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  I note, however, that both the 1993 Act and H.R. 2464 include \nprovisions that deal with the issue of adding land in trust to Indian \nreservations in Utah. Would the Chairman of the Energy Committee agree \nwith me that, with respect to this issue, referral of the legislation \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs is appropriate?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree with the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. As he knows, the Committee on Indian \nAffairs held a hearing on H.R. 2464. The Committee found that the \nauthority the bill would provide for addressing reservation boundary-\nrelated problems is appropriate and necessary and very important to the \nGoshute Indian Tribe. The Committee supports this meritorious and \nnoncontroversial legislation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his statement.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am pleased to add that we have looked at the hearing \nrecord and the report of the Committee on Indian Affairs on H.R. 2464. \nThe Subcommittee has reviewed the bill, and I am confident that had we \nhad more time this session, we would have reported it favorably. We \nhave no problems with the bill as reported by the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  I see no reason for further consideration of the legislation by the \nSubcommittee on Forests and Public Lands or the Full Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with the Senator from Idaho, and I thank the \nSenator from Arizona for his Committee's expeditious work on this \nlegislation. I am pleased to join with him in urging that it be passed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \ndeemed read for a third time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, and any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3378, a \nbill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to extend the \nauthorization of the Indian health demonstration program for direct \nbilling of Medicare, Medicaid and other third party payors. I am \npleased to support the House-passed provisions of H.R. 3378 and to \noffer a substitute amendment that will make additional technical \ncorrections to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act and reauthorize \nadditional Indian health demonstration programs.\n  Mr. President, approximately 20 years ago, the Congress enacted the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act to meet the fundamental trust \nobligation of the United States to ensure that comprehensive health \ncare would be provided to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Despite \nadvances achieved through the implementation of the act, the health \nstatus of Indian people remains far below that of the national \npopulation.\n  The Indian Health Service, as the lead agency responsible for \nadministering programs under the act, has identified several areas \nwhere the act requires modification to fulfill its intended purpose. \nThe substitute amendment I have proposed incorporates those amendments \nto the act to allow maximum flexibility in the delivery of health \nservices to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  First, the substitute amendment clarifies certain provisions in order \nto allow greater flexibility to the IHS in administering IHS \nscholarships and programs. The amendment modifies the definition of \nHealth Profession in section 4(n) to include ``allopathic medicine'' in \norder to provide more flexibility to the IHS in awarding scholarship \nassistance to individuals enrolled in health degree professions. Prior \nto the 1992 amendments, individuals studying disciplines such as \nallopathic medicine were eligible to receive IHS assistance. Because \nthe 1992 amendments omitted this reference, many individuals were \ndenied eligibility for scholarship assistance. This amendment restores \ntheir eligibility for scholarship funds and fulfills the Act's intent.\n  Next, the amendment also clarifies certain provisions under section \n104(b), the Indian Health Professions Scholarship, to clarify the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices to waive or defer service or payment obligations of Indian \nhealth professionals under specified circumstances. Many requirements \nfor a degree in the health professions include an internship, \nresidency, or other advanced clinical program. The substitute amendment \nwould clarify the authority of the Secretary to defer a scholarship \nrecipient's service or repayment obligation until the recipient has \ncompleted his or her education program.\n  The Indian Health Care Improvement Act also authorizes several \ninnovative demonstration projects to increase and improve services to \nIndian communities and to serve as models to be replicated on other \nreservations. The substitute amendment includes the extension for the \nIndian Health Medicare/Medicaid Program, as provided for in H.R. 3378, \nand reauthorizes several additional programs through the year 2000. \nSeveral of these demonstration projects, including the California \nContract Health Services Demonstration Program, the Gallup Alcohol and \nSubstance Abuse Demonstration Program, the Substance Abuse \nCounselor Education Demonstration Program and the Home and Community \nBased Care Demonstration Program, are due to sunset in this fiscal \nyear.\n\n  The California Contract Health Services Demonstration Program \nauthorizes the California Rural Indian Health Board to act as a \ncontract care intermediary to improve the accessibility of health \nservices to California Indians. The program has successfully enabled \ntribal programs to provide in-patient services and prevent high-cost \ncases from devastating many small tribal health programs in California. \nIt is estimated that 41 percent of the California tribes participate in \nthis program.\n  The Home and Community Based Care Demonstration Program authorizes \nIndian tribes to enter into contracts to establish demonstration \nprojects for the delivery of home and community based services to \nfunctionally-disabled Indians. The Substance Abuse Counselor Education \nDemonstration Project authorizes the IHS to enter into contracts with, \nor make grants to, colleges, universities and tribally-controlled \ncommunity colleges to develop educational curricula for substance abuse \ncounseling.\n  The Gallup Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Program has funded \nresidential treatment for alcohol and substance abuse at the Navajo \nAdult Rehabilitation Demonstration Project. The grant program has also \nfunded a protective custody program for alcohol abuse offenders at the \nGallup Crisis Center. These programs are unique to the Navajo Nation \narea and provide valuable services as a community-based outpatient \nprogram.\n  Finally, the substitute amendment includes the House-passed language \nto\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\nextend the authorization for the Medicare/Medicaid Demonstration \nProgram. This program allows four tribal health contract operators to \ndirectly bill and collect Medicare/Medicaid payments rather than \noperate through the current system of channeling payments through the \nIHS. The four participating Indian tribes include Mississippi Band of \nChoctaw Indians, Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation of Alaska, Choctaw \nTribe of Oklahoma and South East Alaska Regional Health Consortium. The \nMedicare/Medicaid Demonstration Program has been a highly successful \nprogram for the participating tribes and the IHS, who have reported \nsignificantly increased collections for Medicare/Medicaid services and \ngreater efficiency in the billing/payments process.\n  In an interim report on this program, Secretary Shalala of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services describes the remarkable \nincrease in Medicare and Medicaid collections by tribal health \nproviders achieved through this program. For example, through the \ndemonstration program, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has \ndoubled its Medicare and Medicaid collections, which has led to further \nimprovements to the overall quality of health care provided to its \nmembers. The Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation of Alaska has been \nable to expand its health care, disease prevention and health education \nservices to an additional 32 villages in Alaska. The Southeast Alaska \nRegional Health Corporation reported a 600 percent increase in Medicaid \ncollections during the first 2 years of the pilot project. This funding \nincrease has allowed the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Corporation \nto upgrade its health care facilities and achieve ``Accreditation with \nCommendation'' from the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare \nOrganizations. Unless this program is reauthorized, these tribal health \nfacilities will be forced to return to the IHS-managed collection \nsystem and forego much of the progress that has been achieved. Based on \nthe record of success of this program, I am pleased that my colleagues \nsupport the extension of this program for 2 years.\n  Mr. President, the changes I am proposing in this substitute \namendment will bring us closer to meeting the goals of the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Act to raise the health status of Indian people \nand to ensure the continuation of several important Indian health care \nprograms. The changes I have proposed in the substitute amendment have \nbeen cleared by the respective Committees of jurisdiction in the House \nof Representatives. I thank my colleagues for their support in passing \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, \nthe bill be deemed read for a third time, passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, and any statements relating to the \nbill be placed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill which had been reported from the Committee on Indian Affairs, with \nan amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in \nlieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. REVOCATION OF CHARTER OF INCORPORATION OF THE \n                   PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY UNDER THE \n                   INDIAN REORGANIZATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Acceptance of Request To Revoke Charter.--The request \n     of the Prairie Island Indian Community to surrender the \n     charter of incorporation issued to that community on July 23, \n     1937, pursuant to section 17 of the Act of June 18, 1934, \n     commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'' (48 Stat. \n     988, chapter 576; 25 U.S.C. 477) is hereby accepted.\n       (b) Revocation of Charter.--The charter of incorporation \n     referred to in subsection (a) is hereby revoked.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE JICARILLA APACHE TRIBE WATER RIGHTS \n                   SETTLEMENT ACT.\n\n       Section 8(e)(3) The Jicarilla Apache Tribe Water Rights \n     Settlement Act (106 Stat. 2241) is amended by striking \n     ``December 31, 1996'' and inserting ``December 31, 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO THE SAN CARLOS APACHE TRIBE WATER RIGHTS \n                   SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1992.\n\n       Section 3711(b)(1) of the San Carlos Apache Tribe Water \n     Rights Settlement Act of 1992 (106 Stat. 4752) is amended by \n     striking ``December 31, 1996'' and inserting ``June 30, \n     1997''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr.President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n3068 and to urge its passage by the Senate.\n  The primary purpose of this legislation is to accept the request of \nthe Prairie Island Indian Community of Minnesota to revoke the Federal \ncharter of incorporation issued to the Community pursuant to the Indian \nReorganization Act of 1934.\n  The Prairie Island Indian Community is organized under a Constitution \nand Bylaws adopted by the Community in 1936 pursuant to section 16 of \nthe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 (25 U.S.C. 476). Article V of the \nPrairie Island Constitution, which enumerates the powers of the \nCommunity's Council, includes a provision that allows the Council to \nmanage economic affairs and enterprises in accordance with the terms of \na charter which may be issued to the Community by the Secretary of the \nInterior pursuant to section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act. In \n1937, the Secretary issued such a Federal charter to the Community.\n  For 60 years, the Prairie Island Community has relied upon the \nauthorities of its Constitution and Bylaws for the operation of its \ngovernment and for the operation of its business enterprises. Article V \nof the Constitution specifically provides authority for the Community \nto regulate the conduct of trade and the use and disposal of property \non the reservation, as well as to charter subordinate organizations for \neconomic purposes and to regulate the activities of such organizations.\n  The Community has come to view the 1937 charter, which hasn't been \namended since it was issued, as outdated, cumbersome, and unnecessary \nto their efforts to operate successful business enterprises and become \neconomically self-sufficient. Some charter provisions, such as one that \nprecludes the Community from contracting for amounts in excess of $100 \nwithout approval by the Secretary of the Interior, are seen as \nparticularly paternalistic and inappropriate for effective management \nof tribal resources. Accordingly, the Community has requested that the \ncharter be revoked.\n  H.R. 3068 accepts the request of the Prairie Island Indian Community \nthat its Federal charter of incorporation be revoked and declares the \ncharter to be revoked. Legislation is needed because Amendment 10 of \nthe charter states that the charter can be revoked only by an Act of \nCongress.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs adopted an amendment in the nature of \na substitute to H.R. 3068 that retains the unamended text of H.R. 3068, \nas passed by the House of Representatives, and adds two new sections \nthat extend the deadlines for completion of two Indian water rights \nsettlements enacted by the Congress in 1992.\n  The first new section extends until December 31, 1998, the deadline \nfor completion of all requirements necessary to effect the Jicarilla \nApache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992. The availability to \nthe Tribe of settlement funds and water from two Federal water projects \nin New Mexico is contingent upon dismissal of actions by the Tribe \nagainst the United States in Federal courts and a waiver of the Tribe's \nreserved water rights claims in general stream adjudications in state \ncourts involving claims to the waters of the San Juan River and its \ntributaries and the Rio Chama and its tributaries. The 1992 Act \nrequires partial final decrees agreed to by the United States, the \nTribe, and the State of New Mexico to be entered into by December 31, \n1996. However, this deadline cannot be met, due primarily to unforseen \ndelays in the necessary state court proceedings to consider the \nsettlement.\n\n[[Page S11054]]\n\n Accordingly, the Tribe, the State of New Mexico, and the \nAdministration support an extension of the 1992 Act's deadline in order \nto preserve the benefits of the settlement to all parties.\n\n  The second new section extends until June 30, 1997, the deadline for \ncompletion of all requirements necessary to effect the San Carlos \nApache Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 1992. This extension is \nintended to provide the Tribe and the Phelps Dodge Corporation, and the \nTribe and the city of Globe, Arizona, additional time to reach \nbilateral agreements that would be included as part of the overall \nSettlement Agreement that the Congress ratified in the 1992 Act. The \nrelatively short time period is intended to ensure that the parties \nremain diligent in pursuing a final resolution of the issues between \nthem. The Tribe, Phelps Dodge, Globe, and all other parties to the \nsettlement, including the Administration, support this extension. The \nCommittee recognizes that, in the event agreements are reached within \nthe time provided by the amendment, an additional extension of time \nwill be needed for the Arizona courts to consider the settlement in the \ncontext of the ongoing general stream adjudication of the waters of the \nGila River basin.\n  Mr. President, by accepting the request of the Prairie Island Indian \nCommunity regarding its charter, H.R. 3068 demonstrates the Congress' \nrespect for tribal self-government and tribal sovereignty. The \namendments to the bill that provide extensions of time for completing \ntwo complex water settlements already approved and funded by Congress \nmust be enacted if we are to preserve the benefits of those settlements \nfor all parties involved, including the United States.\n  Mr. President, H.R. 3068 is extremely important legislation that is \nwithout controversy or opposition. The Congressional Budget Office \nreports that enactment of the bill will not effect direct spending nor \ncreate any pay-as-you-go problems. Accordingly, I strongly urge the \nSenate to pass H.R. 3068 and send it to the President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill be deemed read for a third time, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table and any \nstatements relating to the bill be placed at an appropriate place in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 3068), as amended, was deemed read for a third time \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/09/19/senate-section/article/S11053-1", "month": "09", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WITNESS RETALIATION, WITNESS TAMPERING AND JURY TAMPERING AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, for my colleagues who may have missed \nthe information during the August break, or the news since, the latest \nhousehold survey numbers on drug use are out. For anyone concerned \nabout drug use in this country, those numbers tell a depressing story. \nThe story is quite simply this: more kids are using more drugs. Put \nwhat gloss you want on the numbers, the depressing fact is, we are in \nthe midst of a new drug crisis.\n  There are five major surveys of drug use in this country. These \ninclude the Drug Abuse Warning Network, or DAWN, which surveys hospital \nemergency room admission rates. The high school survey, which studies \nuse among seniors and others in high school. The Parents' Resource \nInstitute for Drug Education, or PRIDE survey of high school substance \nabuse. The Drug Use Forecasting, or DUF, survey that tests for \nsubstance abuse among arrestees.\n  And the household survey, which samples over 17,000 households to \nlook at drug use trends in the population age 12 and older. These \nsurveys are our early warning network. And the alarm bells are ringing. \nThe emergency lights are flashing. We need to heed the warning.\n  To understand the warning in its fullness, we need a little \nperspective. Today's growing problem does not occur in isolation. It is \nnot the result of ignorance of the dangers of drug use.\n  The 1960's and 1970's taught us a bitter lesson about that. They \ntaught us about the risks individuals and communities run in dealing, \nor failing to deal, with the drug problem. Since 1981, when we began to \nfight back seriously, we have spent $128 billion at the Federal level \nto combat illegal drug use. We have spent a like amount at the State \nand local levels. In addition, we have spent in the neighborhood of $1 \ntrillion on the indirect costs of drug use and an additional $1 \ntrillion, out of individual pockets, to buy illegal drugs.\n  This is only the fiscal summary. It does not begin to tote up the \nhuman toll. These numbers do not account for the tens of thousands of \ndeaths or the millions of addicts. They do not make plain the toll of \ndrug-addicted babies. Mere numbers do not convey the suffering, the \nloss of life, the damaged lives, the ruined prospects and shattered \ndreams that are all part of the legacy of this country's flirtation \nwith dangerous drugs. In a generation, we went from a nation with no \ndrug problem to a country in which one-fifth of the population has \ntried drugs and over 6 million people who are addicts.\n  There is not a single, major social pathology today that is not in \nsome way linked to drugs. From family violence to drive-by shootings, \nfrom drug-addicted babies to devastated inner-city neighborhoods, the \nlegacy of drugs is written in bold print across the face of this \ncountry.\n  We got ourselves into this mess because we allowed our cultural elite \nand others to persuade us, against our understanding, that drugs were \nreally OK. That using drugs was merely a form of personal expression \nthat did not hurt anyone, not even the user.\n  We bought into that idea and lived it through the 1960's and 1970's. \nWe came dangerously close to legalizing drug use. And we delegitimized \nthe notion of enforcing our laws against drug use. We are living with \nthe consequences. Today's billions spent on the war on drugs are a \ndirect result of the choices that we made yesterday. Our drug problem \nwas no accident. Movies and music glorified drugs. Politicians publicly \nquestioned the usefulness of preventing individual drug use.\n  Our cultural elite talked of legalization. In virtually all our means \nfor communicating what we think is proper and appropriate, we sent the \nsignal that drugs were OK. And who were we talking to? Who was \nlistening? who got the message? It was our kids. And it was our kids \nwho ended up as the principal casualties of this so-called enlightened \npolicy. What were we thinking?\n  In the 1980's, however, we realized our mistake. We began to fight \nback. It was not that we just spent money on the problem. Parents and \ncommunities, schools and businesses, civic and political leaders came \ntogether to stop the nonsense. They formed coalitions, lobbied their \npublic officials, and organized public and private efforts to fight \nback, to save the kids. And it was working. Between 1985 and 1992 drug \nuse in this country went down. More important, attitudes among kids \nabout drugs improved.\n  More and more kids came to see drugs as dangerous. More kids stayed \naway from using. That was no accident. Everywhere they looked the \nmessage they got was the drugs were bad. The message was, just say no. \nAnd they listened.\n  That did not mean that our difficulties were past. We still had a \nlarge addict population that was using more and more. We had enriched \npowerful drug organizations that had extensive networks for drug \nsmuggling and money laundering.\n  We still had to deal with a lingering notion that somehow, despite \nthe evidence before our eyes, drugs were OK. Nevertheless, we were on \nthe right track. In recent years, however, we have gone off the rails. \nIn some areas, we have been pulling up the tracks and shooting the \nengineers and conductors.\n  This is what the most recent household survey makes clear. It shows \nthat marijuana use among young people is up over 100 percent since \n1992.\n  It went up 37 percent last year alone. Overall drug use has risen 78 \npercent since 1992, 33 percent last year. Fully 10.9 percent of young \npeople aged 12 to 17 reported using marijuana monthly last year. That \nis up from 8.2 percent the year before. At this rate, we will have lost \nall the ground that we won in the late 1980's and early 1990's. And the \npeople who are at risk, once again, are kids and teenagers and young \nadults. If this trend continues, and it is showing no signs of changing \nunder present policies, in the next few years we will have wiped out \nall the gains made in the 1980's.\n  Now, if you do not believe that legalization is a rational policy, \nthen you cannot welcome the recent news. And if you do not think 10, \n11, and 12 year olds ought to be making their own decisions about using \nheroin or cocaine, then you have to conclude that the present trend is \na disaster in the making. As I suggested earlier, the warning lights \nare flashing.\n  When the oil light goes on in your car, it is time to check the \nengine. If you decide to ignore the light you risk making an expensive \nmistake.\n  Well, the Nation's warning light is on. And what do you find when you \nopen the hood and check on the reasons? As it turns out, we've been \ntrying to run our programs without the right stuff.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues have argued on this floor, this \nadministration simply has not taken the drug issue seriously. Not from \nday one, and not, so far as I can see, yet. In fact, its policy, where \none can be disconcerned, has downplayed the issue and distanced the \nPresident from any involvement.\n  Now, having said this, I know that one of my colleagues is likely to \nbe down here any minute accusing me of playing politics. That seems to \nbe the administration's line any time someone criticizes them. Indeed, \nSecretary Shalala and the Attorney General have been going around \nsaying this. They have blamed Congress for lack of funding. They have \npointed to increases of drug use in Europe. They have also taken to \nblaming the Bush administration for the present problem. When they do \nthat, reaching back 4 years to try to blame someone else, that is not \nplaying politics, of course.\n  That is not dodging. That's not blowing smoke. That is what passes \nfor policy in this administration. But serious policy is more than \nartful dodging.\n  Let me remind you, that this administration came into office saying \nthat the Bush administration had not fought a real drug war--that claim \nwas made despite the fact of steady declines in teen use. The present \noccupant of the White House promised to do better. At the least, then, \nwe should expect to see the trend of teen use continuing to decline.\n  We should expect that teenage attitudes about drug use would remain \nnegative. But that is not the case. In fact, it is exactly the reverse. \nAnd it was not the Bush administration that presided over these recent \nincreases. It\n\n[[Page S11056]]\n\nwas not past policies that created the present crisis. The \nadministration's own numbers make this clear. All you have to do is \nlook at those numbers. But, in keeping with this administration's whole \nprogram, the response is deny, deny, deny.\n  I am sure most parents have had the experience in dealing with their \nkids that when the crockery gets broken, it was some mysterious villain \nthat did the deed. Just ask the child. ``I didn't do it.'' Or, ``George \ndid it.'' Or, ``I don't know how it happened.'' These excuses are what \none expects. From children. As adults, however, we are supposed to know \nbetter. But, even as the numbers grow worse, the administration is \nstill hoping to pin the blame on someone, anyone else. But, in the end, \nit is their policies, it is their programs, it is their attitudes that \nhave shaped how we have dealt with the drug issue in the past 4 years.\n  And, the fact remains, after years of decline, drug use among kids is \ngetting worse by the minute, and this administration cannot think of \nanything more constructive to do than pass the blame.\n  All of this is a matter of record. I and others here and across the \ncountry have documented this story. Even the President's drug czar now \nacknowledges that we are in the midst of a crisis of new drug use. In \none of his most recent press releases outlining the problem, however, \nhe wants us to develop amnesia about how we got into this mess.\n  He wants us to look only at what we must do about it. I understand \nwhy he may want us to overlook the recent past. But no serious effort \nto get our programs back on track can hope to succeed if we do not \ngrasp why it is we are having the problem. This is not playing \npolitics, this is talking about policy. It is talking seriously about \nresponsibility.\n  We are in this mess because of choices that were made about what to \ndo. We are talking about conscious decisions deliberately made.\n  But it is now clear, that those decisions were, are a mistake. Our \npresent policies are simply not up to the task. Benign neglect, \nindifference, and just say maybe are not good policy choices. We have \nthe evidence of what happens when they are, however, our policy\n  Clearly, by all the warning systems that we have developed to give us \nfeed back, those choices have failed. The extent of that failure is \nshocking. If we are to change this, we must start doing something \ndifferent, we must do it better, and we must do it now.
