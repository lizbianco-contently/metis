Mr. President, yesterday a mock hearing for the press was \nhosted by Congressmen Schumer and Gejdenson, along with Prof. Ronald \nCotteril, director of the Food Marketing Policy Institute at the \nUniversity of Connecticut. The topic was price collusion in the cereal \nmarket, a charge which has not been proved over the past 20 years.\n  After review of all of the evidence which refutes the collusion \ntheory, I find it difficult to understand why the three continue this \ncurious drama.\n  I would like to present to my colleagues some history on this issue, \nwhich began with the dismissal of an antitrust complaint by the Federal \nTrade Commission after 10 years of tedious and costly examination of \nthe industry by the FTC.\n  Last year Federal Judge Kimba Wood, former nominee for Attorney \nGeneral during the Clinton administration, rejected an antitrust suit \nbrought\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nby the State of New York to prevent the Post Co. from buying Nabisco \nShredded Wheat.\n  Judge Wood indicated at the time that the cereal industry was \n``highly competitive.'' She indicated that there was no collusion, and \nno one company was able to control prices in any market segment. She \ncharacterized the testimony of the State's star witness, Professor \nCotteril, one of the hosts of today's mock hearing, as ``unreliable,'' \n``flawed,'' and ``erroneous.''\n  Last year Congressman Schumer and Gejdenson asked the Justice \nDepartment to initiate a criminal investigation into cereal prices. \nJustice declined the case, based on Judge Wood's decision.\n  Judge Wood has also noted in her decision that cereal prices rose \nonly 6.6 percent between 1989 and 1993, while food prices rose 12.8 \npercent and the cost-of-living index rose 16.5 percent. Widespread use \nof coupons lowers the average retail price by 30 percent. Further, \nJudge Wood found that industry concentration declined about 27 percent \nbetween 1970 and 1994 and that store brand cereals' market share rose \nto 9 percent in 1993 from 4.8 percent in 1988. This trend is expected \nto double in the next 3 to 4 years, surpassing the market share of \nthree of the five manufacturers.\n  Judge Wood also noted little brand loyalty among consumers. She also \nindicated that retailers may have had more to do with increasing \nprices. In 1994, one producer reduced its prices 40 percent, yet less \nthan two-thirds of this price cut was passed on to consumers.\n  Anyone who has been in a grocery store recently knows that the range \nof options and prices is nearly overwhelming. Imports are adding new \ncompetition. Cereal manufacturers not only compete head on but also \nwith other breakfast alternatives, which are also proliferating \nsignificantly. The business climate is hardly ripe for price collusion. \nIt is hard to understand why a trend toward more competition and price \nincreases well under cost of living increases would encourage the two \nCongressmen and Professor Cotteril to continue these efforts.\n  Professor Cotteril's Food Marketing Policy Institute has received \nearmarked funds from the Congress for quite a few years. If this is an \nexample of its priorities, I believe the Congress should reconsider \nfunding this institute.\n  I look forward to this debate as we pursue the fiscal 1997 \nappropriations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1905-7", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHAPLAIN OGILVIE'S 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, a year ago today, my good friend, Dr. \nLloyd Ogilvie joined the Senate family by becoming the 61st Senate \nChaplain. I was fortunate to have known him before he became the \nChaplain and now 99 other Senators have had the opportunity to be \nenriched by his friendship. But it is not just Senators who have been \nfortunate to experience the ministry of Chaplain Ogilvie. Following the \nexample of his predecessor, Richard Halverson, Dr. Ogilvie has \nministered to everyone he encounters.\n  I cannot speak for all of my colleagues, but I have thoroughly \nenjoyed Dr. Ogilvie's morning invocations. It is one of the highlights \nof my day. Each prayer is a poetic weaving of theological wisdom and \nspiritual encouragement. When I hear the Chaplain's resonant voice, I \nfeel as if the Heavenly Father himself has entered our midst and is \nspeaking to us here on the Senate floor. The Chaplain has the voice of \nGod, but he is also a man after God's own heart. He has said that he \nsees himself as an intercessor for the Senators, and I know that he is \nfaithful in his prayers for this body and its Members.\n  I have appreciated Dr. Ogilvie's careful efforts to keep the \nchaplaincy nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and nonsectarian. His concern is \ngenuine and he ministers indiscriminately to all who need \nencouragement. He is keenly aware of the spiritual needs of this body, \nand he makes himself readily available to address those needs.\n  We are fortunate to have Dr. Ogilvie among us. While I know that Dr. \nOgilvie feels a special calling to his ministry as Chaplain, he has \nmade some sacrifices to be with us. Before becoming chaplain, Dr. \nOgilvie was a prolific writer, authoring over 40 books. This literary \npassion has taken a backseat to the pressures of the Senate. But you \nwill hear no complaints from the Chaplain. He is engaged in his new \nministry and he is committed to his new parish.\n  I want to congratulate the Chaplain for his year anniversary and \nthank him for his invaluable ministry. I am grateful for what he has \ndone for us in the past year and I am excited about the many years \nahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1906-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1906-S1907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ON THE RETIREMENT OF DETECTIVE CHARLES J. BENNETT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some while ago, the New York Historical \nSociety conceived the notion of collecting holograph accounts of \nnotable events in our city from contemporary New Yorkers, and \nthereafter auctioning them off to help with the expenses of that \nvenerable institution. I was asked to participate and was happy to do. \nAs would anyone my age, I have all manner of memories of our city, \ngoing back, for example, to December 7, 1941, when I learned about \nPearl Harbor from a man whose shoes I was shining on the corner of \nCentral Park West and 81st Street, across from the Planetarium. I do \nnot really recall what I thought about all that; all I do recall for \ncertain is that when I got home later in the day, the regular radio \nprogramming had been interrupted by bulletins from the Pacific. Between \nbulletins, the station played martial music. Well, sort of martial \nmusic. It seemed the only such record they had on was the ``fight \nsong,'' as they say, of the Fordham football team.\n  Pearl Harbor brought war to the United States but only seemed to \nenhance the greatness of our city. At war's end, it seemed only natural \nthat New York should be chosen as the site of the headquarters of the \nUnited Nations, the victorious alliance that won that war.\n  The years since have not been so generous. At times, they have been \nominous, putting our city in peril in a way world war never did, albeit \nmuch of the peril has come from abroad.\n  I thought of this matter, and, of a sudden, knew the event I would \nrelate--with a penmanship that would mortify the brothers to this day. \nHere is what I wrote, on New Year's Day, 1995.\n\n       Early in 1985, I flew up from Washington to New York. As is \n     our custom, I was met by Detective ``Chuck'' Bennett of the \n     N.Y.P.D. On our way into town we discussed events of the day. \n     Bennett, with a detective's eye, commented that men were \n     appearing on street corners snapping their fingers for no \n     apparent reason. Two month's later he reported that they were \n     selling something called ``crack,'' the finger snapping being \n     a form of street cry. It remained for Douglas Hurd, then \n     British Home Secretary, to visit New York and tell our Drug \n     Enforcement Agency that a new form of cocaine, which had \n     appeared in the Bahamas in 1983, was known as ``crack'' and \n     was spreading. The Plague had reached New York.\n\n  Charles Joseph Bennett, the detective who had met me at LaGuardia, \nwas and remains a preternaturally subtle, observant, normally silent, \nat times near-to-invisible presence on our city streets for near \nquarter of a century. For 20 of those years, he has been keeping me out \nof harm's way. Not an easy thing to do, for public figures in our time \nare commonly threatened, sometimes openly, sometimes not. It has been \nhis lot to assess the threats involved, first having learned of them or \ndivined them. It was in this latter gift that ``Chuck'' excelled. Be it \na U.S. Senator, the least of his worries, a head of state, a peace \ndelegation, a terrorist infiltrator, a building, a bridge, a tunnel, \nthere has been no threat of violence or subversion or sedition in a \nquarter century that he has not been involved with or aware of.\n  His personal qualities are legendary. Affable until the moment of \ndanger when he can be terrifying; near-to-invisible until he must make \neveryone in the room stop instantly and do as he says; self-effacing, \nfunny, deadly serious. It may seem an unusual quality for an officer of \na very old organization, set in its ways and fixed in place, but \n``Chuck'' Bennett has proved an extraordinarily adept ambassador. First \nwith our own law enforcement organizations such as the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation and the Capitol Police here in Washington, but notably \nalso with foreign detective forces, ranging\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\nfrom London to Melbourne. He has formed lasting friendships not just \nbetween individuals but also between organizations that have hugely \nbenefitted all concerned.\n  This April 28 he retires: at the top of his grade and the top of his \nform. He goes with the profound thanks of Liz, Tim, Tracey, John, \nHelen, and Maura for his friendship and his guardianship. And the great \ngood wishes of all manner of New Yorkers for how well he has served us. \nOnly Chuck Bennett would notice odd gestures on street corners and spot \nan epidemic on its way. Let us hope he returns regularly to New York, \nkeeping an eye on things, and keeping in touch with those of us who \nlove him so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1906-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. RODNEY BELCHER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise today \nto inform the Senate of the tragic death of Dr. Rodney Belcher, an \northopedic surgeon from Arlington, VA, who was murdered in Kampala, \nUganda, on March 13.\n  I was fortunate to have known Dr. Belcher. Seven years ago, shortly \nafter I established the War Victims Fund, a $5 million appropriation in \nthe foreign aid program to provide medical and related assistance to \nwar victims, Rod Belcher signed on with Health Volunteers Overseas. He \nhad lived in Uganda before the civil war there, and the Agency for \nInternational Development sent him back to start a War Victims Fund \nprogram to assist people who had been disabled from war injuries. He \nand his wife Dawn had been there ever since.\n  There were tens of thousands of amputees, many victims of landmines, \nwithout access to artificial limbs. The Mulagro hospital and medical \nschool, once the pride and joy of that country, were in ruins. There \nwere not even basic medical supplies. There was not a single trained \northopedic surgeon in the country. The Ugandan Government was bankrupt.\n  Rod embraced that enormous challenge with enthusiasm, good humor, \npatience, and a deep, personal commitment to the Ugandan people. Over \nthe years he won the trust and respect of the Ugandan Government, and \nof successive United States Ambassadors and the ambassadors of other \ncountries who witnessed the impact he was having on the lives of so \nmany people. He rebuilt the orthopedic clinic and trained every \northopedic surgeon in Uganda today.\n  When my wife Marcelle and I visited Uganda in 1990, Dr. Belcher took \nus around the orthopedic clinic. We saw what a difference the War \nVictims Fund had made, as a result of his efforts and the efforts of \nthe Ugandans who worked with him. It was an experience that neither of \nus will ever forget. We saw what a difference this one American had \nmade.\n  Since then I have often thought of that trip, and Rod Belcher became \nthe model for the volunteers that have been recruited for other War \nVictims Fund programs. He exemplified what we looked for in others. He \nhad a warmth and gentleness, and a commitment to Uganda that was \nextraordinary.\n  Mr. President, on March 13, on his way to his office, Dr. Belcher was \nmurdered when two men stole his car. He was shot in the chest and died \nright there.\n  It would be hard to conceive of a more senseless, horrible crime. Rod \nBelcher was a wonderfully generous human being who devoted his \nprofessional life to improving the lives of others. For the past 7 \nyears he lived and worked in a country where getting even the simplest \nthing accomplished often required incredible ingenuity and persistence. \nRod had both.\n  At his funeral, Dr. Belcher was honored by the Ugandan Vice \nPresident, the Minister of Health, the director of the hospital, the \ndean of the medical school, the American Ambassador, the British High \nCommissioner, and many others. The orthopedic clinic that he worked so \nhard to establish was formally named after him. The streets were lined \nwith people who knew him personally or had heard of the American doctor \nwho had done so much for the Ugandan people.\n  Rod Belcher will be terribly missed. But he leaves a legacy that \nanyone would be proud of. He gave the War Victims Fund its start, and \nfor that I will always be grateful. And he leaves a core of trained \nUgandan orthopedic surgeons who loved and admired him, who will carry \non in his place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1907-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendment of the Senator from Texas to the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada is in order.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Chair advise the Senator from \nNevada when I have 5 minutes remaining of the 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have here a letter from the Evangelical \nEnvironmental Network consisting of a number of people, including Dr. \nRobert C. Andringa, president of the Christian College Coalition; Dr. \nGeorge Brushaber, president of Bethel College and Seminary; Mr. Roger \nCross, president of Youth for Christ/USA; Rev. Art DeKruyter, pastor of \nChrist Church of Oakbrook, and on and on with other religious leaders \nof this country.\n  The letter, written to all Senators, says, among other things:\n\n       This week the Senate will be voting on an omnibus \n     appropriations bill that contains a subtle attack on God's \n     handiwork. Buried in the legislation is a provision to \n     continue the moratorium on listing plants and animals as \n     endangered or threatened, under the Endangered Species Act.\n       Certainly there are scientific, economic, and medical \n     reasons for saving endangered creatures, but for many \n     individuals and congregations linked to the Evangelical \n     Environmental Network, the moral and spiritual aspects are \n     the more important. The Bible records ``the everlasting \n     covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind \n     on Earth'' and God affirms that covenant after using Noah to \n     bring the creatures through the Flood and save their \n     lives.\n\n  Mr. President, the letter continues:\n\n       If I am going to be in the right relationship with God, I \n     should treat the things he has made in the same way he treats \n     them.\n       The moratorium on listing species is nothing more than a \n     back door attack. While we stand by and do nothing, this \n     supposedly ``temporary'' measure may stretch over more than \n     two years, with the cost of recovering species becoming \n     greater and greater as time passes.\n       The moratorium was a bad idea when instituted; it is a bad \n     idea today. . . .\n       Despite anti-ESA propagandists claim, neither law nor our \n     environmental stance values plants or animals above people. \n     At issue is not favoritism but just and moral treatment of \n     all of God's creatures. God placed us here as stewards, not \n     as exploiters, and we have no right to act in a callous \n     manner toward any living creature.\n       With respect to the Endangered Species Act, we are \n     compelled to speak out because this matter relates to the \n     core of our faith and respect for God.\n\n  Mr. President, I have read only part of the letter, but the \nindication from these religious leaders is that the moratorium on the \nEndangered Species Act is wrong and it is immoral.\n  Mr. President, we have received letters from all over the country, \nnot the least of which is a letter from a group of physicians. I talked \nabout some of the things they said yesterday. But, in effect, what they \nsay is that it is wrong to have this moratorium; it is wrong for health \nreasons to millions of people throughout the world.\n  This letter is signed by representatives of the Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, the National Association\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\nof Physicians for the Environment, someone from the Pennsylvania \nMedical Society, the Massachusetts Medical Society, the Nevada Medical \nSociety, the Vermont Medical Society, the Arthritis Foundation, AIDS \nAction Council, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston University, and \non and on, Mr. President, with people from the medical community who \nsay that this moratorium is not only wrong from a political standpoint; \nit is wrong from a moral perspective.\n  Mr. President, last night I went back to the office and asked my \nstaff to look at some of the things we have received over our computer, \nover our e-mail network. We received--and I just at random picked a \nfew--we received something from Basking Ridge, NJ, from a woman who \nsays:\n\n       I implore you--\n\n  It is written to various Senators.\n\n       I implore you to support Senator Reid's amendment.\n       This matter is of critical importance because:\n       Listing a species under the Endangered Species Act is not a \n     trivial matter that can be delayed indefinitely. The \n     moratorium on listing and critical habitat designations must \n     be lifted.\n       The integrity of the ESA is extremely important to your \n     constituents. Do not allow this Congress to weaken this \n     important legislation.\n\n  That letter was from Merideth Mueller.\n  I received a letter from Minnesota from one Todd Burnside of \nRoseville, MN. He says:\n\n       The extinction of species and the degradation of the \n     environment are things that future generations may never \n     forgive us for.\n\n  I received also, Mr. President, a copy of an e-mail written to all \nSenators:\n\n       With all my heart I beg you to vote yes to Reid's amendment \n     to H.R. 3019, so that the awful moratorium to the ESA will \n     end. I cannot express to you how angry and disappointed I am \n     at this government for allowing for an ESA moratorium in the \n     first place. This act completely goes against the needs of \n     the country in terms of economics, morality, responsibility, \n     and common sense. At a time when we urgently need solidarity \n     on all fronts to protect what little we have left of the \n     natural environment and to leave something for our future \n     generations to cherish, and to stop the massive onslaught on \n     our natural world, we as citizens need you to protect the \n     environment, our home.\n\n  Mr. President, it is obvious what has happened here. The second-\ndegree amendment calls for emergency listings only. We know that this \nwill allow people to file all kinds of lawsuits to have emergency \nlistings. We know that there were listings prior to this moratorium \nbeing pronounced. They should proceed in an orderly fashion.\n  What this second-degree amendment will do is force the Department of \nthe Interior to defend numerous lawsuits to show that what they are \ndoing is adequate. We need to get rid of this moratorium and get back \nto good science and good protection of the environment and these \nspecies. What is taking place now is an assault on good science and \ngood government.\n  It also allows this body to simply not go forward with reauthorizing \nthe Endangered Species Act. As long as this moratorium is in effect, \nthere will be no further listings, and that is wrong. This moratorium, \nI think it is clear, is going to continue throughout this Congress with \nall we have to do with all the problems with the balanced budget and 13 \nappropriations bills, 5 of which we did not pass last year.\n\n  I think it is going to be extremely difficult to reauthorize this \nbill. This is a license to repudiate the Endangered Species Act. I \nthink we as a country and we as a Congress should be ashamed if we \nallow this to happen. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment to the \namendment because I think it is most important that we keep the \nintegrity of what we are trying to do to protect the endangered \nspecies. The authorization for the Endangered Species Act ran out \nseveral years ago. That is because of the ridiculous excesses that have \nbeen perpetrated on the private property owners in this country. So we \ncalled a moratorium on the old act so that we could reauthorize it, so \nthat we could protect private property and protect the endangered \nspecies. And we want to have good science, we want to have cost-benefit \nanalysis, we want to have economic impact analysis because, after all, \nMr. President, there is no reason for people in the Northwest to have \nthe entire timber industry shut down because of the spotted owl. There \nis no reason to have put people who had worked for generations in the \ntimber industry there out of work and untrained to do other things.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, you and I are paying $250 million to retrain \nthose people because we were protecting a spotted owl that could have \nbeen put somewhere else in a national forest to protect. We could have \nhad it both ways if we had just used common sense, Mr. President. But \nwe did not do that. And that is why it was necessary and why this \nCongress voted overwhelmingly to put a moratorium on the Endangered \nSpecies Act listing--not the preparation for listing, not the research, \njust the final listings--until we could have a reauthorization of the \nact that would put common sense into it, that would put people into the \nequation, because after all, people should be in the equation as well. \nI like to joke sometimes and say that the only endangered species not \nprotected is Homo sapiens.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is time that we started putting common sense \ninto this act. Let me talk to you about a few of the excesses that have \ncaused us to be in the situation where we are, needing to do a drastic \nreorganization and reauthorization of this bill.\n  In Texas, my home State, there is a golden cheek warbler. Fish and \nWildlife originally said they were going to set aside an area the size \nof the State of Rhode Island to protect a golden cheek warbler. Mr. \nPresident, we want to protect golden cheek warblers, but I think it is \na little excessive to cause property values in that entire area to \nplummet to save this golden cheek warbler when we can do it with other \nmeans. Not only that, but what they said you could not do on your \nproperty is cut cedar. Now, cedar has a very bad impact on people's \nhealth. People have what we call cedar fever. People are miserable with \ncedar fever. So they cut cedar trees to keep people from having this \nvery annoying sort of sneezing attack.\n  Well, in addition to that, even more important to the farmers and \nranchers in the area, cedar absorbs water so that we lose the ability \nto use water downstream because the cedar trees are absorbing the water \nupstream. So it really is a hindrance and something that our farmers \nand ranchers need to deal with. One Travis County, TX, owner, Margaret \nRector, invested in land 25 years ago to help her in her retirement \nyears. In 1990, her land was worth $830,000. After it was designated a \ngolden cheek warbler habitat, its value plunged to $30,000.\n\n  Mr. President, that is not a guess, that is an assessment on the \ncounty tax rolls in Travis County, TX. Mr. President, that is \nridiculous. Next is the southwestern willow fly catcher in California. \nThe Army Corps of Engineers built the Isabella Dam in Kern County, CA, \nto catch the runoff of melting snow from the southern Sierra Mountains \nto save it for use in the summer. It has saved millions in flood \ndamage, increased the water supply, and it is the third largest food-\nproducing county in the entire country now. But the listing in February \n1995 of the southwestern willow fly catcher has put the dam's use at \nrisk, fearing the reservoir will flood fly catcher nesting areas, a \nharm to the bird's habitat. Now Fish and Wildlife may force the Corps \nof Engineers to release water from the reservoir to protect the habitat \nthat did not exist until the dam was built.\n  These are two examples, Mr. President. The jaguar in Texas. Mr. \nPresident, they have not seen a jaguar in Texas since 1948 when one \nwandered up from Mexico, they think, and it was cited as sort of an \nanomaly. Now they are talking about listing the jaguar as an endangered \nspecies in Texas, having not seen one since 1948, and it could cause \nrestrictions on land use in 30 counties along the Rio Grande River.\n  Mr. President, that is why so many groups and private property \nowners--the American Farm Bureau is alarmed by what is happening with \nthis Endangered Species Act. They are in total support of my amendment, \nwhich does the following. My amendment just says that we will protect \nthe ability to have emergency listings. It has been said on\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\nthis floor that we might lose some of the very important endangered \nspecies. Well, we will not. With my amendment, we give the Secretary of \nthe Interior the right to do an emergency listing so there would not be \na danger of losing an endangered species on an emergency basis.\n  But, Mr. President, I think it is very important that we realize that \nthe people who are holding up the progress on the reauthorization are \nalso the people who are here wanting to lift the moratorium. I do not \nunderstand that. I do not understand why they would want to lift the \nmoratorium on a bill that they have all said has problems. I have \npointed out a few of those problems here this morning. Why would they \nlift the moratorium under the old act that they say has problems when \nthey have the power to reauthorize and to protect everyone--private \nproperty rights, private property owners, and to protect the animals \nunder the Endangered Species Act, as well? Why would we not do things \nthe right way, Mr. President? That is my question here today.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island, [Mr. Chafee].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, what is wrong with the Hutchison amendment, the \nsecond-degree amendment? First of all, it maintains the moratorium on \nfinal decisions to list species through the end of this fiscal year.\n  Now, Mr. President, let us briefly review the bidding. Last March, \nthe Senate approved a 6-month moratorium, a brief time out on listings \nunder the Endangered Species Act. That was 6 months. That was extended \nanother 5 months under the continuing resolution. Now, under this bill, \nthe moratorium would be extended for another 7 months. That means that \nfor a minimum of 18 months no work will be done toward conserving \nspecies that warrant protection under the Endangered Species Act, \nspecies threatened with extinction or destruction, and a lot of ground \ncan be lost in a year and a half.\n  Now, Mr. President, the second point is that although the Hutchison \nsecond-degree amendment would allow emergency listings --the word \n``emergency'' is in there--that is not an adequate or practical way to \nrecover a species. Mr. President, you come up with emergency listing \nwhen the situation is really desperate. It is sort of a last-ditch \neffort to save a species, when the species is about to become extinct \neither through disease, or destruction by man in some fashion, or the \nlast remnant of the habitat has been wiped out.\n  At this point, Mr. President, there is little hope of recovering the \nspecies. Recovery, after all, is the goal of the Endangered Species \nAct. That is what this is all about. If we do not want an Endangered \nSpecies Act, just let us say so. But we hear constantly on the floor of \nthis Senate--when these amendments are brought up to really demolish \nthe Endangered Species Act, it is prefaced by, ``We are all for the \nact, we just want to make these corrections.'' But this ``correction,'' \nso-called, really is devastating to the recovery of a species.\n  If you are only listing it as endangered when it reaches the \nemergency situation, then the cause is practically lost, in most \ninstances, due to the destruction of the animal, bird or plant, or lost \ndue to the destruction of the habitat that is so essential for the \nsurvival of that.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, I point out that emergency listings are \nonly temporary. Under the Endangered Species Act, they last for 240 \ndays. You go in--it is not like a listing for an endangered species. It \nis an emergency situation. Normally, the Fish and Wildlife Service \npromulgates a final rule to list a species at the end of the 240-day \nemergency listing period.\n  Under the second-degree amendment that is presented, the Fish and \nWildlife Service could not make a final rule to protect the species \nunder the Endangered Species Act because you cannot do that. They have \nto go through a whole series of emergency actions--240 days, and then \nanother 240 days. That is not the kind of situation that is really \ngoing to lead to the saving of a species. It is not going to permit \nlong-term decisions to be made and expenditures of money, perhaps, for \nthe saving of habitat.\n  So, Mr. President, I do hope the second-degree amendment will be \ntabled, as the distinguished Senator from Nevada will move at some \nperiod.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the Endangered Species Listing Handbook \npublished by the Division of Endangered Species, under Procedures \nGuidance for the Preparations and Processing of Rules and Notices \nPursuant to the Endangered Species Act:\n\n       An emergency listing is a temporary measure, providing the \n     Act's protection for only 240 days. It is only used in \n     extreme situations of dire imminent threat to a species' \n     continued existence.\n\n  Mr. President, there is going to be a flood of lawsuits if this \namendment of my friend from Texas is not tabled. The listing moratorium \nmust be lifted. The motion to table that I will make should be granted, \nand the listing moratorium must be lifted.\n  First, over 500 species are dangerously close to extinction along \nwith their life-sustaining ecosystems.\n  Second, the moratorium on the listing process is a display of lack of \nfaith in the legislative process. Really, it is arrogance, because \neveryone knows that as long as this moratorium is in effect, there will \nbe no endangered species reauthorization. It removes the incentive for \nopponents of the Endangered Species Act to reauthorize the act.\n  Third, it is argued that a time out is what was needed to get reform \nmeasures in place and better science procedures in the listing process. \nI have two responses. The first is that there is no time out for the \nspecies who may face habitat degradation and extinction. Finally, the \nscience is irrelevant if a species has become extinct. My second \nresponse to a time out is that the show of good faith in \nreauthorization that my colleagues talked about last night and this \nmorning would be the lifting of the moratorium and proceeding with the \nbusiness of reforming the act.\n\n  Fourth, I received letters from 38 physicians, chemists, dentists, \nand others from around the country advocating the repeal of the \nmoratorium. I read some of their organizations today. They state with \nclarity: ``What is often lost in the debate over species conservation \nis the value of species to human health.''\n  They continue. ``* * * [R]ecent studies have shown that a substantial \nproportion of the Nation's medicines are derived from plants and other \nnatural resources. The medicines of tomorrow being discovered today \nfrom nature * * *.''\n  They conclude: ``When a species is lost to extinction, we have no \nidea what potential medical cures are lost along with it.''\n  I have talked about the evangelicals and representatives of religious \norganizations. I have read in detail from their letters. They believe \nthat this is a moral issue and not a political issue.\n  My response to the second-degree amendment is, among other things:\n  First, the amendment fundamentally maintains the listing moratorium. \nThat is all it does. It fails to mitigate the devastating impact of the \nlisting moratorium because it does not allow for a final determination \nof an emergency listing. This means that no real recovery can take \nplace. It is a meaningless exercise in paperwork.\n  Second, the second-degree amendment only creates wasteful \nbureaucratic procedures and would be a heyday for lawyers.\n  Third, the Kempthorne amendment has agreed in the past that we should \ntry to avoid emergency listings. This is directly in the offset.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is no justification, no logic, to this \ninactivity when the net result will be a greater cost to the taxpayer, \nfewer management options, and, most importantly, greater increase in \nthe likelihood of extinction.\n  The amendment is a superficial legislative ploy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S1910]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized, and the \nremaining time is 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I had 7\\1/2\\ minutes the last time I asked.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes remain.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am very happy to be here to support my \ncolleague from Texas. I think on this issue she is absolutely right. \nLet me explain why.\n  In 1973, we passed the Endangered Species Act. We have gone back \nperiodically and rewritten that law, and in the last rewriting we put \nin a date by which the law had to be updated in order to still have \nforce, a sunsetting provision. The logic of the sunsetting provision \nwas to assure that periodically as situations changed, such as the \npower of the bureaucracy to expand the law beyond any limit anyone \nforesaw when the law was written, that by that date we were going to \nhave to go back and rewrite the law or it was going to stop having any \nforce of law. That act expired in 1992. This is 1996. For 4 years, we \nhave had no Endangered Species Act because the law is sunset. Granted, \nwe have continued to allow it to operate by providing funds for that \npurpose. But the whole purpose of sunsetting is to modernize \nlegislation to reflect the new reality.\n  Then in April 1995 we took a time out. This time out basically said, \n``It has been 3 years since this law expired.'' We should not allow the \nFish and Wildlife Service to continue to designate endangered species \nwithout any limit, without any congressional check, until this law is \nreauthorized. That was eminently reasonable. It was adopted right here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate, and it became the law of the land.\n  Now we have an effort by Senator Reid to go back and, in essence, to \nmake the endangered species law a law that operates in perpetuity where \nthere is no requirement that it be modernized and where it can simply \ncontinue to do things like the effort by U.S. Fish and Wildlife to \ndesignate 33 counties in central Texas as being affected by an \nendangered species called the Golden Cheek Warbler. In the face of \nwidespread opposition in Texas, they backed off.\n  But the point is we have a right to say that when Congress wrote this \nlaw, it wanted the right to periodically review it. That time for \nreview occurred 4 years ago.\n  I think the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has proposed a \nreasonable compromise that will allow emergency designations and allow \nus to rewrite this law and make changes that the American people \nclearly want but which will put the pressure on those whose viewpoint \nis a minority viewpoint.\n  This is not just about endangered species. This is about whether or \nnot we are going to let a small group of people who do not agree with \nthe mandate of the 1994 election ride roughshod over that mandate by \nextending a law which expired 4 years ago and by allowing bureaucrats \nto continue to not consider cost and benefits. Everybody in the Senate \nknows that if we rewrite the Endangered Species Act in this Congress, \nthere are going to be dramatic changes in it.\n  If the underlying Reid amendment which Senator Hutchison has amended \nis adopted and becomes law, we will not rewrite the Endangered Species \nAct--and everybody knows it. As a result, even though the majority of \nthe American people and the majority of the Members of Congress are \nready to make the changes, even though the law has expired, we will end \nup continuing to expand the power of the Federal bureaucracy.\n  I want to urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison amendment.\n  Let me also say that, if the underlying Reid amendment is attached to \nthis bill, I intend to oppose this bill and I intend to vigorously \nfight its adoption. I think it would be an absolute outrage if we went \nback now and eliminated the time out we declared in April 1995 on a law \nwhich expired 4 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 2 minutes and 11 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the argument has been made in the Chamber that we \nmight lose some very important endangered animals in America. I \nsubmitted an amendment to the amendment to make sure that that would \nnot happen. We allow emergency listings if there really is a danger of \nlosing any animal or any species that is under the old act.\n  Let us look at what the Reid amendment does. You have heard people on \nthe other side argue that there are problems with the act, but \nnevertheless they are urging you in the Reid amendment to go forward \nunder the old act which we acknowledge has problems, regardless of the \nfact that it costs people jobs, that it hurts the economies of many \nStates, and that it takes away a fundamental constitutional right in \nthis country, and that is the right to private property.\n  That is wrong. It would be ridiculous for the Senate to vote today to \ngo forward, take away jobs, hurt the economy, and take away private \nproperty rights under an act which everyone has acknowledged has \nproblems.\n  If we are sincere about doing what is right, if we are sincere about \nreauthorizing the bill with some common sense, with some protection for \nprivate property, if we are sincere about making sure that private \nproperty rights and people's jobs have some part in the equation in the \ndecisionmaking, then we should vote for the Hutchison-Kempthorne \namendment. The Hutchison-Kempthorne amendment protects emergency \nlistings. If there really is a danger of losing one of the endangered \nspecies, it protects that right.\n  However, what we must do is also protect the right of the people in \nthis country. The jobs and the people who work for a living ought to \nhave some protection by the Senate. If we vote for the Hutchison-\nKempthorne amendment, their rights will be protected and we will also \nreauthorize the Endangered Species Act to protect the animals in our \ncountry as well. Let us do it right. Vote for Hutchison-Kempthorne.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I first want to commend the Junior \nSenator from Idaho for his leadership on this issue. I know that \nreforming the Endangered Species Act is a critical issue to Idaho. It \nis a make or break issue for many of our constituents. I am certain \nthat he will approach the reauthorization with the reasoned, \ncommonsense perspective it desperately needs.\n  Mr. President, as a life-long farmer, I understand the value of \nwildlife. I have grown up with wildlife and protected it without \ngovernment forcing me to. But also as a farmer, I understand the \nincredible burden being placed on private landowners and public \nresources to meet the mandates of this act.\n  The problem comes when the bureaucracy gets out of control and \ngovernment hurts people in order to protect animals. That is precisely \nwhat is happening all around the country. And where it is not already \nhappening, it will happen soon.\n  For instance, in North Carolina we have thousands of acres of \nvaluable timberland which cannot be cut because the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service believes it may harm red cockaded woodpeckers. Some \nchanges have been announced recently that should help matters some. But \nthere remains a big problem back home. By any reasonable measure the \ngovernment has seized the land of many of my constituents without \noffering them a dime of compensation.\n  Unfortunately, the bureaucracy and the environmental industry do not \ncare about the reality outside of Washington. They seek to use the \nEndangered Species Act and the animals themselves as tools to create \nFederal land use regulations nationwide. The ultimate result being \nthousands upon thousands of overlapping habitat ranges for each and \nevery bug, snail, and fly the bureaucrats think we need more of.\n  Mr. President, the important question is: What happens when virtually \nall land is home to a protected animal--what happens then?\n\n[[Page S1911]]\n\n  This is a very serious question. It has happened in Idaho, Senator \nKempthorne's State. As he has shown the committee, virtually all of \nIdaho is regulated as home to some sort of government protected animal. \nThousands of acres of valuable farmland have been locked off to protect \nan underground water snail called the brunei snail. This kind of thing \nis going to happen everywhere when the environmental industry gets its \nway.\n  I will oppose Senator Reid's amendment because we need to restrain \nthe bureaucracy that is now operating under a flawed law. A law that \ngives too little consideration for the livelihood and property of \npeople, and too much for bugs, bees, and bureaucrats.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each side have \nan additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I yield my 1 minute to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I note that in the second-degree amendment \nit provides $1 to the Fish and Wildlife Service to do the entire \nemergency listing. That shows you how serious the other side is about \nthis whole proposition.\n  In other words, in the underlying bill, there was $750,000 which was \navailable for the downlisting and the other activities in connection \nwith this program. And now they are saying that we are out to take care \nof this situation because there is an emergency provision, and in order \nto take care of it they provide $1.\n  It seems to me that shows you how serious really the other side is in \nproposing this second-degree amendment. And so I hope that the Reid \neffort to table the Hutchison amendment will succeed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to my colleague \nfrom Texas and 30 seconds to my colleague from Wyoming.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I hope nobody is confused by the statement \nthat was just made. When we took a time out in April of 1995, we did \nnot take all the money away from the Fish and Wildlife Service. We left \nthem the money to continue to trample on private property and the \nrights of citizens and to continue to fail to look at reason, \nresponsibility, and cost and benefits. But we simply took away the \nright for them 3 years after the law had expired to continue to limit \njobs, growth and opportunity in America. The only reason the Senator \nfrom Texas added a dollar in her amendment was because this is an \nappropriations bill and it was strictly a technicality. The Senators \namendment does not reduce the $750,000 available. So I hope no one is \nconfused.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in support of the Hutchison amendment. We have worked very \nhard now for almost a year and a half having hearings going on in the \ncountry, and clearly all of us want to have endangered species \nprotection. But very clearly, it needs to be changed, and it needs to \nbe upgraded.\n  We need to learn from the experience of the past 20 years. This is \nthe way to do it. If we do not have passage of the Hutchison amendment, \nthen we will not get to making the changes that need to be made. I \nfully support the Hutchison amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, the amendment will be laid aside and the majority leader is \nrecognized to call up an amendment.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 3480 and 3481 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n     (Purpose: To provide economic reconstruction funds to Bosnia-\nHerzegovina subject to compliance with the Dayton Accord's requirement \n                   for withdrawal of foreign troops)\n\n  (Purpose: To provide economic assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina \n                     subject to certain conditions)\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I am going to offer two amendments on behalf \nof myself and the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee, Senator McConnell. One amendment would prohibit the \nrelease of funds to Bosnia under this act until the Bosnian Federation \nis in compliance with article III of annex 1-A of the Dayton agreement \nwhich simply means that all foreign forces must leave Bosnia before \nfunds for civilian implementation can be released.\n\n  I will also send to the desk another amendment on behalf of Senator \nMcConnell and myself which establishes several conditions for the use \nof the funds provided for civilian implementation projects in Bosnia. \nIn my view, these two amendments should enjoy bipartisan support. As \nfar as I know, there is no objection to the amendments, but I will \noffer the amendments and not ask for final disposition until everyone \nhas had an opportunity to take a look at them.\n  I am pleased to cosponsor with the chairman of the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee these two amendments to the Bosnia supplemental portion of \nthe continuing resolution. I wish to address first the issues of \noffsets for this $200 million in civilian implementation funding. I \nunderstand that this portion of the supplemental was designed as an \n``emergency'' by the Appropriations Committee but was offset by the \nHouse. I hope that the conferees will ultimately offset this $200 \nmillion request.\n  As we have seen over the past few months, the military aspects of the \nDayton agreement have been the easiest to implement. It is the civilian \nside of the equation that poses the toughest problems. Among them, \nfacilitating the return of refugees, conducting free and fair \nelections, and establishing a professional civilian police force.\n  Indeed, the reports we are getting from Sarajevo have demonstrated \nthat integrating the capital is more difficult than separating the \nvarious military forces. The military task is limited and clear, while \nthe civilian task is wide-reaching and complex, with only vague lines \nof authority.\n  The United States has made a tremendous commitment of personnel and \nresources in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While many of us disagreed with \nthe administration's decision to send troops to Bosnia, while many of \nus advocated a different policy, those American forces are now there, \nand therefore it is essential that we succeed. Our credibility and that \nof NATO is on the line. It is essential that we in the international \ncommunity get Bosnia back on its feet. Otherwise, this risky deployment \nof thousands of American and NATO soldiers will be for naught. It will \nend up being a brief interlude in a long war. The challenges are \nimmense. There are more than 2.5 million Bosnians who have been \ndisplaced from their homes. At least 60 percent of housing in Bosnia \nhas been damaged or destroyed. Most Bosnian Moslems and Croats have no \npaying jobs and have been dependent on humanitarian assistance for \nnearly 4 years.\n  No doubt about it, the Bosnians need and deserve our help. However, \nthere are problems that we cannot and should not ignore. First and \nforemost is the continued presence of Iranian military personnel in \nBosnia and Iranian intelligence officials.\n  They pose a potential threat to our forces--but also to Bosnia's \nplace in the international community. The McConnell-Dole amendment \nrequires the President to certify that the Bosnians are in full \ncompliance with article III of annex 1-A of the Dayton Agreement \nmandating the withdrawal of foreign forces, and to certify that Bosnian \nGovernment-Iranian Government cooperation on intelligence matters has \nbeen terminated.\n  It seems to me that through our actions today we can send two \nbeneficial signals: That we are seriously committed to assisting \nBosnia, but that the Bosnian Government's continued military and \nintelligence relationship with Iran must be halted.\n  We know that Iran provided military aid to Bosnia when the rest of \nthe world refused to. I opposed the policy of refusing the Bosnians the \nmeans to defend themselves. The Congress opposed that policy. But, that \nis the past.\n  And now the Bosnian Government must make choices that will affect \nBosnia and Herzegovina's future. Will Bosnia be part of Europe and the \nWest or not? A continuing military and intelligence relationship with \nIran clearly jeopardizes Bosnia's future as a pluralistic democratic \nstate in Europe.\n  Looking further at developments within Bosnia, we need to make sure\n\n[[Page S1912]]\n\nthat our economic assistance has a positive effect on the social, \neconomic and political situation there and that other donors are doing \ntheir fair share. So, besides limiting U.S. aid to projects in the U.S. \nsector, the second McConnell-Dole amendment would add criteria \nincluding:\n\n  Prohibiting funds for the repair of housing in areas where displaced \npersons or refugees are refused the right of return due to ethnicity or \npolitical party affiliation;\n  Establishing, in advance, GAO audit access to the banking and \nfinancial institutions that will receive AID assistance;\n  A certification by the president, after 90 days, that the total U.S. \ncontribution to reconstruction for this year, $532 million, has been \nmatched by a combined total of bilateral donor pledges.\n  These amendments do not address all problems related to the civilian \neffort in Bosnia, but they go a long way. For example, more \ncongressional oversight and work will need to be done on the matter of \ncivilian police and the international police task force which is \npartially funded in this supplemental. This week we saw houses being \nlooted and burned in Sarajevo and a handful of international police are \nstanding by and watching--because they have no arms and no authority. \nAnother vital issue is that of arming and training Bosnian Federation \nForces--which is critical to the long-term stability of Bosnia. That of \ncourse, can also only be achieved once the Bosnian Government ensures \nthat Iranian military units are no longer on its territory.\n\n  Mr. President, helping Bosnia and the Bosnian people is the right \nthing to do. However, we must do so wisely--and these two amendments \nwill ensure that U.S. dollars are spent prudently and in a manner that \nsupports our broader goals. It is not only in Bosnia's interest, but in \nour interest, to have a Bosnia which is pluralistic, democratic, \nmultiethnic and able to defend itself.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to support these amendments, and I now \nsend these amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for Mr. McConnell, for \n     himself, Mr. Dole, Mr. Bennett, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3480 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       No funds may be provided under this Act until the President \n     certifies to the Committees on Appropriations that:\n       (1) The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in full \n     compliance with Article III, Annex 1A of the Dayton \n     Agreement; and\n       (2) Intelligence cooperation between Iranian officials and \n     Bosnian officials has been terminated.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not know if anybody now wishes to speak \non these amendments, but I wanted to offer the amendments. I think \nSenator McConnell will speak after his hearing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is there a time limit on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I believe I sent two amendments to the desk. \nI ask unanimous consent to lay aside the first amendment and call up \nthe second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the second amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for Mr. McConnell, for \n     himself, Mr. Dole, and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3481 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     On page 751, section entitled ``Agency for International \n     Development, Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltics,'' \n     insert at the appropriate place, the following: ``Provided \n     further, That funds appropriated by this Act may only be made \n     available for projects, activities, or programs within the \n     sector assigned to American forces of NATO military \n     Implementation Force (IFOR) and Sarajevo: Provided further, \n     That priority consideration shall be given to projects and \n     activities designated in the IFOR ``Task Force Eagle civil \n     military project list'': Provided further, That no funds made \n     available under this Act, or any other Act, may be obligated \n     for the purposes of rebuilding or repairing housing in areas \n     where refugees or displaced persons are refused the right of \n     return due to ethnicity or political party affiliation: \n     Provided further, That no funds may be made available under \n     this heading in this Act, or any other Act, to any banking or \n     financial institution in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless such \n     institution agrees in advance, and in writing, to allow the \n     United States General Accounting Office access for the \n     purposes of audit of the use of U.S. assistance: Provided \n     further, That effective ninety days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, none of the funds appropriated under \n     this heading may be made available for the purposes of \n     economic reconstruction in Bosnia and Herzegovina unless the \n     President determines and certifies in writing to the \n     Committees on Appropriations that the bilateral contributions \n     pledged by non-U.S. donors are at least equivalent to the \n     U.S. bilateral contributions made under this Act and in the \n     FY 1995 and FY 1996 Foreign Operations, Export Financing and \n     Related Programs Appropriations bills.''\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not know of any other speakers, but \nthere may be requests from both sides of the aisle. I know Senator \nMcConnell wishes to speak briefly. He is now involved in a hearing. I \nask the amendments be temporarily laid aside, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \namendments that have just been laid down by the majority leader and by \nSenator McConnell of Kentucky. I think it is very important that we \ncontinue to keep in mind that the agreement that was made by the \nSenate, over my objection, frankly, that we would send the troops to \nBosnia, nevertheless did include some very important points.\n  After the United States has expended so much to try to keep this \npeace agreement, it is most important that the agreement be kept in \nforce, including the arming and training of the Moslems. That was a key \nreason that so many people on this floor voted to support sending the \ntroops. It is most important that we get on with that part of the \nagreement. Otherwise, after all the money that we have spent trying to \nbring peace to the Balkans, the results will be short-lived, because if \nthere is not some sort of parity there among the three parties, I think \nit will be difficult to keep the peace for a long term. The one chance \nthat I think we have is if there is parity among the parties. So I hope \nthe President will remember that part of the agreement that was made \nand get on with the other parts of the Dayton agreement that would give \nthe best chance for this to be a successful mission.\n  So I am very pleased to support and ask unanimous consent to be added \nas a cosponsor of Dole-McConnell amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3479\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Texas, in his closing remarks regarding the Reid and Kempthorne \namendments, indicated that when the moratorium was originally placed \nthat there was no\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nmoney involved. That factually is not so. Mr. President, $1.5 million \nwas rescinded at the same time that the original moratorium was passed.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison-\nKempthorne proposal with regard to a final listing moratorium for the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  I think a lot about this issue because I have had to confront it \nfrequently in my State of Mississippi. I have also heard of many \ninstances in other States where major problems have been caused by the \nEndangered Species Act. I say this as one who voted for this act way \nback in 1974, I think, when we originally passed it. I thought we were \npassing an act that would be aimed narrowly at truly endangered \nspecies.\n  I was thinking about perhaps, you know, crocodiles. I was thinking \nabout maybe white tigers. I was thinking about elephants. I had no idea \nthe extent to which this law would be contorted and twisted and used by \nthe bureaucracy to harass people who are trying to create jobs and \nprovide economic opportunities.\n  There seems to be no end to the lengths bureaucrats will go to use \nthe Endangered Species Act to take private and public property. I \nreally think that common sense has been lost when it comes to this \nparticular statute.\n  I do not think when I originally voted--in fact, I know that when I \noriginally voted for this act, I had no idea that this would lead to \nthe spotted owl situation in the Northwest. I had no idea that it would \ncreate a problem in my own State of Mississippi with species like the \ngopher tortoise or the ring-necked snake or the red cockaded \nwoodpecker. I believe it never occurred to many of us who voted for \nthis bill over 20 years ago that it would destroy jobs, cripple \neconomic development, and put private property at risk. It has placed \nindividual rights behind those of a ring-necked snake.\n  In my own State of Mississippi, we have had a real problem with the \nForest Service because they want to set aside not a few hundred, not a \nfew thousand, but 100,000 acres of timber-land for the red cockaded \nwoodpecker.\n  I thought that a lot of birds were involved. Unfortunately, I was \nwrong. As a matter of fact, it involved just three colonies. Then I \nthought, well maybe a colony represents a lot of birds. Unfortunately, \nI was wrong again. A colony is just two birds, one male and one female. \nMy State of Mississippi will have a total of seven red cockaded \nwoodpeckers in this 100,000-acre set-aside in the Chickasaw District of \nthe De Soto National Forest. Seems a bit excessive, but all done in the \nname of the Endangered Species Act. And, guess what--the Forest Service \nwants still more acreage.\n  Most Senators can cite similar examples of unbelievable experiences \nand excesses with this law in their States. I think that there is a \nneed to provide some commonsense protection for birds, fish, and \nplants, but a responsible balance must be reached because the \nEndangered Species Act is costing us millions of dollars. It is costing \nus thousands of acres. I think it is getting out of control. Many in \nthis city talk about extremism by one side or the other on policy \nissues, and perhaps the bureaucracy's implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act has reached that stage.\n  It is time that Congress pull the Endangered Species Act back from \nthe abyss and take a calm, reasoned look at it. That is what Senators \nHutchison and Kempthorne are requesting through their amendment. A \nnarrow and limited pause for only one aspect of the statute.\n  That is what this debate is all about. Last year the Congress--not \nsome alien group--this Congress put a hold on future listing of \nendangered species and the designation of critical habitat until the \nbasic statute had been reauthorized. It should be noted that this \nstatute is long overdue for a full review and reauthorization. The \nEndangered Species Act authorization and its appropriations expired in \n1992. And, a pause would enable this Congress to work in a measured \nmanner to correct the statute before more funds are spent and more \neconomic turmoil can occur. The authorization process is the accepted \nmethod to establish and adjust public policy.\n  So why has it not been reauthorized? Because those that want to \ncontinue this abuse under the guise of protection are afraid that the \nAmerican people will insist that the Congress apply common sense to \nthis act. And so the debate has been stalled in the authorization \ncommittees making it impossible to bring it forward.\n  This leaves the appropriation process as the only legislative vehicle \nto address the issue. And to the credit of Senators Hutchison and \nKempthorne, they are not trying to gut or repeal the statute. Rather \nthey are asking for a pause until the authorization work can be \ncompleted.\n  It should be noted that the committee with jurisdiction here in the \nSenate, through the efforts of Senator Kempthorne of Idaho, and others, \nhas made a valiant effort to move this authorization forward. But until \nit is reauthorized, we should not continue to act. Abuses that has been \nheaped upon many Americans as a result of this act should be stopped.\n  The underlying amendment by Senator Reid would lift the moratorium \naccepted and adopted by this Congress last year. Senator Reid would \njust take it away, saying that proper authorizations for public \npolicies are unnecessary.\n  The second-degree amendment by Senators Hutchison and Kempthorne \nwould maintain the original moratorium, but with some changes. It would \nnow only affect final listings and critical habitat designations. This \nmeans it will permit emergency listings to go forward if the well-being \nof a species is at significant risk. This is a major change because it \nwill permit activities to go forward, but they just cannot take the \nfinal action. Again, I think that this is common sense and responsible.\n  There are very few areas where my constituents get absolutely livid \nat what is happening in America--but this is one. We have lost control \nof this act. Congress needs to rethink it. Congress needs to correct \nthe problem. We can protect truly genuinely endangered species but we \nhave gotten down to the area of subspecies--down to single blades of \ngrass, this does not reflect our original intent. It appears that only \nCongress can refocus the basic statute that a bureaucracy has taken \nover.\n  So I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at what is going on \nacross America, as well as what is being proposed here. We should not \nlift the Endangered Species Act moratorium without a proper \nreauthorization. Nor should we allow the abuses to continue.\n  We should support the commonsense proposal by Senator Hutchison. It \nis the right thing to do. It will give Congress time to do the \nreauthorization without impacting emergency listings. So I commend her \nfor what she is trying to do. And I urge the adoption of the amendment \nby Senators Hutchison and Kempthorne. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition this morning to \ncomment briefly about the significant amendment which was enacted \nyesterday adding funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, the subcommittee of Appropriations that I \nchair, and to say at the outset, again, my compliments to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who is the ranking \nDemocrat on the subcommittee, for his tireless work and the work of his \nstaff, as well as my\n\n[[Page S1914]]\n\nstaff, in crafting that legislation in a bipartisan compromise. But I \nam very fearful that if the partisan bickering and the political \ncredit-taking continues, we are going to jeopardize our chance to see \nthat amendment as the cornerstone of this omnibus appropriations bill \ngo through in the House of Representatives and be signed by the \nPresident, so that it becomes law.\n  We have seen political gridlock in Washington in the hours of the \npast many months of an unprecedented nature. We have seen the \nGovernment close down twice, and we have seen the American people \nrecoiling in disgust at the kind of fighting for political advantage \nwhich is taking place in this city. I believe that it is a matter for \nblame to be equally proportioned, 50 percent on each side of this \naisle.\n  I think that what the American people are looking for is to have an \naccommodation and to work out these differences of opinion so that we \ncan keep the Government going and not have another shutdown, and work \nin the interests of the American people.\n  Yesterday, Senator Harkin and I submitted a bill which we had worked \non jointly in accordance with our responsibilities as chairman and \nranking member of that subcommittee and on which we had reached a good-\nfaith, bipartisan compromise. And there was a very, very strong vote in \nthis body--84 to 16--an unusually strong vote on an issue which is as \nhighly contested as that one was yesterday, or what would be expected. \nAnd 37 of 53 Republicans joined in supporting that expenditure, \nalthough there were many questions as to whether that was a wise \napproach in the overall matter, because we are looking for a settlement \non the overall budget dispute. But those differences were laid aside in \nthe interest of funding for education, for health, and for labor and \nplant safety, to get that done.\n  No sooner was the issue resolved on the Senate floor than we had back \nto usual political posturing--taking credit for what had been done in a \nvery, very partisan way. Today's New York Times quotes one Member of \nthe Senate on the opposite side of the aisle saying--and this is \nattributed--``Many of our Republican friends that have been reluctant \nto indicate their support for this, really fell over themselves to \nsupport this measure.''\n  Well, that is not so, Mr. President. There has been a lot of \nRepublican support for education--both on the subcommittee with Senator \nJeffords being the leader for education funding, and Senator Domenici, \nas well as my own participation. When an amendment was offered on the \nother side of the aisle several weeks ago to add substantial money for \neducation, it received 51 votes, and there were many on the Republican \nside of the aisle who joined there.\n  Then that Member is quoted going on to say, ``They expected \nRepublicans in the House to bridle at the agreement, but they predicted \nthat the overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate for the White \nHouse stance on the issue would help them prevail in the final \nlegislation.''\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that would be the case, and I still hope \nthat will be the case. But I am not so sure when we have this kind of \npolitical credit-taking by Democrats for what was clearly a bipartisan \nmovement. It is a move headed by Senator Harkin and myself. It is a \nmove that received an 84-to-16 vote with 37 Republican Senators \nsupporting the measure. If we are going to go back to politics as usual \nand a claim of credit by the Democrats, I think this is going to be a \nvery, very hard matter to hold in conference. There have been some very \nkey legislative proposals that have been defeated this year when \nsomebody crows and takes credit in the political context before the ink \nis dry and before the bill is finally worked through a conference \ncommittee and is finished.\n  Another Member on the other side of the aisle was referenced in the \nWashington Times today saying:\n\n       Senator Arlen Specter, Pennsylvania Republican and coauthor \n     of the amendment, ``knows how politically vulnerable \n     Republicans are on education.''\n\n  That is not true, Mr. President. When a reference is made to what \nArlen Specter knows, the best source is Arlen Specter. I do not believe \nthat Republicans are any more vulnerable than Democrats on these \nvolatile issues of public policy. I think the American people are \ncoming to the conclusion that they ought to throw out all of the \nincumbents because of dissatisfaction for what is going on and the \npolitical infighting and political bickering which leads to gridlock.\n  When we work through a very, very tough, bipartisan amendment and \naccomplish the goals of adequate funding for education and do it in a \nway which protects the balanced budget concept, because there are \noffsets on all of these lines, I would ask for a moratorium on the \npolitical infighting and the political credit-taking so that we can get \non with the business of the American people.\n  There is an old saying that ``a lot could be accomplished in \nWashington, DC, if people were not too concerned about who got credit \nfor what was being undertaken.'' I would say to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle that we ought to tone down the political rhetoric \nand we ought to get on with the business of the country. What we have \nhanging in the balance from the additional funding which we passed \nyesterday of $814 million for title I school districts, which is very \nvital for education in America, is: $182 million for school-to-work \nprograms; we have some $200 million for safe and drug-free school \nprograms; we have some $635 million for summer youth job training; we \nhave very substantial funding for training for dislocated workers, a \nmatter of enormous importance in America today with a downsizing of \nAmerican business. All of this is in jeopardy if we are going to go \nback to crass politics and political credit-taking and political \nbickering as usual.\n  I anticipate great concerns in the House of Representatives when they \nexercise their legislative discretion. In the United States, we have a \nbicameral form of government. We have the views of the Senate. We have \nthe views of the House. I have great respect for what the House of \nRepresentatives has to say.\n  This kind of political bantering, political dialog, and political \ncredit-taking is going to be very, very difficult to deal with, because \nI expect to hear all about it when we go to conference with the House \nof Representatives. They have their own points of view. They have their \nconstituencies. They are elected on a 2-year basis. They have certain \ncommitments that they have made. This does not help the process at all.\n  So, it is my hope that the political rhetoric and the political \ncredit-taking will be toned down as we move ahead to try to get this \nomnibus appropriations bill completed.\n  Mr. President, beyond this omnibus appropriations bill, it is my hope \nthat the leadership and the Government coming from the President, the \nadministration, and the leaders of the Congress will go back to the \nbargaining table and try to work out an overall global settlement. We \nare about to undertake now the appropriations process for fiscal year \n1997. We are already scheduling the appearances of the Secretary of \nEducation, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the \nSecretary of Labor for the fiscal year 1997 budget. It is a little hard \nto look to the next year's budget when we have not even completed this \nyear's budget.\n  We were able to have this revenue-neutral on a tough vote for many \nSenators, Democrats as well as Republicans, because we offset it \nagainst expenditures which are available only on a one-time basis. \nThere had been talk on a global settlement where we addressed the issue \nof entitlements and had savings there. There might be as much as $10 \nbillion available for the issues arising out of the Department of \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education. If we are to find a \nway to have a budget which can be adopted for fiscal year 1997, again \nlooking to the concerns of education, we are going to need a global \nsettlement. If we have the same allocation, 602(b) allocation for my \nsubcommittee, for next year as we had for last year when we go through \nthe budget resolution, I do not know how it will be possible to find \nlight at the end of the tunnel to add the kind of money which we added \nyesterday in the amendment. And we are looking to a very, very tough \npolitical season.\n  My thought is that, if the Congress of the United States and the \nadministration cannot come to terms, it is not\n\n[[Page S1915]]\n\nonly going to be bad public policy for the schoolchildren who very \nbadly need the money which we passed in the Senate yesterday and hope \nwe can get through conference, but what will happen in fiscal year \n1997? It is not going to get any easier as we move from March into \nApril, May through to October and November. So it is my hope that the \npeople who have been negotiating on that overall budget global \nsettlement will come to terms, or I think we are all going to have \nhavoc to pay when we look to fiscal year 1997.\n  But first things first. Let us focus on the bill which is currently \non the floor. Let us try to get the job done without rushing to take \nthe credit.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, for his outstanding work \nand leadership on this important matter and for setting a bipartisan \ntone which, if carried out by all Members in this body on both sides of \nthe aisle, I think will lead us to sound public policy for the \neducation interests and the labor interests, the funding of Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education programs.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator in the Chamber, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3482 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for important environmental initiatives \n                            with an offset)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this morning, I send an amendment to \nthe desk for myself, Senator Mikulski, Senator Daschle, Senator John \nKerry, Senator Kennedy, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Levin, and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself, \n     Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n     Lieberman, and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 3482 \n     to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment has a very simple task, \nI think a very important task, and that is to restore funding for a \ncritical national priority, and that is the protection of America's \nenvironmental heritage.\n  There is broad support for protecting our environment. Americans \nacross the country want to drink clean water. They want to breathe \nclean air. They do not want to live near toxic waste sites that pose \nhealth risks to their families, regardless of whether they are urban or \nrural dwellers and regardless of the region of the country. \nUnfortunately, despite the public's commitment to environmental \nprotection, this Congress has mounted a full-scale attack on our \nenvironment. The contract on America may not have mentioned the \nenvironment, but deep in the recesses of the presentation is a full-\nscale attack on our environment.\n  The contract on America does not have to mention it, but the signers \nof the contract appear committed to doing everything possible to gut \nenvironmental protection. First, the House of Representatives passed a \nseries of riders on the EPA appropriations bill to essentially repeal \nlaws protecting our air, our water, our land, and our families. Also in \nthat legislation, EPA's budget, already underfunded, was cut by a third \nfrom the 1995 funding level, and more riders were added on the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  One banned new listings of endangered species. Another rider \nessentially turned over the old growth forests to private timber \ninterests. And then the House passed changes to the Clean Water Act. \nThat bill dramatically weakened EPA's enforcement authority, wrote off \nthe Nation's valuable wetlands, and included numerous other provisions \napparently drafted not by legislators but by lobbyists for corporate \npolluters. Bills have also been introduced to cripple the Clean Air \nAct, to weaken our program for cleaning up toxic waste sites, and to \nexempt various industries from critical environmental regulation.\n  Another legislative proposal which passed the Senate would weaken \nsomething called the community right-to-know law. I am the author of \nthat law, and it has been on the books for some time. It simply \nrequires polluters to tell the public the truth about emissions that \ncome from their place of business. It has been responsible for a 46-\npercent decrease in toxic emissions in 4 years. It has been a smashing \nsuccess, as they say, and yet a rider to the omnibus regulatory reform \nbill would gut that law and allow any company to easily remove \nchemicals from the listing requirement.\n  As one can see, the list of congressional attacks on our environment \ngoes on and on, and it is a source of great concern to millions of \nAmericans. A poll, a Republican poll, commissioned by the Republican \nParty, by Linda DiVall, showed that only 35 percent of the voters would \nsupport a candidate who supported the one-third cut in EPA funding \nproposed by the House Republicans. Mind you, a Republican poll showed \nthat only 35 percent of those who vote would be willing to support a \ncandidate who supported this one-third cut in EPA funding. That is \nquite a revelation.\n  The same poll showed that while 6 out of 10 Americans say there is \ntoo much Government regulation, generally only 2 in 10 believe that the \nstatement applies to EPA. The public, even those who consider \nthemselves Republicans, do not trust their party on the issue of the \nenvironment.\n  In years past, I have been proud to work closely with many of my \nRepublican colleagues to pass strong and effective environmental \nlegislation. Frankly, I look forward to that opportunity this day. I \nknow that there are Members from the other side of the aisle who care \nabout the environment that we are leaving to our children and our \ngrandchildren. We want to leave them the best, the cleanest available.\n  I wish to single out for commendation the distinguished Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Bond], chairman of the subcommittee on EPA and NASA and \nthe Veterans Administration, who has made a serious effort to increase \nfunding for EPA over the proposals that came from the House. He has had \nto deal with an inadequate 602(b) allocation from the Budget Committee. \nHe has worked hard within these constraints, and he deserves real \ncredit for that.\n\n  Unfortunately, despite his efforts and despite the efforts of the \nranking member of this subcommittee, Senator Mikulski from Maryland, \nlaboring hard to try to improve the funding, because of the inadequate \nfunding in the Republican budget for almost all domestic needs, the \nfunding in this bill for environmental protection is just not enough to \ndo the job. And, although better than proposals from the House, the \nlegislation would require real cuts in critical environmental programs. \nCompared to last year's budget, even after the enactment of the \nRepublican rescissions bill, the bill before us would cut EPA by over \n11 percent.\n  So, my amendment proposes to restore funding for the environment to \nbring EPA's budget back up to, essentially, last year's level after the \nrescission.\n  And, perhaps most importantly, the amendment will add $365 million \nfor States to fund sewage treatment and drinking water programs through \nState revolving funds.\n  Our State and local governments need these funds to meet Federal \nstandards related to the control of sewage waste and to ensure safe \ntapwater. States leverage this money so its real value will be many \ntimes the amount appropriated. Yet the needs are enormous. Local \ngovernments need to meet Clean Water Act mandates that will cost over \n$100 billion. So this is not the time to be stingy with aid. It is \ncritical to many hard-pressed communities and to citizens who rely on \nsafe drinking water coming from their taps.\n  In addition to the $365 million to keep our water clean, my amendment \nincludes various other provisions that will improve our environment. \nThese include $50 million more for the\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nSuperfund Program to clean up toxic waste sites, and success and \nprogress can be directly measured there. But what is going to happen as \na result of the funding levels that we presently have is we will be \nshutting down work on sites that had begun, that show some promise for \ncleanup. That will grind to a halt.\n  We have $62 million for environmental technology to do the research \nnecessary to find different ways and more effective ways to treat the \nenvironment.\n  We have $75 million for the Department of Energy included in here, \nfor its excellent weatherization program which will provide \nweatherization grants for 12,000 homes, and give people a chance to \nprotect themselves against the cold so they do not have to spend as \nmuch for fuel and also do not add to the consumption levels.\n\n  Mr. President, we have $75 million for the National Park Service, to \nstop the degradation that is taking place in our national parks. The \nNational Park Service needs money. It needs staff. It needs resources \nto keep these parks up to the level that makes them available and makes \nall of us proud about these national monuments.\n  There is also $5 million to advance research for methyl bromide \nreplacements. Methyl bromide causes nausea, headaches, convulsions, and \nultimately death in some cases. Research in this area is badly needed.\n  Unlike the underlying bill, which provides funds on the assumption \nthat Congress and the President reach some type of budget deal, this \namendment has sufficient offsets so that we can immediately get on with \nour efforts to protect the environment.\n  First, the amendment includes legislation, proposed by the \nadministration and adopted in the House reconciliation bill, that will \nimprove the Federal Government's ability to collect delinquent debts. \nThe Federal Government is owed almost $50 billion in nontax debts. We \nsimply have to do a better job of collecting them.\n  The other offset included in the amendment calls for the sale of \nGovernors Island in New York harbor. This also enjoys broad bipartisan \nsupport and was included in the House reconciliation bill. Governors \nIsland is no longer going to be used as a Coast Guard station as it has \nbeen for so many years. It is now deemed to be inefficient and \nunnecessary as a place for the Coast Guard. With these offsets, our \namendment is budget neutral.\n  Our Nation has made enormous progress since the environmental \nmovement was ignited by Earth Day in 1970. Environmental laws have made \nour water safer to drink, cleaned up our oceans and rivers, made the \nair cleaner, and protected our land from dangerous waste disposal \npractices. This is no time to turn back.\n  Because of our work, there have been measurable improvements in our \nair and our water. In 1975, 60 percent of our waters--streams, \ntributaries--did not meet water quality standards. Today, only 40 \npercent fail that test. That is a remarkable improvement, and we can \ncontinue to build on that. But if we let it slip back, it does not take \nlong for pollution to take over.\n  Thanks to our environmental laws there is now a generation of \nchildren in many parts of the country who have no conception about the \nterrible air pollution that spoiled our air not too long ago. Even our \nbiggest cities have fewer days of unhealthy air pollution than they did \n20 years ago, despite economic growth and population increases. Lead \nhas been taken out of gasoline, which has had a significant positive \nimpact on children's mental health. Today, ambient levels of lead are \ndown 89 percent since 1984.\n\n  Sulfur dioxide concentrations in urban areas are down 26 percent \nsince 1984, improving the ability of people with asthma and other \nrespiratory diseases to lead normal lives.\n  Carbon monoxide levels are down 37 percent since 1984, largely due to \ncleaner cars and fuels, and more effective vehicle inspection and \nmaintenance programs. These gains have come while the number of cars \nand vehicle miles has grown substantially.\n  Ozone levels have dropped since 1984, so 43 million fewer Americans \nnow must breathe unhealthy ozone levels.\n  These advances occurred because this Congress passed the laws to make \nit happen, not in recent sessions, but over the years, and because we \nprovided the funding to do the job. We made an investment in the \nenvironment and that investment has paid handsome returns. But now, if \nwe back off on our commitment to the environment, successes of the past \nno doubt will be reversed in short order.\n  The environmental challenges of the future are substantial and in \nmany ways more difficult than those of the past. We need to control \nemissions from many smaller businesses, something not easy to implement \nor to police. We will need to develop new technologies and we need to \ndevelop alternative approaches to controlling pollution. All of these \nrequire a real commitment of resources. That fact cannot be wished away \nor ignored.\n  We have heard it said many times that we need to balance the budget \nbecause we are piling debt upon our children. But what about the \nenvironment we are leaving to our kids? In my view, and the view of the \nAmerican people, the environment simply must be a national priority. We \ncan agree on balancing the budget and at the same time making certain \nthat we provide a cleaner environment for our future generations. If we \nwant to balance the budget we ought to find other ways to do it than \nrestricting environmental cleanup activities.\n  This amendment would simply maintain funding for environmental \nprotection at about the same level as last year's budget, after the \nrescission. I think it is a modest and certainly a reasonable proposal. \nI hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support it.\n  Mr. President, we all ought to agree here, and we will agree when we \ncast our votes, that the environment is a priority for those of us who \ncan do something about it. We have to decide here and now what it is \nthat we want to leave for our kids by way of environmental protection. \nDo we want them to be able to breathe the air without getting sick? Do \nwe want them to be able to go to the water tap? Sales of bottled water \nin this country continue to escalate. I am sure, when the original \nsettlers came here they never dreamed they could do anything else but \ndrink the water that was naturally available, and now some 40 percent \nof the population is buying bottled water. We ought to be able to \nassure people that, when kids go to the tap to take a drink, they are \nnot jeopardizing their health, nor is the ground they are playing on \ndangerous for their well-being.\n  Those are the decisions we are going to make with this amendment, Mr. \nPresident. I hope that all of our friends on both sides of the aisle, \nRepublican and Democrat, will agree that while we can discuss budget \npriorities, at the same time we can agree that we want to send a \nmessage on a cleaner environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Lautenberg and \nother of my colleagues in offering this amendment to restore critical \nreductions taken in the funding for environmental programs. I \ncompliment the Senator from New Jersey for his steadfast advocacy on \nthe environment, and I look forward to working with him on these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. President, we in Maryland are budget weary. We have been battered \nby the budget, we have been battered by floods, and we have been \nbattered by the shutdowns that have occurred. What has been so terrible \nabout the shutdowns that have occurred is that they have shut down our \nability to enforce America's vital, crucial environmental protection \nlaws relating to Superfund, safe drinking water, clean water, to be \nable to help our people be in a safe environment and help local \ncommunities.\n  The full committee and the subcommittee chairmen, Senators Hatfield \nand Bond, have taken important steps by restoring $240 million in real \nmoney to this omnibus CR. This important effort, I think, will move us \nbeyond this weariness that we have with shutdowns. I hope that at the \nend of this week, we have not shut down the Federal Government, we have \nnot shut down the Environmental Protection Agency, and we have not shut \ndown our ability to enforce public health and\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nsafety, nor that we have shut down the funding to go to environmental \ncontractors.\n  But the fact remains that despite the efforts of the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and the chairman of the Subcommittee on VA and \nEPA, this appropriation, this CR continues to be $750 million below the \n1995 level. It is the defunding of EPA. That is unacceptable to us on \nthis side of the aisle, and it is unacceptable to the American people.\n  The American people want clean air, clean drinking water, they want \ncontaminated and hazardous waste sites cleaned up, and they want their \nlocal communities to have the resources to provide wastewater and clean \nwater to these communities.\n  The American people are absolutely opposed to efforts to weaken the \nenvironmental laws and are opposed to budget and staffing cuts that do \nthat.\n\n  There was a recent poll that showed that 46 percent of the American \npeople want no changes in either clean or safe drinking water.\n  When we talk about the impact on these budget cuts, this has a \ntremendous impact not only on local communities and on public health \nand public safety, but it absolutely has a direct impact on business.\n  A recent study by the University of Maryland's Jacobs Center, which \nis a business evaluation center, said that businesses are concerned \nthat cuts to regulatory agencies lead to delays in permitting, and \npoorly trained staff also lead to a delay in permitting, which is a \ndelay to business.\n  In my home State of Maryland, good environment is good business. That \nis why we have been such strong supporters of the Chesapeake Bay \nProgram and the cleanup of important rivers and polluted rivers, like \nBack River. So the American people do not want any more cuts in EPA, \nand neither do I.\n  This amendment restores $738 million and puts us at 1995 levels. It \nis essentially a freeze on EPA, but it does restore funds to implement \nthose important standards.\n  It also does something else. This amendment restores programs \nrelating to the environmental technologies initiative. That is an \ninitiative to spur, working with the private sector, new technologies, \nnew products that we can manufacture in the United States and sell \noverseas.\n  Mr. President, these environmental cuts have a great impact on the \nUnited States of America and its citizens, but also this has a great \nimpact on our national reputation. The world is coming to the United \nStates of America for our environmental expertise in Government and its \nform of regulation, in terms of academia, in terms of its scientific \nresearch on the environment and in terms of a private sector that has \ndeveloped techniques and products in manufacturing biotechnology to \nclean up the environment.\n  What we want to do in this legislation is to restore the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to do this. To keep the funding cuts, I \nbelieve, will have a devastating effect on American citizens and will \nbe a loss of national honor, as well as a national opportunity to go \nglobal.\n  This national opportunity will enable us to take our environmental \nexpertise that the world wants access to and to go around the world \ngiving out information, ideas, science and actual products.\n  We talk a lot in this U.S. Senate about how we need to have good jobs \nat good wages. I believe the frontier to do that is in the field of \nenvironment, using the expertise of EPA, working with America's \nacademic institutions, encouraging these new technologies in the \nprivate sector. If we do that, we will not only protect our \nenvironment, but we will also be able to create jobs and be able to \nhave an important contribution internationally.\n  So I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will support the Lautenberg-\nMikulski-Lieberman and Kerry amendment to restore these cuts to EPA. We \nbelieve we have sound offsets to be able to do it, and I believe then \nwe can move this process forward.\n  Again, I thank the chairman of the full committee, Senator Hatfield, \nand the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bond, for taking the \nfirst step by restoring the $240 million. We look forward now to taking \nthe next step to put EPA at the 1995 levels.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their attention, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I particularly want \nto thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from New Jersey, \nSenators Mikulski and Lautenberg, for their leadership and efforts to \ntry to guarantee that we have a sensible environmental policy in this \ncountry.\n  What is really astonishing is that this is the 10th time this year \nthat we are debating the environmental programs of this country, the \n10th time we are debating the 1996 budget. We are now in the sixth \nmonth of the current fiscal year, and we are setting a historic first \nfor the United States of America. In the 11 years that I have been in \nthe U.S. Senate, never--never once--have we had to go into a succeeding \nfiscal year and still be debating the items of the last fiscal year.\n  I would say, without any question at all, that the responsibility \nthat fell to the majority last year or the year before, when they won \nthe election, has really not been discharged properly. I remember when \nwe were in the majority, in the last occasion of 1994, all 13 \nappropriations bills were passed on time. Whatever compromises were \nnecessary in order to achieve that, we understood the Constitution of \nthis country, we understood the nature of the system.\n  What has really happened here in Washington in 1995 and 1996 is that \na small band of radicals in the House of Representatives have \nfundamentally hijacked the Constitution of this country. In the name of \nideological purity and of their particular point of view, they have \ndisavowed the balance of power between the executive and the \nlegislature. They have taken into their own hands their own definition \nof timing.\n  They are breaking the law, Mr. President. They are breaking the law. \nThe law says that these bills will be accomplished by a specific point \nin time. They have not been.\n  So we are here for the 10th time debating where we are going. People \nwill say, ``Well, the President won't agree.'' Well, the President has \nthe veto power. That is what the Founding Fathers gave him, and when \nthe President has the veto power, and there is not a sufficient \npolitical force in the country to undermine whatever sustaining \ncapacity there is in the Congress with that veto, then the President \ngets to have that balance.\n  The reality is, you are supposed to compromise. But that is not what \nis happening. I think it is very unfortunate for all concerned. I know \nthat there are moderates on the Republican side, many in the Senate, \nwho are uncomfortable with what is happening, who do not agree with it, \nwho would rather see the Congress of the United States do its business. \nI think it is entirely inappropriate for the country to pay the price \nfor this small group in the House of Representatives.\n  It is revealing that while a certain group of appropriations bills \nhave made it into law, it is revealing that the bills that fund the \nagencies with primary responsibility for the environment and our \nnatural resources, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nDepartment of Interior, have not been signed into law. I think, Mr. \nPresident, that the fact that those particular bills have not been \nsigned into law underscores the clash of priorities that is evidenced \nin the Republican approach to the funding of those bills and the \nDemocratic approach.\n  The fact that the Republican leadership is still fighting for large \ncuts in environmental programs is, in my judgment, an indication that \nthey are not in touch with the real concerns of the American people and \ntheir desire for clean air and clean water. The response from some will \nquickly be, ``Wait a minute. Of course we're in touch. Being in touch \nmeans you balance the budget. We have shown that you can balance the \nbudget.'' But you do not have to do it at the expense of these \nenvironmental programs.\n  So, in the final analysis, it really comes down to a fundamental \nconfrontation between choices--the choices you make to balance the \nbudget. And the choices that you make to balance the budget are the \nfinal evidence of your priorities and of your values.\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\n  That is why, Mr. President, I am here once again in this 10th series \nof efforts on the environment with Senator Lautenberg and Senator \nMikulski and others, to speak in support of increasing the funding for \nspecific environmental programs. What we are seeking to do is to add \nback over $900 million for environmental programs at four Federal \nagencies--at the Environmental Protection Agency, at the Department of \nEnergy, at the Agriculture and Interior Departments. It is our judgment \nthat this money is critically needed in order to fully protect \nAmerica's health and safety at a level that Americans have come to \nexpect and that they believe is their right.\n  Mr. President, if we succeed in passing an omnibus spending bill, we \nare going to set the environmental budget for the EPA through the end \nof this fiscal year. If we pass a bill that includes environmental \nfunding increases in this amendment, all we will have succeeded in \ndoing is bringing us back to last year's level of protection. I think \nAmericans need to understand that.\n\n  This is not a Democrat effort to try to add huge sums of money, even \nthough many of us believe that in certain areas we ought to be spending \nmore. This is simply an effort to hold our citizens harmless from a \nreduction below the level that we were at last year.\n  If, however, this amendment is defeated, Congress will have turned \nits back and turned the clock back on some 25 years of environmental \ngains. Ironically, for 19 of the last 25 years, Republicans were in \ncharge of the EPA. It was Richard Nixon who signed into law the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and delivered protection of the \nenvironment as a national priority. I think it is particularly ironic \nthat after George Bush joined with us to help sign into effect the \nClean Air Act, and after the many efforts of the last years that have \nbeen bipartisan, that we are suddenly thrown into this partisan clash \nover whether or not we can keep the funding at last year's level.\n  Regrettably, our friends on the other side of the aisle have made a \ndifferent choice, and it is different from what most Americans are \ntelling us that they want. I think almost every poll in the country has \nshown that Americans want to protect their environment: they want \ncleaner air, they want cleaner water, they want pristine rivers, they \nwant our ecosystems protected, they want an abundance of species, \nplants, and animals, they want clean beaches and national parks, and \nthey want public lands that are safe and they want them protected. They \nwant cities with breathable air and industries and businesses that are \nwilling to join in the effort to guarantee that these kinds of \nprotections exist.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, you cannot reconcile that stated desire \nof the American people with the budget figures that we are being \npresented. So the central question in this debate is really: What \npriority do you place on protecting the Nation's environment and \nnatural resources and the health of our citizens?\n  I am confident that we are going to hear Senators on the other side \nof the aisle say, ``I take no second seat to anybody in the country on \nprotecting the environment.'' We will hear Senators say, ``Let's not \nkid ourselves; nobody is against the environment. Nobody wants to have \nbad water,'' and so forth. It is fine to say that, Mr. President, but \nif you are in favor of cutting inspections, if you are in favor of \ncutting a community's ability to be able to provide that clean water, \nif you are voting for an amendment or a bill that reduces the \ncommitment from last year, even though no American is asking for a \nreduction except for some companies, it is very hard to follow through \nand say, you are, in truth, voting for what you are talking about.\n  That is the real difference here. What are you voting for? What are \nyou putting into the budget? What numbers do you really support? While \nthe bill that is being brought to the floor is an improvement from the \nconference report, it is still a budget that is hundreds of millions of \ndollars below the level that most people in good conscience and good \nfaith have decided is necessary in order to continue the level that we \nhave committed to the American people.\n  In addition to that, Mr. President, the bill contains a series of \nlegislative riders that cripple the EPA's ability to be able to protect \nthe Nation's wetlands, which is precisely what some people want to do. \nThey have never liked the wetlands protection. They want to develop \nwetlands, and they do not care about the standards. So they are \nintentionally setting out to cripple it. And it would also halt the \nDepartment of Energy's work on setting energy efficiency standards for \nappliances.\n  Mr. President, we have, as I have said before--but I think it needs \nrepeating again and again--shown that you can balance the budget in 7 \nyears without doing what the Republicans are choosing to do here. I \nhope that we will recognize that without restoring some of this \nfunding, the cuts to the EPA are going to deal an extraordinarily harsh \nblow to efforts to be able to protect us.\n  I would like to bring it down to a local level, if I may, Mr. \nPresident, to my State of Massachusetts. We are trying, in this bill, \nto increase the State revolving fund by $365 million over what the \nRepublicans have provided. Every State will benefit. All cities in each \nof our States that are in need of new infrastructure will benefit by \nadding to the State revolving fund.\n\n  We have communities in Massachusetts, a community like New Bedford, \nfor instance, about 100,000 residents, is building a sewer treatment \nfacility that will cost more than $200 million. It has to build this \nunder Federal law. Yet the tax base is such that the citizens cannot \nreally afford to do that on their own. In the 1980's we had a \npartnership with the Federal Government where the Federal Government \nwould provide anywhere from 55 to 75 percent of the money. That is not \nhappening today. As a result, local communities are being harder and \nharder pressed to be able to try to live up to the standards that we \nhave set at the Federal level. Because they are harder and harder \npressed to do that, they get angrier and angrier over those Federal \nstandards and begin to blame the standards themselves.\n  What happens here, you get caught in a vicious circle. People begin \nto lose their commitment to the standards and to wanting to clean up \nbecause they feel oppressed by them. The reason they feel oppressed by \nthem is they are required to do things they do not have enough money to \ndo. The reason they do not have enough money to do it is the Federal \nGovernment has pulled out of the partnership and taken away the help \nthat was given in the 1970's and the 1980's. That happened, as we all \nremember, in 1982 when Ronald Reagan came along and stripped away title \nII of the Clean Water Act and left the mandate. All of a sudden the \nanger was directed at mandates\n  Mr. President, we desperately need that kind of funding assistance. \nIn a city like Fall River, a partner city to New Bedford, you have a \nsimilar sort of tax base, similar difficulties. You have a combined \nsewer overflow problem which the community desperately needs to be able \nto refurbish, rehabilitate the sewer overflows, 100-year-old \ninfrastructure, a current population, and the current population is \nrequired to pay for the next 100 years. That is not fair. You have to \ntry to spread that out.\n  Nowhere is that more felt, Mr. President, than in the city of Boston \nwhere we are living under a court order, Federal mandate, Federal court \norder, that you have to go ahead and clean up the harbor; at the same \ntime, put in a secondary treatment facility for water, billions of \ndollars of expenditure. So the citizens of our State and city have seen \na 40 percent increase in their water rates in the last few years. It \nhas gone up to about $618 per family and will go up to $800. This \ndrives out business, drives down the value of property, and most \nimportantly, it is just impossible for the average family, already \nstruggling on a lower income, to be able to pay these increasing costs.\n  Once again, what is the result? The result is people get angry at the \nmandate, even though it is a legitimate mandate that you have clean \nwater. The result is we begin to lose the consensus in this country to \nbe able to do these things.\n  Mr. President, in the 1970's and 1980's, many communities got money \nto the tune of 90 percent, 75 percent, 55 percent of their project \nbeing paid for by the Federal Government. In 1996, Boston has received \na total of 18 percent\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\nfunding, contrary to the 55 percent, 75 percent, 90 percent of years \npast. Even President Bush saw fit to put $100 million each year into \nour budget to help us with that. We desperately need the State \nrevolving funds and those kind of commitments. That is an example of \none State. That can be replicated all across this country. There are \nother communities in need of additional money.\n  Mr. President, there is another area that is a concern. That is the \narea of the funding for the cleanup of toxic waste sites. This bill \nprovides an increase, for which we are obviously grateful, over the \nconference report which devastated this program. Our amendment would \nrestore an additional $50 million to the Superfund which is still \nseveral hundred million dollars below what the President of the United \nStates has asked for. Now, while our amendment is not everything we \nwould have liked, we believe what the Republicans are doing will slow \nthe cleanups. It will continue to stall cleanup efforts in communities \nthat have very, very patiently waited for Federal intervention.\n\n  Let me just share with my colleagues a story that I think underscores \nwhy this is so important. The toxic waste cleanups are critical to our \nability to be able to provide the fundamental protection that our \ncitizens are looking for. There was a young man in Woburn, MA, named \nJimmy Anderson who got sick from a contaminated well in Woburn. He died \nfrom lymphocytic leukemia in 1981. His story underscores why this $50 \nmillion is important. About 30 years ago, his mother, Ann, suspected \nthat something was wrong and that their water was bad because it \nsmelled bad. She went to authorities and said, ``There is something \nwrong with our water.'' The authorities just said, ``No, don't worry \nabout it. It's OK. It will be all right.'' Then in 1972 her son Jimmy \ngot sick. Despite her concerns, the wells that they were drinking from \nremained in use until 1979, when an environmental inspection that was \ntriggered by a totally different event revealed that in those wells \nthere were, indeed, high levels of toxins.\n  Eventually, other leukemia victims came forward. It turned out that \nbetween 1966 and 1986 there were 28 cases of leukemia among Woburn \nchildren with victims concentrated in the two sections that were served \nby those wells. Now, investigations revealed when they analyzed the \nwater, that there were whole lagoons of arsenic, chromium, and lead \nthat were discovered on a tract of land that had once housed a number \nof chemical plants, and from a nearby abandoned tannery that had left \nbehind a huge mound of decades-old rotting horse hides that gave off a \nsmell that commuters used to call the Woburn odor as they drove by.\n  I say to my colleagues, before we rush into adopting a budget that is \ngoing to reduce the level of inspections and give us more Jimmy \nAndersons, why do we not just stop and think about what the \nenvironmental protection effort is trying to achieve and what it has \nachieved in its previous years. Jimmy Anderson's mother came to \nCongress to testify. This is what she said: ``It is difficult for me to \ncome before you today but I do so with the realization that industry \nhas the strength, influence, and resources that we, the victims, do \nnot. I am here as a reminder of the tragic consequence of uncontrolled \ntoxic waste and the necessity of those who are responsible for it, to \nassume that responsibility.''\n  Mr. President, in no uncertain terms, the budget that the Republicans \nare offering empowers those polluters and takes away the \nresponsibility. The budget that we are offering tries to hold those \npeople accountable and provide power to the victims.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that in the hours ahead we can find the same \nkind of bipartisan coalition that we found yesterday on education. This \nshould not be a partisan issue. I regret that there are some who have \nstated their priorities different from other people's.\n  Finally, I hope we will rectify the legislative riders that open up \nmore timbering, that create a greater imbalance in the relationship \nbetween our natural resources and the people of this country. There is \nnothing, frankly, more important, than education. This is part of our \neducation effort. It is also part of our fundamental responsibility to \nthe next generations. I hope we will add the money that is necessary.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Lautenberg \namendment. I also must point out to my colleagues that the partisan \nrhetoric that we are hearing about the environment is reflective of the \nfact that this is an election year. I have listened with great interest \nto some of the wild charges and political claims being made. I keep \nchecking to find if it has anything to do with the measure before the \nSenate. I find, unfortunately, that it has to do more with somebody's \ncampaign than with talking about the issues that are relevant to this \nbill.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts has just denounced the fact that we \nare breaking the law because there has been no appropriation for \nveterans, housing, environment, and space--the main subject areas of \nthe subcommittee I chair. Well, I can tell you, Mr. President, quite \nsimply why there has been no bill passed and signed by the President. \nIt is because the President vetoed the bill that we presented to him \nthat was within the budget allocation and passed by both Houses of \nCongress.\n  I can tell you, also, that beginning last November when we sought to \nwork with the White House to find out what would be acceptable, what we \nneed to do to accommodate their interests, we were stonewalled, \nabsolutely stonewalled. Leon Panetta came and said, ``Well, the only \nway we can sign this bill is to spend $2 billion more.'' This was at a \ntime when the President was stating that he was for a balanced budget. \nHowever, he was asking that we break the budget by $2 billion. He \nvetoed the bill and said we need $2.5 billion. No longer the original \n$2 billion.\n  Mr. President, how much is enough? How much is enough? How far do \nthey want to break the budget? I have fought hard on this bill, and I \nbelieve we have fought responsibly to raise the amount of money \nappropriated for vital environmental cleanup efforts, and within the \nappropriations available to us under the budget agreement, we have done \na good job.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BOND. In this measure before us, we have added additional funds \nand we have put in a provision that if the President will agree to sign \na balanced budget amendment that would make the budget balance in 2002, \nthere will be even more money available for what I regard as a high \npriority, and that is environmental cleanup.\n  My friend from Massachusetts said, ``You are supposed to compromise \nand negotiate.'' Well, on that matter, I agree with him 100 percent. \nBut let me ask my colleagues, Mr. President, if we are supposed to \nnegotiate and compromise, if we are supposed to come to an agreement \nwith the White House, how do you do it when they do not show up? This \nChamber is essentially empty. But this Chamber is just what I have had \nin attempting to deal with the White House--nobody. I have talked to \nthe Agency head, Administrator Browner. I have talked to Ms. McGinty in \nthe White House, head of the Council for Environmental Quality. I have \ntalked to the Vice President. I have talked to OMB director, Alice \nRivlin. I said, ``We want to compromise and work with you to make sure \nwe meet the objectives of the programs funded by this bill.'' We do not \nhave a bill, Mr. President, quite simply, because the President has \nchosen the political tack. His political advisers say it is far better \nto veto and throw hot rhetoric than to sit down calmly and negotiate.\n  I hope the time has come when we are ready to negotiate, because I \nbelieve we have made great progress in the environment in past years. I \nwant to see that continue. I believe the bill before us will continue \nthat progress. I will be happy to work along with the leadership on \nthis side and the leadership on the other side of the aisle to come to \na reasonable compromise that keeps us on our budget goal of balancing \nthe budget, so we do not put the burdens of our debt on future \ngenerations, but which will meet the objectives that are funded in this \nbill in the environmental area.\n  Let me return to the Lautenberg amendment. The Lautenberg amendment \nis about pumping up the rhetoric\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\nand the polarization surrounding environmental issues. I must say that \nthe supporting remarks are completely in that vein. It is not about \nensuring that limited dollars are spent on EPA programs and activities \nwhich most effectively reduce risk to human health and the environment.\n  The Lautenberg amendment includes funding for the administration's \nentire wish list for EPA, totaling $726 million. I would like another \nbillion dollars, too. It is always nice to have that. Maybe the stork \nor the tooth fairy will bring it. I am sure we can spend more money \nwell. But it is not possible, unless we reach other agreements that \nwill lead us to a balanced budget, that we can accomplish that goal and \nput additional sums in.\n  There are additional sums in this measure introduced and presented by \nSenator Hatfield, which will provide more funding when we come to an \nagreement on a balanced budget. The offsets proposed in the Lautenberg \namendment are phony. They are being used in the other Democratic \nleadership amendment to be offered to the bill. How many times can you \ntrod out that same old ghost of imaginary cuts? Imaginary cuts are a \ngreat offset, but they make awful thin soup because there is nothing \nthere.\n  As chairman of the VA-HUD subcommittee, I have worked very hard to \nfund EPA adequately within the very constrained budget allocation \navailable to the subcommittee. The bill before us today increases EPA's \nbudget by $402 million above the conference level, including $240 \nmillion within title I that would be available upon the passage and the \nsigning into law by the President of this bill, and another $162 \nmillion in title IV of the bill, the contingency section. We can spend \nthe $162 million if we reach a broader budget agreement.\n  The total for EPA is $6.1 billion. This, I believe, represents a \ngood-faith effort to meet the administration's concerns, even though \nthey are not willing to discuss those concerns with us or present us \nwith an honest prioritized list of needs and wants.\n  We have made these efforts because we are concerned about the \nenvironment. We have made these efforts, and we have taken these steps \nbecause Members of this body on both sides of the aisle are interested \nin protecting the environment. This is a bipartisan issue.\n  The arguments about the Republican opposition to the environmental \ncleanup are absolute hogwash. It is embarrassing that we have to answer \nthose inane charges on the floor of the Senate. It is appalling to me \nthat someone would come down and make those assertions. But they have \nbeen made, and they are nonsense. They do not deserve further \ndiscussion.\n  The additional funds in title I, which are funded within the \nsubcommittee 602(b) allocation, are provided for State revolving funds, \nfor the Superfund and the enforcement activities, all of which were \nincluded on the administration's wish list. As a matter of fact, they \nwere the first ones mentioned by the Administrator of EPA when I asked \nher to set priorities--assistance to the States for water \ninfrastructure construction, toxic waste cleanups for sites posing real \nand immediate risks, and funding to ensure that there are no employee \nfurloughs or RIF's. Reductions to ongoing contractual support are high \npriorities.\n  Let me be clear. The amount provided in title I--that is not subject \nto contingency. The only contingency is that it be passed by the \nCongress and signed by the President. This appropriation ensures that \nthe EPA does not have to fire or furlough a single employee. And the \nenforcement budget is increased, Mr. President, by $10 million over \nfiscal year 1995, in a year when total funds available for commitments \nby this subcommittee were reduced by 12 percent from the preceding \nyear.\n  We have held EPA at a higher level and even increased the enforcement \nbudget. In addition, this legislation recommends another $162 million \nin title IV, the contingency section, for additional State revolving \nfunds operating programs and a new laboratory facility in the North \nCarolina Research Triangle Park, where EPA space is sadly deficient.\n  This legislation recommends a total of $6.1 billion--just $300 \nmillion, or 4 percent, less than the total fiscal year 1995 actual \nspending level in a bill that is 12 percent overall below. Where did we \nhave to cut? We had to choose priorities. We cut earmarked water and \nsewer projects--the pork that Members love to bring home. Bringing home \nthe bacon is unfortunately a sport that is still popular around here.\n  Last year's appropriations contained some $800 million in these \nbringing home the bacon projects. This bill all but eliminates such \nearmarks.\n  I note that the Senator from Massachusetts, a staunch defender of the \namendment that is being offered, would see funding for his State to go \nup by another $75 million. Certainly it does enhance one's enthusiasm \nfor an amendment. But I will address that part later.\n  H.R. 3019 provides $1.825 billion for State revolving funds. This \nincludes an increase of $100 million over the President's request of \n$500 million for drinking water--State revolving funds to be \ndistributed by a formula based on need--a formula based on need and not \na formula based on who can offer an amendment. It is a formula for \nwhich we hope the Environmental Protection Agency and State agencies \nwill use good, sound science and prioritizing in determining where the \nmoney needs to go.\n  In fiscal year 1995 the States received only $1.235 billion in \nrevolving funds. This year's bill ensures that States will receive \n$1.725 billion, and an additional $100 million if title IV spending is \nreleased; that is, if the President agrees on a balanced budget. That \nwould be an increase of almost 50 percent. The occupant of the chair \nand I have served as Governors. We know where the pedal hits the metal \nand where the rubber hits the road, which is in the States where they \nactually do the cleanup. In Washington we talk about it and we \npontificate about it. It is the States that have to do the cleanup. It \nis the States that take care of the needs of their communities. It is \nthe States that take care of the environmental risk to their citizens. \nAnd we increase that money by 50 percent in this bill.\n  I note that it is especially ironic that the pending amendment seeks \nto add back pork barrel sewer projects. This is not environmental \nprotection so much as old-fashioned parochial political pork. That is \nwhat is involved here.\n  In addition to the State revolving funds this legislation fully funds \nState agency grants. We have recognized that the States have been \nassigned burdensome responsibilities by the Federal Government to \nprotect and clean up the environment. We have tried to provide \nsufficient funds for them to do that despite the budgetary constraints \nunder which we must act.\n  Despite very serious concerns with the Superfund program--and there \nare serious problems with that program, Mr. President, and everybody in \nthis body knows there are problems with it and reservations about \nputting a lot of money into a program which virtually every one agrees \nneeds to be reformed--the legislation before us actually recommends \n$1.263 billion for Superfund, $100 million more than the conference \nagreement. This appropriation would result in an increase in the \ndollars spent on actual cleanups in fiscal year 1995 and would provide \nlevel funding for enforcement activities.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and other proponents of this measure \nhave talked about the slowdown in Superfund. Slowdow is synonymous with \nSuperfund. That is what Superfund has become--a tremendous slowdown \nproject. It has had some tremendous benefits. It has had tremendous \nbenefits for the lawyers who file the lawsuits and argue over who is \ngoing to be responsible. The more money we put in the Superfund the \nmore fees we generate. This is a litigation machine. This is a lawyer's \ndream. The law provides more dollars for lawyers and too little for \ncleanup. We cannot just throw more and more dollars at it without \nchanging the law.\n  If we are serious about the Superfund and toxic site cleanups--and we \nmust be--then we have to reform the program. We are working to reform \nthe Superfund Program so that the money in Superfund goes to what \npeople thought it ought to, and perhaps think it still goes to; that \nis, cleaning up the sites.\n\n  Mr. President, many of the recommendations included in the committee \nreported bill for EPA were made by\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\nthe National Academy of Public Administration. This is a nonpartisan \norganization which was asked by my predecessor, my Democratic colleague \nand ranking Member, Senator Barbara Mikulski, to undertake a report on \nreforming EPA 2 years ago. I want to say once more for the Record that \nSenator Mikulski has been a leader in promoting environmental progress \nand using the best management and the best science to do so, and the \nwork that was done at her request in the National Academy of Public \nAdministration, I think--in common forums away from the political \ndiatribes on the floor and on the hustings--is recognized as the way we \nshould go to make sure that we deal with the threats to health and the \nthreats to the environment from toxic waste.\n  We followed the recommendations in this bill of the National Academy \nof Public Administration. They were presented to Congress almost a year \nago, and they said turn over more responsibility to the States; turn \nover responsibility to the States which have developed capacity over \nthe past 25 years to manage environmental programs. Do not step on \ntheir efforts, if they are doing a good job. If they are not doing a \ngood job, Mr. President, there is every reason to have a Federal agency \nwhich says, ``You are not doing a good enough job.'' If we in Missouri \nwere polluting the air of Illinois, polluting the water of Arkansas or \nMississippi or Louisiana, the national agency should step in. But if we \nare doing the job in Missouri in cleaning up the environment to \nstandards set on a national basis to protect the national health and \nwell being of the environment, then we ought to give the States the \nflexibility to do it.\n  According to NAPA, ``EPA should revise its approach to oversight, \nregarding high-performing States with grant flexibility, reduced \noversight, and greater autonomy.''\n  That sums it up. This is what we have tried to do through the \nappropriations bill. We have even included authority for EPA to begin \nissuing block grants for maximum flexibility. We have tried in this \nbill to get EPA to focus on the areas of highest risk to human health \nand the environment, and to reduce spending for the time being on those \nprograms which produce less bang for the buck, either in terms of the \ncleanup progress or the risk that they are dealing with. Rather than \nspending time organizing press conferences and news events, I believe \nthat EPA should follow the recommendations of NAPA to get its own house \nin order. Despite EPA's claims to support NAPA's recommendations, we \nhave seen little in terms of real change.\n  As I have mentioned before, Mr. President, I have been trying \nunsuccessfully--I have been waiting for 5 months to forge a compromise \nwith the White House within the allocation available to my \nsubcommittee. Since last November I have placed phone calls, I have \nwritten letters, and I have held hearings--nothing, zip, nothing. \nUnfortunately, the White House seemingly has decided that portraying me \nand those on this side of the aisle as antienvironment is a better \npolitical strategy than compromise. My phone calls have not been \nreturned. My letters have not been responded to.\n  I held a hearing on January 26. EPA administrator Carol Browner \nrefused to admit there can--and, indeed, must be--priorities within the \nEPA's budget. The Administrator, when I asked her for her priorities, \nclaimed that the entire $966 million of add-backs demanded by the White \nHouse were critical, including earmarks for sewer construction, the \npork barrel part of it. Is there anything that is more important than \nthe environment? When you cannot set any priorities you do not have any \npriorities. If you refuse to prioritize, to live within a budget, then \nyou do not have any idea of what you are trying to do.\n  Two weeks ago, I held a second hearing on EPA. We heard from former \nEPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus, State environmental commissioners, \nEPA Science Advisory Board members, and others. These witnesses \nconfirmed the importance of setting priorities and reordering spending \nto achieve the most gains for the environment with the available \ndollars. These witnesses recognized that spending was not unlimited and \nthere must be management discipline to ensure we allocate resources \neffectively.\n  Unfortunately, instead of attempts to compromise, we have seen \nnothing but incendiary rhetoric from the administration. Two weeks ago, \nEPA Administrator Carol Browner, at a press event staged by House \nDemocrats, stated that the Republican budget would force her to choose \nbetween setting drinking water standards for cryptosporidium and \ncontrolling toxic water pollution in rivers, lakes, and streams.\n  There is not a shred of truth in that. I think cryptosporidium and \ncontrolling toxic water pollution are top priorities. How come she \ncannot see that? How come she wants to put pork-barrel projects and \ncorporate welfare projects in a budget and say that those are equal in \npriority? They are not establishing any priorities. If they give us \nsome priorities, we will work with them. Let us talk about things that \nreally can clean up the environment.\n  The appropriation for EPA does require EPA to begin to set \npriorities--a novel concept. The National Academy of Public \nAdministration, the General Accounting Office, EPA's own Science \nAdvisory Board, and other experts who have testified before our \ncommittee recognize that EPA should begin to do it, but in no way does \nit force the sort of tradeoff that the Administrator described.\n  Let me get to one of my favorites. I am sure you read or heard or saw \non TV about the President's campaign event in New Jersey. Oh, that was \na bell ringer. The political pundits and spin masters must have been \nrubbing their hands together in glee. He attacked Congress as being \nantienvironment. He accused the Congress of shutting down cleanup at a \nSuperfund site in Wallington, NJ. He pointed out that right next to the \nsite was a school and children were in danger. Why? It was because the \nRepublicans in Congress wanted to subject these children to the dangers \nof toxic waste.\n  We listen to a great commentator named Paul Harvey back in our part \nof the country, and he says, ``Now let me tell you the rest of the \nstory.'' Well, the rest of the story gets pretty interesting because \nwhat he did not say, what the President did not say was that EPA \nchose--not Congress, EPA chose--to slow down the work at that site. We \ngave them the dollars and told them: You set the priorities. You \nprioritize your cleanup dollars to put them into the areas which pose \nthe greatest risks to human health, and do that first.\n  Why did we do that? Why did we do that, Mr. President? Because we had \na GAO study of existing Superfund cleanup actions. This study showed \nthat 32 percent of the sites reflected an immediate threat to human \nhealth and the environment, and those are under present or current land \nuses; 15 percent would not pose any risk to human health in any event; \n50 percent would pose a threat to human health only if they changed the \nland use.\n  Therefore, if you went into an industrial site where they had had \nmanufacturing and transportation and did not clean it up and set up a \nkindergarten playground or a day care center, that would pose a risk. \nSo you do not do that. Fifty percent of them pose no risk to human \nhealth under the current land use. And unless you brought in kids and \nhad them eating the dirt, there would be no human health risks--15 \npercent, no human health risks. Only 30 percent of the taxpayer dollars \nwere being spent on human health risks.\n  So we told EPA: Go out and spend your money where there is a human \nhealth risk. You have more than enough money to do that.\n  So either one of two things, Mr. President. Either EPA decided that \nthe Wallington, NJ, site was not posing a risk to human health, which \nwould have been a vitally important factor that reporters could ask the \nPresident about at his news conference. Or if there was a real risk to \nhuman health and EPA had staged the slowdown to give the President a \npolitical forum. One of two choices. Maybe EPA will tell us which. Did \nthey allow the President to hype as a risk something that was not a \nrisk, or did they slow down funding for something that really was a \nrisk in order to give the President political gain and political \nmileage?\n  Whichever answer, it is not very pleasant. It is not something that I\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\nthink the people of America would tolerate. If there is a risk to human \nhealth, we said we will give you the money; go forward and clean up \nthose risks first. Prioritize them. EPA has a little trouble focusing \non the priorities. It is about time they did.\n  The amount of spending provided in the current continuing resolution \nand in the conference agreement is the same as the fiscal year 1995 \nlevel for actual Superfund cleanups. That is $800 million. And the bill \nbefore us today would increase the Superfund cleanup budget by an \nadditional $100 million, as I have already indicated. We have told EPA \nthey have to prioritize Superfund cleanups--something they have never \ndone in the past--and it needs to be based on real threats to human \nhealth and the environment.\n  If the Wallington, NJ, site where the President staged the press \nevent meets EPA's own risk-ranking process, there is money and that \nsite should receive cleanup funding this year under the terms of the \nbill before us today.\n  The Lautenberg amendment continues the misinformation campaign of the \nWhite House. It seeks to add more funds for programs we have already \nincreased in this bill. It seeks to add funds for programs which are \nnot high priorities such as the environmental technology initiative.\n  The environmental technology initiative has funded private sector \nconferences on energy efficiency lighting. In the past, they have \nfunded studies on how large corporations can save dollars. That is a \ngreat idea if they save dollars by energy efficiency, but for a large \ncorporation, I think that they probably ought to be willing to fund \nthat themselves. We have heard in the past about studies to control and \nstudy bovine emissions and many other areas that may be of scientific \ninterest, although not of great personal interest, I would say.\n  We add back money for funds for enforcement. We have already \nincreased enforcement spending over the fiscal year 1995 level.\n  Now, perhaps most amazingly, the amendment seeks to add funds for \nBoston Harbor when this bill already has $25 million. We did accede to \nthe request of Governor Weld of Massachusetts to continue funding it at \na lower level because of the magnitude of the problem and the fact that \nthey have to have some funding as we phase down the availability of \ndollars. But Boston Harbor has received almost $600 million over the \npast several years, even while such earmarks are not authorized and are \nunfair to thousands of communities which do not receive such largesse.\n  Surely, it cannot be a priority to move one site above every other \nsite in the Nation. We have said that we are making funds available to \nbe allocated on the basis of need, on the basis of sound science. If \nthat, in fact, is such a need and sound science requires it, then money \nwill go there.\n  But, as indicated by the Senator from Massachusetts, there are lots \nof requests in lots of other areas. I have had many, many Members tell \nme about the very difficult situations they face in their States. They \nhave talked about water system supplies, and I said, ``Yes, I \nunderstand that.'' And we have not done a good job in the political \nprocess of determining which of those projects has the highest priority \nneed in terms of science, in terms of human health, and in terms of the \nenvironment. So we put the money into State revolving funds, we put the \nmoney into programs where it will be allocated on the basis of sound \nscience, where it will be allocated on the basis of how much danger is \nposed. That is how the money should be allocated.\n  I believe we can establish decent priorities. Mr. President, if the \nLautenberg amendment goes to a vote, I will oppose it because I believe \nin this bill there is adequate funding for EPA within the constraints \nimposed by the needs to balance the Federal budget. I think it is time \nfor EPA to begin prioritizing and instill management disciplines to \nensure Federal funds are spent effectively on environmental protection \nactivities.\n  There have been encouraging words. I have been approached by the \nDemocratic leadership. I have had a conversation with my ranking member \nand colleague, Senator Mikulski. They have indicated that perhaps we \ncan reach a compromise with the administration. And if the \nadministration does not want to play, we will reach a compromise with \nthe Senate Democratic leadership on what we are going to do. I am tired \nof guessing what the priorities of the administration are.\n  We are more than willing to work in a reasonable manner to allocate \nthe funds that are available and to make sure the EPA and the State \nagencies have the funds they need to move ahead as we work on \nreauthorizing and changing Superfund and other programs. If the \nadministration is serious, if the Democrats are serious, in case they \nhave lost my telephone number, my phone number is 224-5721. I have left \na lot of messages. They have probably been erased from the e-mail \nscreens by now, but I can be reached by fax or by message from the \ncloakroom. I will be waiting for a call.\n  This is serious business. It is time that we end the partisan charges \nthat I think have been totally unwarranted, and talk about how we can \npass a measure which actually provides funding within the budget \nconstraints to do the vitally important environmental cleanup and \nenforcement work that the people of America have a right to expect.\n  Mr. President, because we are hoping there will be further discussion \nof this, we have conferred with the minority side and I have not heard \nobjection. I therefore ask unanimous consent that this amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, seeing no other Member seeking the floor, I \nnow suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending business be set aside so that I might speak for no more than 5 \nminutes on the preceding Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Leahy of Vermont be added \nas a cosponsor of the Lautenberg amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the \nSenator from New Jersey to restore funding for the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of the \nInterior, and the Department of Agriculture.\n  Senator Lautenberg and others have discussed the critical programs of \nenvironmental protection that would be funded by the amendment in some \ndetail. I want to touch very briefly on a few of the key aspects of the \namendment, particularly the provisions related to funding for \ntechnology.\n  First, Senator Lautenberg's amendment adds back a modest amount of \nfunding for environmental technology, $62 million, for a total spending \non environmental technology of $108 million. Unfortunately, the \ncontinuing resolution includes only $46 million for spending in this \ncritical area.\n  Funding for the President's Environmental Technology Initiative, \nwhich is known as ETI, is slashed from his request by 92 percent to \nonly $10 million. Mr. President, the failure of the continuing \nresolution to provide adequate funding for environmental technology is, \nin my opinion, very shortsighted. A small amount of funding on these \nprograms can yield enormous savings for our regulated industries while \nproviding superior protection for all of our citizens.\n  During the current debate on environmental protection, we often hear \nwhat at first appear to be conflicting messages. Some in the electorate \nclearly want less of the overly bureaucratic, heavy-handed command-and-\ncontrol approaches we have turned to too often in the past to protect \nour environment. Those folks want new solutions that rely more on the \nmarketplace. They have a good point.\n  On the other hand, it is clear that the public's commitment to \nprotecting the\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\nenvironment has remained very strong, and understandably so. I was \npleased that at a meeting with my staff recently, representatives of \nthe Connecticut Business and Industry Association affirmed their \nsupport for strong environmental protection laws.\n  Of course, that should not be surprising. Folks who run our \nbusinesses, who are citizens, are as concerned as anyone else about the \nquality of the air they and their families breathe and the water they \ndrink or swim in. They want to be good citizens, good corporate \ncitizens, of our community.\n  What the conflicting messages tell me is that we have to be smarter \nin our approaches to environmental protection, not weaker. That is \nprecisely what the Environmental Protection Agency is working toward in \nits Environmental Technology Initiative.\n  The program is developing and promoting new approaches to regulation \nand new technologies that will increase our efficiency, cut costs, \nexpand exports, and produce a healthy, productive environment for our \ncitizens. Under the Environmental Technology Initiative, EPA is working \nwith the States to streamline permitting processes and to ensure that \nthe permit approval process does not penalize those companies that are \nwilling to try new, cheaper solutions involving technological \nimprovements in order to control pollution. The National Academy of \nPublic Administration's report on improving EPA's programs, mandated by \nthe Appropriations Committee, emphasized the need to eliminate \nregulatory and policy barriers hampering use of new technologies.\n  Mr. President, 63 percent of the funds proposed by the President for \nthe Environmental Technology Initiative would be spent on programs to \npromote just this kind of permit flexibility and other regulatory \ninnovative practices. These are the type of programs that the \nConnecticut Business and Industry Association and other businesses are \ntelling us they want to help them meet their environmental \nresponsibilities in a more efficient manner.\n  During the last Congress, I worked with colleagues on ways to promote \nthese new, more cost-effective environmental technologies. I learned \nthat the single most significant barrier to investment in these new \ntechnologies is that many of EPA's regulations inadvertently lock in \nthe old, existing technologies.\n  Under the Environmental Technology Initiative, EPA is working now to \ndevelop regulations that correct this mistake, that do not lock in any \none existing technology. They are working at EPA with State and \nnonprofit and Federal laboratories to test and verify the performance \nof these new, promising technologies. We need to make sure that this \nverification program can be expanded.\n  EPA is investing in other programs that make good economic and \nenvironmental sense. One of the most successful environmental programs \nhas been the market-based program to reduce emissions contributing to \nacid rain. Studies show that this very exciting new program is yielding \nenormous health benefits while costing the industries regulated by the \nClean Air Act at least $2 to $3 billion less than estimated at the time \nof enactment of the law. ETI, the Environmental Technology Initiative, \nis investing in programs that will expand market-based approaches. And \nthat is exactly what the Lautenberg amendment would support.\n  Over the long term, improvements in environmental technology, \nparticularly when it comes to pollution prevention, are critical to the \nability of American companies to compete. Not only do new technologies \nreduce compliance costs but they improve competitiveness by leading to \ngreater efficiency. Saturday's New York Times had an exciting article \nabout the success of the paper industry in vastly reducing its \ndischarges of contaminated water into rivers or streams and in the \nprocess saving huge amounts of water and energy while still increasing \nproduction. Those companies have found that this approach provides a \ncompetitive advantage.\n  ETI is working in partnership with industry to develop these cleaner \ntechnologies. For example, it is working with industry to reduce toxic \nemissions released by metal finishing processes used by more than 3000 \nmetal finishing facilities nationwide. One of these projects already is \nreducing the use of chromium. Another project aims to slash the time \nEPA takes to approve new technologies that prevent dangerous \ncontaminants such as cryptosporidium from entering our drinking water, \nand other technologies that will disinfect the water as well as provide \nquicker confirmation of drinking water safety.\n  In other words, at the most basic level, the development of \ninnovative environmental technology will enable us to maintain strong \nenvironmental protection at dramatically lower cost. Involving Federal \nand State agencies such as EPA as partners in this effort is important \nbecause these agencies should have a good sense of the regulations that \nmay be promulgated in the next decade. Working in partnership with the \nFederal Government is the best way to focus technology development on \nareas where the economic and environmental benefits will be the \ngreatest. Involvement in technology development will also help increase \nawareness by EPA and other regulatory agencies of what is or is not \npossible from a technology development standpoint as they develop \nregulations.\n  ETI is also working with industries to promote the exports and \ndiffusion of U.S. technologies throughout the world. There is an \nenormous market for these technologies and U.S. companies should lead. \nIn Connecticut, the environmental technology industry--a $2 billion \nindustry according to recent reports--has become a major exporter.\n  Mr. President, the second provision in Senator Lautenberg's amendment \nthat I want to discuss briefly is the add-back for funding for the so-\ncalled Partnership for the New Generation of Vehicles. That is \nsometimes referred to more familiarly as the clean car initiative. This \nis an extremely important and innovative program that has transformed a \ntraditional adversarial relationship between industry and Government--\nin this case the auto industry--into a relationship that is built on \ncommon goals and has produced a broad-based cooperation. The goal of \nthe program is to develop an attractive, affordable, midsized car, much \nlike the Ford Taurus, Chrysler Concorde, or Chevrolet Lumina, which \nachieves up to 80 miles to the gallon. It is mostly recyclable, \naccelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in 12 seconds.\n  The occupant of the chair can remember our youths together, when how \nfast you could go from zero to 60 was truly a measurement of one's \nstatus in life. This car is aimed to hold comfortably six passengers \nand to meet all safety and emissions requirements and to cost about the \nsame as comparably sized cars on the showroom floor.\n  This would be a revelation. Up to 80 miles per gallon. The program is \nreally a win-win program. Government is working as a partner with \nindustry to protect our environment. At the same time, it is \nstimulating new technologies that lead to increased competitiveness for \nAmerican industry in the fiercely competitive international automobile \nmarketplace.\n  The clean car initiative not only protects the environment, but also \njobs--high wage jobs--for our work force. This program is cost shared. \nIndustry is pulling its own weight. Government funding is used in long \nterm precompetitivess research and development. And there is clear \nprogress being made toward the program's goals. One representative of \nthe partnership told Vice President Gore last year: ``By the end of \nl997, we will narrow the technology focus. By 2000, we will have a \nconcept vehicle. And by the year 2004, we will have a production \nprototype.'' He added: ``This is not just about jobs. It is not just \nabout technology. It is not just about the environment. It is also \nabout a new process of working together, for both industry and \nGovernment, in ways that have not been attempted before.''\n  Again, the Lautenberg amendment pluses up the money available for \nthis program. It is a very, very cost-effective investment of public \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on several other provisions \nin Senator Lautenberg's amendment. I strongly support the restoration \nof funding for the State revolving fund under the Clean Water Act. SRF \nmoney is critical for Connecticut and particularly Long Island Sound.\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\n  The SRF program espouses the virtues that the majority has been \nemphasizing this Congress--it provides low interest loans to States to \nmeet community based environmental needs and offers flexibility in how \nmoney is spent. For example, Connecticut has received $170 million in \nFederal funds and has committed over $1 billion in State funds since \n1987 to improve sewage treatment plants.\n  In Connecticut, clean water is not just an environmental issue--but \nan economic issue. Long Island Sound, for example, generates \napproximately $5 billion per year for the local economy--through fin \nand shellfish harvest, boating, fishing, hunting, and beach-going \nactivities. The commercial oyster harvest is a great example. In l970, \nConnecticut's once thriving shellfish industry was virtually \nnonexistent. Today, its $50 million harvest has the highest value in \nthe Nation. This improvement is due in large part to required \nimprovements in water quality.\n  Our work on cleaning up Long Island Sound, however, has a long way to \ngo. Health advisories are still in effect for recreational fish \nconsumption, and disease-causing bacterial and viruses have been \nresponsible for numerous beach closures. Connecticut still needs \nhundreds of millions of dollars to perform needed improvements on \npublic sewage system, which continue to be the largest source of \npollution for the sound. The total estimated cost of upgrading the \noutdated plants is estimated at $6 to $8 billion.\n  I am also very concerned that the comprehensive conservation and \nManagement plan for Long Island Sound will be curtailed without \nadequate SRF funding. Through this plan, representatives from EPA, New \nYork, Connecticut and other local governments have joined forces with \nbusinesses, developers, farmers, and environmentalists to work \ncooperatively to upgrade sewage treatment plants, improve stormwater \nmanagement and control non point source runoff. A reduction in SRF \nfunds will limit each State's ability to assess local conditions and \nmove toward more site-specific and flexible watershed protection \napproaches.\n  Inadequate funding of the SRF delays needed improvements in Long \nIsland Sound and in other greater water bodies in this country--\nimprovements that have enormous economic, recreational and \nenvironmental benefits. That is why I support the additional funding in \nSenator Lautenberg's amendment.\n  Finally, I want to express my strong support for the modest additions \nto the funding for climate change. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of \nan amendment offered by Senator Jeffords to restore a significant \namount of funding for EPA's ozone depletion and global climate change \nprograms. But I think it is critical that a minimum there be no \ndecrease in EPA's programs from fiscal year 1995 enacted levels. \nAdequate funding for DOE's climate change programs is also critical.\n  Mr. President, the new scientific assessment by the world's leading \nscientists concludes that the best evidence suggest that global climate \nchange is in progress, that the temperature changes over the last \ncentury are unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes, and that a \npattern of climate response to human activities is identifiable in \nobserved climate records. The assessment concludes that the incidence \nof floods, droughts, fires and pest outbreaks is expected to increase \nin some regions. For example, we are experiencing a continuing rise in \naverage global sea level, which is likely to amount to more than a foot \nand a half by 2010. To bring that home to Connecticut, sea level rises \nof this magnitude along the coast could result in total inundation of \nbarrier beaches such as Hammonasset Beach, which is probably our most \npopular State park, and destruction of some coastal property.\n  The President's global climate action plan is modest . It commits the \nUnited States to reducing greenhouse gas emission to l990 levels by the \nyear 2000. This is a modest step because our efforts at stabilizing \nemissions is different from stabilizing atmospheric concentrations. \nConstant annual emissions will still increase the total concentration \nof greenhouse gases and heat-trapping capacity of our atmosphere.\n  The President's plan relies on voluntary, public private partnerships \nwhich are based on building a consensus between business and \nGovernment. It does not rely on command and control regulation. If \nthese types of innovative alternatives are to be the basis of our \nfuture approach to environmental protection, it is critical to support \nthe programs now in existence.\n  I also strongly support the additional funding for the Department of \nAgriculture's Stewardship Incentive Program. This program provides \nfinancial and technical assistance to private nonindustrial forest land \nowners to manage their forest land for timber production, wildlife, \nrecreation and aesthetics. It is an important nonregulatory incentives \nprogram for preserving wetlands and endangered species across the \ncountry that has widespread support, including the Connecticut Forest \nand Park Association.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Lautenberg and Senator Mikulski.\n  We have to balance the budget, and everyone has to sacrifice a bit. \nThe new Congress does deserve some credit for trying. But it has gone \nabout the job in the wrong way.\n  It wants to give new tax breaks to wealthy people and corporations. \nAnd to do that, Congress has threatened a back-door tax increase on \nrural America through higher water rates, and threatened the creation \nof good jobs by turning its back on critical research and development \nin environmental technologies. This amendment will help set things \nright.\n\n\n                    stopping the back-door water tax\n\n  First, we will help small towns and rural communities meet their \nobligations without slapping folks with higher water bills.\n  How do we do that? Well, we provide money for the State revolving \nloan funds. These help communities and water systems treat their sewage \nand provide safe drinking water. Without this fund, these communities \nstill have to keep the water safe. But they can only do it by raising \nwater rates, sometimes through the roof.\n  With this amendment, small towns can keep their drinking water safe \nwhile keeping water rates low. Without this amendment, many just can \nnot do it. So if Congress does not pass the Lautenberg amendment, the \n25 million Americans who get their water from a small drinking water \nsystem could see a back-door tax increase through higher water bills. \nThat includes virtually everyone in rural America.\n\n\n                       protecting high-wage jobs\n\n  Second, by adopting this amendment we will protect high-wage jobs \nthat make our country cleaner, healthier, and more competitive.\n  We do it by restoring money for the Environmental Technology \nInitiatives [ETI] at the Environmental Protection Agency. Through this \nprogram, companies and local governments can participate in research \nand development of new technologies.\n  In Montana, small businesses like Yellowstone Environmental Sciences \nin Bozeman and public-private partnerships like the Western \nEnvironmental Technology Office in Butte are some of the most \ninnovative players in addressing our Superfund problems. They are also \nsome of the most promising sources of high-wage jobs for the future.\n  Elsewhere in America, the ETI Program is verifying the performance of \nnew technologies that are suitable to the special cost and performance \nneeds of small drinking water systems.\n  It is helping to reduce dangerous toxic emissions released by the \nmetal finishing processes used by over 3,000 metal finishing facilities \nnationwide.\n  It is speeding up approvals of new analytical methods which can \nrapidly determine the nature of contamination at toxic waste sites, and \nmake cleanups faster.\n  The ETI is a great example of how Government and the private sector \ncan cooperatively advance technology while protecting the environment.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  So we need to balance the budget, but we need to do it the right way. \nThis amendment keeps us on the path to a balanced budget while setting \nthe priorities straight. It will protect good jobs and prevent Congress \nfrom imposing a large back-door tax on the average family's water \nrates. It will help make sure our country is the clean, healthy Nation \nour children deserve.\n\n[[Page S1925]]\n\n  I urge support for the Lautenberg-Mikulski amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak \nin support of the pending amendment, particularly for restoring \noperating funds for the National Park Service. Without these funds \nmillions of Americans will not realize the full majesty and spectacle \nof our national treasures.\n  The $72 million restoration provides funding to manage the \noperational needs of our national parks. At its current level of \nfunding the Park Service is merely treading water with respect to \nmaintaining facilities. Additional funding provides for much-needed \nimprovements and repair of our national treasures. This would also \nrepresent a boon to local economies as more visitors will be able to \nmake use of upgraded parks. The proposed offset offered in the \namendment ensures no additional taxpayer money will be spent. As some \nwould seek to keep level funding in the face of increasing costs and \ndemands, I think you now see sentiment throughout America that \nrecognizes the need to stop irreparable damage being done to our \nnational heritage. This funding restoration is necessary to ensure the \nfuture of a strong, accessible National Park System.\n  As you know, I have been a strong advocate of promoting and \nstrengthening our national parks. Minnesota is home to a truly wondrous \narea, Voyageurs National Park--the crown jewel of the north. This \nunique water-based park is a pristine wildlife habitat where one can \nsee wolves in the wild, bald eagles soaring overhead, and fish breaking \nthe water in pastoral settings. Voyageurs provides Minnesotans the \nopportunity to explore this national treasure by boat, snowmobile, \nfloatplanes, skiing, or hiking. Last summer I had the privilege of \nboating in the park and I don't believe I've ever been so thrilled with \nthe beauty of nature as I was on that trip.\n  I want to see more people visit and enjoy this spectacular resource. \nAs with other national parks, this cannot happen without adequate \noperating funds, money that will preserve and enhance the beauty of \njewels like Voyageurs. I have fought to maintain the carefully managed \nmultiple use nature of Voyageurs, to address water level problems, to \nachieve better safety for boaters, and at the same time benefit fish \nspawning and wildlife habitat.\n  Northern Minnesota has a rich history of individuality; the proud \npeople of this area have worked the land and provided for their \nfamilies through toil and sweat. Maintaining and improving facilities \nat Voyageurs, ensuring the multiple-use nature of the park, will allow \nmore people to come and enjoy it, bring more jobs to the local economy, \nand lead to economic development. Northern Minnesota deserves it and I \nwill work to make it happen.\n  Some of my colleagues are all too often willing to turn back the \nenvironmental clock, to say get rid of Government regulation, to go \nback to the days of unregulated extraction and exploitation of our \nlands. I say we cannot go back, we must preserve nature's wonders for \ngenerations to come. We cannot back down from the gains we've made in \nprotecting our great heritage. This must be a shared responsibility, \none that accounts for the needs of the many and the few.\n  When Congress voted to establish Voyageurs, we said yes to preserving \nthis wonderful and pristine resource for all Americans. We said no to \nfuture lakeshore development, to building homes and putting up private \nproperty and no trespassing signs. We made a decision to provide \nmultiple use recreation in a natural setting, free of development, free \nof timbering and free of the threat of losing this resource. Now we \nhave to invest in this resource to ensure that all Americans and their \nchildren will experience our National Parks.\n  We often say that someone has good common sense, but we are losing \nsight of what constitutes common sense--or what makes sense. It makes \nno sense to risk the loss of this treasure. Common sense should compel \nus to guard and protect our parks. Once we walk away--once we fail to \nprovide adequate funding, it is too difficult to recover what we have \nlost.\n  We must continue to support the gains we've made with respect to our \nnational parks. We must maintain and improve the treasures we have set \naside. We must make them accessible to all, to share the splendor of \nnature.\n  Take some time, come to Minnesota, enjoy the beauty of Voyageurs. I \npromise you my friends, once you've experience the wonders of our \nnorthern jewel, you will support full funding for our national parks \nand you will help to ensure their beauty for generations to come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \namendment before us.\n  Americans have a core belief in protecting the environment, \nregardless of party affiliation. They may differ on the means to \nachieve conservation and protection of our natural resources, but they \nare in agreement that we cannot squander or waste this precious \nheritage. In this regard, we are the envy of the world. Few other \nnations have approached protection of the environment in such a \ncomprehensive fashion. Our parks, our drinking and waste water systems, \nand our pollution prevention efforts are envied around the world.\n  Some seek to rewrite our environmental laws through the budgetary and \nappropriations process, rather than through the more deliberative \nprocess which gave us those laws. It is surely true that many of these \nstatutes could be improved. In fact, I have introduced legislation to \namend the Clean Air Act because I do not believe that it addresses \nadequately the matter of interstate transportation of air pollution. I \nhave supported various bills to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act, the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act. And, as my colleagues are \naware, I support improving and reforming the Federal Government's \nrulemaking process. However, I vigorously oppose wholesale changes in \nthe bedrock protection principles underpinning these laws. Americans \nwill not and should not accept such changes.\n  We have made huge strides in reducing pollution of the laws Congress, \nStates, and local governments have crafted over the years. Our \nemissions of most toxics have been declining, recycling has become an \naccepted waste management strategy, and we're working hard to develop \ncleaner, more environmentally sound products and manufacturing \nprocesses. All of these trends have occurred while economic growth \ncontinues and exports rise.\n  There is a new approach to business and management catching on in the \nUnited States. Industries, businesses, and even governmental units, are \ncarefully reviewing their production, procurement, and usage practices \nto root out waste and so become more competitive here and abroad.\n  Many experts say, and in some cases I agree, that we have already \nrequired and adopted the easy, most cost-effective pollution control \ntechnologies. From here on out, we have to focus more carefully on \nrefining our laws to provide flexibility to the regulated community and \nensure that benefits of any required investments in pollution \nprevention and control outweigh the costs. This is a difficult \nbalancing act, but if we can carefully review the basic environmental \nstatus and very carefully adjust them we will further the goal of \ncheaper, but equally effective protection. The Federal Government can \nand should be an active participant in helping those regulated to \ndevelop technologies and processes that can meet these cost-effective \ncriteria.\n  This is the direction that the Congress and the Clinton \nadministration, and the Bush administration before it, have begun. \nEPA's resources are now being spent more often on commonsense pollution \nprevention efforts that provide environmental protection and \nflexibility.\n  But, rather than continuing that process, the bill seeks to cut items \nthat are important priorities for environmental protection and \nconservation. Punitive cuts in Endangered Species Act activity, in Land \nand Water Conservation Fund matching grants to States, in Superfund, in \nenvironmental technology development, in wastewater treatment grants to \nStates, in energy conservation and so forth don't add up to a balanced \ncareful approach.\n  On a Michigan note, I must continue to express my opposition to the \nbills' reductions in the National Biological Service and its transfer \nto the U.S. Geological Survey, primarily because of its impact on \nresearch at the Great Lakes Science Center. And, I oppose\n\n[[Page S1926]]\n\nthe inclusion by reference of the conference report language \naccompanying the vetoed Commerce, Justice, State bill, which proposed \ntransfer of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to the Department of \nInterior.\n  Industry leaders, business managers, and local elected officials, \nhave internalized the public's unquenchable desire for continued \nprogress in environmental protection. That is a real revolution.\n  Now, we are halfway through the fiscal year for which this omnibus \nbill is providing funds. The uncertainty of funding has caused \nwidespread havoc among local governments, businesses, and States. The \nstop and start approach harms good, solid planning and jeopardizes \npublic and private sector jobs. It does not make any sense to do things \nthis way.\n  Most Americans do not have the luxury of time necessary to fully \nmonitor how things are being handled here. They don't know who to blame \nfor the holdup of wastewater treatment grants or education loans. But, \nthey are tired of the infighting and want it to end.\n  Americans want our laws fixed to relieve unnecessary burdens or gross \ninefficiency. But, they will not surrender what they know to be \ntheirs--the right to clean air, clean water, and a safe environment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Lautenberg \namendment to the Omnibus Appropriations Act. It gives the environment \nthe high priority it deserves, by restoring some of the most serious \ncuts proposed in the pending bill.\n  We need to do all we can to see that the Nation's priceless \nenvironmental heritage is passed down from generation to generation. \nThis amendment offers Republicans and Democrats alike a chance to give \nthe environment the priority it deserves.\n  It restores needed funds for programs to improve the safety of our \nNation's drinking water supplies, and helps protect our lakes, rivers, \nand coastal areas from harmful pollutants.\n  It maintains the Federal Government's commitment to provide needed \nassistance to communities struggling to meet the requirements of the \nClean Water Act.\n  It gives States and localities the support and flexibility they need \nto bring their water systems into the 21st century.\n  In particular, the amendment will restore $190 million for the Clean \nWater Act's State revolving fund, which offers a vital source of \nFederal assistance for wastewater projects across the Nation.\n  The cost of implementing clean water mandates has put an \nextraordinary burden on families and businesses in thousands of \ncommunities.\n  In Massachusetts, the cost of these mandates has resulted in water \nand sewer bills that exceed many of my constituents' property taxes. \nLow-income families have had their water shut off because they were \nunable to pay their soaring bills. Some families are now paying $1,600 \na year for water and sewer service, and the rates will continue to rise \nthrough the end of the decade.\n  In the communities of Fall River and New Bedford, businesses that use \nwater-intensive processes--particularly textile companies--are \nconsidering leaving the State, because the projected rate increases \nwill put them at a competitive disadvantage. To add insult to injury, \nthese communities are also plagued by double-digit unemployment, and \nhave not yet recovered from the ongoing economic recession.\n  Congress has a responsibility to help ease the burden of their rising \nwater and sewer rates by providing additional support for the State \nrevolving fund.\n  The Lautenberg amendment also adds $75 million in clean water funds \nfor the cleanup of Boston Harbor. This addition will bring Federal \nassistance back to the $100 million level of annual support recommended \nby President Clinton and President Bush as well, and provided each year \nby Congress over the past several years.\n  Over the course of the past decade, the cleanup of Boston Harbor has \nreceived strong bipartisan support. Democrats as well as Republicans \nhave recognized the crushing financial burden on the 2.5 million \nratepayers in the area to meet the $3.5 billion in federally mandated \ncleanup costs.\n  State funds have been essential as well in bringing relief to these \nratepayers. In addition, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, \nwhich oversees the cleanup of Boston Harbor, has successfully worked to \nreduce the costs of the project.\n  But continuing Federal assistance remains vitally important for this \nongoing project, which still has several years to go before completion. \nThe project has passed some important milestones already--it has \nreduced harmful metals dumped into the harbor from 3,000 pounds per day \nin 1984 to 500 pounds per day in 1993. It has reduced the number of \nharbor beach closings by 70 percent over the last 4 years. But much \nmore remains to be done.\n  At the $100 million annual level, Federal assistance meets just 18 \npercent of the total Boston Harbor cleanup costs--far below the Federal \nshare provided in the past for many other clean water projects \nthroughout the United States.\n  Finally, the Lautenberg amendment will also restore $175 million to \nthe State revolving fund under the Safe Drinking Water Act. This fund \nwill, for the first time, provide Federal assistance to States and \nlocalities to improve their public water systems and ensure the safety \nof their drinking water supplies. Many communities urgently need this \nassistance to comply with Federal law and build new water treatment \nfacilities, develop alternative water supplies, and consolidate small \nsystems.\n  The creation of this revolving fund received the unanimous support of \nthe Senate last November, by a vote of 99 to 0. The Lautenberg \namendment will help make that commitment real and bring relief to \ncities and towns across America.\n  Communities across America will benefit from this amendment. This \nCongress should not go down in history as the anti-environment \nCongress. I urge the Senate to give this amendment the overwhelming \nbipartisan support it deserves.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1907-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1926-S1933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WHITEWATER DEVELOPMENT CORP. AND RELATED MATTERS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 1 p.m. having arrived, there will \nnow be 1 hour equally divided on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed to Senate Resolution 227.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nthe time to be equally divided between the sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, for the past 16 days our Democratic \ncolleagues have used the Senate rules to block consideration of a \nresolution to provide additional funds, funds for the Whitewater \nspecial committee. That is simply wrong. The Senate has a duty to get \nthe full facts about Whitewater.\n  The Democrats are filibustering, for 16 days now, to prevent the \nSenate from voting on whether or not to provide additional funds for \nthe Whitewater Committee.\n  So that the record is clear, we must understand how much we are \nasking for. We are asking $600,000. In addition, I have agreed to allow \nus to have a vote to curtail the committee's investigation to 4 months. \nThey have said they wanted to negotiate with us. We are willing to \nnegotiate. We have heard nothing except what is almost contemptuous \nbecause it says we would have to conclude our public hearings by April \n5. That is silly.\n  The majority is committed to getting all the facts about Whitewater. \nIt is now clear that our Democratic colleagues simply are not.\n  Let me ask the question: If Whitewater is much to-do about nothing, \nas the White House claims, why are Democrats afraid of the hearings? \nWhy are they afraid to let them go forward? What are they afraid of? \nWhat does the White House want to hide from the American people? You \ncannot say it is much to-do about nothing, and then oppose having the \nhearings.\n\n[[Page S1927]]\n\n  Second, it is absolutely disingenuous, as some have claimed, that \nthis has cost the American people $30 million. The fact is our \ncommittee has spent about $900,000, and a total of about $450,000 last \nyear; so, that when they come up with this $30 million, in an attempt \nto ascribe it to the work of the committee, it is disingenuous and they \nare playing fast and loose with the facts.\n  There are a number of unanswered questions. Let me just pose some of \nthem.\n  Who put the Rose Law Firm building records in the White House \nresidence? How do you think they got there? How? Do you think the \nplumber brought them there? The carpenter who was making repairs? The \nmen who were working to fix the air-conditioning? Do we really believe \nthey brought it there? Do we think the butler brought them there? Or, \nrather, did these records--that were being worked on by Mr. Foster and \ncontained his handwritten notes in the margins--come from Mr. Foster's \noffice? Did they come there at the explicit directions of the First \nLady to her chief of staff? We have had the testimony of a young man, \nMr. Castleton, who says that he was told that he was bringing the \nrecords up because Mrs. Clinton wanted to look at them.\n  Indeed, if she did not look at them as she claimed, how did the \nrecords wind up there? If all the records were just simply shipped off \nto her lawyers, how do they get over there?\n  So we have a question as to how did these billing records \nmysteriously appear. Remember, those records were subpoenaed by the \nspecial prosecutor. How did they get into the White House residence? My \ncolleague from North Carolina has said that one of the most secure \nrooms in the United States of America would be one of the rooms in the \nresidence of the President and First Lady. Incredible.\n  Another question is, did the Clintons know that James McDougal was \ncovering their Whitewater losses for them? He is presently under trial \nin Little Rock, AR. He ran a bank that was a criminal enterprise--we \nfound that out--Madison Savings & Loan. Some of the bankers I have met \nrecently said, ``Senator, please do not say it was a bank; it was a \nsavings and loan.'' And, indeed, they lost over $60 million worth of \ntaxpayers' money.\n  If one follows just some of what we have uncovered, one sees sham \ntransactions, one after another, where insiders were asked to buy land \nand hold land for that bank, would be given 10 percent commissions for \na land transaction in which it was a total sham, in the end costing the \ntaxpayers--this S eventually collapsed and left the taxpayers with a \n$60 million bill to foot.\n  Did the Clintons take improper tax deductions on their Whitewater \ninvestment? It is a question. The committee is working on that and \nlooking at that. Maybe, indeed, the White House does not want us to \nhave those answers or hold public hearings. I guess if you took \nimproper tax deductions, you might not want that to come out. Did \nGovernor Clinton direct special favors to McDougal to keep Madison \nafloat? If the President--then Governor--did not do any of these \nthings, fine, then let the record clear that question. It would seem to \nme if he did, maybe that is why we are hearing all of this puffery, \nsmoke, and bellowing that this is politics having these questions \nanswered.\n  Did the Governor help Dan Lasater, a convicted distributor of \ncocaine, get bond contracts with the State of Arkansas? Did he or did \nhe not? I do not know. But again, the question is, if he did not, then \nfine, let us at least go through this and clear the record. Then, I \nwould be the first to say that is absolutely an unsubstantiated \nallegation. Did Governor Clinton exchange favors for campaign \ncontributions from officials of the Perry County bank? These officials, \nby the way, were just indicted last month. We did not just come out \nwith these names. Did that happen or did it not? These are just some of \nthe unanswered questions.\n  I think that we have an obligation to get the facts. Sixteen days of \nfilibuster. Now, the New York Times said that a Democratic filibuster \nagainst a vote on additional funding would be ``silly stonewalling''. \nThey said:\n\n       No argument about politics on either side can outweigh the \n     fact that the White House has yet to reveal the full facts \n     about the land venture, about the Clintons' relationship to \n     McDougal's banking activities, Hillary Rodham Clinton's work \n     as a lawyer on Whitewater matters, and the mysterious \n     movement of documents between the Rose Law Firm, various \n     basements, and closets in the Executive mansion. The \n     committee, politics notwithstanding--\n\n  This is the New York Times.\n\n     has earned an indefinite extension, and a Democratic \n     filibuster against it would be silly stonewalling.\n\n  That is not my statement. That is the New York Times, certainly not a \nspokesperson for the Republican Party or Republican philosophy.\n  Yesterday, the Washington Post said essentially the same thing. Let \nme quote what it said:\n\n       Lawmakers and the public have a legitimate interest in \n     getting answers to many questions that prompted the \n     investigation in the first place and those that have been \n     raised in the course of it by the conduct of many \n     administration witnesses. If Democrats think that \n     stonewalling or stalling will make Whitewater go away, \n     they are badly mistaken. The probe is not over, whether \n     they tried to call it off or not.\n\n  Again, that is the Washington Post.\n  So my colleagues on the other side may attempt to keep the \ninvestigation and the funding for it from going forth. Again, I have \noffered to curtail the committee's work to 4 months. I think we would \nbe making a mistake in setting an arbitrary date certain, but in the \ninterest of moving the process forward and of attempting to \ndepoliticize it, I am willing to do so.\n  Let me suggest that there is a common theme to the number of \nlingering questions. As Pulitzer prize-winning author, James Stewart, \nstates in his new book ``Blood Sport'':\n\n       The question of whether specific laws were broken should \n     not obscure the broader issues that make Whitewater an \n     important story. How Bill and Hillary Clinton handled what \n     was their single largest investment says much about their \n     character and integrity. It shows how they reacted to power, \n     both in their quest for it and their wielding of it. It shows \n     their willingness to hold themselves to the same standard \n     everyone else must, whether in meeting a bank's conditions \n     for a loan, taking responsibility for their savings, \n     investments and taxes, or cooperating with Federal \n     investigators. Perhaps most important, it shows whether they \n     have spoken the truth on subjects of legitimate concern to \n     the American people.\n\n  Mr. Stewart is not some partisan author out to get the Clintons. He \nhas a reputation for being fair and thorough. In fact, the Clintons, \nthrough their close associate, Susan Thomases, first asked Mr. Stewart \nto write this book. He even had direct access to Mrs. Clinton early on. \nMr. Stewart has uncovered a number of important facts about Whitewater. \nHe has identified new witnesses. In an excerpt published in Time \nmagazine, Mr. Stewart raises serious questions about the Clintons' role \nin managing the Whitewater investment after 1986. Although the Clintons \nhave always claimed to have been passive investors in Whitewater, Mr. \nStewart found that Mrs. Clinton actively managed the Whitewater \ninvestments after 1986.\n  Mr. President, we will continue to seek a solution to this impasse. \nYesterday--and I repeat it today--we offered to extend our hearings by \n4 months. But I do not think that we can simply allow this kind of \nobstruction and stonewalling to keep us from attempting to get the \nfacts.\n  Now, if those facts clear the Clintons and their associates, the \nAmerican people have a right to know; they really do. The White House \nhas the opportunity to help in insisting that we conduct these hearings \nexpeditiously, yes, but in a manner that will get the truth out there, \nand if it vindicates them, then that should be the case. Now, if indeed \nthey have no concern about their actions, then it would seem to me that \nthe proper course of action would be to authorize the committee to do \nits work and get to the job of doing its work, and attempt to get those \nwitnesses that we now do not have access to as soon as the case is over \nin Little Rock. Certainly, we would hope within the next 6 to 7 weeks \nit will be concluded. Maybe we will not be able to get some or any of \nthose witnesses, but at least we will have made our good-faith effort \nin attempting to do so, and to do so in a way that does not impinge \nupon or impair the work of the special counsel.\n  So I believe that the facts are clear. I think the American people \nare entitled to get this information, and I\n\n[[Page S1928]]\n\nthink what we are facing here is a politically orchestrated attempt to \nstop the committee from doing its work. That does not reflect well upon \nthe Senate, the White House, or either of the political parties. The \nprocess is one that should be continued. It should be continued because \notherwise the questions will remain: What are they hiding? Why are they \nafraid?\n  Again, while the resolution calls for no time limitation, let it be \nclear that this Senator will be happy to amend that to 4 months. We \nhave not gotten any satisfactory reply with respect to our offer. It is \nan offer that I make here on the Senate floor again. There are \nlimitations when you do that, as described by the former Senate \nmajority leader, a Democrat, George Mitchell, when he said, ``When you \nset a time line, you then get people who look to work at that as a mark \nto delay the hearings, delay the release of information.'' \nNotwithstanding that, we would be willing to submit that as a timeframe \nin which to try to complete our work, the work of the committee.\n  Some people have said to me, ``What happens if it appears that the \nDemocrats are going to continue to filibuster, Senator? What will you \ndo?''\n  We will be forced to go forward with our work. It will be more \ndifficult, and we have a busy agenda for the Banking Committee, but, \nnevertheless, we have to do the best we can; come in early; work as \nmany hours as we can; deal with the various maneuvers that our \nDemocratic colleagues will undoubtedly employ in attempting to keep the \ncommittee from doing its work. But a large share of the work that we \nare embarked upon could be undertaken by the Banking Committee. It \nwould be difficult in terms of resources, but we will do it. It will \ncertainly be, I think, very burdensome as it relates to some of the \nburdens that will be placed upon the staff of the Banking Committee, \nthe time of the Banking Committee and its members.\n  I also point out that there are certain perils for those who may want \nto circumscribe and carefully proscribe the scope of the inquiry. As \nauthorized pursuant to the Resolution 120 we have limited the scope of \nour inquiry. If we were to take this up with the Banking Committee, in \nmany cases the scope would not be nearly as limited. I can assure my \nfriends and colleagues, if that is the route they choose to take, then \nthey will create a situation in which they have to understand that the \nscope will be broadened.\n  I say that because they should understand there will come a point in \ntime when we would then have to fall back to the use of the Banking \nCommittee as opposed to going forward with the special committee that \nhas carefully proscribed a methodology for which we could proceed. I \nthink we would be making a great mistake. I hope we can work out a \ncompromise. Let the chips fall where they may; the offer is on the \ntable, and I hope that we can settle this thing without a prolonged \ndebate. Otherwise, we will be back here tomorrow, we will be back here \nthe next day, and we will be back here next week. The question is, What \nare my friends at the White House afraid of?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized. He \nhas 26 minutes 30 seconds remaining on his time, and the Senator from \nNew York has 2 minutes 31 seconds on his time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and then 6 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  Just before doing that, I want to put an editorial in the Record \nbecause sometimes we get caught up in the debate and we do not get them \nin. I listened to my colleague from New York cite editorials. This one \nis from Friday, March 8, just this past Friday, from Newsday, from the \nNassau County edition of Newsday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Newsday, Mar. 8, 1996]\n\n                       Enough Whitewater Hearings\n\n       The Senate Whitewater Committee ran out of time and money \n     on Feb. 29, but it still wants more of both to embarrass \n     President Bill Clinton. Senate Democrats have threatened a \n     filibuster to keep Chairman Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) from \n     getting $600,000 to continue an open-ended investigation that \n     could stretch to Election Day and beyond.\n       The Democrats are right about this. In fact, their \n     counteroffer to D'Amato--$185,000 to wrap up his inquiry in \n     five weeks, at most--is too generous. After 41 days of public \n     hearings and 121 witnesses, D'Amato has nothing of substance \n     to show for the $950,000 the committee has already spent. \n     It's time to hand off to Whitewater independent counsel \n     Kenneth Starr and see how far he can carry the ball.\n       This is all the more so now that Starr's office is actually \n     trying a case against Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's \n     former Whitewater partners. The defendants want the president \n     to appear as a witness in that case, and he should. The only \n     question is whether he should testify in person, on tape, via \n     satellite or whatever. There's precedent for presidential \n     trial testimony on tape, and that should be good enough this \n     time.\n       But no more money for Senate hearings. The Senate Watergate \n     Committee, pursuing impeachable offenses by the Nixon \n     administration, called only 37 witnesses. The joint \n     committees on the Reagan administration's illegal arms deals \n     with Iran and the Nicaraguan contras heard a mere 28. The \n     Senate has had enough time for a partisan probe of decade-old \n     Arkansas savings-and-loan deals. If the independent counsel \n     leaves any loose ends, there'll be time to crank it up again.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will quote from it just very quickly \nin part.\n\n       The Senate Whitewater Committee ran out of time and money \n     on February 29, but it still wants to embarrass President \n     Bill Clinton. Senate Democrats threatened to filibuster to \n     keep Chairman Alfonse D'Amato from getting $600,000 to \n     continue an open-ended investigation that could stretch to \n     election day and beyond.

It is time to hand \n     off to Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and see \n     how far he can carry the ball.\n\n  Then later on in the editorial they say in the closing paragraph:\n\n       But no more money for Senate hearings. The Senate Watergate \n     Committee, pursuing impeachable offenses by the Nixon \n     administration, called only 37 witnesses. The joint \n     committees on the Reagan administration's illegal arms deals \n     with Iran and the Nicaragua contras heard a mere 28. The \n     Senate has had enough time for a partisan probe of decade-old \n     Arkansas savings and loan deals.\n\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, sometimes I walk into the Chamber of the \nSenate and I think that I have stumbled into the wrong Chamber. I hear \nthe debate, and I think that is not what is being discussed. In the \ndebate a few minutes ago it was said that the Democrats are \nstonewalling on Whitewater. I guess I do not understand. I must have \nmissed something. We commissioned a Whitewater inquiry last May--May of \nlast year. We provided nearly $1 million for a special investigative \neffort in the Congress last year.\n  Now we are saying we are willing to provide additional resources, and \nyou ought to wrap this up in the next 5 weeks--5 weeks. And somehow we \nare stonewalling on Whitewater? I mean, it is plenty cold in Montana \nand North Dakota these days, and the heat bills are plenty high. I was \nthinking maybe if we took some of this hot air out there, it would heat \nthe two States for the entire winter. Stonewalling on Whitewater? What \non Earth are people talking about?\n  This is a manifestation of Parkinson's law. If you study Parkinson's \nlaw, one of his laws was that the amount of time needed to do a job \nalways expands to the amount of time available to do the job. This is \nthe manifestation of Parkinson's law. This inquiry, after spending $26 \nmillion on the independent counsel and still counting--this inquiry \nwhich is the political inquiry--now they want to extend to election \n1996.\n  Some of us say maybe you ought to get up early in the morning now. \nMaybe you ought to go 5 days a week now. Maybe you ought to get the \nwitnesses in now for the next 5 weeks and finish this investigation. As \nfor me, it does not matter with respect to these records. Get a rental \ntruck, back it up to the White House, get a vacuum cleaner, find a \nbunch of people that can read, and read all the records. As far as I am \nconcerned, whatever the truth is let the truth come out. But do you \nneed from last May until the election\n\n[[Page S1929]]\n\nday of 1996 to demonstrate what this issue is? I think not. That is not \nwhat the issue is here. There is a right way to do things and a wrong \nway to do things.\n  We have said, in the next 5 weeks finish this investigation. Do your \nwork. And what we are told by the other side is we are stonewalling. \nWhat a bunch of nonsense. While we are doing this, we are saying this \nis the most important thing for the Congress to do. Do you know what we \nare not doing? We are not having hearings on the issue of health care \nand Medicare and what we ought to do to solve that problem. Nobody is \nhaving hearings on the issue of jobs. Why are we losing jobs in this \ncountry? Why are jobs moving out of our country? Why does our Tax Code \ncontain this insidious incentive that pays corporations to shut their \nplants in this country and move them overseas, and why does not \nsomebody in this Congress do something about that? Nobody is holding \nhearings about what our monetary policy to doing to this country. Why \ncannot we have more than a 2.5-percent economic growth? What about the \nFed and the Fed's policies? Nobody is talking about hearings on a whole \nrange of issues dealing with the things that are central to people's \nlives.\n\n  This is the number of hearings. There were 41 days of hearings since \nlast May on Whitewater, 12 days on crime, 3 days on education, no \nhearings on the economy and jobs, and no hearings on Medicare and \nhealth care. The question is, What is the priority?\n  I want to get to the bottom of Whitewater. We have had 100 FBI agents \nand independent counsel that spent $23 million, and we have had a \nspecial inquiry in Congress since last May. Now we have people telling \nus we want to go for another 4 or 5 months. You know that some of us \nserve here because we are interested in doing the people's business, \npart of which deals with the issue of jobs, health care, the economy, \neducation, and a whole range of things. Get every record you want. Get \nevery record you can. Study it forever. But I do not think we ought to \nhave an unlimited amount of money given by the taxpayers for an \nunlimited inquiry to take us to election day 1996. Let us finish this \nin the next 5 weeks. Let us decide to do this and do it right; finish \nthe testimony, finish the report, report back to the Senate, and then \nlet us get on with the other business that confronts the American \npeople.\n  We have enormous challenges. We have budget challenges. We have \ndeficits. We have jobs, health care, and education. I have recited \nplenty of them to do. But the interesting thing is that no one seems \nvery interested in focusing on those challenges. My constituents are \ninterested. They are very interested in the question about what makes \nour education system work better. How do we advance the interest of our \nkids to have the best education system in the world? What do we do \nabout jobs that are leaving the country? What kind of policies can we \nput in place to deal with that? That is what my constituents are \ninterested in.\n  I am not suggesting that you have no business in the Whitewater \ninquiry. I voted for the funding last May for $1 million, and I will \nvote for additional funding. My objection is to what I think is kind of \na thinly disguised approach by some to say we want unlimited time here; \nwe want to work 2 or 3 days a week; we want to sort of move along \nleisurely. If you were hauling mail, you would go out and hire horses, \nI guess, and create some sort of ``Pony Express'' these days. That is \nthe speed with which we see this inquiry moving.\n  All we are saying is let us get this job done. We have said we will \nprovide appropriations for 5 weeks' additional inquiry, write a report, \nand let us finish it. There has been no other inquiry in the history of \nCongress that I am aware of that accepts this as a precedent. Nothing \ncomes close to what you are suggesting and what has been done here. The \nSenator from Maryland has made that point over and over again. Yet we \nhave people stand with indignation and say, ``You all are \nstonewalling.'' What a bunch of nonsense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Hawaii.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on May 17 of last year, this Senate voted \n96 to 3 to create a special committee to investigate the so-called \nWhitewater affair. This bipartisan vote established the special \ncommittee with its primary purpose to get all the facts on Whitewater \nto the American people.\n  This bipartisan Senate vote imposed a February 29, 1996, deadline for \nthe committee to complete its work to ensure that the facts were \npresented to the American people in a balanced and timely manner and \nbefore the country entered the politically charged atmosphere of a \nPresidential campaign.\n  Yet, as I listen intently to the ongoing debate, much of the \nbipartisan spirit which this body exhibited on May 17 no longer exists. \nRegretfully and sadly, it appears that the Republican majority has now \nchosen to forego bipartisanship in an effort to indefinitely extend the \nspecial committee's mandate, at a cost of $600,000, and prolong the \ninvestigation into the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  This Republican extension request is unprecedented, and it is \nunreasonable. The U.S. Senate has never before conducted an open-ended \npolitical investigation of a sitting American President during a \nPresidential election year.\n  During the course of this debate, reference has been made to the 1987 \nIran-Contra hearings. The committee was able to complete its \ninvestigation in a 10-month period within the deadline set by the \nCongress. The Iran-Contra affair was an international event that had \nmajor consequences beyond our shores. It involved the constitutional \nrelationship between the executive and legislative branches in the \nshaping of foreign policy. It involved the credibility of our foreign \npolicy. It involved our relations with other countries and it involved \nthe actions of our intelligence service and some of our Nation's most \nclosely held secrets.\n  Because of the profound issues in question, we in Congress were \ncompelled to investigate the episode, and for precisely the same reason \nwe were compelled to ensure that the Iran-Contra investigation was \nconducted in an atmosphere free of partisanship and theatrics. I \nstrongly believed then, as I do now, that the Nation would be ill-\nserved by a congressional panel wantonly weakening a President for \npresumed political benefit.\n  The Iran-Contra Committee was obligated to investigate the conduct of \nthe highest Government officers, and we were determined to let the \nfacts lead us to where they willed. But we did not perform this task in \na way that suggested to our adversaries that we were a nation divided. \nI believed we avoided this impression because of the lessons learned \nduring the Watergate investigation.\n  The Senate committee that investigated Watergate, on which I served, \nhad the same mandate as do today's select committees: to seek the facts \nabout the event in question and propose legislation to prevent a \nrepetition.\n  The structure of the Watergate Committee encouraged partisanship. \nThere were majority and minority lawyers, majority and minority \ninvestigators, majority and minority secretaries and clerks. Even the \ncommittee's budget was divided into Democratic and Republican portions.\n  After the conclusion of the investigation, the committee's minority \ncounsel and now our very distinguished colleague, Senator Fred \nThompson, wrote that loyalty to the Republican minority was ``one all-\nimportant criterion'' for hiring his staff. ``We are going to try our \nbest to have a bipartisan investigation, but if it comes down to the \nquestion of us and them, I don't want to worry about who is us and who \nis them.''\n  Mr. President, my one condition for assuming the role of chairman of \nthe Senate Iran Committee was that there would be no majority and no \nminority staffs but a unified staff whose members reported to the \ncommittee as a whole and not to Democrats or Republicans. Our chief \ncounsel, Mr. Arthur Liman, regarded all members of the committee as his \nclients, and, under his direction, our staff members worked side by \nside unconcerned whether their neighbor was one of us or one of them.\n  The structure of the staff would have been meaningless if the members \nof the\n\n[[Page S1930]]\n\ncommittee were determined to make the Iran-Contra investigation a \npartisan matter. This did not happen.\n  Our colleague, former Senator Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and vice \nchair of this Senate Iran-Contra Committee, was empowered to make \ndecisions in my absence. We collaborated on everything, and we divided \nthe responsibility for witnesses among all members of the committee so \nthe hearings became a collective matter. At no time during our closed \ncommittee meetings did any member raise political issues or hint at a \nDemocratic attempt to smear the President or a Republican scheme to \ncover things up.\n  In comparison, nearly 17 months had elapsed from the date the Senate \ncreated the Watergate Committee until the committee report was \npublished. The Watergate hearing itself dragged on for more than 8 \nmonths. The Iran-Contra Committee worked hard to accomplish its work \nwithin a 10-month period, hearings included. Yes, there were requests \nby Democrats and Republicans that we seek an indefinite time limit on \nthe hearings, but the chairman of the House committee, Representative \nHamilton, and I, in conjunction with our vice chairs, strongly \nrecommended against an open-ended investigation. We sought to ensure \nthat our investigation was completed in a timely fashion to preserve \nthe committee's bipartisanship and to avoid any exploitation of \nPresident Reagan during an election year.\n  The Special Committee on Whitewater has had 41 days of hearings, five \npublic meetings, and now has made an unprecedented and unreasonable \nrequest to indefinitely extend the special committee's mandate. It will \nbe a $600,000 tab, and I suppose it will prolong the investigation into \nthe Presidential campaign with a possibility of politically damaging \nand embarrassing the incumbent President.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats are committed to ensuring that the \nAmerican people know the facts on Whitewater but that it be done in the \nsame bipartisan fashion as the Iran-Contra hearings, and not for the \nexploitation or for the embarrassment of the sitting President.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, while the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii is still in the Chamber, I commend him for his statement and \nunderscore--underscore--the responsible manner in which he dealt with \nthe Iran-Contra issue.\n  At the time, there were Members of the Congress, a Democratically \ncontrolled Congress, who wanted to extend those hearings well into \n1988, a Presidential election year, for political purposes. And that \nwas obvious. The Republican leader of the Senate, Senator Dole, \nstrongly urged there be a time limit on the work of the committee. He \nwas fiercely opposed to the notion of an open-ended extension and was \nvery clear in making that point in debate on the floor and off the \nfloor in comments to the media.\n  Senator Inouye, who chaired the special committee in the Senate, and \nCongressman Hamilton, rejected this proposal by some Democrats to \nprolong the hearing into the election year and therefore exploit, for \npolitical purposes, President Reagan's difficulties, and they settled \non a reasonable time period. In fact, they moved it up in response to \nthe representation made to them by Senator Dole.\n  It was Senator Dole at the time who pressed very hard that there \nshould be a reasonable time limit, that it should stay out of the \nelection year. In fact, Senator Dole, on the floor, said: ``I am \nheartened by what I understand to be the strong commitment of both the \nchairman and vice chairman to avoid fishing expeditions. I am pleased \nto note that, as a result of a series of discussions which have \ninvolved myself, the majority leader, and the chairman and vice \nchairman designate of the committee, we have changed the date on which \nthe committee's authorization will expire.'' And they moved it forward.\n  Senator Inouye took the lead in achieving that constructive and \nresponsible result. I simply want to underscore it and contrast it with \nthe situation we are now facing, where we have a proposal, now, for an \nunlimited time period, an additional $600,000.\n  I yield myself 1 more minute.\n  Furthermore, in order to complete its work, the Iran-Contra \nCommittee, on which I was privileged to serve, under the very \ndistinguished chairmanship of the Senator from Hawaii, held 21 days of \nhearings in the last 23 days, in late July and August, in order to \ncomplete its hearings. Contrast that with the work of this committee, \nwhich held 1 day of hearings in the last 2 weeks of its existence in \nthe latter part of February; which held only 8 days of hearings in the \nentire month of February, whereas the Iran-Contra Committee held 21 \ndays of hearings in order to wind the thing up.\n  The minority leader has made, I think, a very reasonable proposal in \nterms of providing some additional time to finish this matter up. The \ncommittee should intensify its schedule and complete it on time, and it \nought to follow the example set by the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii when he chaired the Iran-Contra Committee and worked assiduously \nto keep partisanship and politics out of the inquiry and to keep the \ninquiry out of the election year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 10 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Maryland has 8 minutes, 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I find all of this debate about Iran-\nContra very interesting. I was not here for it, and so I enjoy being \nbrought up to date on past history. It is interesting, but it is \nirrelevant to the issue before us because the issue before us is: Are \nthere still things yet to find out about Whitewater which need to be \nfound out? This has nothing whatever to do with whether or not the \nIran-Contra Committee was able to find out what it needed to find out \nfrom Ollie North in the timeframe that it set for itself. This has \nnothing to do with the timeframe of the Whitewater Committee, which is \ntrying to find out information that has been denied it by a series of \ncircumstances, some of which I believe are deliberate.\n  I make that statement, recognizing that it, perhaps, is emotionally \ncharged for some. I try to stay away from emotionally charged \nstatements on this issue because I realize how easily this can get out \nof hand. But I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there has \nbeen a deliberate attempt on the part of those who have been called \nbefore the committee to withhold information from the committee and to \nsee to it that the committee does not receive that which it needs. I \nknow of no such charges that have been made in past investigations, \nand, even if they were, frankly, they are irrelevant to this issue.\n  This issue is very simple, again, Mr. President. It is simply this: \nWhat is there yet to find? What will it take us to find it? It has \nnothing to do with any past investigation of any other circumstance. It \nhas to do with this investigation of this set of circumstances. What is \nthere yet to find, and what will it take us to find it?\n  The editorials that have been quoted here--I have quoted them, the \nNew York Times, the Washington Post, others. The most recent one I will \nreturn to again, as my distinguished chairman has. But it makes this \npoint, relating to the question of, ``Can the committee not wind its \naffairs up?'' This is what the Washington Post has said. I repeat it \nagain:\n\n       . . . here is part of the problem; The McDougals and \n     Governor Tucker are currently unavailable for Washington \n     testimony as they are defending themselves against a 21-count \n     indictment handed up last August alleging fraud and \n     conspiracy on their part. It came courtesy of independent \n     counsel Kenneth Starr and a federal grand jury in Little \n     Rock. Judge Hale, whose earlier guilty plea slims down \n     considerably his chances of ever returning to the bench, is \n     similarly occupied in Arkansas and unavailable to be heard by \n     anyone in Washington. He is the prosecution's key witness \n     against the governor and the McDougals. Their trial, which \n     just got started, is one reason the Whitewater committee \n     hearings have been dragged out.\n\n  I will repeat that, Mr. President. ``Their trial is one reason the\n\n[[Page S1931]]\n\nWhitewater Committee hearings have been dragged out.''\n  It is not a conspiracy on the part of the Republicans. It is not an \nattempt on the part of the Republican National Committee to delay this \ninto an election year. There is a trial going on, over which the \nRepublicans on the committee have no control, that is preventing these \nwitnesses from coming before us. This is why we are asking for a time \nthat will allow us to deal with those witnesses when they become \navailable. We do not know when this trial will be over. If we knew with \ncertainty when the trial would be over and when these witnesses would \nbe available, I, for one, would be willing to set a date, appropriately \nfar off into the future, that would allow us time to deal with these \nwitnesses. We do not know. We cannot know. And, therefore, it does not \nmake sense for us to set a firm date.\n  Back to the editorial, quoting:\n\n       The other reason is the protracted battle with the White \n     House over subpoenaed documents and the very slow and \n     uncertain way certain important documents finally are \n     produced.\n\n  In other words, the delay in the eyes of the Washington Post has not \nbeen because the committee wants to drag it out for political reasons; \nit has been because the White House has been unresponsive.\n  I am a member of this committee. I have been to as many of the \nproceedings as I possibly could, given the schedule and the other \nchallenges that apply. I thought I knew this controversy fairly well. I \nhave now picked up the recent copy of Time magazine and read the first \ninstallment of a book that was written, initially at the recommendation \nof Susan Thomases, one of the President and First Lady's closest \nfriends and confidants, in an attempt to make sure the whole story got \nout.\n  She went to the author and said, ``Will you write a good book on \nthis?''\n  The author spent an hour and a half in the White House with Mrs. \nClinton, and she said, ``I will cooperate with you, and I will see to \nit that everybody connected with me will cooperate with you. We want \nthe truth to come out.''\n  Now, we have the book that was created by that genesis and I can only \ndescribe it as devastating. It is devastating to those who say, ``There \nis no there there.'' It is devastating to those who say the Republicans \nare on a partisan activity, because nothing significant really \nhappened.\n  As I say, I am a member of this committee. I thought I knew this \nissue fairly well, until I read this week's issue of Time magazine and \nfound out there is a whole lot more that I did not know about, and I \nhave been a member of the committee attending these sessions.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I conclude by saying there is plenty more yet to \nfind out, and I am sorry if it did not come out in the same timeframe \nas other investigations have had. But that is entirely beside the \npoint.\n  The point is, I repeat again, what is there yet to find out and what \nwill it take for us to find it? The answer to that question dictates \nthat we proceed in the fashion that the distinguished chairman, Mr. \nD'Amato, has asked us to proceed.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 42 seconds remaining on his \nside of the aisle.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I apologize to the Senator. I thought I had more time \nthan that. I yield all 42 seconds to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as we have just heard, Time magazine \nhas released excerpts from a new book, ``Blood Sport,'' which is one of \nthe most revealing and down-to-Earth accounts of Whitewater we have \nhad. It certainly is easier to follow than anything we have seen, doing \nthe best we could with the Whitewater hearings: Coming in a day, skip \ndays, a day out. It has been very difficult for the average citizen to \nfollow what we have been doing and what we have been trying to pursue.\n  This book chronologically identifies exactly what went on and what \nhappened. I think, again, it points to the very great need for us to \ncontinue the hearings, and the public will see the need, once they read \nthe book and read the excerpt that was in Time magazine.\n  It shows the Clintons to be much more active partners in Whitewater \nthan any of us believed at one time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. All time has \nexpired on the chairman's side of the aisle.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we provide 4 \nadditional minutes to be equally divided, so that we each have 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Four additional minutes for each side.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I asked for 4 minutes, 2 minutes for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, it shows the Clintons were much more \nactively involved than we had any idea; that the McDougals put far more \nmoney into the project than did the Clintons; and that they clearly \nused money from the savings and loan to supplement the Whitewater \nventure. I think we need to and should pursue it.\n  Further, there is a new revelation of how Mrs. Clinton received legal \nbusiness from Madison. She told the public that a young associate, Mr. \nMassey, brought the business to the law firm. Then Mr. Massey appeared \nbefore us and said he did not bring any business to the law firm. So \nthen she said it was Vince Foster who brought it. She changed her mind. \nMcDougal said that Bill Clinton urged him to give business to Hillary \nClinton because the Clintons needed the money.\n  The book reveals that there was a clear witness to that, Susan \nMcDougal's brother, and I think we need him to testify as soon as \npossible.\n  Many people might say, ``So what, 20 years ago, why is it relevant \ntoday?'' There are a number of reasons. First, the White House is \nengaged in a massive coverup of the entire episode, an inept coverup, \nbut at least an attempt to cover up.\n  We now know what the First Lady truly meant when she told Maggie \nWilliams she did not want 20 years of her life in Arkansas probed by \nthe Senate. We now know why. But it is a true indication of the way \nthey ran things in Arkansas, and they clearly have demonstrated they \nare going to run them the same way in Washington. They sure tried to \nrun them the same way. Old habits die hard, and we have seen the same \ncharacteristics that we know of in Arkansas come about in Washington.\n  I hope we can end the filibuster and let the Senate vote and then let \nthe American people decide if Whitewater hearings are worth pursuing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 10 minutes, 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to be very clear with respect to \nthe reasonableness of the issue that is before us. When Senate \nResolution 120 was adopted, it was adopted and encompassed within it \ncertain premises, all of which are now being departed from or violated \nby the proposal offered by the Senator from New York.\n  The first premise was that there would be a fixed deadline in the \nproposal that would seek to keep the inquiry out of the election year. \nThat was the February 29 date, and it was agreed to.\n  We had overwhelming bipartisan support for the resolution that was \nadopted last year for this inquiry. Regrettably, the majority has now \ngone down a different track and made impossible, up to this juncture, a \nfurther bipartisan concord with respect to this matter.\n  Senate Resolution 120 was consistent with Senate precedents. The \nproposal that is now before us is a complete departure from Senate \nprecedents. The proposal last year for a fixed-ending\n\n[[Page S1932]]\n\ndate reflected the very argument that Senator Dole made in 1987 with \nrespect to Iran-Contra, where some Democrats wanted to extend it into \nthe election year and he said that would not be a fair and reasonable \nthing to do. Senator Inouye and others accepted that proposition, and \nthey put on a deadline. It is very important that that be understood. \nThe proposal before us departs from that essential premise.\n  Second, this committee had only 1 day of hearings in the last 2 weeks \nof its existence in the latter part of February. In Iran-Contra, we \nheld 21 days of hearings in the last 23 days in order to complete the \nwork. The distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, wrote to \nSenator Dole in mid-January saying the committee should intensify its \nwork through the balance of January and through February in order to \ncomplete on schedule. The committee did not do that.\n  Third, this resolution premises that there will be consultation \nbetween the majority and the minority. In fact, we had such \nconsultation in the formulation of Senate Resolution 120, and when it \nwas brought to the floor, it had been worked out on the basis of \ndiscussions between the majority and the minority. That has not taken \nplace in this instance. In fact, Senator Daschle's letter to Senator \nDole remained unanswered for a month period. I know Senator Dole was \ndistracted with other matters, but nevertheless, we are still left with \nthe problem with which we are confronted.\n  Finally, I want to underscore that the Office of Independent Counsel \nwill continue its inquiry. It was an essential premise of the original \nresolution that we would not come in behind the independent counsel \nand, in fact, Chairman D'Amato and I wrote to Mr. Starr at the \nbeginning of October to make that very point. It was strongly argued \nthat extending it out would turn it political.\n  Now it is becoming political; we simply have to recognize that. There \nare editorials around the country that are beginning to say that--here \nis one from Greensboro:\n\n       A legitimate probe is becoming a partisan sledgehammer. The \n     Senate Whitewater hearings, led since last July by Senator \n     D'Amato, have served their purpose. It's time to wrap this \n     thing up before the election season.\n\n  One from a Sacramento paper:\n\n       Senator D'Amato, the chairman of the Senate Whitewater \n     Committee and chairman of Senator Bob Dole's Presidential \n     campaign in New York, wants to extend his hearings \n     indefinitely or at least, one presumes, until after the \n     November election. In this case, the Democrats have the best \n     of the argument by a country mile. With every passing day, \n     the hearings have looked more like a fishing expedition in \n     the Dead Sea.\n\n  The minority leader, Senator Daschle, has made a very reasonable \nproposal.\n  The proposal for an indefinite extension, or this 4 months, which \namounts to the same thing, is not reasonable. It is not consistent with \nthe premises on which we got an overwhelming bipartisan consensus to \npass the initial inquiry resolution.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member of the committee has \nsaid it so well and ably. I applaud him for making the case once more \nprior to the time we are called upon to cast our vote this afternoon. \nThere is very little one can add to what he has said so well.\n  This is an unprecedented request. Everyone needs to be fully \nappreciative of the nature of what it is we are called upon to vote on \nhere--an unprecedented request, an open-ended, unlimited request to \ncontinue this investigation forever if the majority chooses to do so--\nforever. There is no deadline, none whatsoever.\n  So, Mr. President, we have looked back to try to find some other \noccasion when a committee has sought that kind of authority to say, \n``We don't know whether we're going to take a week, a month, 2 months, \nthe rest of the session. We may even need to go into the next Congress. \nWho knows? What we do know is that we're not going to give you any \nspecific timeframe within which we realistically think we can finish \nthis investigation.''\n  So what does that tell you, Mr. President? What it tells me is that \nthey want to keep open the option to take this right up until the very \nlast day of this Presidential campaign. We are unwilling to accept \nthat. We have indicated, in as clear a way as we possibly can, that we \nwant to find a way to resolve this once and for all. We want a way to \nfind a resolution in the amount of time and the amount of money to be \ndedicated to this investigation, even though now we anticipate more \nthan $32 million in total, within the Congress and within the special \ninvestigation that is ongoing, has already been dedicated to this.\n  If we need to spend another $100,000, another $130,000, $140,000, we \nwill do that. Our amendment suggests $185,000. Our amendment suggests \nthat the investigation go on at least through April 3, and then gives \nthe opportunity to write a report through May 10.\n  If we had used every day we had available to us, if the committee had \ntaken the opportunity that they had available to them in using Mondays \nand Fridays and days throughout the week for which they chose not to \nhave any hearings, we would not have to extend it. But for whatever \nreason, the committee chose not to meet on a lot of Mondays, they chose \nnot to meet on virtually every Friday. There were a lot of days during \nthe week, for whatever reason, they chose not to meet.\n  So it was not that we did not have the time. We simply did not use \nthe time very wisely. And the majority, if they could do it over again, \nI am sure, would use that time more wisely. But now, to say that is the \nreason we want to carry this thing out forever is just unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, the second point I emphasize is that we have made a \ngood-faith offer. That offer stands, although I will say that the clock \nis ticking. We are simply not going to extend this thing out over and \nover farther and farther just because we are not able to resolve this \ndifference today. The clock is ticking. The calendar pages are turning. \nThe offer that we have been given is unacceptable. The counteroffer, \nthis notion that somehow we now could go 4 or 5 months longer, is also \nunacceptable. We do not want to make this a convention issue. We do not \nwant to make it a Presidential campaign issue. We want to get the \nfacts. We want to resolve these matters. We want to resolve this issue \nonce and for all.\n  We can do that in a time certain. We can do that in a bipartisan way. \nWe can do that working together to make the best use of the time, \nwhatever additional time is requested. We can do all of that. But we \nhave to resolve this matter. The standoff that we are in today is \nunacceptable. We do not like it. We know the majority does not like it. \nSo let us sit down and try to find a way to resolve it. But let us \nrecognize an unlimited request or any request that takes us into \npolitical conventions and the campaign season for 1996 is unacceptable, \ntoo.\n  So, Mr. President, reluctantly, I urge my colleagues once more to \nvote against this cloture motion. I believe that we will continue to be \nable to defeat the cloture motion for whatever length of time this \nunreasonable request is, the one before us. We can resolve it this \nafternoon. It is time we do so.\n  It is time we get on with the real business of the Senate. I hope we \ncan do it sooner rather than later. I yield the floor and yield the \nremainder of our time.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, earlier today the majority leader sent \nto the desk two amendments relating to Bosnia on behalf of myself and \nhim. I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain and Senator Burns be \nadded as cosponsors to both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the first amendment regarding Bosnia, \nconditions the obligation of funds in this supplemental upon a \ncertification that all foreign fighters, including Iranians are out of \nBosnia, in compliance with the Dayton Accords.\n  Let me describe each amendment, turning first to foreign troops.\n  Article III of annex 1A is absolutely clear--Let me read it into the \nRecord. This is part of the Dayton Accords. It says:\n\n       All forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina as of the date this \n     Annex enters into force which are not of local origin, \n     whether or not they are legally and militarily subordinated \n     to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federation of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina or the Republic of Srpska, shall be \n     withdrawn together with their equipment from the territory of \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina within 30 days.\n\n  Just to make abundantly clear so that there was no misunderstanding \nof just what we meant by this provision, the annex spells out who was \naffected by this requirement. The accord explicitly states:\n\n       In particular, all foreign forces, including individual \n     advisors, freedom fighters, trainers, volunteers, and \n     personnel from neighboring and other states, shall be \n     withdrawn from the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  In a December hearing before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee \non Foreign Operations, Assistant Secretary Holbrooke reiterated the \n``high importance'' the administration attached to full compliance with \nthis provision.\n  Let me cite his testimony:\n\n       It is imperative that the commitment made to have these \n     elements removed be honored. They have said publicly they \n     will do so . . . President Clinton raised this directly with \n     President Izetbegovic in Paris.\n\n  During questioning he noted that Iranian and other freedom fighters \nwere concentrated in the sector where United States troops are \noperating, ``so we are going to be watching this extremely carefully.''\n  When I asked Secretary Holbrooke what happens if they choose not to \ngo, his answer was absolutely unequivocal:\n\n       Choose not go go? This is the Bosnian government's home \n     turf. This is the core of the Federation position. It is not \n     their choice. If the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina says \n     they will go, then either they go or the Bosnian government \n     was not sincere in what it said. They must get them out and \n     we will know if they are out or not . . . President \n     Izetbegovic has publicly committed himself, not only to the \n     public and the press, but to the President.\n\n  The deadline for the withdrawal has now come and gone. January 19 \npassed with Iranian's terrorist forces still operating in the American \npatrolled sector.\n  Secretary Christopher acknowledged the administration's ongoing \nconcern about this issue during an appearance on the McNeil-Lehrer Show \non January 23. At that time, he said:\n\n       We will not go forward with the equipment and training \n     unless they are in compliance with the agreement. They'll not \n     have a right to the reconstruction fund unless they are in \n     compliance with the agreement.\n\n  At the time, I was reassured that the administration shared the view \nmany of us have here in Congress--Iranian troops represented a direct \nthreat to American soldiers and to American long-term interests in \nstability.\n\n[[Page S1934]]\n\n  Yet shortly after the Secretary's remarks, NATO soldiers raided a \nhouse near Sarajevo and detained 11 people with a cache of weapons, \nammunition and explosives. According to a senior State Department \nofficial, news accounts indicated five were Iranians believed to have \nalready left the country, yet they were clearly involved in plotting \nattacks on NATO installations.\n  This past week, the Washington Post reported that members of the \nIranian Interior Ministry are among the 150 or so men running vie to \nseven training camps. Western officials believe Iranian Revolutionary \nGuards joined by volunteers from across the Islamic world are engaged \nin building a secret security organization called the Agency for \nInvestigation and Documentation.\n  U.S. Navy Adm. Leighton Smith conceded in a recent interview that the \nforces were of immediate concern to the security of American soldiers \nand cited the loss of 248 marines in Beirut in a suicide bomber attack.\n\n  In addition to our security concerns, Iranian forces and their role \nin the Agency for Investigation and Documentation directly undermine \nprospects for continuation of the Moslem-Croat Federation. In a letter \nto Izetbegovic, Federation President Kresimir Zubak said the Agency was \n``in direct opposition to the constitution of the federation and the \nlaw.''\n  He, like others are deeply worried that the agency will be used to \nharass and investigate Izetbegovic's political opponents and over the \nlong run, encourage the movement toward a separate Moslem state, a goal \nIran has long pursued.\n  There are a number of other disturbing signs that President \nIzetbegovic is moving in this direction. However, the immediate concern \nwe should all have is the continued presence of Iranian Revolutionary \nGuards.\n  In the last several days, administration officials seem to have \nabandoned the linkage drawn by the Secretary on January 23 between full \ncompliance and economic and military aid. They are now asserting that \nwe will only hold up plans to equip and train the Bosnians.\n  This is a decision which is bound to backfire. Withholding military \nsupport and training will only drive the Bosnian Moslems closer to \nIran, a nation unfortunately viewed as one of the few reliable partners \nduring the years that the embargo imposed an unfair disadvantage on \ntheir government and people.\n  Moreover, if not a part of a broader strategy, withholding only \nmilitary support will call American credibility and commitment to the \nFederation into question. It will be seen as an excuse to reinstate the \nadministration's long standing position opposing lifting the embargo. \nAfter all, only when faced with the imminent prospect of a \ncongressional vote to lift the embargo, did the President make the \ncommitment to move forward with a meaningful program to assure the \nBosnian Federation receives the assistance necessary to achieve an \nadequate military balance prior to IFOR's departure.\n  If we are serious about the presence of foreign troops in Bosnia, and \nI certainly believe we should be, then we must use all necessary and \nappropriate diplomatic, economic, and security tools we have available \nto press for full compliance.\n\n  I believe the amendment Senator Dole and I have offered sends a clear \nsignal that the Congress expects full compliance with the Dayton \naccords if we are to move forward with this $200 million supplemental.\n  I think it is worth noting that none of the funds we have designated \nfor emergency humanitarian programs would be affected by this \namendment. In fact, $339 million provided in the fiscal year 1996 \nforeign operations appropriations bill for a variety of activities and \nprograms would still be available.\n  We are simply withholding a portion of our total commitment to assure \ncompliance with a provision of the Dayton accord which has an immediate \nimpact on the well being of our troops and a long-term affect on the \nviability of the Federation and peace.\n  The second amendment Senator Dole sent to the desk earlier today on \nbehalf of myself and him, supports the broad goals and plans the \nPresident outlined in his Oval Office address announcing the commitment \nof U.S. troops. In separating the belligerents and patrolling the cease \nfire zone, he said the United States would ``help create a secure \nenvironment so that the people of Bosnia can return to their homes, \nvote in free elections, and begin to rebuild their lives.''\n  While many of us opposed the deployment of our troops, we now hope \nthat they succeed in accomplishing this mission. I think every one of \nus also supports the President's determination to assure the mission is \nlimited in nature and fulfilled within the year. Above all else, we are \ncommitted to protecting the security of our forces.\n  The amendment before the Senate advances these goals.\n  First, it requires that the funds in this supplemental may only be \nmade available for projects and activities in Sarajevo and the sector \nwhere Americans are assigned. It also establishes that in making \nfunding allocations, priority consideration should be given to projects \nidentified by the Department of the Army on the so-called Task Force \nEagle Civil Military Project List.\n  This list is a catalog of specific activities designating both the \nlocation and type of assistance necessary. The task force has \nidentified a wide range of activities including the repair of roads, \nbridges, and railroads, and rebuilding municipal electricity, water, \ntelecommunications, and sewer systems.\n  Although costs have not been assessed for each project--which will \nclearly have an impact on deciding which to pursue--the report makes \nclear that every project has been deemed urgently needed.\n  No other agency has been able to produce as comprehensive an \nassessment of Bosnia's urgent priorities. Since the administration \ndeemed this supplemental an urgent emergency, designating these \nidentified projects as high priorities will expedite the process of \nobligating funds and hopefully have an immediate, visible, and \neffective impact. My expectation is that by improving economic \nconditions in the American sector we will reduce the level of tension \nand stimulate popular support, which, in turn, should lower the \nsecurity risks to our soldiers.\n  I should make one point perfectly clear. This amendment affects only \nthe $200 million provided in this bill. An additional $339 million \nappropriated in 1995 and 1996 are not subject to these conditions or \npriorities. We have exempted the early appropriations because much of \nthose funds are for emergency humanitarian activities which we in no \nway wish to impede or redirect. To date, these short-term, quick impact \nefforts have been very successful and should be continued.\n\n  It is my view that focusing the supplemental resources on the area in \nwhich United States troops are assigned and targeting projects that the \nArmy has already identified as ready for funding enhances stability in \nBosnia and strengthens the chances of achieving an early exit. While I \nhave opposed setting a specific date for departure, I support the \nPresident's objective to complete the mission within a year. The \neffective administration of our aid contributes to this exit strategy.\n  There are a few other provisions in the amendment worthy of note. The \nadministration has indicated it intends to deposit $65 million in a \nCroation-owned bank in Bosnia, convert the money to German marks and \nextend loans to small- and medium-sized businesses to generate jobs and \nincome. I have made my reluctance to support this idea clear to AID in \nlarge part because there are no clear accountability mechanisms to \nprevent fraud or abuses. Blank checks to foreign banks invite trouble.\n  To solve this problem, the amendment requires the bank which will be \nthe beneficiary of this substantial deposit to grant GAO access to \naudit the flow of U.S. funds. I am hopeful this will address \ncongressional concerns about accountability while allowing the \nadministration to test the merits of this approach.\n  Finally, the amendment offers the administration leverage in \ndiscussions with our friends and allies over their contributions to \nreconstruction. Late last year, the World Bank estimated Bosnian \nreconstruction would cost approximately $6 billion. The administration \ntestified that half of the necessary funds would come from multilateral\n\n[[Page S1935]]\n\nlending institutions such as the European Bank and the World Bank. The \nbalance would be derived from bilateral donations, of which we have now \npledged $539 million or roughly 20 percent.\n\n  So far, the pledging by other nations, especially our European allies \nhas been anemic. I think it is important that they understand that we \nwill not shoulder this burden alone. Thus, the amendment requires the \nPresident to certify that the total of bilateral contributions pledged \nby other donors must match our level of support. Failing that test, we \nshould suspend obligation of supplemental funds. Here again, the \nemergency humanitarian program will not be affected.\n  Finally, the amendment makes clear that no funds may be made \navailable to support building or refurbishing of housing in areas where \nrefugees or displaced people are refused the right to return based on \nethnicity or political party affiliation. As Senator Dole points out, \nit makes no sense to use our limited resources to endorse or sanction \nwhat amounts to a variation of the repugnant practice of ethnic \ncleansing.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by stating this amendment accomplishes \nthree goals. It improves the operating environment where our troops are \nassigned thereby enhancing their safety, it targets the aid to support \nidentified, ready-to-go projects improving prospects for success, and \nthe combination of fulfilling those two goals contributes to achieving \nthe third and most important--the timely withdrawal of U.S. troops.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments.\n  I hope both of these amendments will be approved when they are \nactually submitted for a vote to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3483 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  I send it on behalf of Senators Kerry, Wellstone, Daschle, \nLautenberg, Levin, and Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, \n     and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 3483 to \n     amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 8, add after ``basis.'':\n\n\n                  community oriented policing services\n\n       For public safety and community policing grants pursuant to \n     Title I of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \n     of 1994 (Public Law 103-322) and related administration \n     costs, $1,788,000,000, to remain available until expended, \n     which shall be derived from the Violent Crime Reduction Trust \n     Fund.\n       On page 29, line 2, strike all after ``(`the 1990 Act');'' \n     through ``That'' on page 29 line 18 and insert in lieu \n     thereof: ``$1,217,200,000, to remain available until \n     expended, which shall be derived from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund; of which''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have spoken with the White House, and the \nPresident agrees that the only course to be taken on the 100,000 COPS \nProgram is an unequivocal and unwavering support for adding 100,000 \ncops to our streets.\n  The irony of all ironies is, in my view, that after the years that \nSenator Kerry, Senator Wellstone, and others of us have fought for this \nprogram, we heard repeatedly--I mean, if I heard it once, I heard it a \nhundred times on this floor--``This isn't really going to be 100,000 \ncops.''\n  I watched Charlton Heston on TV in paid television advertisements. He \nwould say, ``This is a phony thing. It is not 100,000 cops. This will \nnot produce more than 20,000 additional police officers. It just simply \nis not''--and he went on and on and on and on.\n  I heard repeatedly from my Republican colleagues that all this was \nabout was adding welfare workers. This was adding welfare social \nworkers and no hard police enforcement.\n  We have only been doing this about a year, and we now have a total in \nthe United States of America--and I will be repeating some of these \nnumbers, because they warrant repeating--totally funded so far are \n34,114 additional cops; direct hiring, 20,236; and the so-called COPS \nMore Program, 12,678.\n  Bottom line, Mr. President, is more than 33,000 police officers are \non the streets who would not otherwise have been on the streets doing \ncommunity policing and have already been funded.\n  What is more, the results of the Community Policing Program, which \nall of my colleagues know now ad nauseam because the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I have been--for how many years now, I ask the \nSenator from Massachusetts, 5, 6 years we have been talking about \ncommunity policing?\n  Because of community policing, because of the requirement that in \norder to get a single additional federally paid local police officer \nyour whole department has to be involved in community policing, the \nresults of these additional 33,000 police officers have been leveraged \nin a way that was not imagined by many. It was by the Senator from \nMinnesota, and that is, if you had a police force of five cops in a \nsmall town and they are not involved in community policing, in order to \nget one additional cop that you need, you have to put the other five in \ncommunity policing. We have leveraged six cops into community policing, \nwhere there was none before, by merely one additional police officer.\n  Mr. President, there was only a total of about 525,000 local police \nofficers before this began. There are those of us on this side, and I \ncan speak for the President in this regard--and I seldom ever do that--\nbottom line is we want to make sure there are an additional 100,000 \ncops on the street when this is over, so we end up with 600,000-plus \nlocal police officers. As a result of what we have already done so far, \ncommunity policing speaks for itself. More cops means less crime.\n\n  You know, there is not a lot we know about crime. We all think we \nknow about it. We think we do not have to know the facts. I heard \nsomeone say--actually I heard Senator Simpson say it--everyone is \nentitled to their own opinion, but not entitled to their own facts. He \nwas talking about something other than this, but the facts are that \nthere is not a lot we know for certain about law enforcement and the \ncriminal psyche.\n  But one thing we do know. If you have a cop standing on this corner \nand no cop on the adjacent corner and there is a crime that is going to \nbe committed in that intersection, it will be committed on the corner \nwhere there is no cop. That is all we know. We think we know a lot of \nother things, but that we do know. So we need more cops.\n  To cite just one specific example, look what is happening in New York \nCity. More police devoted to community policing has proven to mean less \ncrime. In the first 6 months of 1995, compared to the first 6 months of \n1994, let me read the statistics: Murder is down by 30 percent, robbery \nis down by 22 percent, burglary is down by 18 percent, car theft is \ndown by 25 percent.\n  In the face of that success in fighting America's crime epidemic, it \nseems to me it would be folly to go back on our commitment of adding \nthe remaining 67,000 cops called for under this crime law to the list. \nAs a former President used to say, in a different context, ``If it \nain't broke, don't fix it.'' Well, the COPS Program is working. It is \nnot broke. It is fixing things.\n  Why are we doing what this legislation calls for, backing off of that \ncommitment in both dollars and numbers and the requirement that local \nofficials use this money to hire cops? That, unfortunately, is exactly \nwhat this latest continuing resolution proposes to do. Instead of fully \nfunding the President's request for the 100,000 COPS Program, this \nlatest proposal would slash the 1996 request of the COPS Program to \n$975 million, about one-half of the $1.9 billion called for.\n  Let me go back and review the bidding here just a little bit. That is \nthat, unlike any other program, we set up a trust fund to fund these \ncops. We are not talking about new taxes here. We are talking about we \nmade a commitment, with the help of the Senator from Texas, Senator \nGramm, over 1\\1/2\\\n\n[[Page S1936]]\n\nyears ago, that we were going to cut the size of the Federal Government \nwork force instead of letting it continue to grow as it did under two \nRepublican Presidents with the help of Democratic Congresses.\n  What happened was we have kept that commitment. We have essentially \ntaken a check that we were paying the Federal bureaucrat--I do not use \nthat word in a derisive way, but in which we paid a Federal employee--\nwhen that person left Federal employment, we did not hire one; we took \nthat check and sent it back home for folks to hire cops. We traded \nbureaucrats for cops.\n  Now, here we are, with money in the till under that program, and \neffectively defunding by $1 billion the request for money for cops. Not \nonly is the 100,000 COPS Program subject to extreme cuts, but the \nlatest continuing resolution also makes nearly $813 million of that \nmoney that is supposed to go to the 100,000 COPS Program to fund those \ncops into what we call down here--and we think everybody at home \nunderstands it--we call it a block grant.\n\n  You know what a block grant is? A block grant for this is like the \nold LEAA program, Law Enforcement Assistance Act. When I first got \nhere, one of the first things I did--I remember I had gotten in great \ntrouble with a senior Democrat named John McClellan from the State of \nArkansas. I had the temerity to come to the floor and introduce \nlegislation doing away with LEAA because I had been a local official, \nand I know how it works. We would sit around the county council \nmeetings in my State--which is the largest representative body in my \nState in this particular county I represented--and we would say, ``You \nknow something? We can save the county taxpayers' money.'' And a guy \nnamed Doug Buck, he and the county administrator said, ``Here we have X \nnumber of firemen,'' or X number of policemen in this case, ``on the \ncounty payroll. We'll fire half of them, we'll fire them, cut the \nbudget. We'll tell the local taxpayers we're cutting the budget. And \nwe'll take that Federal money for cops, and we'll rehire them. We'll \nrehire them with Federal money.''\n  So what happened was all of us, as local officials, could go home and \nsay, ``You know, we didn't raise your taxes. We cut your taxes, and you \ndidn't lose any services.'' But what happened was you did not get one \nadditional cop. No new cops. The community was not one whit safer, but, \nboy, we local officials, we loved it. We thought it was a great idea. \nThat is what a block grant is.\n  If you look at the language, I say to my Republican friends, if you \nlook at the language closely under the block grant, the local officials \ncan take this block grant money and they do not have to hire a cop with \nit, they can go out and use it for anything they think impacts on law \nenforcement. They can hire a public defender with it. They say, Who \nwould do that? Well, the folks in Pennsylvania would do that. The folks \nin Delaware would do that. We both know it. You know why they do that? \nBecause the local folks do not like telling the local taxpayers they \nare taking their tax money to hire a public defender. They do not want \nto do that. They know that is not a popular thing. But they know they \nhave to have public defenders. They do not want to tell them they are \ntaking the money to hire judges. They know that is not popular. So what \ndo they do? They will take the Federal money and they will hire the \npublic defender.\n  I say to my friend presiding in the chair, if this prevails, I will \nmake him a bet--and anyone else in here--Pittsburgh; Scranton; \nWilmington, DE; my hometown of Scranton, PA, Democrat, Republican, \nIndependent alike will find a way to make sure that locally they look \nlike they are getting tough, but there will not be more cops.\n\n  I support the public defender program. I think we need more judges. I \nthink we need more protection. I think we need more social workers at \nthe prisons. But let me tell you what I know I need: I need more cops. \nI need more cops in Delaware. Scranton, PA, needs more cops. Dagsboro, \nDE, needs more police protection. But that is not what will happen. So, \n$813 million that is supposed to go directly to hire new cops--do not \npass go--go straight to hiring a cop, now can be used as a block grant. \nThe approach just is not right. This so-called law enforcement block \ngrant is written so broadly that money can be spent on everything from \nprosecutors to probation officers to traffic lights and parking meters, \nwithout having to hire a single cop. And that is not an exaggeration.\n  I challenge anyone on this floor or back in their offices listening \nor Senator's staff who are listening, go in and tell your boss, ``Come \nto the floor and debate Biden.'' If you can prove to me that you cannot \nlocally, with this block grant, go out and buy parking meters or get a \nprobation officer, if you can come and tell me that, I will stand \ncorrected. But until that, understand, all my tough colleagues, \nDemocrat and Republican, who are getting tough on crime, you are \nsending money back home to hire probation officers. The same outfit \nthat was worried that the Biden crime bill which became law would be \nsoft and hire all these social workers, now apparently are concerned \nbecause you really are hiring cops. I guess you all want to hire those \nsocial workers. I guess that is what you all are about. That is what \nyou want to be able to do.\n  Now, if you do not want to do that, amend this on the floor and say \nthe block grant cannot be used--cannot be used--for anything--and I \nwill give you a list--from parking meters to probation officers, to \ncourts, to judges. Did you ever ask yourself, those who are listening, \nwhy this block grant is so broad? Well, it is because, I guess, we do \nnot like having all these extra cops.\n  Second, the block grant has never been authorized by the Senate. My \nfriends on the Appropriations Committee like to talk about how they \nfollow the process. Well, let me tell you, we know the Judiciary \nCommittee--to the best of my knowledge, neither House ever authorized \nthis. Let us be clear about what is being done here.\n  What this continuing resolution does is take the crime bill that has \nbeen passed by only one House, the House of Representatives, whose \nfunds have been authorized only by the House, whose block grant ideas \nalready have been rejected by the Senate. We have come at this a couple \ntimes in direct legislation. A couple of times I have come to the floor \nand we have debated it, and I have won. Not I have won, my position has \nwon. Now we find it back in the appropriations bill. The block grant \nidea has already been rejected by the Senate and incorporated into an \nappropriations bill, so it is passed and funded all in one fell swoop, \ninstead of people standing on the floor here saying, ``I don't want to \nfund COPS.''\n  Mr. President, we are going to legislate by fiat like this. If we are \ngoing to do that, then we might as well do away with the committees, \nwith hearings, with subcommittee markups, with full committee markups, \nwith careful consideration of authorizing legislation and with \nlegislating in the sunshine.\n  I understand why you put it in the bill this way. You put it in the \nbill this way, in an appropriations bill in a continuing resolution, \nbecause then you can say, ``I tell you what, I did not vote to cut \nthose cops. Not me. I voted for that big continuing resolution, but I \nhad no choice. We had to do that. We had to keep the Government \ngoing.''\n  ``It was not me, Charlie.''\n  ``Honest to God, Mabel, I know your store got held up three times. \nYou did not get the four cops.''\n  Let me give you an idea here. I will not take the time to submit the \nchart, but I will just give you a list of the pending requests that \nexist. I will repeat this again: Already more than half a billion \ndollars is pending in requests. Remember Republicans said local \nofficials would not want this money, they would not come and ask for it \nbecause they kick in their own money? I know my friend from \nMassachusetts, a former prosecutor, understands this one. What are the \nreasons we wrote it this way? We knew cops were more popular than \nmayors. So they go, and the chief of police would say, ``Mr. Mayor, got \ngood news. We can get 75 grand from the Federal Government. The bad \nnews is we have to come up with 50 or 60 or 70, depending on the cost \nand size of the jurisdiction.''\n  The mayor always said, ``I don't know. I don't want to do that.''\n  ``No problem. We will tell the folks we do not want the Federal \nmoney.''\n  It happened twice in my State already. Guess what? The city council, \ncounty council, could not take the heat when the public found out they \ncould\n\n[[Page S1937]]\n\nget the money and they were not asking for it. Well, guess what? Mr. \nPresident, 7,766 cops beyond the 33,000 are already requested and \npending. That means the town councils, the city councils, the county \ncouncils have already sat down and made the hard decision that they \nwill keep a commitment to hire a cop for another 5 years and have to \npay half the freight in doing that. They did it.\n\n  Take a look. In the State of Delaware, we already have something like \n120 new cops already. We only have an entire police force, if you count \nevery cop in the State, about 1,500 in the whole State. We have some \npending. In the State of Massachusetts there are 276 cops asked for, \nformally requested, ready to be certified. In the State of Minnesota, \n100 cops, 7 million bucks, an additional 100. The State of \nPennsylvania, 280 cops. Say we turn this to a block grant. That will be \nlike water going through your hands. You will not get 280 cops in \nPennsylvania or 400-some cops in Massachusetts, and so on, because \nthere will be other priorities.\n  I, for one, happen to believe that is a terrible way to proceed, and \nthat is through this block grant approach on COPS. That is reason \nenough for me to oppose the bill all by itself. If the Republicans want \nto change the crime bill, they have a right to try that, but we should \ndo it the right way and have a vote on it. Wiping out a major piece of \nthis most significant anticrime legislation to ever pass the Congress \non an appropriations bill makes a mockery of the Senate process. The \nimportance of the program we are considering, not to mention the \nperception of our institution, I think, demands better.\n  Before turning to specific problems with the so-called law \nenforcement block grants, let me preview the specific success of the \n100,000 COPS Program. I do not know a single responsible police leader, \nacademic expert, or public official, who does not agree that putting \nmore police officers on our streets is the single best, more effective, \nimmediate way to fight crime. Community policing enables police to \nfight crime on two fronts at once: They are better positioned to \nrespond and apprehend suspects when the crime occurs; but, more \nimportantly, they are in a better position to keep crime from occurring \nin the first place.\n  I have seen this work in my home State of Delaware where community \npolicing in Wilmington, DE, taking the form of foot patrols aimed at \nbreaking up street level drug dealing, is turning the city of \nWellington and neighborhoods into a combat zone. The efforts \nsuccessfully put a lid on drug activity, without displacing it to other \nparts of the city.\n  In practice, community policing takes many forms. Regardless of the \nneed of a particular community, the reports from the field are the \nsame: It works, it works, it works, it works. I am delighted to debate \nanybody who wants to come and make the case that community policing \ndoes not work. I will stand here as long as anybody wants and come back \nafter I yield to my friend from Massachusetts. I will hang around for \nanybody who wants to make the argument to me that community policing \ndoes not work. I would love to hear it. I would love to hear it.\n  I suspect no one will come and make that argument, and no one will \ncome to the floor and say we need fewer cops, and no one will come to \nthe floor and tell me, no, they do not want more cops in their home \nState. No one will come to the floor and tell me that they want more of \nthis COPS money to hire probation officers. No one, I suspect, will \ntell me that.\n  That is what this all does. That is what it does. The 1994 crime law \ntargets $8.8 billion for States and localities to train and hire \n100,000 new police officers over 6 years. Now, we will all remember the \ncriticism of last year's program, the COPS Program. Republicans in \nCongress got Charlton Heston to go and say there will never be more \nthan 20,000 cops, and ``Moses'' Heston could not have been more wrong.\n  As indicated, we already have 33,000 new local cops--not Federal \ncops, local cops--only after 1 year. Because of the way we set it up \nwith the match requirement in spreading out the cost over a period of a \nyear, the money will continue to work and keep working for cops on the \nbeat well into the future. This is not just 1 year the cops have been \nat it. The progress will come to a screeching halt if my Republican \ncolleagues have their way.\n  The continuing resolution includes new enforcement block grants. They \ncall it new enforcement block grants, which has loopholes so big that \nit would prevent all the money to be spent without hiring a single \npolice officer--not one. Read the proposal. Money is sent not to the \npolice, as it is now, but to the mayors. The money may be used not only \nfor the cops but also for other types of law enforcement officers or \nanything that ``improves public safety.'' Moreover, the money can be \nused for other vaguely defined purposes such as ``equipment technology \nand other material.''\n  Now, look, I am not trying to pick on local officials. They know what \nthey need. They do not have to ask for a single cop. They do not have \nto ask for any of this. Let me point out, we are emasculating local \nbudgets. As the Federal share of local budgets go, we are throwing many \nof our cities and States into chaos by our unwillingness to come up \nwith some rational plan. Now, you are sitting there as a mayor; you \nalready lost a significant portion of what used to be Federal funding \nfor other programs, and now you have to make some tough choices. You \nhave to make these really tough choices because you have less money and \nno growing tax base. Do you think you will put all the money into cops \nlike we required to be done? What do you think? I wonder what the \ncitizens back home who might listen to this think will happen? I wonder \nwhether or not the mayor and the county executive and others, Democrat \nand Republican, would conclude it is better for us to spend this money \non improvements of public safety because we need new traffic lights, we \nneed new parking meters, we need new lights in the local playground, \nall of which are legitimate. They do not put a single cop on the \nstreet.\n\n  Let me repeat, under the Republican proposal, the dollars can be \ndiverted to prosecutors, courts, public safety, and public safety \nofficials. In addition, the block grants require any money spent for \ndrug courts, crime prevention, law enforcement, educational expenses, \nsecurity measures, or rural crime task forces be taken out of the money \nto hire new cops.\n  I see my friend from Utah just walking on the floor. He and I worked \nawful hard to make sure the rural crime task forces were funded and \nrural crime money--as I know my friend from Minnesota knows better than \nmost of us here, rural crime is growing faster than urban crime, with \nless resources and training and capability to deal with it. That is why \nit is growing. That is where the drug cartels are moving. That is why \nthe drug operations are moving to those areas. What do we do here? \nRight now, in the crime law that exists, there is money separately for \nrural law enforcement, separately for the drug courts, separately for \nall these things. This is the pea in the shell game of all the block \ngrant stuff that relates to the money part of it. We are going to give \nyou a block grant, give you more flexibility, and that is the good news \nif you are a local official. Even they like the good news. Here comes \nthe bad news: Add it all up and it is less money overall. Less money is \ngoing home. A lot less money is going home. So they may think they can \nhire prosecutors and put in street lights with assets of hiring cops. \nBut they have to do everything else they were going to do with less \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, look at the language of the bill. Not one new cop is \nrequired. All it says is--I am quoting--``Recipients are encouraged to \nuse these funds to hire additional law enforcement officers.'' \nEncouraged to use these funds. That is a very strong directive, is it \nnot? Encouraged. That is encourage, not require.\n  Mr. President, American communities do not need our encouragement. \nThey need our help. They need more cops. We should not encourage the \nStates to keep the commitment this Congress made to the American \npeople. We should keep our word. We should keep our word. Let me also \npoint out that this block grant will also force American law \nenforcement to wait for these dollars. It will take the better part of \na year to draft regulations, preparing application forms to get these \ndollars out the door.\n\n[[Page S1938]]\n\n  When we passed the crime bill last year, I did something that the \nAttorney General thought was a little strange. Two days after, I asked \nfor a meeting with her in my office, and I said, ``General, I really \nappreciate all your support on this bill.'' She was supportive and for \nit. I said, ``Now, General, we have to make sure of one thing--that you \nare able to reduce this application to one page.'' They looked at me \nlike I was nuts. My two colleagues here who know a lot about this know \nthat the cops at home only have to fill out a one-page application. \nThey do not have to go to the mayor, or to some grantsman, they do not \nhave to go through the Governor, they do not have to go through the \nState legislature, they do not have to fill out forms in triplicate. \nOne page. One. The cop sends it in. Guess who gets the answer? The cop. \nThe cop.\n\n  When I told the cops back home this was going to happen, they looked \nat me and said, ``Joe, I love you, you are always with us. But come on, \nwe did not think you would get this passed, but do not overpromise \nnow.'' Go back and ask your local law enforcement people how \ncomplicated this is. All my Republican friends are real interested in \nmaking sure we do away with redtape and regulations. Well, this is a \nprescription for redtape and regulation. This is a prescription for it. \nIf you want to delay it all, pass this.\n  The implementation of the 1994 crime law stands in stark contrast to \nthe typical scenario where you will have to go through drafting \nregulations, preparing additional forms, getting the dollars out the \ndoor, getting them to the mayor's office before they get to the cop's \noffice. It is a stark contrast. Instead of requiring the burdensome \napplication often filled with entire binders, one-page applications \nwere developed. Instead of waiting until the end of the year to \ndisburse the funds, the money was awarded in batches beginning only \nweeks after the passage of this law.\n  So let us not destroy the momentum. Let us not destroy our effort to \nadd 100,000 additional cops to protect our sons and daughters. I make a \nrecommendation with some timidity to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle. Go back home, find out every single cop that came to your State. \nYou can get the names of the cops who were hired under the Biden crime \nlaw. You can get the names. And then just ask at the end of the year \nhow many collars each of these cops made. Ask how many times the cop \nthat was hired under that bill saved some young girl from being raped, \narrested somebody who murdered somebody, broke up a drug ring working \non the street. Look at the specific actions they took and then, after \nyou do that, you come back and stand on the floor and you tell the \npeople of your State and all of us here that it did not matter, that \nthese additional cops did not matter. We down here talk in such broad \nstrokes about things that sometimes we miss it. This is real simple \nstuff. If they hire John Doe or Jane Smith as a local cop in your town, \nyour city, your county, just track them for a year. You tell me who \nwould have arrested that person who burglarized your house or stopped \nit were it not for that cop.\n  In a word, Mr. President, the law is working. The crime law is \nalready paid by the trust fund, is already being paid that way. Let me \njust add that the $30 billion crime law trust fund that uses the \nsavings from cutting 272,000 Federal bureaucrats pays for every cop, \nevery prison cell, every shelter for a battered woman and her child. \nThat is provided for in the crime law without adding a single penny to \nthe deficit or requiring one new penny in taxes.\n\n  The single-most important thing our communities need when it comes to \nfighting crime is more police. The current law guarantees that our \nmoney will be used for just that purpose. We should not abandon it, 1 \nyear after enacting it, especially in light of the spectacular results \nthat have already occurred. We must save the 100,000 COPS Program to \nensure that the money for police is used only for police. We should not \nretreat now on this tough but smart crime package that is already hard \nat work preventing violent crime across the country. We should not \nretreat on the 100,000 COPS Program that we insisted on just a few \nmonths ago in this Chamber.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President--and then I will yield to my friend from \nMassachusetts--I want to make it clear. It seems to me an absolute \ntravesty that we are out here trying to dismantle a law that nobody \neven attempted to make a case that it is not working. Not one single \nperson has come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to make the case that \nthis law is not working. I am anxious to hear and debate anyone who has \nthat point of view. Yet, we are dismantling, and instead of dismantling \nit, we should be building on it. We should be dealing with an issue my \nfriend from Minnesota knows about: violence among youth and the growing \ntrend of violent youthful behavior. The growing trend is that crime is \ndown in every category. The Senator from Utah and I are involved in a \nproject through his leadership to deal with youth violence in this \ncountry. We should be spending our time on that. I should be spending \nless time having to constantly defend a bill that nobody has made the \nargument that it is not working.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware, \nwho, when he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, shepherded the \nsingle-most comprehensive and important crime bill probably in this \ncentury, or ever, through the U.S. Senate. It was the first crime bill \nin history to comprehensively try to deal with the problem of crime in \nthis country.\n\n  Generally speaking, previously, we came to the floor and we had a \nbill that sought to deal with guns, or we had a bill that sought to \nbuild prisons, or a bill that sought to deal with drugs, and \noccasionally something like the LEAA that sought to do something with \nthe criminal justice system itself. But this was the first time, under \nthe leadership of Senator Biden, that we stood back and said, ``How do \nwe deal systemically with the problem of crime?'' To the credit of the \nU.S. Senate, we finally --after we got over the issue of guns--shed \nparty lines and shed the partisanship, and came up with a comprehensive \napproach to try to deal with crime. We put slightly less than $10 \nbillion into the building of prisons. We put up almost the same figure \ninto prevention, and almost the same figure into police officers.\n  What I think is most significant about the approach that we adopted \nis that we recognized something that has been building in this country \nfor perhaps 20 years and did something about it even as we recognized \nit. That is, specifically, we took note of the fact that for about 15 \nor 20 years we had been disarming our communities in this country. We \nhad been losing numbers of police officers, losing the ratio of police \nofficer to crime.\n  I think for any Member of the Senate who has spent time in the \ncriminal justice system--there are a number of us here who have done \nthat--or for anybody who spent a lot of time, like Senator Moynihan or \nothers, studying the relationship of values and other damaging trend \nlines in the disintegration of the fabric of our communities to law and \norder issues, I think most people have come to the conclusion that \nthere is a relationship between people in the community and their \nperception of how the law is applied and how it is enforced to their \nsense of justice, their sense of deterrence, their sense that there is \na linkage between the law and behavior.\n  Most people in America have been able to come to the conclusion that \nwhen you are properly administering the judicial system, when you have \nadequate police officers, when you have an adequate level of \ndeterrence, there really is a relationship to how people choose to \nbehave. That is no different from what we try to do in our schools at \nthe earliest stage. When the teacher is out of the classroom, kids tend \nto run amuck a little bit and take advantage of it. When the teacher \ncomes back in, usually to a greater degree or lesser degree, order is \nrestored and people begin to have a sense that there is an authority \nfigure there, and they know how to behave. The same is true at home. \nDepending on whether a babysitter is a strong, hard-nosed babysitter, \nor lax, or present or not present, at the refrigerator or the \ntelevision versus taking care of kids, kids will make decisions about \nhow to behave. It is no different in the rest of the world in which we \nlive. In a community,\n\n[[Page S1939]]\n\nwhen people perceive that there are not any officers of the law, they \nwrite the law. They take their behavior and start to do things that \nthere is no outside influence to suggest to them they should not do. It \nis so elementary that it almost defies the imagination that we are here \ndebating about it.\n  The word ``cop'' stands for constable on patrol. It is not rocket \nscience. We learned years ago in America when we were this great \nimmigrant nation welcoming people from everywhere that one of the great \nways in which we sort of brought people together was through the \nestablishment of a set of laws and a standard of behavior which people \nfollowed as a whole. One of the critical ingredients of that was the \ncop, the constable on patrol, the person walking down the street with a \nbilly stick in a uniform of blue who stood for the standards of that \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, during the 1960's and 1970's, we walked away from \nthat. We took police officers off the streets, literally, putting them \nboth into headquarters and into an automobile. We eliminated precinct \nafter precinct after precinct station in America. This was part of the \ngreat new policing and cost-saving consciousness of that particular \ntime period. What we did was kind of modeled our policing habits after \nthe general sort of living habits of Americans. We all went for the \nautomobile, and America moved its sense of community from the community \ninto this transient status which we are in, fairly well to do, where \npeople live in apartment buildings and do not even know each other. We \nhave neighbors in these apartment buildings who are utter strangers. We \nhave a whole new level of what we call stranger crime in America; \nmurders that are committed by people who never met their victims.\n\n  In fact, we have learned in the past few years in America--thanks \nfinally to our having required the Justice Department to report the \ntruth of who kills whom--we have learned that the great story about \nmost people committing murder being people who knew each other is a \nmyth. It is not true that most murders in America are committed in this \npassion between lovers or family disputes. We now know that in the last \n10 years in America, out of 200,000 or so murders, 100,000 of our \nfellow citizens were blown away by somebody they never met, an utter \nstranger. And we now know that, of those people who were murdered, two-\nfifths of their murderers have never set a foot across the threshold of \na police station--not for an inquiry, not for an arrest, and certainly \nnot for a prosecution.\n  That is why there is an increase of fear in America; that is why \nthere is an increase of anger in America; because the average citizen \nfeels this loss of freedom in this country. There is a dramatic loss of \nfreedom in the United States of America--still the freest country on \nthe face of the planet, but not the same free country that it used to \nbe where we felt that we could go anywhere, travel anywhere, go to a \nrestaurant, not have fear of our car being stolen, not having to pay \nextra money for insurance, not having to pay extra money for trauma in \nour hospitals, not having to pay for the price of this incredible wave \nof violence that has consumed our Nation.\n  What has happened at the same time as we have had this wave of \nviolence? We have diminished the number of police officers. In \ncommunity after community after community we have less police officers \non the streets of our country today than we did 15 and 20 years ago.\n  So here you have these two lines. One line is the increase in crime. \nIt is going up. The other line is the presence of police officers, and \nit is going down.\n  What is the message? The message is very clear. If you are a criminal \nand you know that the police cannot even respond to the current 911's, \nif you know that if there is a burglary or an armed robbery, that their \nability to track it down is limited because they are already having \ndifficulty filling out their own overtime because they are already \nhaving difficulty going to court for the number of court appearances \nthat they have to meet for the crimes already investigated, and they \nare having difficulty doing their patrols on the level that they ought \nto be doing them because, lo and behold, there are not enough officers \nto cover those patrols. What are you going to wind up sending as a \nmessage? The message has been crime pays. That is the message we have \nsent America--crime does pay.\n  All you have to do is talk to any hardened professional criminal out \nthere, and most of them will tell you that you just learn in the \nundercurrent and the subculture of crime in this country that that is \ntheir perception. It is their perception because we have never had a \nserious war on drugs in America. Why? Because we only treat 20 percent \nof the addicts in this country. So what is the message? The message to \n80 percent of the drug addicts of America is it does not make any \ndifference if you are lying in somebody's doorway drugged out; it does \nnot make any difference if you have committed your 50th household \nbreak-in to support your habit because there is nobody there to get you \noff your habit, and nobody to catch you for the crime you are \ncommitting.\n  Go to most cities and dial 911, and see what happens. We have had \ntales that baffle the imagination here in Washington where three blocks \naway from this Capitol people have dialed 911, and it took 20 minutes \nto half an hour for a cop to show up.\n  My wife was involved in an attempted robbery in the city of \nWashington a few months ago, stuck up by a man with a handgun, and a \nguy who happened to be driving by in his car called 911, reported it, \nand nobody showed up. And it was only thanks to that lucky citizen's \npresence that he took the license plate of the car that got away, and \nthey caught the person who did it.\n  In Boston a few months ago, we had a guy who started to run amok out \nin the street at night. The cop came up to him, the guy pulled a gun \nand shot the cop and started running down the street. He went around a \ncorner, but there happened to be an off-duty cop working a detail who \nheard it on his radio; he heard the call of what was happening, started \nlooking around, saw the guy, ran after him, and the guy went around the \ncorner and blew his own brains out before the cop got to him.\n  Another example in the 99 Restaurant in Charlestown just a few months \nago. Guys walked in the restaurant with guns in the middle of the day, \nin the middle of lunchtime and started firing away at five people \nsitting in a booth. I think there were four people killed. It might \nhave been five. I cannot remember--four anyway. Two guys come running \nout with their guns. They are taking off in the light of day, having \ncommitted murder, but two cops happened to be in the place eating, off \nduty again--off duty--and two other guys were out there, again off \nduty, on a detail. The four of them managed to make the arrest red-\nhanded, right there in the parking lot.\n  What happened? Cops off duty, cops not part of the regular duty \nhappened to be there. What is the message out of that? What is the \nmessage out of the cop who happens to be there when somebody runs amok \nin the street? The message is cops in the streets make a difference. \nYou do not have to go to school to learn that a police officer walking \ndown the street is an invitation not to commit a crime. Most people do \nnot go out and rob a bank when the cop is standing on the corner. Most \npeople do not run up to an old lady and pull her purse away when there \nis a cop in the lot.\n  That happened in Brockton, MA, just last week. A 73-year-old woman \nwas murdered at random, in an act of senseless violence, when a young \nguy from a neighboring city, who was just caught a couple of days ago, \ncame to that parking lot, grabs her purse and beats her senselessly, \nand she is dead. I tell you, if he had seen a cop in that lot, that \nwould not have happened.\n  Now, obviously, we cannot cover every corner, we cannot cover every \nparking lot, but you know what we can do? We can guarantee that this \npriority of putting cops on our streets that we committed to only a \nyear ago is not now taken away. For what? For what reason? Nobody has \nspoken here and said this is not working. The arguments that were made \na year ago were that you are not even going to put 5,000 cops out \nthere. This is a joke.\n  Well, we have put 33,000 cops on the streets of America in the last \nyear and a half. We have added 265 cops alone to the city of Boston. \nThe Federal Government is now paying for a 25-percent\n\n[[Page S1940]]\n\nadd-on of cops to the city of Chelsea, next to Boston, and we are \ntaking back communities. I was over there the other day listening to \nthe police chief and to the community activists tell me what has \nhappened to the drug dealers and the crack houses since we put those \ncops on those streets. They are gone. They are painting the houses \ntoday. People come out in the community. They care about the community. \nThey come back into it, and they suddenly have new life, Mr. President. \nWhy would we want to not continue that commitment?\n  Now, I know some people will come to the floor and say: ``Well, \nSenator, what we want to do is give the local community the power to \nchoose and give these people the opportunity to have a big block grant, \nand they can pick and choose what they want to do.'' But that is \ntotally contrary to the decision that we made based on the evidence a \nyear ago. There are communities in America that need these cops.\n  When you make the cops competitive with a cruiser or floodlights for \na jail or a drug court or another program, you are diminishing the \nnumber of cops that will be put on the street. That is the result. \nThere is a fixed pot of money, and this block grant takes the fixed pot \nof money and makes cops competitive with everything else that is in the \nblock grant. The end result is there will be fewer police officers on \nthe streets of America.\n\n  Why would we want to do that when the Conference of Mayors says, do \nnot do that; we want the cops. Why do it when the police chiefs across \nthe country say, do not do that; we want police officers. Why do it \nwhen the police officers' unions and patrolmen themselves say, we need \nmore cops to help us do our job. The mayors are against it, the police \nchiefs are against it, the district attorneys and attorneys general are \nagainst it, and we are going to go ahead and do it.\n  Now, why would we do it when it flies in the face of truly giving \npeople local control? When small communities give it to the Governors, \nthat is not local control. That is State control. When you give it to \nthe Governors in the format of which it has been given, it is actually \nmore expensive administratively. We are currently administering this \nprogram for less than a 1-percent administrative cost. You put it in a \nblock grant with all of this competition at the State level and you \ndrive your administrative costs up to at least 3 percent and maybe \nmore.\n  Moreover, you enter politics into the situation. What is going to \nhappen when you have a Republican Governor and a Democratic district \nattorney who may be thinking about running against the Governor and he \nis going to submit a plan to the Governor for this money? Do you think \nhe is going to be the first to get it?\n  We took the politics out of this program. A cop, as the Senator from \nDelaware said, can directly send a single sheet of paper to the Justice \nDepartment and he can get an answer within days, and they have been \ndoing that.\n  I do not know how you get more direct local control than that; a \nlocal police department goes to where the money is, says we need help \nand gets the money. Instead, we are going to go three tiers. We are \ngoing to go to the Federal Government, to the State Government, State \nGovernment through the process down to the local government. It just is \nnot part of the revolution of restoring local community control. It \nflies directly in the face of that, and it is contrary to it.\n  I do not think this is politics. I think this is really common sense. \nThis is how we are going to restore our communities. I think that \n100,000 cops, as I said a year and a half ago, is a downpayment on what \nwe need to do in America today. I think we ought to add 100,000 more \ncops to the 100,000 we have, and I absolutely guarantee you that if we \ndo that, we will diminish the number of Americans in jail; we will \nrestore whole communities; we will reduce the costs to our hospitals \nand all the trauma people suffer as a result of violent crime, and we \nwill honestly send a message in this country about law and order.\n  I can take you to community after community. Lowell, MA. Let me read \nto you what happened in Lowell in the last year and a half. We were \nlucky in Lowell--not lucky. People made some good judgments. They hired \na terrific police chief named Ed Davis. He came in 18 months ago, and \nhe came in particularly committed to community policing. I went to a \nstreet in Lowell called Bridge Street with the chief where prostitutes \nand druggies were taking over the street and senior citizens literally \ndid not dare to come out of their homes because they feared what was \nhappening in the street.\n  I walked into the corner pizza store and the guy there who owns it \ntold me, ``Senator, you know, people don't come in here anymore. I am \ngoing to go out of business unless we do something about this.'' So the \npolice chief put several police officers in a building right on that \nstreet, a new precinct, new storefront. And literally the street has \nbeen revived. The drug dealers left. The pimps and prostitutes are \ngone. Seniors come out of their homes. People take part in the \ncommunity again and the store owner is thriving. That has been \nreplicated in other parts of the community.\n  Let me just share with you what the Justice Department has reported \nabout Lowell. In Lowell, MA, for the first time in 25 years, 365 days \npassed without anyone being murdered.\n  In a city plagued by heroin use and street gangs, many say the city \nchanged over the last 18 months as a result of an intensive community-\nbased policing effort now supported by a Federal COPS grant. The city's \neffort has provided 65 new officers, 6 neighborhood substations with \nbicycle patrols, a gang unit, and a mobile precinct for public events. \nMr. President, that is the story. Over 60 new officers, 6 substations.\n  Bill Bratton used to be the police chief in Boston. I began working \non community policing with him in Boston a number of years ago. As we \nknow, he is now the police commissioner in New York City, and he graced \nthe cover of Time magazine a couple of weeks ago because the crime rate \nin New York has gone down 20-some percent and it has done it, most \nagree, because of the presence of police officers and the commitment to \ncommunity policing.\n  Mr. President, 15 years ago in America we had 3.5 police officers per \nviolent crime. Today we have 4.6 violent crimes per police officer.\n  So I hope my colleagues will again reach across the partisan divide \nand agree that common sense and the experience we are seeing in our \nstreets today dictate that we should not take this pot of money and \ndivert it from cops.\n  Am I saying that the other priorities that they have included in the \nblock grant are not important? The answer is no. They are important. I \nwould like to see those funded too. That would truly be part of a \ncomprehensive effort to deal with crime. But the first priority, beyond \nany of those other things, is to guarantee that our children can play \nin parks without fear of harm; that our seniors can come out of their \nhomes and walk a street to go to the post office or the bank or the \ncorner store; and that all of us in our communities can believe that \nthe fundamentals of public safety are being attended to by putting \npolice officers on the street.\n  I will tell you, even with all the computers in the world, all the \nother things people are looking for, until community after community of \nthis country is sufficiently staffed by police officers on patrol, we \nwill not regain our liberty and we will not restore the order that is \nso cared about by so many of our citizens. I think that is the first \norder of priority and that is why I hope this amendment will be \nadopted.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thompson). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for a \nsecond?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to follow the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Elizabeth \nKessler, Michael O'Neill, Steven Schlesinger, John Gibbons, and James \nO'Gara, all detailees from my staff, be granted the privilege of the \nfloor for the remainder of this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1941]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and \nit is an interesting one. But I rise in support of the compromise \nlanguage addressing both the local law enforcement block grants and the \nCOPS provision contained in this bill.\n  This bill strikes a good balance between the Local Law Enforcement \nBlock Grants Act of 1995 and the COPS Program. This combination will \nbetter support the local communities' law enforcement needs, and it \nprovides funds, guaranteed funds that will be used to hire new police \nofficers. That is the way the bill is written.\n  This proposal--that is the bill, not the amendment before our body--\nthis bill improves the notion of the current COPS Program. To begin, \nthis program moves us away from the Washington-knows-best philosophy. \nThe proposal returns responsibility and capability to local law \nenforcement officials: The police chief, the sheriffs, the district \nattorneys. Further, this compromise program allows just under 50 \npercent, 47 percent of the funds to be distributed directly to the \ncommunities to meet their individual community policing needs and law \nenforcement needs. This program empowers communities to decide how to \nbest spend these resources.\n\n  For example, if a community wants to use block grant funds to hire \nmore police to supplement community oriented policing, they may do so. \nThey can use whatever funds come to them.\n  However, if the resources can be used more efficiently by the \ncommunity, more effectively, by purchasing equipment and doing other \nmatters that are critical to their law enforcement needs, they may do \nthat. I think any reasonable person would say that makes sense. Why \nthrust upon them a Washington-knows-best philosophy, which is what my \ncolleagues on the other side want to do, and not give the local \ncommunities the right to do this?\n  I will tell you why they want to thrust it upon them. Because when we \npassed the crime bill back in 1994, there was a moral commitment by \nthis administration to put 100,000 police, or cops, on the street. \nThere was $8.8 billion, as I recall, dedicated to that effort in that \nbill. What this administration did not tell the American people is that \n$8.8 billion would not put 100,000 cops on the street. They have been \nclaiming credit for that ever since 1994, knowing the funds are not \nthere.\n  There was a formula, pursuant to which they would pay 75 percent, \nthen 50 percent, then 25 percent, then 0 percent--ultimately where the \ncommunities had to assume all of the costs of those additional police.\n  I said that they were dissembling, that they were claiming to put \n100,000 cops on the street when the moneys were not there to do it. Now \nit just shows I was 100 percent right.\n  Now they are talking about, ``Oh, we just meant seed money.'' Give me \na break. I said back then that it is untruthful for anybody to claim \nthat bill was going to put 100,000 cops on the street with only $8.8 \nbillion attributed to that particular approach. And that is true today.\n  Yet, in every crime speech since that time the President has gotten \nup and said we are going to put 100,000 cops on the street.\n  Now they have about 24,000. I think Senator Kerry indicated they had \nmaybe 33,000. That is a far cry from 100,000, assuming that their \nfigures are right. And they have hit the brick wall where they do not \nhave the moneys to fully fund 100,000 cops. Now they want to call it \nseed money.\n  Naturally, some of these communities who want to hire policemen here \nor there are going to have their hands out to grab whatever money they \ncan. But New York, by the way, which has been used here as an \nillustration of how crime has come down--I would just like to note that \nNew York City did not receive one cop under the President's COPS \nProgram, not to my knowledge. If they have, I sure do not know about \nit.\n  Nor did Washington, DC. Everybody knows that I have raised a couple \nof points about Washington, DC. It is drug capital USA. It is murder \ncapital USA. You cannot walk down the streets and be safe, kids are \nshot in schools, you are shot in drive-by shootings. Of course that is \ntrue in a number of our communities throughout this country. But \nWashington did not ask for any hiring money. I will tell you why, they \ndid not have the money needed to make the match requirement.\n  They can come back on the other side and say let us give them the \nmoney. That is what they said they did back in 1994. The fact was the \nmoneys were not there, except for about 20,000 cops. And the 33,000 \nthat they claim they have are only partially funded under the COPS \nProgram. They are not fully funded. So neither New York City nor \nWashington, DC, to my knowledge, have participated in this COPS hiring \nprogram. They could not afford to put these people on with this seed \nmoney that it has suddenly become, rather than the full money that was \nbeing promised to them.\n  I said back then it would cost $8 billion a year for each succeeding \nyear to have 100,000 cops on the street, under that formula that was in \nthat bill. And that is true today. The fact is, it has been dissembling \nto indicate to the American people that they are putting 100,000 cops \non the street. Now they are here, trying to, I think, ruin a block \ngrant approach that really would be effective for our local \ncommunities, under the guise that they are going to put 100,000 cops on \nthe street. Now it is seed money.\n  I have nothing against putting more police officers out there. I \nsimply believe that the cities should be able to decide for themselves \nwhether they want to have cops or whether they want to upgrade \ntechnology for crimefighting purposes.\n  For instance, the District of Columbia, which I have been fighting \nfor in trying to make it safe again, does not even have computers that \nwork. They have dial phones, rotary dial phones. In some areas, they do \nnot have police cars, they do not even have the weapons sometimes, in \nthe greatest city in the world. We all ought to be ashamed of that.\n  Let me just say, if the community wants to hire these police with the \nblock grants, give them the right to do so. We can supplement \ncommunity-oriented policing awards. However, if they find the resources \ncan be more effectively used, they have the flexibility to do it, which \nseems to me to be quite important.\n  Why do we need flexibility? Take the metropolitan police department \nin Washington, DC. They have more police officers per capita than any \nother city in this country--more than any other city. The last thing \nthat the metropolitan police department wants is more police. What they \nneed, in this case, happens to be cars, equipment, bullets, if you \nwill, and they cannot afford them, because we are not block granting \nthe funds to them to be able to do that.\n  The metropolitan police department in Washington, DC, is \ncannibalizing police cruisers to keep going, and we are talking about \nplaying this phony game of 100,000 cops on the street, which I have \ncalled a phony game since 1994. I am the first to say, in some areas, \nyes, we need more police on the street, but, by gosh, they can do it if \nthey want to. If that is what their needs are, the block grant will \nenable them to do that. If they do not need that, then they can do \nthese other things like cars, equipment, bullets, if you will.\n  Officers in this town are buying their own bullets. They do not like \ndoing that, but to protect themselves they are doing that. Now that is \npathetic. It is time to bring flexibility to our law enforcement \nassistance programs, and that is what this bill does.\n  When we get the flexibility into the bill, what do we face? People \ncoming to the floor and making arguments for 100,000 cops, who promised \nus that the moneys were there before, or at least implied that the \nmoneys were there, when I said they were not and they have not been and \nthey will not be, because it is just too much money.\n  I personally resented every speech by some of our national leaders \nwho get up and say, ``We are going to put 100,000 cops on the street,'' \nknowing that the moneys have not been there, knowing that that formula \nhas not worked and knowing that it is a misrepresentation. I think it \nis time for Washington to help first and then get the heck out of the \nway. That is what is wrong around here. We are dictating where these \nfunds should go rather than helping and getting out of the way and \nletting those law enforcement people who really know what is best for \ntheir communities do what needs to be done.\n\n[[Page S1942]]\n\n  This proposal does that, it gives them that flexibility. This block \ngrant proposal helps poorer communities by allowing the hiring of \npolice with less of a financial strain on the community. This is \naccomplished by containing a lower matching requirement than the COPS \nProgram.\n  During the last floor debate on the Commerce, Justice, State and \nJudiciary appropriations, my friend and colleague, Senator Biden, \nstated that nothing in the bill requires that even $1 be used to hire a \nsingle new police officer. This compromise satisfies his concern, even \nthough we set aside a considerable amount of money to hire police \nofficers but we block grant the rest in a way that makes sense. This \ncompromise satisfies his concern by funding the COPS Program at the \nlevel the President endorsed in the continuing resolution.\n  For those of you who are concerned about the 100,000 additional \npolice on the street, this plan--that is, the one in the bill, not the \none that has been offered by my colleague--this plan places your \nconcerns at rest. Although the President's plan does not fully fund \n100,000 cops, assuming that the law enforcement block grant earmark for \nthe COPS Program remains at the current 51 percent, more than $3.8 \nbillion will be available for cops awards over the life of the program, \nassuming money is there under the block grant approach.\n\n  Using the President's math, the fiscal year 1996 average grant award \namount is $45,856. The available funds will provide seed money for more \npolice under the COPS earmark. In other words, according to the \nPresident's math, it only costs about $45,856 to put a police officer \non the street. We know it cost more than that.\n  To also make it clear, this bill provides especially a paragraph on \nprohibitive uses. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, a unit of \n     local government may not expend any of the funds provided \n     under this title to purchase, lease, rent or otherwise \n     acquire (1) armored tanks (2) fixed-wing aircraft (3) \n     limousines (4) real estate (5) yachts (6) consultants or (7) \n     vehicles not primarily used for law enforcement, unless the \n     Attorney General certifies that extraordinary and exigent \n     circumstances exist that make the use of funds for such \n     purposes essential to the maintenance of public safety and \n     good order in such unit of local government.\n\n  There are protections in this bill. It costs about $75,000--I have \nbeen corrected--to fund a police officer on the street, about $75,000 \nto fully fund one. This so-called seed money will not fully fund \n100,000 police on the street. There is no way that it can. So we have \ngone from fully funding to seed money now under the guise that we are \ngoing to give the people 100,000 police on the street when, in fact, \nthat just simply is not true.\n  Add this to what was awarded in the prior years, if you spend that \n$3.8 billion over the remaining program life, and with seed money, I \nsuppose you could get to 100,000 cops with a tremendous drain on the \nlocal community. But they are going to hire these police anyway. \nNaturally, they are going to have their hands out if there is a free \ngift of money from the Federal Government, and that means people they \nhired anyway are going to get help while other communities who need \nmoney for cars, for equipment, for bullets, if you will, or police \nuniforms cannot get it and cannot do the policing job that they should \ndo.\n  This is even before the flexible portion of the block grant money is \nexpended. We have taken appropriate measures to address concerns about \nguaranteeing police on the street and also in poorer communities to \nbest determine how best to fight local crime.\n  Why do we always have to go to the Washington knows best mentality? \nWhy do we always have these arguments out here about, ``By gosh, we're \ngoing to earmark and tell them what to do with these funds?'' What is \nwrong with block granting the funds, as long as we have prohibited \nuses, which we have expressly written in this bill? What is wrong with \nblock granting the money to them and letting those local communities \nmake their determinations of what is best for them, rather than us \ntelling them what they need?\n  Some communities do need more police. This block grant will help \nthem. They will be able to make that flexible determination. Others do \nnot, and they will not be forced to because of an inflexible approach \nthat I think my colleagues on the other side are asking for.\n  One reason the local law enforcement block grant of 1995 is superior \nto a cops-exclusive program is flexibility. We provided for flexibility \nin this bill by allowing local communities to expend funds for all of \nthe following law enforcement purposes:\n  First, for hiring, training, and employing additional law enforcement \npersonnel. So they can do it if they want to. If that is what they need \nto do, they will have some funds out of this block grant to do it with.\n  Second, paying overtime to presently employed law enforcement \nofficers.\n  Third, procuring equipment and technology directly related to basic \nlaw enforcement functions.\n  Fourth, enhancing security measures in and around schools.\n  Fifth, law enforcement crime prevention programs.\n  Sixth, establishing or supporting drug courts.\n  Seventh, enhancing the adjudication process.\n  And, eighth, establishing multijurisdictional task forces, \nparticularly in rural areas.\n  Local law enforcement officials can decide how best to decide to \nspend the money under the program. More police does not always mean \nbetter policing. Oftentimes, necessary procurement is the best option \nfor the community, by far the best law enforcement option in some \ncommunities.\n  This program moves us away from the Washington knows best philosophy. \nWe do not let Washington dictate local crimefighting strategies. \nWashington simply does not know best. Washington does not know best how \nto solve local problems, especially a problem like crime. The COPS \nProgram dictates to a community how much of their scarce funds they \nmust allocate to combat crime.\n  The COPS More Program promises to supply overtime and supplies to the \npolice departments. However, in practice, only big cities with large \npolice forces can be eligible. This is because COPS More grants require \na showing of moving a cop to the street to receive these funds. Smaller \ncommunities who are already maximizing their street coverage have \ndifficulty showing more officers can move to the street. Small town \nforces do not have the extra manpower to put another officer on the \nstreet, and rural communities need cars to travel through their \ndistricts.\n  The COPS Program determines the number of officers given to \ncommunities by the number already on the force. It disregards the crime \nprogram. Small crime-riddled communities should be able to receive \nhelp, not be penalized because they are small. The COPS Program does \nnot take into account crime when giving out grants. The grants are \ngiven to any locality that can afford the matching fund whether the \nofficer is needed or not.\n  The COPS Program does not base the number of officers awarded on \ncrime but rather on the number currently on the force. Cities who \napplied for four officers because they had one of the highest crime \nrates in the Nation will be given 1 or 2 officers because the current \nforce has 50 officers.\n  Look, we are not playing games here. We are trying to solve this \nproblem. The block grant gives the local communities the flexibility to \nsolve it in their best interests and their best ways without Washington \ntelling them what to do. What is going on here is the department is \npaying 75 percent of the salary the first year, 50 percent the second \nyear, 25 percent the third year, and then the local agency has to carry \nthe full load.\n  Based upon a salary of $65,000 to $70,000 a year, for every $75,000 \nin Federal COPS grants awarded, the community will need to spend \n$225,000 over the 5-year life of the program to keep a cop on the \nstreet. That is one single cop.\n  I want to submit for the Record a statement by the city manager of \nSunnyvale, CA, who turned down a COPS grant because they could not \nafford it. I ask unanimous consent that that statement be printed in \nthe Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Thomas F. Lewcock, City Manager, City of Sunnyvale, CA\n\n       Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:\n\n[[Page S1943]]\n\n       I am honored to have been requested to submit a written \n     statement to the Judiciary Committee regarding the City of \n     Sunnyvale, California's decision to not accept Crime Grant \n     funds to add additional police officers to the Sunnyvale \n     Department of Public Safety.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       My name is Thomas F. Lewcock. I am the City Manager of the \n     City of Sunnyvale, California. I have served in that capacity \n     for fifteen-and-a-half years. I have served in executive \n     capacities in city government for 26 years, having received a \n     bachelor's degree in political science from the University of \n     Minnesota, and a master's degree in public administration \n     from that same institution. The City of Sunnyvale operates \n     under the Council/Manager form of government, with the City \n     manager appointed on professional merits for an indeterminant \n     time by the City Council, serving fully at its pleasure. The \n     City Manager is the Chief Executive Officer.\n       The City of Sunnyvale is a residential/industrial community \n     located in the geographic heart of the Silicon Valley. It has \n     a resident population of approximately 125,000, with a \n     private-sector job base of approximately 120,000. It is a \n     demographically diverse community with a minority population \n     of approximately 35%. While the income and educational levels \n     of its citizens are above average, the City has the full \n     spectrum of income and education levels. While law \n     enforcement issues do not have the same complexity as those \n     of an urban core, Sunnyvale remains a relatively densely \n     developed community in the California context with a full \n     range of law enforcement complexities. Approximately 50% of \n     the resident population lives in multi-family dwellings. \n     Given the sophistication of the City's industrial base, \n     highly complex law enforcement issues are presented. This \n     brief overview of the community is provided to members of the \n     Committee in order to provide a framework for the community's \n     law enforcement needs. In many respects, the law enforcement \n     requirements of this community are significantly closer to \n     that of an urban core community than the typical American \n     suburban community.\n       The City of Sunnyvale over the last several years has \n     gained a national and international reputation for its unique \n     approach to long-range strategic and financial planning, to \n     results-oriented budgeting, and to its well-recognized \n     approach of operating the City more as a business than a \n     government. In the Osborne and Gabler book, ``Reinventing \n     Government,'' the City of Sunnyvale was noted as the \n     government ``performance leader.''\n       The relevance of the City of Sunnyvale's approach to policy \n     setting and the provision of public services is briefly \n     reviewed in order to gain a context as to why a decision was \n     unanimously made by the Sunnyvale City Council to not accept \n     Crime Grant funds.\n       For the past fifteen years, the City has structured its \n     approach to policy setting and financial management with two \n     key themes. The first is that of long-range strategic \n     planning coupled with a sophisticated ten-year financial \n     plan. That financial plan estimates all projected operating, \n     capital, debt expenses, as well as future revenues. This \n     highly sophisticated approach to long-range financial \n     planning is used in a number of ways which are beyond the \n     purpose of this statement to describe in detail. Key to this \n     statement, however, is its use in recognizing that the short-\n     term financial position of any government and for that matter \n     any business is not predicated on a year-to-year analysis, \n     but can only be fully understood in the context of multi-year \n     projections. Though those projections will of course suffer \n     from the natural uncertainty of government finance and all \n     the related factors that affect government income and \n     expense, it can and does provide a clear understanding of \n     significant expense and revenue trends that should be taken \n     into account in making any decision which has long-term \n     consequences. A series of detailed financial policies have \n     been adopted by the Sunnyvale City Council in respect to \n     utilization of long-range financial planning. One of the most \n     important of those policies is to require that in submittal \n     of annual budgetary plans, that the budget must be balanced \n     not only in the context of one year but also in the context \n     of the position of the City over the entire ten-year time \n     frame. Even though an expenditure may be affordable in a one-\n     year context, if it cannot be supportable over the long term \n     then it is not undertaken. This approach recognizes that \n     although on a one, two or three-year basis an expenditure may \n     be affordable, if over the long term it pushes governmental \n     spending in deficit, then it is much better to deal with that \n     issue initially than to compound the financial problem \n     created of effectively spending for many years beyond means \n     and then eventually reaching the point where far more \n     significant budget and service reductions are necessary.\n       A second critical component of the approach of the City of \n     Sunnyvale is to clearly specify in measurable terms each and \n     every service which the City is to provide and to allocate \n     funding to those specified service levels. The Patrol \n     Services Division of the Department of Public Safety follows \n     this approach as do all other City departments and services. \n     This approach is not focused on line item detail as to \n     numbers of people, vehicles required, and the like, but \n     rather on the specific level and quality of services to be \n     provided. It is here that the policy focus of the City \n     Council is centered. For example, in the Patrol Services \n     Division, service levels are defined in terms of emergency \n     response times, crime rates, crime clearance rates, citizen \n     satisfaction, and the like. Each year, the Council determines \n     whether or not that defined level of service is adequate and \n     if not, appropriate resource changes are made. Further, if \n     change in demands occur in such a way that additional \n     resources are required in order to meet those service \n     standards, then the Council either appropriates the \n     additional funds for that purpose or if insufficient funds \n     are available makes a determination as to what level of \n     service is affordable.\n       It would be incorrect to assume that because the Sunnyvale \n     City Council declined Crime Bill funds that either Public \n     Safety services are not a priority nor that the City is in \n     the financial position to ignore a sizable sum of outside \n     funds. Over the past five years, the real dollar value of tax \n     income to the City of Sunnyvale has declined by 15%. This has \n     occurred as a result of the California economy and severely \n     restricted revenues for all levels of California government. \n     The City has had to make difficult decisions over this time \n     frame to find ways to continue to the maximum extent the \n     level of services it provides. Most certainly, the action \n     taken by the City Council is not a reflection on the lack of \n     priority for Public Safety services. Public Safety services, \n     both police and fire, are clearly the two highest priority \n     services in the City of Sunnyvale. In fact, these services \n     receive 58% of the overall tax-supported budget in this \n     community.\n\n\n                             the crime bill\n\n       When the Crime Bill was passed, the City began the process \n     of reviewing this new grant program in accordance with the \n     general policy and budget framework outlined above as well as \n     against a specific intergovernmental grant assistance policy \n     which was adopted by the Sunnyvale City Council many years \n     ago. Attachment I excerpts the most relevant aspects of that \n     policy. As can be seen in the attachment, that policy in \n     general discourages the utilization of State or Federal \n     grants to support ongoing City programs. The underlying \n     reason for that strategy is that when City services are \n     increased as a result of a grant that may later be reduced or \n     eliminated by the State or Federal governments, then it is in \n     essence establishing a new or expanded service which the \n     community will become accustomed to. If then later the \n     funding either declines or is eliminated, very difficult \n     decisions have to be made in a constrained resource \n     environment of either eliminating that program or some \n     other. Therefore, this policy attempts to assure a \n     continuity of priority setting around the most important \n     services this City should be providing consistent with its \n     financial constraints. This policy places that strategy \n     into action by either requiring that the program be shown \n     in the City's Ten-Year Financial Plan only for the period \n     of time that the entitlement has been granted or requiring \n     the City's own tax resources to be dedicated in advance of \n     accepting the grant if it is believed that the program \n     should continue.\n       For a program such as the Crime Bill which would add police \n     officers, it is clear that if there is a need to increase the \n     law enforcement presence that need will not dissipate simply \n     because Federal funding is no longer available. Therefore, \n     this is not the kind of service expansion for which the City \n     would knowingly accept grant money and then reduce the \n     service by eliminating these added police officers at the \n     time the grant money was no longer present. Rather, this kind \n     of grant would be accepted only if a decision was made that \n     the costs were supportable over the long term and actually \n     scheduled in the City's Ten-Year Financial Plan.\n       In order to estimate the City's ability to support the \n     ongoing cost of officers, an analysis was conducted as to \n     what the true cost to the City of Sunnyvale would be. Under \n     terms of the Crime Bill, the City would have been eligible \n     for a maximum of six police officers with a maximum grant \n     amount of $450,000.\n       In order to estimate the cost over the City's ten-year \n     financial planning horizon, the wages and benefit costs of a \n     Sunnyvale Public Safety Officer was first determined. As of \n     1995, that annual cost is $95,538. Although officers would \n     not initially be hired at the top of their salary level as is \n     reflected in this cost, the City always utilizes the practice \n     of estimating top-step salaries in compensation since over \n     the long term that will ultimately be the actual cost of new \n     employees. In addition, there are ancillary costs placing a \n     police officer on the street and properly equipping them, \n     which adds an additional $3,227 annually, for a total cost \n     per officer of $98,765 annually.\n       Attachment II reflects the present estimated financial plan \n     for tax-supported services in the City. In order to project \n     the full financial effect of six new officers, Attachment III \n     was developed. Under Revenues, a new line item was added \n     reflecting the $450,000 in new income. Under Expenditures, \n     the new cost to the City was projected over ten years. Please \n     note that the projected expense does go up annually \n     consistent with the City's Inflation and cost-of-living \n     projections. While we do not pretend to have a crystal ball \n     as to how inflation will perform, we consider this an \n     important aspect of multi-year financial planning as it \n     recognizes the reality that costs do increase over time even \n     when inflation is low. As can be seen in Attachment III, the \n     total projected\n\n[[Page S1944]]\n\n     expenditure over the City's ten-year financial planning \n     horizon is $6.8 million. Also of note is the interest line \n     under Revenues which was appropriately adjusted to reflect \n     the fact that this new expenditure would reduce City reserves \n     and therefore interest income. As a result, the total net \n     cost to the City is $8.853 million over ten years, which \n     reflects that this grant would support only 5% of the total \n     cost. While it is certainly the case that the cost of law \n     enforcement officers in the State of California is \n     considerably above national averages due to the very high \n     cost of living in California, even with lower expenditure \n     numbers, over a protracted time frame a grant such as this \n     would reflect but a small percent of the overall cost. As \n     also reflected in Attachment III, necessary prescribed \n     reserve levels in accordance with City fiscal policies would \n     not be able to be maintained by the tenth year falling some \n     $2.75 million into deficit.\n       The question of whether or not to accept Crime Grant funds, \n     however, was more than the financial analysis alone. As was \n     stated earlier, local government in California has been hard \n     pressed for a number of years with continual reduction in \n     revenue availability while at the same time being faced with \n     expensive new Federal and State mandates. As a result, two \n     additional questions had to be addressed. The first question \n     was whether given all City priorities the addition of six \n     police officers was the most important. The second question \n     was that if it was determined that a greater law enforcement \n     presence was needed and was the top priority in the \n     community, whether the specific restrictions and strings that \n     came along with this grant would restrict the ability to use \n     the funds in such a way as to meet the City's most pressing \n     law enforcement requirements. As outlined earlier, Sunnyvale \n     is a results-oriented organization, specifying in clear and \n     measurable terms what it will accomplish in quality and level \n     of service in everything the City does. The City's \n     recognition as the ``performance leader'' has come as a \n     result of articulating in clear terms what we are \n     to accomplish, but not prescribing the way in which it is \n     to be accomplished. For example, one can assume that one \n     of the most important purposes of the Crime Bill is to \n     reduce the incidence and fear of crime. Due to the \n     prescriptive requirements of the bill, the bill presumes \n     that if police officers are dedicated to this task \n     consistent with the requirements of the bill, then this \n     objective will be best met. We have found in literally all \n     service areas that prescriptive requirements as to how to \n     meet an objective creates substantial limitations in the \n     creative use of resources to assure that service \n     objectives are met in the highest quality and lowest cost \n     fashion. In lay terms, what this basically means in the \n     case of the Crime Bill was that the City would have to \n     accept the fact that the Federal government knew better \n     than we do how to utilize resources in order to accomplish \n     a comparable goal. Rarely have we found that to be the \n     case.\n       In the case of the Crime Bill, it was not even necessary to \n     get to the point of judging whether or not this resource \n     increase paid 95% by the City was the highest priority area \n     of expanded City services. Rather, when it became clear that \n     the Federal government would dictate how these officers would \n     be used by providing only 5% of the funds, a unanimous \n     decision was made by the City Council that the incentive did \n     not come close to justifying a change in City priorities. \n     Further, and perhaps even more important, it was believed \n     that if the choice was paying the additional 5% of the cost \n     and thereby allowing these resources to be marshalled in a \n     way judged to result in the best return in investment, then \n     the City would be better off paying 100% of the cost.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Most cities do not use the performance-based policy setting \n     and budget approach nor multi-year financial planning \n     approach that has been long utilized in the City of \n     Sunnyvale. The reality is, however, that the issues and \n     consequences are exactly the same for other cities as well. \n     Perhaps the only difference in many other cities is that \n     these consequences are not recognized in advance and will \n     have to be dealt with when funding is depleted. It also \n     underscores the importance that local government and now the \n     Federal government has placed on mandate relief. In a \n     constrained resources environment, each time a new direction \n     is provided by the Federal government by rule, regulation, or \n     law, the Federal government is essentially establishing \n     priorities for local government. Two years ago, a detailed \n     study was undertaken which reflected that fully 23% of the \n     City's operating budget on an annual basis was directed \n     toward the meeting of Federal and State mandates. If all \n     involved in government leadership positions at the local, \n     State, and Federal level concur that law enforcement is by \n     far the highest municipal priority and if in turn that is the \n     major reason for the assistance the Federal government is \n     offering, then it is clear that this high priority has been \n     continually subverted by both the Federal and State \n     government, requiring that scarce resources be directed to \n     other purposes. Not all will agree that City government is \n     capable of establishing the most important priority uses of \n     local government funds. Most local government officials, \n     including this one, would argue, however, that law \n     enforcement is amongst the very highest priorities for local \n     government and to the degree it is not funded to the level it \n     should, the problem will not be solved through carrot and \n     stick techniques that in reality do not significantly enhance \n     the financial ability of a City to continue those services \n     over a protracted time frame.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, look, all of us want more police on the \nstreets. All of us will support that. On the other hand, we have \nprovided about half of this money to go for the COPS Program, about \nhalf the money this administration represented were sufficient to put \n100,000 cops on the street, or at least they have been misrepresenting \nover the last number of years--in the last year and a half, in my \nopinion.\n  What we also have is about 50 percent of these funds going in a block \ngrant to the communities so they can make their own determination as to \nwhat is best for their communities, how best to do it. We provided \nprohibitions in here so the community cannot just have exotic police \napproaches, that they have to use funds for the very best law \nenforcement needs, in the best interests of the community. To me, that \nmakes sense.\n  We help the COPS Program even more than was represented we would do. \nWe help the communities to have a flexibility to be able to do what is \nbest for their communities. If they do not need police personnel, they \ncan then use the money for other law enforcement needs that are very \nimportant for the community. In the process, everybody wins.\n  I think what we have to do one of these days, though, is face the \nmusic around here in the District of Columbia. I believe we have in \nsome respects some very decent people in that police force, but they \nare not funded properly. They are not treated properly. We have crime \nin the streets here in the greatest city in the world. We are not doing \nwhat we should do about it. Frankly, this type of an approach just \ntakes away from getting the job done here as well as elsewhere \nthroughout the country.\n  I think it is time for us to wake up and realize that block granting \nmakes sense, that there have been some pretty sorry claims made with \nregard to the 100,000 cops-on-the-street program.\n  No one opposes hiring new cops. The question is whether we here in \nWashington should dictate to the local communities what they should or \nshould not do. My colleagues on the other side apparently like that \nsystem. I do not. I do not think a majority of people in Congress like \nthat system. The underlying bill represents a compromise. Funding the \nCOPS Program and funding for greater flexibility is that compromise. It \nseems to me that makes sense.\n  I know that the majority leader is going to move to table this \namendment. I hope that a majority of the Members of this body will \nsupport that motion to table because we want communities to have the \nflexibility to be able to do real law enforcement, not just what \nWashington thinks ought to be the approach for every community in this \ncountry. They will have the flexibility under this bill to be able to \ndo policing, if they want to, or partial policing, or whatever they \nneed for law enforcement that is in the best interest of their \ncommunity.\n  I apologize to my colleague for taking so long. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me say to the Senator from Utah, first of all, \nthat there is no reason for apology. It is very gracious of him. I do \nnot always agree with some of the positions he takes, and I do not \nagree with him on this amendment, but I believe that if you want to use \nthe words ``class act,'' he is a class act. I have tremendous respect \nfor him.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this amendment with my \ncolleagues, Senator Biden and Senator Kerry from Massachusetts.\n  Our constituents, citizens in our country, all of us, we plan our \nlives sometimes around crime--where we eat, how we treat our children, \nwhere we live, how we travel, where our kids go to school, how we \nanswer the door, how we answer the phone. The crime and violence in our \ncountry and in our communities takes away freedom, the freedom of our \nloved ones, the freedom of our families, the freedom of our neighbors.\n  Mr. HATCH. Would the Senator yield for a unanimous-consent request?\n\n[[Page S1945]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to.\n  Mr. HATCH. We have a couple of amendments.\n\n\n               Amendment Nos. 3480 and 3481, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send two amendments to the desk. I think \nthey are 3480 and 3481. They are modifications. I believe they have \nbeen cleared on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could find out as to \nwhat the amendments are.\n  Mr. HATCH. Modifications--have they been cleared? They are not \ncleared? Let me leave them at the desk and see if we can get them \ncleared.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, there is no \nobjection.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nmodifications be approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the two amendments, as \nmodified, are considered and agreed to.\n  So, the amendments (Nos. 3480 and 3481), as modified, were agreed to \nas follows:\n\n                           amendment no. 3480\n\n       On page 751, section entitled ``Agency for International \n     Development, Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltics'', \n     insert at the appropriate place:\n       ``Except for funds made available for demining activities, \n     no funds may be provided under this heading in this Act until \n     the President certifies to the Committees on Appropriations \n     that:\n       ``(1) The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in \n     compliance with Article III, Annex 1A of the Dayton \n     Agreement; and\n       ``(2) Intelligence cooperation on training, investigations, \n     or related activities between Iranian officials and Bosnian \n     officials has been terminated.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3481\n\n       On page 751, section entitled ``Agency for International \n     Development, Assistance for Eastern Europe and the Baltics'', \n     insert at the appropriate place, the following: ``Provided \n     further, That funds appropriated by this Act for economic \n     reconstruction may only be made available for projects, \n     activities, or programs within the sector assigned to \n     American forces of the NATO Military Implementation Force \n     (IFOR) and Sarajevo: ``Provided further, That Priority \n     consideration shall be given to projects and activities \n     designed in the IFOR ``Task Force Eagle civil military \n     project list'': ``Provided further, That no funds made \n     available under this Act,or any other Act, may be obligated \n     for the purposes of rebuilding or repairing housing in areas \n     where refugees or displaced persons are refused the right of \n     return by Federation or local authorities due to ethnicity or \n     political party affiliation: ``Provided further, That no \n     funds may be made available under this heading in this Act, \n     or any other Act, to any banking or financial institution in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina unless such institutions agrees in \n     advance, and in writing, to allow the United States General \n     Accounting Office access for the purposes of audit of the use \n     of U.S. assistance: ``Provided further, That effective ninety \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act, none of the \n     funds appropriated under this heading may be made available \n     for the purposes of economic reconstruction in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina unless the President determines and certifies in \n     writing to the Committee on Appropriations that the aggregate \n     bilateral contributions pledged by non-U.S. donors for \n     economic reconstruction are at least equivalent to the U.S. \n     bilateral contributions made under this Act and in the fiscal \n     year 1995 and fiscal year 1996 Foreign Operations, Export \n     Financing and Related Programs Appropriations bills.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3483\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not really believe that there is \nany debate in my State of Minnesota about the need to have more law \nenforcement, more police, in our neighborhoods and in our communities. \nWe must have more police out in the communities.\n  Mr. President, because of the violence, because it is so important \nthat we reduce the violence in our homes, reduce the violence in our \nschools, reduce the violence in our neighborhoods and in our \ncommunities, it is critically important that, as legislators, we, as \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans alike, act powerfully, forcefully \nand immediately. That is what the crime bill of 1994 was all about.\n  There is a brave initiative to this piece of legislation. This piece \nof legislation gave us an opportunity, I think, especially through \ncommunity policing, to reclaim our cities and to reclaim our \nneighborhoods, to reclaim our schools, and to really reclaim our \nfuture.\n  The community oriented policing service, COPS, was created by the \nCrime Act in 1994. So far, it has exceeded its hiring goals. Funds have \nalready been authorized to add more than 31,000 police officers, over a \nquarter of the final goal. I think my colleague from Delaware, Senator \nBiden, had the figure higher than that--about 34,000, as I remember.\n  Mr. President, in my State of Minnesota we have already been able to \nhire 435 new cops that have been put out in the neighborhoods and in \nour communities. Minnesota has received over $24 million under this \nprogram. This year, if our amendment passes, there would be 100 more \nlaw enforcement women and men out in our communities, working with the \ncitizens in our communities, helping to reduce violence in our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, Chief Leslie, the sheriff of Moorhead, tells me that \nthe COPS' dollars have allowed him to institute a very effective \ncommunity policing strategy and a citizens police academy for \nresidents. He says, ``After 30 years in law enforcement and 17 years as \npolice chief of Moorhead, the COPS Program is the best thing I have \never seen.'' ``The best thing I have ever seen,'' says the chief of \npolice of Moorhead.\n  St. Louis County Sheriff Gary Waller is equally enthusiastic about \nthe program.\n  Mr. President, I have spent time talking with the law enforcement \ncommunity in my State of Minnesota. What they say ought to be heard \nloud and clear by all of us in the U.S. Senate. Minneapolis Police \nChief Robert Olson, talking about the community policing program, the \nCOPS Program. They have 17 community police so far. They see 23 in \njeopardy. They hope to have 40 altogether. In Police Chief Olson's \nwords the COPS Program has been successful and has led to a ``dramatic \nimpact this year on the level of crime violence in the metro area.'' A \ncity where we have seen entirely too much crime. They have seen fewer \nincidents since instituting the COPS Program of drive-by shootings and \nestimate that they have taken 50 percent more guns off the streets.\n  Mr. President, the police chief of Minneapolis, Chief Olson, said to \nme, ``This is not the feel-good program, Senator. This is strict law \nenforcement. We have been able to shut down some of these crack houses. \nWe have been able to target those neighborhoods most ravaged by this \nviolence and crime and have police out in the communities, out in the \nstreets, working with people, to reduce that violence.''\n  Mr. President, we need to listen to these law enforcement officers. \nThe community police program is a huge success in the State of \nMinnesota. I have talked to sheriffs and police chiefs in the metro \narea, in greater Minnesota, whether it is suburbs, in cities, or \nsmaller communities. You get the same response: ``Senator, this program \nis working. Don't kill the COPS Program.'' The League of Minnesota \nCities said this yesterday, ``Look, we need to make some commitments as \na Nation. One of those commitments ought to be to community police. Do \nnot talk about block grants where the money may or may not go to this. \nYou all made a commitment. You have a contract with us. You have made a \ncommitment to the community policing program to make sure there are \n100,000 police out in our neighborhoods by the year 2000, to make sure \nin my State we dramatically expand law enforcement in the communities. \nDon't renege on that commitment.''\n\n  I talked to Duluth Police Chief Scott Lyons. He said to me, \n``Senator, this is a new philosophy. What we have been able to do \nthrough this community police program is establish more rapport than we \never had with the communities in our city. Senator, what we have been \nable to do''--and I use the police chief's own words, ``is empower \ncitizens to be able themselves to take action --not vigilante action--\nworking with the police force to reduce violence in their \ncommunities.'' The police chief went on to say, ``Senator, we are no \nlonger reactive. We are proactive. We are taking steps to prevent crime \nin the first place, in the city of Duluth, in some of the neighborhoods \nmost ravaged by the crime.'' Why in the world would we want to weaken a \nprogram that the law enforcement community so strongly supports, as do \nthe citizens in our States? It makes no sense.\n  I talked to Stearns County Sheriff Jim Kostreba and he said, \n``Senator,\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nthe COPS Program has enabled us to work with school officials, to work \nwith kids. It has helped us to fight against teenage drinking, against \ndrugs, against substance abuse, against teenage suicides.'' He went on. \nI thought it was very interesting. He said to me, ``Senator, at the \nbeginning, through the community police program, when we had a presence \nin the schools, some of these young people were cynical. Some of these \nyoung people looked at our police officers as if they were the enemy. \nBut not any longer. Through the community police program, we have our \nlaw enforcement people, men and women, working with these kids.''\n  I say to my colleagues, this program is a huge success. This is \nexactly what we ought to be doing by way of priority.\n  I talked to Anoka Police Chief Andy Revering and he talked about what \nAnoka has done. He said only 4 years ago Anoka had the fifth-highest \ncrime rate in the metro area. The demand exceeded their resource. \nBecause of the COPS Program they have seen a dramatic decline, \naccording to the chief, in crime. What they have been doing is they \nhave been using the COPS Program law enforcement in conferencing. This \nis a program, for my colleagues' information, whereby you bring \ntogether some of these kids would have committed some of these crimes, \nyou bring their families into a meeting, and you conference them, along \nwith the victims so that these kids really know what it is they have \ndone. By bringing these kids together with their families and also \nbringing them together with the victims, what has happened, says Chief \nRevering, there has been very little repeat of crime by these kids.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, what in the world are we doing by trying to \nhave in this continuing resolution essentially a proposal which says, \nyeah, we keep the Government going but we want to cut by half the \nnumber of resources that go to community policing?\n  Mr. President, I have said it many times on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate: When three teenagers, regardless of color of skin, beat up an \n85-year-old woman and leave her for dead, we hold them accountable for \nwhat they have done. We do not tell them we feel sorry for them. That \nis a strict law and order approach. By the same token, you can talk to \nthe kids--and Sheila and I spend time with kids who are at risk--you \ncan go to the schools in some of the tougher neighborhoods, you can \ntalk to the judge, you can talk to the sheriffs, you can talk to the \npolice chiefs, you can talk to the youth workers if anybody wants to \nbecause they are the ones that are dealing with this violence, and they \nwill tell you we have to have opportunities for these kids. We have to \nhave alternatives to the gangs and make sure the kids are able to do \npositive things in the communities.\n  Mr. President, no matter who you talk to--whether it is people in the \ncommunities, whether it is the police, whether it is the chiefs, the \nlaw enforcement people who are in the communities--they all say the \nsame thing: This community police program is important. We need more \nlaw enforcement in our neighborhoods. We need to reclaim our \nneighborhoods. We need to reclaim our cities. We need to reclaim our \ncommunities. We need to reduce this level of violence.\n  I was talking to the police chief in Fergus Falls and he said, \n``Senator, the reason the COPS Program is such a good program is \nbecause you do not limit the grants just to the large cities.'' He \nsaid, ``I want to tell you that this is a wonderful community, and it \ncertainly is, but do not think for a moment we do not have problems \nwith violence and problems with crime.'' This COPS Program has been a \nhuge success. Same comment from the sheriff. It does not matter whether \nyou talk to sheriffs or police chiefs in the big cities, Minneapolis-\nSt. Paul, in Minnesota, or Duluth, or you talk to them in midsized \ncities like St. Cloud, or whether you are talking to law enforcement \npeople in the small towns of rural communities, they all say the same \nthing. They all say the same thing: ``Senators, cut a program if it \ndoes not work, but do not cut a program that has been an astounding \nsuccess.'' We need to reduce the level of violence. We need to be bold \nand we need to be dramatic. It is a huge mistake to block grant, to \nmove away from what has been the commitment that we have made.\n\n  We said, when we passed this crime bill, that we make a commitment to \n100,000 community police, that we would make a commitment to community \npolice all across my State of Minnesota. That is what law enforcement \npeople expected. That is what we are doing now, with great success. \nThat is what the people in our States expected. We need to live up to \nour commitment. That is why this amendment is so important, and I hope \nit will pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been listening to the distinguished \nSenator, and I have to say that some of the points he is making are \ngood. Take them up with your Governor. We do not have to dictate from \nWashington what law enforcement officials have to do in the individual \nStates and communities. If you do not like what the block grant moneys \nare used for in your State, then take it up with your Governor, because \nI will tell you one thing, you get the money. If you need more \npolicemen, you can get them with that block grant money. If your \nGovernor is not doing it, talk to him. I doubt----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. For a question, sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will wait for a chance to respond.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I heard the Senator correctly--and he is a friend and \ncolleague--maybe I did not because I was listening and not listening. \nBut it seemed to me that I recall him saying that Senator Dole was \nbeing accused of reneging.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If the Senator will yield, I did not mention the \nmajority leader's name at all. I do not do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am glad to hear that because I thought there was some \nsort of accusation that Senator Dole had reneged on law enforcement \nneeds. I want to make it clear that not only did he not do that, he has \nbeen one of the strongest pro-law enforcement people in his long time \nin the U.S. Senate, and rightly so, as is his colleague, the Senator \nfrom Utah. We both have fought very, very hard.\n  I agree that my colleague, Senator Biden, on the other side, has been \na tremendous leader in the war against crime. I have a lot of respect \nfor him. I grieve when we disagree on some of these things. Senator \nDole, in particular, opposed the 1994 crime bill because it was not a \ntough enough law enforcement bill. I was there, too, and I opposed it \nfor that reason as well, although there was much we agreed with in that \nbill, and we were glad certain parts of it were passed. I commend \nSenator Biden for his efforts on that bill because there is much in \nthat bill that is good, not the least of which is the Biden-Hatch \nviolence-against-women provisions. Senator Dole believes in real law \nenforcement, not shallow promises.\n  What I am saying here is, look, it makes sense to give about half of \nthis money to the communities as seed money to try to help them get \npolice personnel. It does not make sense to say that this is the \nPresident's commitment of 100,000 cops, because he made that commitment \non the last bill that had $8.8 billion in it, and everybody knew that \nwould not provide for 100,000 police on the streets. Now they are \ncoming and saying with seed money they can get their 100,000 cops. I \nhave said they could not get the 100,000 cops on the basis of what they \nhad done up through the 1994 crime bill. That crime bill did not do \nthat. It talked about it, but it did not, will not, cannot, do it. The \nPresident has been going up and down the country talking about his \n100,000 cops on the streets bill. The fact is that just simply is not \ntrue. I think it is time for the American people to understand that.\n  Republicans, recognizing that it is important to have police on the \nstreet and to have flexibility so you can do what needs to be done in \nthe communities, have said, in spite of the fact that the President \nhas, in some respects, demagoged this issue all over the country, \nknowing the funds are not there, acting like they are and helping the \nAmerican people to believe they are there when they are not. We have \ndecided to put half of the moneys into the cops on the street program \nregardless, because we believe in that, too, to the degree that we \nshould do it. That is the degree. But we also put about half\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nof the money into a block grant so those communities have the \nflexibility to do whatever is in the best needs of their community. \nThat makes sense.\n  I do not understand the argument against it--to just dictate from \nWashington that you have cops on the streets whether you want them or \nnot, and if you do not want them or cannot use them, you do not get \nanything out of this bill. I would rather have these police people \nthroughout the country get good things out of this bill that will help \nthem to meet their law enforcement needs in their area than have us \nwonderful people in the U.S. Senate tell them what they have to have. \nSure, some of these communities will have their hands out for anything, \nand I cannot blame them. Any time you can find money that is just a \ngift, why not take it?\n  What we want to do is have these moneys go for the purposes they \nshould go for, the best possible, flexible response to crime in this \ncountry. This bill does that. I think anybody who says otherwise just \ndoes not understand what is in the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the debate that we are having today \nfocuses on the specific issue of community police. I would like, at a \nlater point, to discuss some of my opinions and observations about this \nparticular form of use of police personnel from a recent experience in \na specific community in my State of Florida.\n  But as a context of this, I would like to raise the question of what \nis the appropriate Federal, State, local role in law enforcement? What \nshould be the nature of the Federal Government's participation in our \ncollective efforts to provide security to our homes, our neighborhoods, \nour States, and our Nation? Let me suggest just three items that I \nthink are important principles for that relationship and for the \nFederal role.\n  First is that the Federal Government must fulfill its own specific \nand singular obligations. Mr. President, that sounds obvious. Of \ncourse, the Federal Government ought to fulfill its obligations. \nUnfortunately, there have been too many instances in which that has not \nbeen the case and in which other levels of government, therefore, were \nforced to divert their resources to carry out what otherwise would have \nbeen a Federal responsibility.\n  Example: My State is replete with instances in which the Federal \nGovernment, through specific agencies, established thresholds of a \nparticular criminal activity which must be passed before the Federal \nagencies would assume responsibility. It was a Federal crime at a lower \nlevel of intensity. But for various reasons, generally having to do \nwith the resources or other set of priorities available to Federal \nagencies, those agencies would not investigate or prosecute activities \nunless it reached a particular quantity.\n  This has been particularly true as it relates to drug-related \noffenses. Unless you were caught with several pounds of marijuana, or \nsignificant amounts of cocaine, even though you were subject to Federal \ninvestigation and arrest and prosecution, you, in fact, were not. So, \ntherefore, it became the obligation of the local law enforcement \nagencies to spend their resources in doing what should have been a \nFederal obligation.\n  What makes this particularly vexing is that these prosecution \nstandards are not evenly applied across the Nation. So that one \ncommunity in America receives a different level of Federal law \nenforcement support than does another. I think those differences are \nintolerable and that one of the first steps in the Federal-State-local \npartnership ought to be that the Federal Government would meet its \nresponsibilities and do so on an evenhanded basis across America.\n  Second, I think the Federal Government has an important role to play \nin assisting in the coordination of law enforcement agencies. The \nFederal Government has some natural characteristics that lead it to be \nan important partner, if not the first among equals, when there are \nefforts to bring several law enforcement agencies together. The \nexamples that have been used in areas of drug enforcement, where the \nFederal Government has, through leadership and through financial \nincentive, encouraged States and local communities to collaborate more \neffectively, has served a very salutary function.\n  A third area in which the Federal Government has a role to play is to \nencourage innovation and dissemination of best practices in law \nenforcement. So that if a particular community engages in an activity \nwhich has demonstrated its effort for efficacy, I think the Federal \nGovernment has a role in spreading that best practice as rapidly as \npossible to other communities which can benefit by that.\n  Mr. President, left out of this list of what I think are appropriate \nFederal roles is for the Federal Government to become involved in a \ngeneral, nondirect form of assistance to State and local law \nenforcement. I do not believe that this is an appropriate role for the \nFederal Government, and that is a ditch into which we have fallen \nbefore and I fear are about to fall again. Law enforcement is a State \nand local responsibility, and it should be the primary responsibility \nof the citizens at the State and local level to be charged with the \nestablishment of priorities and direction, and to provide the financing \nfor that level of law enforcement which that community feels to be \nappropriate.\n  This is not by any means a novel suggestion. Fifteen years ago, the \nPresident of the United States of America was Ronald Reagan. Ronald \nReagan, in his first years in office, advocated a principle called New \nFederalism. That principle was built around the idea that there should \nbe an allocation of major responsibilities to levels of government, \nthat we should try to avoid what had become a marble cake in which \nvirtually every level of government was involved in every decision of \ngovernment.\n  President Reagan advocated, among other things, Mr. President, an \nadvocacy which has, I am afraid, been forgotten in our current debate, \nthat the Federal Government had a particular responsibility for those \nprograms that related to the income maintenance of our citizens and \nthat those programs that might cause a citizen to move from one State \nto the other seeking higher benefit levels should be nationalized \nbecause it was not in the interest of the Nation to have people induced \nto make those kind of relocations. He was particularly an advocate that \nMedicaid should be a national responsibility, both because of its \ntendency to induce people movement but also--and I think this was quite \nprophetic of President Reagan--that we were going to need to relook at \nthe relationship between Medicaid and Medicare as they served the \nchanging needs of our older population and that we would have a better \nopportunity to look at that interrelationship if both Medicare and \nMedicaid were national responsibilities. I believe that suggestion \nwhich was made 15 years ago is even more true today.\n\n  President Reagan also identified some activities that he felt the \nFederal Government ought to get out of and let the States and local \ngovernments assume a greater degree of responsibility. One of those was \ntransportation. Frankly, I hope that in the next few months as we look \nagain at the Federal Government's commitment to transportation that we \nwill relook at some of the wisdom of Ronald Reagan in terms of his \nrecommendation, if that should be more of a State responsibility, \nparticularly in this post-interstate era.\n  But another topic in which President Reagan felt should be turned \nback to States with less Federal involvement was law enforcement. He \nfelt that law enforcement was a function which was inherently State and \nlocal in its character and should be looked to be carried out with \nlimited Federal involvement. He was well aware of the status of the Law \nEnforcement Assistance Act, the program which had provided block grants \nto States and local communities, a program which lost focus, lost \naccountability, and finally lost public and political support and \ncollapsed.\n  I am afraid that we are looking more to the failed experience of the \nLaw Enforcement Assistance Act program than we are to the appropriate \nrole of the Federal Government in law enforcement as we consider this \nproposal to reestablish a Federal Government block grant. I do not \nbelieve that a\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\ngeneral purpose block grant has an appropriate role in the Federal \nrelationship with State and local governments for the purpose of law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. President, I indicated that I thought that one of the areas in \nwhich there was an appropriate Federal role had to do with the issue of \ninnovation and encouraging best practice and dissemination of those \nbest practices. In the best tradition of that effort to stimulate best \npractice is what the Federal Government has done as it relates to \ncommunity policing. Community policing is a concept that in many ways \nis as old as law enforcement in this Nation, a concept which, for a \nvariety of reasons, waned in recent decades, for which we have paid, I \nthink, a heavy price in the loss of the benefits of a closing \nrelationship between law enforcement personnel and the communities they \nserve.\n  I believe that this is an ideal example of the Federal Government \nusing its specific target influence to encourage innovation, in this \ncase, the reinvention of a fundamental American idea of the close \npartnership between the police and the neighborhoods that they serve. \nIt works to reduce crime. Community policing works to create bonds of \ntrust between police officers and their neighborhoods and their \ncitizens. Community policing works because it involves the entire \ncommunity in the business of increasing public safety.\n\n  Mr. President, let me share with you an experience that I had on \nFebruary 10 of this year. For over 20 years I have been taking \ndifferent jobs every month, and on February 10, 1996, this program \nbrought me to the headquarters of the police department of Port St. \nLucie, FL. Port St. Lucie, FL is a town in Florida in the middle \nAtlantic coast which has been undergoing an explosion of population. It \nis one of the fastest growing cities in our rapidly growing State. It \nis a community which has developed a very diverse population. It is a \npopulation which is in many neighborhoods, in a very scattered housing \npattern; that is, there will be only a few houses with several still \nyet to be built upon lots in a particular block. In many ways, it would \nappear as if Port St. Lucie was not a good candidate for the concept of \ncommunity policing as many people know it--the policemen on the beat \nwalking from home to home and store to store.\n  Port St. Lucie has received under the crime bill of 1994 $525,000, \nwhich has allowed it to hire six new officers and a supervisory \nsergeant for purposes of implementing its community policing program.\n  The first person I saw upon arriving at the city hall and at the \npolice department of Port St. Lucie was the police chief, Chief \nReynolds. I asked him what had been his experience in the first 2 years \nof implementing community policing in a city with the characteristics \nof Port St. Lucie, FL. He was extremely enthusiastic, and he listed as \nsome of the things that had made him a believer in the concept of \ncommunity policing the fact that he had a strong community-neighborhood \ngeographic orientation, that under traditional police patterns, \nofficers were rotated generally on a 30-day basis from one neighborhood \nto the other. This made it very difficult, if not impossible, for there \nto be a bond developed between an individual police officer and the \ncitizens for whom that officer was responsible.\n  Community policing was proactive. It had reduced the need for \nemergency responses in his city because, through community policing, \nthey were dealing with problems while they were still manageable, not \nbefore they had become emergencies.\n  There was a new access to public officials and to nonlaw enforcement \nactivities, as the community police officer in many cases served an \nombudsman function, intermediary, assisting the citizens not only in \nmeeting their traditional law enforcement needs but also in areas like \ndirecting the citizens to the appropriate public works officials to fix \nup a problem with a street or to a housing code enforcement officer if \nthere was an instance of failure to maintain a home in adequate \ncondition. The community police served to mitigate community problems \nby dealing with a squabble while it was still a squabble before it had \nfestered into a major controversy.\n  Those were just some of the preliminary concepts of community \npolicing that caused Chief Reynolds to be such a strong advocate. As I \nspent the day working with the officers of the Port St. Lucie Police \nDepartment I experienced some of those concepts in reality.\n  I worked with Officer Joe Diskin through much of my day, and with \nOfficer Diskin we met community members in senior centers. We talked to \nthem about what was happening in their neighborhood, and if there were \nany problems that we might deal with while they were still at a \nmanageable stage. Part of my day was spent at the Darwin Square Plaza \nin downtown Port St. Lucie. For years, citizens in that area had been \nconcerned about harassment and about loitering and about allegations \nthat the plaza was being used for drug dealing. Recently, the Port St. \nLucie Police Department, utilizing the personnel resources available \nthrough the community policing grant, established a substation in the \nDarwin Square Mall. Within a matter of weeks, there had been a decline \nin citizen complaints. There had been a decline in assaults, major and \nminor. There had been an increase in public confidence about using that \ncommercial facility.\n  I spent a considerable amount of my time going from store to store, \ntalking with the owners, with employees, with customers who frequent \nthe mall. In every instance, I received acclaim for what the community \npolicing program had meant in the quality of their lives.\n  Mr. President, community policing is working in Port St. Lucie, FL. \nIt is an ideal example of the Federal Government using its targeted \nrole in the family of Federal-State-local government law enforcement to \nencourage innovation and the dissemination of best practices. It is not \nan inappropriate Federal Government intrusion into the State and local \nresponsibility for law enforcement which I fear a return to the LEAA \nblock grant approach would lead us to.\n  When we vote today, we are not just deciding the future of the \ncommunity policing program and the opportunity that it offers to \naccelerate this reinvention of a fundamental American idea of the \npolice and the community working together. We are also deciding on the \nfuture of the Federal Government's role in law enforcement. I believe \nin the philosophy of President Reagan that Government will best serve \nits people if there is a clear understanding of what level of \nGovernment is responsible for what activity, and that law enforcement \nwill best serve the needs of the people if it continues to be primarily \na State and local responsibility, and that the insertion of a Federal \nblock grant for indeterminate purposes is an inappropriate concept \nwithin that philosophy of new federalism and State and local \nresponsibility for law enforcement.\n  Mr. President, we have an idea which is working to make a positive \nimpact on the security of our people. That idea is community policing. \nWe should continue with this idea, as we look for other innovations \nthat the Federal Government can encourage at the State and local \ngovernment level. But we should become intrusive in terms of the basic \nresponsibility at home for the protection of our neighborhoods and our \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment which is \nbefore us which will keep us on an appropriate path and avoid us \nslipping into the ditch of an ill-considered, ill-formed Federal role.\n  I urge you to do this. If he were here today, Mr. President, I \nsuggest that President Reagan would encourage us to support this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment and to \nurge my colleagues to vote for it for a number of important reasons. I \nthink the COPS Program does represent a partnership between the Federal \nand State and local governments.\n  This proposal by the majority party is another manifestation of the \nsolutions they propose in a range of areas: package up some money, tie \nit in a bow, block grant it, ship it someplace else and tell whoever \nyou are shipping it to: Go ahead and spend the money. We raised it. You \nspend it. We will not watch. And somehow that will fix our country's \nproblems.\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\n  Senator Biden and others, including me, when we put the crime bill \ntogether, said there are certain things we would like to encourage, and \nwe provided resources with which to encourage them. One of those things \nwas putting cops on the street to provide more community policing. The \nprogram has been very successful. The proposal by the majority party \nnow would retreat on our efforts to provide more community policing and \nhelp provide the resources with which to do that. We are told now by \nthe majority party: Let us back away from that, and we will go back to \nthe old days. Just block grant it and let somebody back home decide \nexactly what their needs are because they can decide that best.\n  I think in some cases that might be correct. They can decide best \nwhat their needs are, and that is why they can decide whether they want \nto access money for community policing. And if they do not want to \naccess it, that is fine. But if they do want to, then this is a \nresource the Federal Government provides in partnership with them.\n  We have already been through one iteration of a block grant in law \nenforcement, the LEAA Program which, I would say, was extraordinarily \nwasteful in many ways. Some of my colleagues have already described how \nsome of that money was spent: $79,000 spent by one State--this is \nFederal money that was free to them--for a tank and machine guns. \nAnother $27,000 LEAA award was to study why inmates would want to \nescape from prison. That, by the way, got Senator Proxmire's Golden \nFleece Award. I have a lot of friends in North Dakota who could tell us \nwhy inmates want to escape from prison for a whole lot less than \n$27,000. They could study that for about $5 and come up with a quick \nanswer.\n  In 1970, LEAA provided money for a twin-engine Beechcraft airplane. \nThey spent money for a six-passenger, twin-engine airplane for police \nwork in fighting against crime. It was free Federal money, just a block \ngrant, so they got $84,000. The problem is the flight logs were \nchecked, it was discovered that the plane was used mostly by the \nGovernor flying around with his family and staff and other non-law \nenforcement personnel flying around going to meetings, apparently \nfighting crime. But it was Federal money, so they were able to get an \nairplane to fly the Governor around.\n  One university got a $293,000 grant to decide whether to make--but \nnot to actually create--a loose leaf encyclopedia on law enforcement. \nOne city bought a police car with no markings on it with the money, the \nold LEAA money. That car was used primarily by the mayor. Maybe it was \nnot so much to fight crime.\n  We have had some experience with having one level of government raise \nthe money and give it to another level of government and say: by the \nway, we raised the money, you go ahead and spend it, and we will not \nwatch you. It is kind of like passing an ice cube around.\n  I guess my question is, if that is the notion, why would you want to \nrun the money through Washington? Why not simply say: let us cut \nFederal taxes, and say to the local governments and the Governors: if \nyou want this money for law enforcement, raise taxes back home and \nspend the money back home. Why should we separate where we raise the \nmoney from where we spend the money? This is the ultimate manifestation \nhere. We are going to block grant everything around here. Why not say \nto the Governors: well, raise taxes and pay for these programs \nyourself. But they say: no, let us run the money through Washington \nfirst so we can cycle it around here a while, and then send it back and \nsay: by the way, you spend it; we will not watch you, and it will not \nmatter to us.\n  That is what this amendment is about, in many ways. We put together a \ncommunity policing program that is working and it is available to those \ncommunities who need it, with some matching funds. If they do not need \nit, they do not apply for it. If they do not want it, they do not get \nit. But if they need it and want it, then that money is available.\n  The fact is, all of the information demonstrates that this program \nhas worked and has worked well. It has provided more police on the \nstreets, and everybody understands that one of the ways to prevent \ncrime is to put police on the street. Far from deciding that we do not \ncare what the local government's decisions are going to be, I would \nlike to move in the other direction and say to State and local \ngovernments, we do care and we want to be involved in some of it.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues something on a slightly different \nissue. We have 3,400 people who have been murdered in this country; \n3,400 murders committed by people who were in State prisons but who \nwere let out early because it was too crowded. They got good time \ncredit, they got whatever you get to get out early, so they got out \nearly and murdered 3,400 more people. In those cases, in my judgment, \nthe governments were accessories to murder. We knew these people were \nviolent because they had committed a violent crime. We locked them up \nand then let them out early because we said, ``Well, you were good in \nprison so we will let you out early.'' Then they go out and murder \nagain.\n  Let me just talk about two cases briefly because I am going to \nintroduce some legislation, which is slightly different than this \namendment, next week. I will support this amendment. This is the right \napproach. But let me just quickly describe two cases. When somebody \nsays, ``what business is it of anybody's, on a national basis, to deal \nwith these issues,'' I say that it is a national issue when you have \n3,400 people murdered by people who should not have been in a position \nto murder anybody.\n  There is a piece of prose that I thought was really well written, a \ncolumn in last Saturday's Washington Post, written by Colbert King. It \nis entitled ``The `Wrong Place, Wrong Time' Dodge.'' The reason I was \ninterested in it was because the columnist was writing about a tragic \nmurder that happened here in Washington, DC, that I had also \nresearched. It struck me as so strange and so unthinkable that this \ntype of tragedy could continue to happen in our country. The columnist \nwrote about the murder of a young woman named Bettina Pruckmayr. \nBettina was a 26-year-old young attorney, and she lived here in \nWashington, DC. She was just starting her career. On December 16--not \nso awfully long ago--she was abducted in a carjacking, driven to an ATM \nmachine in Washington, DC. She was stabbed 38 times.\n  Colbert King, in his column in the Washington Post, graphically \ndescribes what happened to poor Bettina Pruckmayr. She was stabbed in \nthe back, three times in the neck, and in dozens of other places. Some \nwounds were so deep that her bones were broken. The person who \nallegedly murdered Bettina Pruckmayr, a young woman who was in a \nparking lot adjacent to her home and was kidnaped and murdered, is a \nman named Leo Gonzales Wright. Wright is now facing murder charges, but \nhe should not have been in the position, under any circumstance, to \nhave murdered anybody. He is a fellow who had already murdered. He had \nraped. He committed robbery. He committed burglary. And he murdered. He \nwas in prison and then let out early because the Government said, ``We \ndo not have enough room so you go ahead and go out on the streets.'' \nThis person, allegedly, on the streets, murdered Bettina Pruckmayr. He \nshould not have been anywhere in a position to murder anyone, but \nsomebody let him out of prison.\n  In fact, not only did they let him out, but, when he was out, he was \ncaught and picked up for selling drugs. The parole board did not put \nhim back in prison. As a result, Bettina Pruckmayr is dead.\n  It is not just her. Mr. President, 3,400 Americans were murdered in \nthose circumstances. Let me describe one additional victim, again \nmurdered recently, and again in this area.\n\n  It is the story of a young boy named Jonathan Hall, a 13-year-old boy \nfrom Fairfax, VA. He was a young boy who had some difficulty in his \nbackground, but a 13-year-old boy who, I am sure, wanted a good life \nand wanted to grow up, like all young boys do. He was found, instead, \nin an icy pond, stabbed 58 times, with dirt and grass between his \nfingers. Apparently, when he was left there for dead, he, in his last \nmoments, tried to pull himself out of this pond but did not make it.\n  Who murdered this young boy? Again, it does not take Dick Tracy to\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nunderstand who does these things. A person who had been convicted of \nmurder previously, not once but twice--two separate murders--and a \nkidnaping. This fellow was sent to prison, this man named James Buck \nMurray, who allegedly killed this young boy. He was sent to prison for \n20 years for slashing the throat of a cab driver. Then, while in \nprison, escaped while on work release and kidnapped a woman. Then, he \nwas convicted of murdering a fellow inmate. But Murray was let out of \nprison long before he completed the terms of his sentence.\n  This person should not have been in a position to murder anybody \nunder any condition. He should have been in prison. But instead, a 13-\nyear-old boy is dead. Jonathan Hall is dead, Bettina Pruckmayr is dead, \nand 3,400 other people are dead, because this system does not work.\n  People say, ``That is none of your business. That is not of national \nimportance. That is for State and local governments.'' Those people who \nlet these violent criminals out of jail to kill others ought to be told \nby us this is a matter of national importance.\n  Let me finish in a moment. I will be happy to yield for a unanimous \nconsent request to Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that at the hour of 5:45 today, \nSenator Dole be recognized to make a motion to table the Biden \namendment No. 3483, and, further, that the time between now and 5:45 \ntoday be equally divided between Senator Biden and Senator Hatch or his \ndesignee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have a national interest in this country in addressing \nthis crime issue. We had a national interest when we put together \nsomething under Senator Biden's leadership that talked about putting \nmore police on the streets in this country. We did it and it works and \nit makes a lot of sense. We ought not retreat from that.\n  I also make the point, as I have just made previously about the \nmurders committed in this country by people who should not be out of \njail, that we have a national interest in addressing that issue as \nwell. Why are people who have been previously convicted of violent \ncrimes being let out of prison early so they can murder again? We need \nto ask these questions of State governments. We ought to ask them if \nthere is not some way we can work together to decide, if prisons are so \nfull that you cannot keep the kind of murderous characters in prison \nwho now go out and murder again, to build more prisons, because we want \nto keep these people in jail.\n  These people would not be let out of Federal prisons, by the way--\nthese are not Federal prisoners--to murder 3,400 people, because you do \nnot get an early parole in the Federal system, thanks to Senator Biden. \nYou do not get good time in Federal prisons, thanks to me and some \nothers. You are sentenced to jail in the Federal system and you spend \nyour time in jail. You are not going to be out murdering again before \nyour sentence ends.\n  But, guess what? If you are a convicted murderer in this country, if \nyou are convicted of committing a murder somewhere, you are going to be \nsentenced to around 10 years in prison, but you will not serve 10 years \nin prison. You will serve 6\\1/2\\ to 7 years. Why? Because it was \ndecided that murderers should get out early.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am sorry, murderers ought not get out early under any \ncondition, and if we cannot protect the Jonathan Halls and Bettina \nPruckmayrs, and other people who were killed by murderers who should \nnot have been in a position to kill anybody, then we should not be in \nthe business of law enforcement.\n  I support this amendment. It makes eminent good sense, and I support \nmany initiatives by Senator Biden and others on our side of the aisle \nwho have worked long and hard on this issue. There are good ideas from \nthe other side as well, and I appreciate those.\n  But it is not a good idea to step back, it is a good idea to step \nforward in addressing crime. Preserving the COPS Program is one step.\n  I intend in the coming days to offer a second step, not on this bill \nbut as a separate piece of legislation, dealing with the issue of those \nwho have been previously convicted of violent crimes, that they ought \nnot get good time to go out and murder again, that they ought not be \nput on our streets early. Bettina Pruckmayr and Jonathan Hall should \nnot have been killed, and more in the future will not be killed if we \ndeal with this appropriately.\n  Mr. President, with that, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware, \nfor whom I have great respect for his leadership on this issue. I do \nhope the Senate will, when considering this issue, decide that what we \ndid to put more police on the streets in this country made sense then \nand it makes sense now. That is an approach and progress from which we \nshall not retreat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. The time is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need, \nbut I plan to be relatively brief. I just want to comment and follow up \non what the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, just said.\n  One of the significant problems we have--and I agree with him--is the \nproblem of people who are getting out of prison at the State and local \nlevels before they should. The problem, though, I think, is in large \nmeasure stemming from Washington and needs to be addressed. I invite \nthe Senator from North Dakota to join me in some legislation on which \nwe have had hearings before the Judiciary Committee. A number of other \nStates have been similarly affected.\n  It turns out that Federal rules and regulations under the CRIPA \nlegislation, as well as Federal court orders, are actually forcing \npeople out of prisons prematurely. In my State, we entered into a \nconsent decree with the Department of Justice back in the 1980's with \nrespect to conditions in Michigan prisons.\n  By 1992, we had an agreement with the Department of Justice that we \nhad satisfied the problems that had caused this consent decree to be \nentered into. The Federal judge who had jurisdiction, nonetheless, even \nafter the Department of Justice was willing to allow the consent decree \nto be removed, maintained continuing jurisdiction and is forcing people \nout of our State prisons prematurely.\n  For the city of Philadelphia, as we heard testimony in the Judiciary \nCommittee, this is a problem that literally has meant that people \narrested for committing violent crimes, because of a cap that has been \nplaced on the amount of people who can be allowed in the prison system \nin Philadelphia, are not being incarcerated, are not being held. The \nSenator from Delaware was at the same hearing.\n\n  I hope we can get together on this. I think that is a whole different \nset of issues, and I think it very important they not be merged into \nthis debate. I want to make it clear, I think that is a whole separate \ntopic, and I would like to work together with the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me for a question for a moment? \nYou make a good point. I would be very interested in talking with you \nabout your proposal. I may very well consider supporting it.\n  If the Federal Government is part of the problem, then let us solve \nthat part of the problem that we can in Federal law.\n  I will say this. There are some States--and I do not know what \nMichigan does--there are some States that provide over 430 days a year \nof good time credit for every year a violent prisoner serves. I am \nsaying to the States, ``Look, if these people committed multiple \nmurders, I don't want you giving them a year-off credit for every year \nthey spend in jail.'' Put them there and keep them there.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I do not want to take much time on our side. Part of the \nreason these things are beginning to happen is because in order to meet \nvarious Federal court consent decrees, as well as the other regulations \nthat have been imposed, it is forcing States to make decisions that I \ndo not think they would make if they did not find themselves subject to \nit. I would be very anxious to work on it.\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for his generous comments about my role in this \nlegislation. I must say, I knew of the Senator when he was a \nCongressman, and I, quite frankly, have been impressed at how dogged he \nhas been in pursuing tougher approaches to crime.\n  The Senator from Michigan spoke about frivolous lawsuits. He is \ncorrect, this is worthy of a debate at another time. I think his \nintention is positive. I think he may have the perverse effect of \nbringing about the exact opposite result he wants.\n  Unfortunately, a lot of what he suggested is in the bill before us. I \nkind of find it fascinating. We had this debate. We had a hearing in \nthe Judiciary Committee. We did not do much else. Starting at page 153 \nof the continuing resolution and continuing for, I do not know how many \npages here, entitled section 802, ``Appropriate Remedies for Prison \nConditions,'' we essentially rewrite the law. The fact of the matter \nis, nobody in this body even knows what is in this bill. Senator \nHatch's staff knows. Senator Abraham's staff knows, Senator Abraham \nknows, Senator Biden knows. None of you, I will bet you a million \nbucks, has any notion what is in this bill. Zero. I am willing to bet \nyou anything.\n\n  But it will not be the first time I have or others have voted on \nthings we do not know is contained in omnibus bills like this.\n  Let me respond to the comments about my amendment to restore 100,000 \ncops. A couple of my colleagues have stood up and said, ``100,000 cops, \njust not true, never going to happen.'' There are 33,000 cops already, \njust from the time we passed the bill, after spending $1.6 billion of \nthe $8.8 billion. Then we heard, of course, 100,000 cops are never \ngoing to, nor should it, fund 100 percent of the local police now or in \nthe future. That is true. No one ever said this was going to support \n100 percent.\n  Guess what folks? The block grants do not either. The block grants do \nnot do it either, nor should they. It is not the Federal Government's \nrole to promise in perpetuity to the local communities to fund forever. \nThis does fund 100,000 cops, and it does fund them for 5 years or so. \nThe cops and the States are going to have to pick up the tab. Guess \nwhat? It funds 100 percent of what we give them in the block grant, but \nthe block grant ends. I challenge any of my Republican colleagues to \nstand up and promise that this bill contains in perpetuity a commitment \nto continue to pay out of the Federal payroll for any cop hired under \nthis bill. This is not going to happen. It is not supposed to happen. \nIt was not designed to happen. So it is, what we used to call in law \nschool, a red herring to suggest this fully funds the cops.\n  Funds are in the trust fund. We heard funds are just not there. The \nfunds are in the trust fund. Let us recall the Republicans cut $200 \nmillion from the $4.287 billion that is in the trust fund in 1996 in \ntheir budget resolution. So if they keep up their efforts, maybe they \nwill be able to deplete the trust fund so there will not be any money \nin it. The money was there. They cut the trust fund in the Republican \nbudget resolution.\n  I also heard we have to end the Washington-knows-best philosophy. \nWell, that is what the 100,000 cops is all about. Local communities \ndecide if they want to apply, local communities define local policing \nstrategy for themselves and the Republicans call for a separate prison \ngrant of $100 million that does not let them decide the same way that \nwe allow them to decide, because communities have to pick up the costs \nfor each cop after 3 years.\n  ``One hundred thousand cops is a lie,'' one of my colleagues said. My \nresponse is, neither 100,000 cops nor a block grant is going to be or \nshould be a permanent entitlement program, and we do not want to \nfederalize local police. There is no difference. No difference, except \nyou get fewer cops and less money under the block grant approach.\n  Now we also heard New York City did not receive one new cop.\n  New York City got $54 million to redeploy 2,175 cops through the COPS \nMore Program. So we gave them that money, the Federal Government. They \nput up the rest, and they were able to redeploy from inside the \nprecincts 2,175 cops.\n  D.C. It was also said D.C. did not receive more cops. Response. D.C. \ngot $6,076,163 to redeploy 626 cops under the COPS More Program.\n  Also, it was said, the city should decide between cops and computers. \nMy response is, the COPS More Program is exactly that --$217 million in \n1996 that helped relocate and redeploy 13,000 cops by not having to go \nback to the station house.\n  Also, I heard block grants give you the right to use the dollars to \nhire new cops. Well, my response is, it must be guaranteed, not an \noption to hire new cops or they will not be hired.\n  I also heard it said on the floor by one of my respected colleagues, \n``I have long said 100,000 cops is a phony idea.'' Well, in November \n1993, a lot of people did not think it was such a bad idea, including \nthe Senator who thought it was a phony idea. I will not go through it \nbecause I would hate everybody reading everything I said back to me in \nthe Record. But, you know, it may be thought of as a phony idea now, \nbut it was not in 1993 when we were doing it.\n  The other criticism I heard is the continuing resolution level for \n100,000 cops, $975 million, is sufficient to get us there. Well, $975 \nmillion is not enough for this year, 1996. The CR provided $407 \nmillion, and $276 million has already been spent, and $130 million will \nbe spent on police technologies and police efforts to fight family \nviolence and community policing efforts.\n  The current CR would provide a total of $975 million for COPS. \nSubtract the $407 million, and that leaves $568 million for the rest of \nthe year, if the Hatfield amendment becomes law. But $522 million has \nalready been requested through March 6. In other words, that leaves $50 \nmillion for all other applications that come in from now through \nSeptember 30.\n  There is not enough. There is not enough. Just go back to your home \nStates, ask them if they are going to stop applying. No. If the State \nof Oklahoma, if the State of Utah, if the other States, they do not \nwant to apply for any more cops, God bless them. Wonderful, do not \napply. But if they do apply and they qualify on the merits, there is no \nmoney for them. We already have something like--where is that chart--\n7,766 new cops requested so far this year--requested. Oklahoma wants 94 \nnew ones.\n  My colleague says, ``Wow.'' Well, go tell the Oklahoma folks they do \nnot need them. I respect that. But the idea there is enough for those \nwho qualify and are requesting simply is not true.\n  We also heard Washington should not dictate local strategy. Well, my \nresponse is, we are not dictating local strategy. Nobody has to ask, \nand only big cities get COPS more dollars. That is also not true. You \nhave got American Fork in Vermont, Carbon County, Duchesne County, \nKane, Layton, Logan, Ogden, UT, Salt Lake, South Ogden--you know, the \nlist goes on and on. I did not know they were big cities.\n  Based on a salary of $65,000 to $70,000, this will not fund 100,000 \ncops. The truth is, the average salary is $40,000. I reserve the 20 \nseconds I may have left and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, enacted by the last Congress, contained a $30 \nbillion trust fund for State and local law enforcement programs. That \nlegislation made an important statement of our commitment to stand with \nour police officers in the war against crime by providing dedicated \nfunding to put 100,000 new cops on the streets.\n  From 1970 to 1990, we increased Federal spending on lawyers by 200 \npercent and prison spending by 156 percent, but we increased Federal \nspending on police officers by only 12 percent. The COPS Program would \nreverse that trend, without adding to the deficit, and without any new \ntaxes, by cutting thousands of jobs out of the Federal bureaucracy. \nMore police officers, fewer bureaucrats. That is the commitment enacted \ninto law by the last Congress.\n  Mr. President, there is no more important step that we can take to \nfight crime and support our law enforcement community than to increase \nthe number of cops on the streets. And that is\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\nwhat the COPS Program has been doing. That law has already funded \n25,000 new cops nationwide, including 825 in Michigan.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today would undermine this \nmilestone achievement of the last Congress by cutting in half the \nfunding provided to put new police officers on the street. Instead of \nthe $1.9 billion requested by the administration, and fully paid for \nout of the violent crime trust fund, this bill would provide only $950 \nmillion to put police officers on the street.\n  This cut in funding would not help reduce the deficit, and it would \nnot help balance the budget. Congress would still spend the same amount \nof money--we just would not spend it where it is needed, on new police \nofficers. Under the bill before us, the bulk of the funds would be \ntaken from the COPS Program and put into a block grant, which could \nthen be spent on anything from traffic lights to parking meters, \nwithout hiring a single new cop.\n  That is unacceptable. Let me tell you what it would mean for my State \nof Michigan. We currently have applications pending for more than 200 \nadditional police officer slots around the State. We have applications \nfor two new officers from the city of Alma, for three new officers from \nthe Ann Arbor Police Department, for one new officer from the Barry \nCounty Sherriff's Department, for two new police officers from the city \nof Battle Creek--I could go on and on. I ask unanimous consent that a \npartial list of pending applications for additional police officers \nfrom the State of Michigan be placed in the Record at this point.\n  The point is, each of these communities needs the help. And if we \npass this bill, we are not going to provide it. They need the \nadditional police officers to fight a very real war against crime, and \nif this bill passes in its current form, they are not going to get \nthem.\n  What is true of Michigan is true of other States as well. Every State \nin the country has dozens of pending applications for additional police \nofficers under the COPS Program, and if we slash the funding for this \nprogram, as proposed in this bill, they are not going to get what they \nneed. If this bill is passed in its present form, the funding for half \nof those applications will simply disappear.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to \nrestore full funding for the COPS Program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to restore funding to the Community Oriented Policing [COPS] \nProgram. Law enforcement officials from all across the country have \ntold us loud and clear, that the COPS Program is one of the 1994 Crime \nAct's most effective programs. To those who want to slash the COPS \nprogram by 50 percent in favor of a block grant, I have this to say: \n``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''\n  Consider this: Serious crime is retreating all across the United \nStates. Nationally, murder rates fell 12 percent in the first 6 months \nof 1995 and serious crimes of all kinds dropped 1 to 2 percent. Law \nenforcement across the United States credit community policing for \ncontributing to these declines. Now is not the time to cut back on our \nefforts to fight crime.\n  And more importantly, to my constituents in Iowa, it is rural America \nthat will pay the price if this amendment is not adopted. The COPS \nProgram made a special commitment to include small towns and rural \nareas. half of all COPS funding goes to agencies serving jurisdictions \nof under 150,000 in population. Block grant funding favors larger \npopulations so that even small towns with high crime rates would lose \nout. In 1995, Iowa received over $14 million to hire over 200 officers. \nOver 70 percent of law enforcement officers surveyed in my State, \nsupported the COPS Program.\n  Perhaps the most puzzling aspect of the proposal to slash funding for \nthe COPS Program is the loss of local control. Proponents traditionally \nargue that block grants increase local control. The crime prevention \nblock grant proposed in the continuing resolution does no such thing. \nThis initiative replaces a highly successful program that responds to \npublic desire for an increased police presence with a program that \nmerely gives money to State governments that may keep up to 15 percent \nbefore distributing the remainder to local governments. This is a \nsignificant departure from the COPS Program which funneled the funding \ndirectly to the local law enforcement agencies.\n  The block grant approach to crime prevention invites the abuse of \nfunds the COPS Program was created to eliminate, as well as doing away \nwith effective crime prevention programs that worked hand in hand with \ncommunity policing initiatives set up under the COPS Program. The block \ngrant approach is an ineffective response to our Nation's war against \ncrime and a sad departure from the successful efforts started under the \n1994 Violent Crime Control Act.\n  Community policing works. It is a flexible program that is responsive \nto law enforcement needs. More cops on the beat have an undeniable \neffect on crime and a community's sense of security. Nationwide, the \nCOPS Program serves 87 percent of America with 33,000 officers. We \nshould heed the advice of the folks that are on the frontlines in the \nfight against crime. I urge all my colleagues to support this important \namendment to restore funding to the COPS Program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I strongly support the Biden amendment \nand am proud to be a cosponsor of this important amendment. The \namendment would restore $1,788,000 to the COPS Program.\n  This funding will allow us to keep our promise to the American people \nto put 100,000 new police officers on our streets. Under the Violent \nCrime Control Act we passed in 1994, the COPS Program was created to \nprovide our communities with the police they need to fight crime.\n  COPS stands for community oriented policing services. So far the COPS \nProgram has made possible over 790 new police officers in my State of \nMaryland, and over 33,000 new officers nationwide.\n  Through the use of community policing, the COPS Program puts into \npractice what police chiefs and other experts have been saying for \nyears. They know that police officers fight crime and prevent crime \nmore effectively when they are integral members of the community they \nserve. They know the fight against crime will be won only when the \npolice work with citizens as full-fledged partners in the battle to \ntake back our streets.\n  Mr. President, the COPS Program is working. Why would we want to \nchange a law that is working?\n  If we start taking apart the crime control package we passed in 1994 \nwith bipartisan support, we leave to chance what we know is working \nnow. Let us continue to make it a priority to get more police out on \nthe streets.\n  By restoring the COPS Program, we are responding to a cry for help, a \ncry for more police officers on the street. We cannot ignore this cry \nfor help from all of those police departments who need more police.\n  My constituents are calling for an increase in the number of police \nofficers in their communities. My constituents are calling for more \ncrime prevention programs. The legislation to satisfy these calls has \nbeen passed, the programs are now established; why should we dismantle \nthem?\n  Mr. President, this bill, as reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee, provides no guarantees that even one new police officer will \nbe hired. The 1994 crime bill called for 100,000 new police on the \nstreets of America participating in community policing.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this: our failure to fulfill the \npromise of 100,000 new police officers means less partnership between \npolice and their communities, less work with community residents to \ndetect and supress crime, and a missed opportunity to keep our streets \nsafe for law-abiding citizens.\n  If we are going to take back our streets, we must empower our \ncommunities with the police they need. The concept of community based \npolicing is police officers and citizens forging alliances to combat \ncrime. I strongly oppose any efforts to cut community oriented policing \nprograms.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Biden amendment. \nPassage of this amendment will allow our citizens and their partners in \nlaw enforcement to continue to combat crime together by delivering more \nnew police officers to the frontline.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time do we have remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has, on his side, 9 minutes, 8 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself--I see the Senator from Utah. Please \nnotify me in 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After 5 minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. In 5 minutes.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment. I am kind of amused and kind \nof interested in it as well. This is an amendment that says we want to \ntake whatever money we have available and we want to mandate that it \nhas to be spent in the COPS Program.\n  Obviously, it is a popular program, as illustrated by the Senator \nfrom Delaware, because a lot of people have applied for it. Why would \nthey apply for it? Well, it is Uncle Sam saying, ``We will pay for 75 \npercent of the cost for new policemen in your community for the first \nyear, the second year 50 percent, and the third year, 25 percent, and \nthe fourth year you are on your own.''\n  But a lot of communities, if they see Uncle Sam waving some dollar \nsigns around, they say, ``Yes, we want to grab a hold of it.'' Maybe it \nis the best way to spend resources in fighting crime, maybe it is not.\n  I will mention to my colleague there are not just big cities that \nqualify for this program. We had one community in Oklahoma, Moffett, \nOK, that applied for money, was eligible to receive the money. Just a \ncouple comments. It is a fairly small town. Unfortunately, they do not \nhave a police force, but yet they qualified. I do not remember exactly \nthe amount. But it was, I think, about $180,000. But they did not have \na police force.\n  As a matter of fact, this little town had volunteer fire and police, \nbut they did not have an organized police force. Yet, they received \nthis money. They did not know what to do with it. To make the story \nshort, when they realized they would have to do the matching, that was \na serious problem for this little town, even if they had to match 25 \npercent the first year, 50 percent the second.\n  The end of the story is they went through a lot of city managers in a \nperiod of about a year or so and finally decided they did not need this \ngrant, they could not afford it. Also kind of humorous, but of \ninterest, they said, ``We can do a lot more if we just had a little \nmore leeway in what to do with this money. We need some help.'' They \nmade that comment. ``And we could use it for''--frankly, I do not think \nthey had a police car. I could go on and on.\n  But this bill says that the money that we are going to give, we are \ngoing to mandate that it go to the COPS Program because we decided in \nWashington, DC, that is the best way to combat crime. Maybe some of the \ncommunities have a particular interest in juvenile crime and might \nthink that a better approach would be an effort to educate juveniles, \nor maybe they have a problem with drugs and juveniles, or maybe there \nare problems in other areas. Maybe more police are the answer; maybe \nthey are not. But we are coming up with this amendment that says we are \ngoing to take all the money available that is not earmarked and we are \ngoing to take the balance of it for the so-called COPS Program. I think \nit is a serious mistake. I do not think it is a Federal Government \nprerogative to hire policemen in my hometown.\n  Does my hometown of Ponca City, OK, need more police? Maybe they do. \nBut I think that is the responsibility of the people of Ponca City, OK. \nMaybe they have to raise the sales tax to pay for it, or maybe they \nhave to find some other method of paying for local police, but I do not \nthink it should be coming to Washington, DC, on bended knee and saying, \n``Please give me this money so we can hire another policemen. Oops, in \n3 years, we have a big liability.''\n  Uncle Sam starts out pretty generous paying at 75 percent. That is \npretty nice. But on the fourth year, they are on their own. And a lot \nof cities are saying, boy, that is a nice inducement for the first year \nor two, but after the third or fourth it is a real problem. Maybe we \nwill just do this for a year or two and then let people go, or maybe \nhave some attrition and not replace them in the third or the fourth \nyear. My point being that this is not a Federal responsibility.\n  I do not want to federalize police, and 100,000 police officers is \nnot a drop in the bucket if you look at the national scheme. I do not \ndoubt that my colleagues who support this program can find somebody \nthat was hired in this program and they did a good job and they saved \nsomebody's life or they stopped crime or something, and I am grateful \nfor that. But I just question the right level of Government.\n  It is like this issue we had over speed limits. A lot of us decided \nthat the States should set speed limits instead of Washington, DC. \nLikewise, I would think community policing is a good idea. If \ncommunities want to do it, let them do it. Let them do it with their \nown money, not with Federal bribery or enhancements to pull or \nencourage the States to do it, and then find that they have such \nenormous liability.\n  Local policing is a local matter. That is something that should be \nunder the jurisdiction and control and financing of individual towns \nand cities, counties and States, not the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, that is the reason why I stand in opposition to this \namendment. The way we had the bill drafted, we had earmarked $975 \nmillion for COPS. That is half of that money. The cities would have \nlatitude to spend a significant amount of money for the COPS Programs. \nWe are not doing away with the COPS Program. If the city wanted to \nspend more for that, they would have that option. If they wanted to \nspend more for technology, if they wanted to spend more for juvenile \ncrime prevention, more for cracking down on drugs or surveillance or \nall kinds of different things, they would have that option, instead of \nthe Federal Government dictating, ``We think you should put it all into \nthe COPS Program. We know how best to spend this money. We know you \nshould put it exactly in this program.'' I think that is a mistake. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think it is a great idea to have cops on \nthe street. Our bill will do that. I think it is an equally great idea \nto make sure that we block grant some of the funds so the police \ndepartments can use them for whatever they need to use them for.\n  Using the New York illustration, there was not one additional \npoliceman put on the streets by the moneys sent to New York. They used \nthe moneys to deploy police people who were already there or to replace \npolice people who they were already capable of paying for. The fact is, \nthere is nothing in this approach of the 100,000 cops on the street \nthat means they have to be additional police people in addition to \nthose that were on the current police forces and were capable of being \npaid for by the local communities.\n  Be that as it may, I agree with the noble goal of having more police \non the streets. I think every Republican does. The problem is, why can \nour friends on the other side not see the value of allowing some \nflexibility so that the people who really have to solve these problems \nin the local communities have some flexibility to do so? The real \nquestion is whether we provide funds for cops and cops alone, or \nwhether we permit the funds to be used to meet the needs of the local \ncommunities and the local law enforcement agencies.\n  It seems to me that makes sense. It makes every bit of sense that \nanybody, it seems to me, who thinks seriously about it would agree. If \nwe are going to provide Federal money to local law enforcement \nagencies, then we should permit those agencies to use the funds as they \nsee fit. We have adequate protections in the bill so they cannot use it \nfor certain exotic reasons that some have criticized in the past.\n  Now, some of those who have criticized LEAA today are the people who \nsupported it the strongest. These are the kind of things that bother \nme, just a little bit. Unfortunately, this becomes a political exercise \nrather than what is best for the local communities. It becomes an \nexercise of Washington telling the local communities what they should \nand should not do. We know more, I guess, inside the beltway than the \npeople out there who have to face the problems in their respective \ncommunities. We all know that is bunk.\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\n  As a matter of fact, I think it is the most surreal and unreal place \non Earth sometimes right here within the beltway. These folks who face \nthose criminal problems day in and day out in the local communities \nknow a lot more what they should use their funds for. We should not be \ndictating it. We provide half the moneys for cops on the street; we \nprovide about half the money for block grants so they can use them to \nsolve their own individual law enforcement needs, which makes sense. \nWhy should we dictate that every dime has to go for the COPS Program? I \nagree with the COPS Program to the extent that we have granted it here \nin this bill, but we also have provided flexibility in this bill that \nmakes a lot of sense, it seems to me.\n  Again, the real question is whether we provide funds for COPS and \nCOPS alone or whether we give the local communities some ability to do \nthe things they think need to be done. The question is whether we fund \nthe COPS Program only and tell the communities like Washington, DC, \n``Sorry, we have no money for you,'' or to permit communities to use \nmoney for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am prepared to offer an amendment to establish a fund in \nthe U.S. Treasury to serve as a funding source for carrier compliance \nunder the Communications for Law Enforcement Assistance Act.\n  I understand the concern that is shared by some members of the \nAppropriations Committee is that creating this fund implies a \nsubsequent obligation to provide funding for carrier compliance. I also \nunderstand that this concern is highlighted by fears on the part of \nsome that carrier compliance may cost more than authorized amounts.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, the Senator cannot be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators will please take their conversations \noff the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would note that carrier compliance \nunder the Communications for Law Enforcement Assistance Act, which we \ncall CLEAA, does not obligate Congress to appropriate any funds in \nexcess of the amounts authorized.\n  I emphasize that we are losing ground in a important area. We passed \na bill last Congress that satisfied the various interests and \nconstituencies involved in this important issue. Now we need to move \nforward with funding.\n  In my view, the creation of this fund will not obligate my colleagues \non the Appropriations Committee to appropriate funds beyond what the \nCongress has already promised for this worthy purpose. Specifically, I \nam prepared to ask for a commitment between now and the time we take up \nthe fiscal year 1997 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill that \nwe will try to work this out. I hope that our staffs will establish a \nseries of meetings, the purpose of which would be to reach a resolution \nof this matter by fiscal year 1997.\n  It is important; with digital coming into being, we have got to be \nable to handle this aspect of law enforcement. And it is just going to \nhave to be something we meet.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge and congratulate \nthe Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for \npointing out this concern and this issue, which is a very legitimate \nconcern. I believe that with our staffs working together, we can work \nout the concerns the Appropriations Committee has relative to how we \nmanage the funding of\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nthis issue, and I look forward to having such an agreement worked out \nand will direct our staffs to work together.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognized the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. FORD. I am sorry. I apologize.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be willing to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. FORD. What are Senators trying to work out? The money you are \ngoing to give is grandiose, but I never heard----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. CLEAA is what we call carrier compliance under the \nCommunications for Law Enforcement Assistance Act. It is to aid our law \nenforcement agencies to be able to do their work with regard to the new \ndigital age, to be able, with court orders, to tap into digital phones \nso that they can follow criminals and organized crime.\n  Mr. FORD. This amendment would add more money than we have already \ngiven in the past?\n  Mr. HATCH. It will not add anything now. We are going to try to work \nit out in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. FORD. There is no additional funding?\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. FORD. Why do you need the amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because we need to have funding.\n  Mr. FORD. I thought there was no funding. This is an authorization?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. What we are agreeing to in the colloquy is that in the \nfuture 1997 budget and appropriations bills we try to find the money to \nbe able to do this law enforcement work, and my colleagues have said \nthey will work with me.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3490 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure that discretionary spending does not exceed the \n           level agreed to in the FY 1996 Budget Resolution)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3490 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II of the committee substitute, add the \n     following:\n       Sec.  . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     title, none of the amounts provided in this title is \n     designated by Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant \n     to section 251(b)(2)(D)(i) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (b) Each amount provided in a nonexempt discretionary \n     spending nondefense account for fiscal year 1996 is reduced \n     by the uniform percentage necessary to offset non-defense \n     discretionary amounts provided in this title. The reductions \n     required by this subsection shall be implemented generally in \n     accordance with section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, this is a very simple amendment. This \namendment tries to eliminate the need for an emergency designation in \nthis bill. We are adding $1.2 billion to the Federal budget deficit by \ndeclaring an emergency, but by eliminating the need for an emergency \ndesignation and cutting other discretionary spending accounts across \nthe board by .53 percent, we have an opportunity to fund these so-\ncalled emergencies but do it in a fiscally responsible manner where the \ndeficit does not go up.\n  Let me try to make my case. Let me make it as succinctly as I can, \nand then give others an opportunity to respond and oppose as well as to \nsupport.\n  First of all, since 1990, we have passed $80 billion of emergency \nsupplemental appropriation bills. In some cases, like the Persian Gulf, \nwe have been able to come back and offset that with payments from \nforeign nations. But just to give you an idea of the magnitude of this \nloophole that we have created by declaring emergencies, in 1994 we \ndeclared an emergency for the California earthquake and the Midwest \nfloods, and we spent $11 billion which was added directly to the \ndeficit.\n  In 1993 we declared an emergency for Midwest floods and added $3 \nbillion to the deficit, with funding also for the drought in the \nSoutheast. In 1993 again we added $1 billion to the deficit with an \nemergency for Somalia. In 1993 again we declared an emergency for \neconomic stimulus as a supplemental appropriation and added $4 billion \nto the deficit to extend unemployment benefits.\n  In 1992 we declared an emergency and spent $9.3 billion for two \nhurricanes, one on the mainland and one in Hawaii; and then for Typhoon \nOmar. In 1992 we declared a dire emergency to fund the costs incurred \nfor the Chicago flood and for the riot in Los Angeles. I remember being \nin the conference and I moved to strike a provision where we were \ndeclaring an emergency to fund lawyers to defend the rioters. \nFortunately, that provision died because people were shamed out of it. \nIn 1992 we had another dire emergency. I could go on and on, but I \nthink I made my point. My point is we have a lot of emergencies around \nhere.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that families have emergencies, but I \nwant to go through what happens when a family has an emergency and what \nhappens when the Government has the emergency and explain the \ndifference. Families have emergencies. Let me just offer an example. \nJohnny falls down the steps and breaks his arm. He is taken to the \nhospital and it costs $700 to set Johnny's arm with the attendant \nmedical expenditures. The family has had an emergency.\n  If this family were the Federal Government, the Brown family would \nsay, ``Well, look, we have already planned that we are going on \nvacation this summer. We have already planned that we are buying a new \nrefrigerator. We have already set our monthly budget. This is an \nemergency, we cannot pay for it, so we are just going to add it on to \nour spending.'' That is what we are doing here. But that is not what \nthe Brown family does. What the Brown family does is they go back and \nsay, ``Well now, look, we have incurred an expense of $700 because \nJohnny broke his arm, so we are not going on vacation this year. We had \nplanned it, we had written it in our budget, but now we cannot afford \nit because we had an emergency. Johnny broke his arm.'' In fact, the \ndefinition of an emergency in this case is something they have to spend \nmoney on and so they have to take it away from another purpose. They \nmay decide they are not going to buy a new refrigerator.\n  It seems to me that we can have a procedure that is exactly analogous \nto what families have to do, by saying we have an emergency, we are \ngoing to provide $1.2 billion for many worthy objectives, but to pay \nfor it we are going to take all the other nondefense appropriated \naccounts and reduce them across the board --and let me remind my \ncolleagues, we have in the supplemental a defense expenditure. We \noffset every penny of it. We only have emergencies in nondefense. We do \nnot have an emergency in defense in this bill, though we have had them \nin the past. We generally do not have them. And we do not have one \nhere.\n  So, what I want to do is for nondefense accounts, in a simple across-\nthe-board procedure, what we have done with specific accounts in \ndefense. If someone wants to come up with a substitute that cuts \nspecific programs as an alternative, I am willing to look at it. That, \nbasically, is what my amendment does. Let me explain why it is so \nimportant.\n  The American people got the idea that we were trying to do something \nabout the deficit when we passed the Contract With America. The \nPresident has vetoed the Contract With America. We are now under a \ncontinuing resolution which is a temporary funding measure. We have a \nbill in front of us that already spends $2.3 billion more than that \ntemporary funding measure spends on an annual basis. So, if we pass \nthis bill, rather than simply rolling over that bill through the end of \nthe year, we are going to spend $2.3 billion more than simply rolling \nover the continuing resolution would do, in any case.\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n  But let me remind my colleagues that yesterday all but some 16 \nMembers of this body voted to increase spending by $2.6 billion. In \nfact, we had an interesting occurrence and that is our Democratic \ncolleagues said, ``Let us increase spending by $3.1 billion.'' One of \nour Republican colleagues said, ``No, let us increase spending by $2.6 \nbillion.'' Congress decided on the $2.6 billion and with great fanfare \nwe had offsets.\n  The problem is, these offsets have already been counted in the \nbudget. We counted $1.3 billion in savings for the sale of the U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation. That is basically a corporation that enriches \nuranium. But the problem is we have already counted that $1.3 billion \nin deficit reduction in the budget that we adopted. But since that \nbudget and the bill flowing from it has been vetoed by the President, \nwe were able to do that yesterday. To pay for this new spending, $2.6 \nbillion adopted yesterday, we sold off portions of the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. The problem is we had already decided to sell it as \npart of the budget. So what we really did yesterday is added roughly \nanother $2.6 billion of spending. So we are already talking about \nspending almost $5 billion more in this bill than if we extend the \ncurrent short-term continuing resolution.\n  I think it is important that at some point we stand up and decide to \nstop spending money we don't have. It is one thing to write a budget \nsetting out good intentions. But it is clear to a blind man that if you \nlook at the pattern that we have followed with these emergency \ndesignations, it has turned into exactly what many of us feared it \nwould when it was put into the 1990 budget summit agreement. It has \nturned into an agreement whereby the President and the Congress \nconspire to cheat on the budget; conspire to increase spending above \nthe level we set out in the budget. In the process, we have these \nbudgets that do not look so bad, but when we count how much money is \nactually spent we end up spending beyond the budget.\n  What I am offering our colleagues is a great opportunity to save $1.2 \nbillion. Somewhere in the sweet by-and-by there may be a budget that is \nadopted. The President may accept it. On the other hand, he may not \naccept it. So we may get through this whole year not having saved a \npenny anywhere.\n  I can give you an opportunity tonight to save $1.2 billion. The only \nperson I know who knows how much money that is is Ross Perot. We can \nsave $1.2 billion by doing what the Brown family would have to do if \nthey had an emergency, and that is cut programs we were going to spend \nmoney on to fund the emergency. And my proposal is a very simple one. \nWe remove the need for an emergency designation so that it is not an \nemergency, and we have an across-the-board cut in all other nondefense \ndiscretionary accounts by 0.53 percent to pay for it. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, we have spending in the supplemental for defense. We offset \nevery penny of it with cuts. Why should we not do the same in \nnondefense? That is the purpose of the amendment. It is very simple and \nit boils down to one question: Do we want to spend money we don't have? \nOr do we want to move toward a balanced budget? I am giving you an \nopportunity tonight to save $1.2 billion. I hope we do not miss this \nopportunity and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise in very strong support of Senator Gramm's \namendment. As a cosponsor of that amendment, I think we have a \nfundamental issue to decide on the floor of the Senate tonight, and \nthat is whether we are going to go back to the old system, prior to \nlast year paying for emergencies, adding it to the interest costs of \nfuture generations, or whether we are going to face up to the fact that \nwe have emergencies in this country, that we do not appropriate for \nthem every year as they occur, as we should, and that we need to pay \nfor them out of existing appropriated accounts, not to just declare an \nemergency every time we have one and pass the bill on to the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  If we do not and this bill becomes law, the children of America, the \npeople of America are going to be paying interest on this $1.1 billion \nfor the rest of their lives. Now, is that fair to have that happen? I \nam speaking as someone from the State of Pennsylvania who probably is \ngoing to get the lion's share of this benefit.\n  In Pennsylvania, in January, we had a very serious snowstorm. We had \na couple feet of snow in most places, followed by extremely warm \nweather and a rainstorm which, depending on the area, dumped anywhere \nfrom 4 to 7 inches of rain. So we had the combination of 2 feet of snow \nmelting plus 4 to 7 inches of rain in a matter of a 2-day period. It \ncaused floods that were above the 100-year-flood level in many places.\n  The damage in Pennsylvania is calculated now over $1 billion. There \nis half a billion dollars in eroded infrastructure, and, even more \nimportant, we lost 100 lives. We lost 2,000 businesses and 50,000 \nhomes. We had a very serious disaster. It is one that we should, on the \nFederal level, help. It is a disaster that qualifies, in fact, all 67 \ncounties eligible for individual assistance. Madam President, 52 of the \ncounties have been declared eligible for public infrastructure \nassistance.\n  So there is no doubt we need to spend this money. The question is, \nare we going to spend it within the existing pot of money that we have \nto spend this year, or are we going to just add it to the deficit?\n  Last year, in the rescissions package, we made a decision that we \nwere going to fund emergencies. We provided FEMA with money, $5.5 \nbillion. That is paid for in a rainy day fund. Unfortunately, that \nmoney is over at FEMA and some of the extraordinary expenses are in the \nSmall Business Administration, which is not FEMA. So they cannot take \nthat FEMA money, even though it is sitting over there. They cannot use \nit. Or it is in the Department of Agriculture. Again, it is for \ndisasters, but the money is sitting over in FEMA.\n  I will have an amendment, if this amendment fails, to take the money \nfrom FEMA and put it into those accounts. It is not something I want to \ndo, because I think we should have this fund available to FEMA. I think \nwe should pay for it now.\n  I have had a history as a House Member of standing up for this. I \nvoted, I think, on four or five occasions against unemployment \nextensions which were not paid for, which emergencies were declared and \nwe just added on to the deficit. Luckily, in four of the five instances \nwhere we extended unemployment benefits, the President at that time, \nPresident Bush, insisted that we find offsets, and we did find offsets, \nand we were able to pass a deficit-neutral unemployment extension.\n  The only time we did not do that was under President Clinton in his \nstimulus package. It is the only part of the stimulus package that \nbecame law, and we deficit spent to provide unemployment benefits. I \nvoted against it.\n  I tell you, I was a Congressman at that time, and I represented a \ndistrict which has probably been as hard hit, if not harder hit, than \nany district in the country with respect to unemployment. I represented \nthe steel valley of Pittsburgh where we lost over 100,000 jobs in a \nmatter of 10 years--100,000 steel worker jobs in a matter of 10 years. \nWe still have long-term unemployment there.\n\n  But I said that it is important to stand up for principle, that we do \nnot spend money today for emergencies, as important as those \nemergencies are and as needed as the funding is, by penalizing future \ngenerations and not making the tough decisions, not setting priorities. \nThat is what this is about. Everybody in this Chamber and everybody in \nthe House Chamber is for this disaster assistance. The President has \nasked for it, and the appropriators have wisely appropriated the money \nhe has asked for.\n  The question is, are we going to pay for it now or are we going to \nmake our children pay for it later, forever and ever and ever? I think \nthe answer is pretty clear.\n  One of the reasons we are here debating this bill--we are into March \ndebating appropriations bills--is because we are trying to balance the \nbudget. We are trying to cut spending. We are trying not to add on to \nthe deficit, and here we are in the middle of this great struggle to \nput America back on sound financial footing, back on the path to\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nfiscal responsibility and we are saying, ``Oops, we have an emergency; \nwe must add to the deficit.''\n  I can tell you, the House of Representatives is not adding to the \ndeficit in their bill. They have an appropriations bill similar to \nours. They do not add to the deficit. They are within their caps, and I \nthink that is important to know. I think it is incumbent upon us to act \nas judiciously as the House in this instance.\n  Right now there is a special session going on in Pennsylvania, and \nthey are coming up with the funds to pay for the tens of millions--\nhundreds of millions--of dollars that the State of Pennsylvania is \ngoing to have to come up with to fund this, and they cannot declare an \nemergency. They cannot put it off budget. They cannot add it to their \ndeficit. They have to balance their budget every year, and they are \nmaking tough decisions up there right now.\n  My colleague in the State house and the State senate and the \nGovernor, my former colleague in the House, Tom Ridge, are offering up \nsome pretty tough medicine right now to the people of Pennsylvania. All \nI am asking is that we take a little bit of the medicine in Washington, \nthat we do the responsible thing.\n  I do not understand how this body, whether you are a Republican or a \nDemocrat, can go back home and go before the people of this country and \nsay you really are serious about balancing this budget, that you really \nare serious about cutting spending and setting priorities. We have to \nset priorities. As Senator Gramm says, when the refrigerator breaks, \nyou cancel the vacation. Every family does that. Most States do that. \nThis Government and this Congress should do that.\n  If there is anyone who should be for this bill, whether it spends for \nemergency and adds on to the deficit, it should be me. But I believe it \nis so important--so important--that we continue the precedent that we \nset last year of paying for our disasters, of not bailing out and \ndeclaring emergencies that I am prepared to vote against this bill. I \nam prepared to vote against disaster assistance for my State if we do \nnot offset it over the next few hours.\n  If the Gramm amendment fails, I have other amendments. I have other \namendments to offset other accounts within the purview of this bill and \noutside the purview of this bill. I have amendments to transfer money \nfrom FEMA. I know that is subject to a point of order, but I am \nprepared to be here tonight, and I am prepared to offer amendments.\n  I think this is something that we absolutely must do to be able to \nface the American public with a straight face.\n  We bail out too often around here. We are always looking for a way to \nsort of be cute and get around the law, to get around the substance of \nwhat we really are talking about here.\n\n  Oh, sure, we can legally, under the law, circumvent the Budget Act \nand declare an emergency and add it on. By and large, you know, it is \nonly $1 billion. No one is going to notice. Well, I notice. I think we \nhave an obligation not just to the process that we are engaged in to \nbalance the budget but for the future generations of Americans who, as \nI have said before, will pay for this $1 billion of deficit the rest of \ntheir lives. Is that fair to do? The answer, I think, is very clear. It \nis not fair to do.\n  So I am very hopeful that we can get bipartisan support for a very \nrational act. I will tell you that an across-the-board cut is probably \nnot the best way to go about paying for this, but I suggest that the \nprinciple of saying that we are going to pass a deficit-neutral \nappropriations bill is important. When we do that and we send it to the \nconference and we have a deficit-neutral appropriations bill coming out \nof the House and a deficit-neutral bill coming out of the Senate, then \nwe can sure as heck guess that we are going to get a deficit-neutral \nbill coming out of the conference.\n  Is it going to have an across-the-board cut? No, probably not. They \nwill probably set priorities. They will sit down and they will make \nthose decisions within the context of a larger picture, as it should \nbe. But I think we have to set the tone here with this amendment.\n  So, I am very hopeful that my colleagues who stand up and repeatedly \ntalk about how we have to set priorities and balance the budget and \nthat we did not need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nbecause we can do it ourselves, we can make these decisions, we can set \npriorities--it is priority setting time. I cast my priority to spend \nthis money on disaster relief. I am for disaster relief. I want to fund \nthese programs. But I also want to do it within the context of this \nbudget.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support that \neffort.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I propound a unanimous-consent time \nagreement. I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 hour for debate on \nthe pending Gramm amendment--30 minutes under the control of Senator \nSantorum, 5 minutes under the control of Senator Gramm, 25 minutes \nunder the control of myself--and following the debate, the amendment be \nlaid aside and Senator Mikulski be recognized to offer an amendment \nregarding national service, and that there be 1 hour for debate to be \nequally divided in the usual form, that no amendments be in order to \neither amendment, and following the debate, the Senate proceed to vote \nin relation to the Gramm amendment, to be followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Mikulski amendment. I believe this has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Madam President, I think that those votes, as they are \nbeing stacked or joined, linked, probably would occur somewhere between \n8 and 8:30, assuming all the time is used. I do not plan to use all the \ntime on my side on this matter that is pending.\n  Madam President, the Gramm amendment proposes to offset the so-called \nemergency supplemental the President asked for and that was approved by \nour committee to cover the losses and the damages, in part, that have \noccurred during the floods in the Northwest and other parts of the \ncountry.\n  I am not sure that we need to have a replay of the suffering and the \ntragedy that has beset so many people in these types of disasters, \nwhether it is an earthquake or a hurricane or a flood or a fire. I \nthink that is why the budget agreement of 1990 very precisely empowered \nthe Congress of the United States to visit these problems on an ad hoc \nbasis and make a judgment in accordance with the needs created by these \ndisasters and why there is no formula for that, there is no basic \ncriteria. That is within the prerogative and the discretion of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  My colleague from Texas tried to compare this to a family disaster of \nJohnny breaking an arm, and what would they do? I will tell you what \nthey would do. They would go down and get that arm fixed, and they \nwould charge it on their credit card because they did not have the \nmoney, cash in hand. They would take an attitude that this is worthy of \nan indebtedness because we have an emergency that has to be dealt with.\n  Madam President, I believe that is true with the Nation as a whole \nand under the very concepts that set up FEMA, the Federal Emergency Act \nto deal with these emergencies. The Senator from Texas also said why is \nit we do this only for nondefense programs? Aha, we put the gulf war in \nan emergency declaration.\n  Over $20 billion we were willing to march down the aisle to say, ``We \nsupport the President. We support this war for oil,'' even in spite of \nall the propaganda that somehow we were trying to support an emergency \nof a little country like Czechoslovakia being overrun by the big brutal \nneighbor, Hitler.\n\n  So, the gulf war was an oil war, pure and simple. And we declared an \nemergency. Why is it that we can find it easy to declare an emergency \nto make war, but we find it a gnat strangling us in trying to swallow \nin declaring an emergency related to people in need? I suppose it is a \nphilosophical debate to some degree. I think it is also a value and a \npriority debate as well.\n  I think it is poor procedure, in addition. Bear in mind that this \namendment says that we reduce appropriations in the nondefense area, \nboth in this bill and already enacted, the legislative branch bill, the \nTreasury bill,\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\nthe transportation bill, the agricultural bill, the energy-water bill, \nthe foreign operations bill, all having been passed, and now we are \ngoing to go back and reduce those commitments for those programs in \nspite of the fact that there is a different spendout probably for each \none of those accounts in most of those bills. That then is going to \nfall disproportionately heavily on those that have had a slower \nspendout in order to recoup that percentage reduction. That kind of \nfiscal management is irresponsible--irresponsible.\n  It is an easy way to follow the rules about offsets, but we do not \nhave any consideration as to the impact of that disproportionate \nreduction in these accounts across the board. It even undoes the action \nwe took yesterday of adding moneys back to the Labor-HHS for \neducational purposes. We have to revisit that. That may not be a high \npriority for some. It is a very high priority for me.\n  But it only means again that there are no sound criteria being used \nto recover the offset in order to say, oh, I can vote for the disaster \nrelief for those people who drowned, have been drowning, or people \nwhose homes have been drowning or their farms have been drowning or the \nlevees that have broken through that need repair to prevent another \nstorm totally eliminating communities in my State, or the Small \nBusiness Administration that had expended or obligated its funds to be \nreplenished in this bill, to give assistance for the reconstruction and \nthe restoration of small enterprise under our great capitalistic \nsystem.\n  We can find lots of help for the big corporations in all sorts of tax \nbreaks, but I do not find that there is that easy access to tax breaks \nfor small enterprises, the small businessperson, which, after all, is \nthe soul of the capitalistic system, not the Fortune 500.\n  So, consequently, it seems to me that we are being again very \ninequitable in making these applications. Let me say that on the \nforeign operations, Israel--Israel, in its time of need--will also be \nreduced, the Israeli need that exists today that we have voted \noverwhelmingly to support. I have a strong feeling that we are really \nalmost playing games with people in distress. I heard the recitation of \nall the times we have adopted the emergency declaration.\n  Again, Madam President, I do not accept the sins-of-the-fathers-\nbeing-visited-upon-the-children concept. I am not saying that every one \nof those declarations had high support or could be validated by \ncriteria. I can tell you, having visited farms that will take 2 years \nto restore in my State, at least 2 years for productivity--my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden and I, had first-hand direct exposure to \npeople who had been absolutely wiped out. Their milk cows stacked in \npiles waiting to be burned or disposed of, losses that cannot be \nreplaced even if they had the money to do it because there is not that \navailability. People whose hopes were just washed away, totally washed \naway and; at the same time, to replace those hopes and to be able to \nrestore those levies to protect them in the future is being threatened \nby this particular action at this time.\n  Let me say, we have stretched this every way possible to find offsets \nfor adding through the actions yesterday, and other actions, moneys to \nincrease the level of funding. We have done it for a variety and many \ndifferent accounts, fitting almost anybody here on the floor in the \nbody, here as a total body, the needs or priorities.\n  At the same time, the Appropriations Committee is the only committee \nin the U.S. Congress that has taken specific actions for budget \nreductions and spending reductions--$22 billion we have taken in the \nAppropriations Committee. We could not get the reconciliation through \nthe President's veto but I have not seen too many subsequent actions \ntaken by authorizing committees to deal with the problem under the \ncurrent circumstance we had.\n  There is no committee that can stand on the floor of the Senate and \nsay they have done something specific to try to move toward a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, except the Appropriations Committee. We have a \nrecord. We have a unique position. Always, I will defend our action. \nSure, we can say we can do more, maybe $24 billion instead of $22 \nbillion. It is very interesting when we come to the floor we face a \nbarrage of amendments to add back, add back, add back; and at the same \ntime that we have offset, offset, and offset, there comes a limit to \nhow much you can offset and make viably authentic a plan you have for \nfunding the U.S. Government.\n  Another thing that had made our problem difficult is we protect the \ndefense spending. That is sacrosanct. That is jobs. That is this. That \nis the other things. The Russians are not coming any longer, so now \nperhaps Saddam Hussein is coming. I grew up at a time when Communists \nwere behind every door, according to some politicians, to scare the \npeople into more spending for military; or that the Russians were \ncoming.\n  As I have said before on this floor, the greatest enemy we face \ntoday, externally, is the viruses are coming. The viruses are coming. \nWe better be more defensive of our people against the viruses through \nmedical research than for the so-called hardware buildup.\n  I can remember when we used to be able to separate people's \nphilosophy because it was easy, oversimplified--a hawk and dove. Doves \nvote to lessen military spending and the hawks want increased military \nspending. I can remember when the Republicans controlled the Senate in \n1980 and we were faced with a Reagan massive buildup of military \nweaponry. Do not let anybody try to sell you the proposition that \ncaused the decline of the empire of the Soviets. I will not give them \nthat much credit. Their system was flawed to begin with. It was doomed \nto failure. It was just a matter of time.\n  Nevertheless, the point is we justified every kind of dollar at that \ntime, build up, and up, and up and deficit go up, up, up--one of the \nmost conservative Presidents in the United States in modern history \nbuilding the greatest deficit we have had in modern history. So these \nlabels of conservative and liberal and moderate and fiscal \nconservatives, all that is a very superficial kind of labeling. All I \nam saying is we have never found a problem to find more money to spend \nfor military hardware, but when we come to trying to meet the needs of \nflood victims and people of disasters who have suffered disasters, we \nare, oh, so concerned about our fiscal future and our fiscal present.\n\n  This is a legitimate declaration of emergency. I urge my colleagues--\nI do not know in what way we will move at this time. We are checking \nthe point of order possibility that exists and we will have to have \nthat confirmed. If it is confirmed, I will make a point of order. \nOtherwise, I will move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me ask our colleague who has the \npreponderance of time to yield me 5 minutes to respond.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it seems to me in listening to this \nargument that our dear colleague from Oregon, who has great \nintellectual powers, has been forced to strain them to defend his \nposition on this amendment. I am not going to get into a lengthy \nresponse on each and every point, but there are some I would like to \nmake.\n  If every penny that we have cut out of defense since 1985 had gone to \ndeficit reduction, we would have a balanced budget today. Second, no \none is proposing that we not provide flood relief. Nobody is making \nthat proposal. What we are saying is, we can provide it, but pay for \nit. There is no doubt about the fact that a lot of families, when \nJohnny falls down the steps and breaks his arm, they put it on the \ncredit card. The difference is, 30 days later they get the bill. They \nhave to either pay it or come up with permanent financing. Their \nability to get financing, other than rolling it on their credit card at \nastronomical interest rates, depends on a plan to pay it back. We have \nnot paid back a net penny of borrowing since Eisenhower was President \nof the United States. That has been a long time. That has been too \nlong.\n  In terms of the gulf war, we actually collected more money from our \nallies than we spent--probably the only war in history where that was \nthe case. Obviously, when we are talking about the loss of American \nlife, we are talking about a loss that can never be paid back, but I \nwas not talking about the Persian Gulf war here. I am talking\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nabout the fact that in this very bill we increase defense spending, but \nwe offset it by cutting other programs, something we did not do for \nthis $1.2 billion.\n  In terms of going back and cutting programs across the board, there \nis no doubt about the fact that if the committee had offset this \nincrease in spending, they could have done it more efficiently than the \nacross-the-board cut. Let me say that without the emergency \ndesignation, the law would apply an across-the-board cut. Let me also \nsay this is a procedure that we have used many times. If a better \nalternative can be found in conference, it can be substituted.\n  The point still comes back to not whether we should help flood \nvictims, but should we pay for the assistance or should we simply add \nit to the debt? Do we simply spend more and more money every time \nsomething happens? Or do we say, ``There has been a tragedy in the \ncountry. We have to do something to help. What we are going to do is \ntake money away from programs that we would have spent the money on \nthat were a lower priority so that we can fund this emergency \nassistance.''\n  The issue here is simply the issue of deficits, and no matter what \nkind of arguments are made, no matter what specter is held up about \nhelping needy people, no matter what discussion occurs on defense, the \nbottom line is that we are going to have a vote here on $1.2 billion of \nadditional deficit spending.\n  Are you for it, or are you against it? I am against it. I want to \nprovide the money to try to help people who have suffered from floods, \npeople who have suffered from fires, people who have suffered from \nemergency situations that they had no control over. But I want to pay \nfor it, and I want to pay for it by cutting other Government programs. \nThat is the prudent policy. That is the way, ultimately, in the real \nworld, things have to operate. We have been divorced from the real \nworld for too long, and that is why we have not paid off a net penny of \nnational debt in any year since Eisenhower was President of the United \nStates.\n  It seems to me that if we continue this process, people are going to \nbe here 30 years from now who are going to be making the same \nstatement. So I think the choice is clear, and I hope people will make \nthe choice to pay for it--to help, but pay for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am very happy to.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. As the Senator knows, we operate on an October-through-\nOctober fiscal year. What would the Senator do if an emergency occurred \nor disaster of some kind occurred on September 28?\n  Mr. GRAMM. What would I do if it occurred on that date?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. What I would do is extend the funds. And for those 2 days \nI would take the funds out of the funding to be spent on those last 2 \ndays. Then I would take the additional funding--since we are not going \nto be able to spend it all out in 2 days, I would take the spend-out \nrate, and for those first 2 days I would take the amount to be spent \nand take it from the overall Government operations of those 2 days. And \nthen, as it is spent out in the new fiscal year, I would take it from \nthat.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I think that is obviously a hypothetical \nquestion, but it was not a hypothetical response to that problem \nbecause what we are proposing to do today is to meet the emergency at \nthe time.\n  I think the Senator makes a good point in the matter of how we have \nhandled the emergency declaration. I say to the Senator that I will be \nhappy to work with the him to set up a criteria on how we should apply \nthat emergency declaration. I do not think we ought to do it on an ad \nhoc basis, on the basis of need today. That is a matter we should deal \nwith in terms of an overall long-term--we can do the job quickly, but \nit should not be applied on an ad hoc basis of this current emergency.\n  I think, also, that we realize that the disasters that happen early \nin the fiscal year--from all practicality, not hypothetically, the \ndisasters that happen early in the fiscal year are going to have more \nopportunity to be offset than those that happen late in the fiscal \nyear, as to the spend-out we have had during that fiscal year of those \naccounts that would be taxed or offset.\n  So, I think, again, the whole principle of offset is unsound at this \npoint in time, unless we add criteria, criteria firmly established that \nwe were going to apply. Let me say that the gulf war was so-called \npromised on the part of our allies to be paid back. But let us remember \nwe did not have that in hand at the time we made the declaration any \nmore than we had any kind of a payback plan for Somalia and the other \nprograms that we put declarations of emergencies to in order to meet \nthe needs of those people at the moment.\n  If we are going to have to measure somehow the suffering, or we are \ngoing to find some better way to establish the declaration--and the \nSenator himself was a member of that conference and that so-called \nsummit that adopted the very language of the declaration of emergency, \nas I was a member of that conference and that summit of that time. So \nthat is sort of ex post facto in terms of the pattern in which we have \nfollowed the declarations of emergency and of the conditions that exist \ntoday, the call for this declaration of emergency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. I would like to respond to the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee by suggesting that the timing of the disaster \nis really less important than the timing of when the money is going to \nbe spent. That is very important. We have a billion dollars' worth of \ndamage in Pennsylvania, but we are not going to spend a billion dollars \nover the next 6 months in repairing or fixing that problem. We have, \nfor example, $5.5 billion sitting in FEMA right now. That money was \noriginally appropriated for the California earthquake and for the \nMississippi floods that happened 3 years ago. It still has not been \nspent out.\n  Historically, what we have done when we have declared emergencies is \nwe have put it off budget and appropriated money for the entire \nemergency, for what we think is going to be the cumulative cost of that \nemergency, knowing full well they are not going to be able to spend all \nthat money in this fiscal year, whether it was September 28 or October \n1. It takes a long time to let contracts and rebuild, as the Senator \nfrom Oregon said. It is going to be a couple of years before a lot of \nthese people get it all back together and can use all the money that is \navailable.\n  So to suggest we should be worried about the timing of disasters \nreally does not reflect how the disasters are paid for. So what we are \nsaying is, look, maybe we should look at, as the Senator suggested, how \nwe appropriate money for disaster assistance because maybe there is \nmoney in this request that is not going to be spent this year, that we \ndo not need to put in the budget this year, that we can put in next \nyear when we anticipate it to be spent. That is a real concern.\n  I think the more fundamental issue here is, how are we going to pay \nfor emergencies? It is interesting for me that if you look at all of \nthese accounts, whether it is the Department of Agriculture, watershed \nand flood control, or whether it is the Small Business Administration, \nor the Corps of Engineers, or the National Park Service--all of these \nagencies that are funded--none of these agencies, to my knowledge, \nreceive any additional funds for emergency purposes. They get funded \nfor their programs, but they are not given sort of a slush fund or a \nrainy day fund to be able to be used to meet emergencies that they have \nto deal with when they come. We do not appropriate money--with the \nexception of a small amount for FEMA every year, usually $200 million \nor $300 million, which is always exceeded. We appropriate very little \nmoney annually for emergencies. Then when they come, as surely they \ncome every year, we step back and say: We do not have any money. We \nhave an emergency we did not anticipate. And whether it is a big one \nlike the California earthquake, or a small one, we say, well, let us \njust add it to the deficit.\n\n  What we are saying is that is just not responsible. The responsible \nthing is to let us appropriate the money every year and, my goodness, \nif we do not\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nspend it, and if the Lord shines upon us and we do not have a natural \ndisaster, well, then we keep it for the next year when, probably, the \ndisasters will be worse than what we had planned on. But it is silly \nfor us to not appropriate for emergencies, and when they come along, \nsay: We have all this destruction and costs and we have to come to \nthese people's aid.\n  We are coming to these people's aid. We are out there. I have been \nout there, as have Senator Hatfield in Oregon, and Senator Wyden, and \nSenator Specter, and Senator Gorton. We have been out there, and we \nhave seen the damage. It is severe, and we need to remedy it, but we \nneed to do it within the confines of rational budgeting. That is what \nSenator Gramm said. Every family does it. I hear the credit card \nanalogy all the time, and Senator Gramm is right that the analogy is \nnot applicable to the Congress, because you have to pay back a credit \ncard. If not, they take you to court and garnish your wages. We are \nnever going to pay this money back. We are going to add this billion \ndollars to the deficit, and we are going to pay interest on that. \nChildren who are not yet born are going to pay interest on that.\n  I do not think we have any intention in the near future of doing \nanything to reduce the national debt. We are hoping to reduce the \nannual deficit.\n  But there is no plan that I am aware of to start whittling down the \nmountain of debt that we have already accumulated. So to suggest that \nit is equivalent is just not accurate. It is apples and oranges.\n  I applaud Senator Hatfield and the Appropriations Committee for, as \nhe said, having cut $22 billion this year. He is absolutely correct. \nUnfortunately, because we have not been able to get agreement on \nentitlements and on the budget--the President vetoed the budget that \nactually does something with entitlements--we have had to rely solely \non appropriations. But we have relied on appropriations within the \nbudget caps that we set in the budget resolution. We are not asking \nthem to do anything more than we would have had we done all of the \nentitlement savings anyway. I appreciate that they have done it. But it \nis not like we have not worked very hard to get those entitlement \nsavings. Everyone over here, at least, put up the votes to get that \nbill to the President for him to balance the budget. Unfortunately, the \nPresident has vetoed it. But we have done our part. We will continue to \ndo our part to make sure that we reduce all levels of government so we \ncan balance this budget, not just appropriated accounts.\n  The final point I want to make is just to reemphasize. This is not \nabout helping people in need. We are helping people in need. FEMA teams \nhave been in Pennsylvania for a couple of months. We are doing the job. \nThis is how we pay for it, if we pay for it. I think that is a pretty \neasy call for most Americans. You would think it is fairly common \nsense. It is one of the commonsense things that I hear when I go home. \n``Well, of course, if something comes up that you need more money, you \nfind the money somewhere else. You just do not put it on the deficit \nforever and over and over for us to pay interest on for generations.''\n  I want to see this bill passed. I want to see the people who are in \nneed feel good about the fact that the Federal Government came in and \nhelped them but also feel good that we did it within the context of a \nbudget, that we did it the right way. I am hopeful that we can get \nbipartisan support on this and send a resounding vote that we are going \nto balance this budget and that we are willing to step up to the plate \nin tough situations and make the tough decisions to move this country \nto a more responsible fiscal future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nrestraints with respect to the Mikulski amendment just agreed to be \nvitiated, that following the debate on the pending Gramm amendment, the \nSenate proceed to vote with respect to that amendment, and following \nthe vote Senator Mikulski be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, before Senator Hatfield leaves, I am \nthrough debating. I think we made the points. I do not know if the \nSenator from Pennsylvania is finished or not. But if he is, perhaps we \ncould go ahead. I would like to have 1 or 2 minutes to sort of sum up, \nand we could go ahead and vote.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. I say to my friend that this certainly is a \npossibility. We have to have a few minutes because of the time \ndesignated, or, at least, a time estimate for a vote. We have to get \nnotice to some of our colleagues who perhaps have left the Hill. But I \nwould be willing to yield back all of my time and move to a vote as \nrapidly as possible.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on that basis, let me sum up. Again, there \nare a lot of issues that have been raised here. The provision for the \nemergency designation was in the 1990 budget summit agreement. I \nparticipated in those negotiations. I opposed this provision. I voted \nagainst that summit agreement--not that that is of any relevance here.\n  Here is the point. There are some emergencies under some \ncircumstances that create a situation where there is not a readily \navailable option to finance. We could have funded the Civil War by \noffsetting expenditures and by raising taxes. We decided not to do it \nthat way. We might have funded World War II that way. We decided not to \nbecause of the magnitude of the undertaking. But I remind my \ncolleagues, we are spending $1.6 trillion a year. We are getting ready \nto add $1.2 billion of new spending declared an emergency. We can avoid \nthat by simply cutting across the board by .53 percent, or a penny for \nevery $2 we spend on nondefense discretionary programs. I am very proud \nof the fact that in 1995, under the leadership of Senator Hatfield as \nour new chairman, we did not have a need for emergency designations. We \ndid not, through supplementals, raise the deficit. In fact, we had \nrescissions bigger than the new spending we had. It is not as if we \nhave never sinned before, but we were on such a roll from 1995 under \nthe leadership of our great chairman that I was hoping that we might \nstay on the straight and narrow and avoid this movement back to our old \nways.\n  So, I do not see this as a big amendment in terms of its impact; $1.2 \nbillion for anybody, or any group of people of any reasonable size, \nthat would be an unbelievable amount of money. For the Federal \nGovernment, it is basically one penny out of every $2 we spend on \nnondefense discretionary programs. But why not take a stand here, keep \nthe record of this new Congress with the Republican majority, a perfect \nrecord in that we have written a budget. The President vetoed it. But \nwe have lived by it. We have not used an emergency declaration to spend \nmoney when we had the alternative to pay for it. It is a record I am \nproud of. It is one I want to keep. And, most importantly, despite all \nof the arguments that can be made, it is the right thing to do. This is \nthe right thing to do.\n  This is a manageable emergency. There is no reason that a country \nthat spends $1.6 trillion a year cannot manage an emergency of $1.2 \nbillion. This is a manageable amount. And what we are doing here is \nsetting a precedent that will be followed, if we set it here.\n  I would like to stay with our record in 1995, stay with our budget, \nnot declare this emergency, and pay for this modest amount of money as \ncompared to the Federal budget. We are capable of doing it. It is the \nright thing to do, and I urge my colleagues to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum on my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I think we are about to \nwork out an agreement here, Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nthat would end our debate, order a rollcall at some time in the future, \nand finish up this matter. I think we can do that very quickly, and \nthen the Senator could be recognized to offer an amendment, and this \nwould be out of the way.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3491 to Amendment No. 3466\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. Biden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3491 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, line 20, after ``Provided further,'' insert \n     ``That not less than $20,000,000 of this amount shall be for \n     Boys & Girls Clubs of America for the establishment of Boys & \n     Girls Clubs in public housing facilities and other areas in \n     cooperation with state and local law enforcement: Provided \n     further,''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing today would \nprovide the first $20 million of a 5-year effort to add 1,000 new Boys \n& Girls Clubs--including 200 more clubs in housing projects--so that 1 \nmillion more children can participate in this vital program.\n  This investment of $100 million in seed money--all to start new \nclubs--translates to only $100 per additional child who will be served \nby a Boys & Girls Club.\n  The Federal Government's contribution is only 10 percent of the total \nfunds needed to complete this project. This is only seed money. The \nremaining 90 percent of the funding for new clubs will come from \nprivate donations.\n  That is a Federal contribution of only $100 per child to provide 1 \nmillion children with a safe, supervised, and challenging place to go \nafter school rather than hanging out on street corners or returning to \nan empty home.\n  Fully 40 percent of juvenile crime is committed between 3 and 9 p.m. \nThese are the hours when many children are left unsupervised.\n  In hundreds of public housing projects across the country, Boys & \nGirls Clubs give kids a safe place to hang out after school--a place \nwith positive activities and positive role models.\n  A 1992 evaluation conducted by Columbia University found that housing \nprojects with Boys & Girls Clubs had 13 percent fewer juvenile crimes; \n22 percent less drug activity; and 25 percent less presence of crack \nthan housing projects without Boys & Girls Clubs.\n  Those who study this issue agree that breaking the cycle of violence \nand crime requires an investment in the lives of our children with \nsupport and guidance to help them reject the violence and anarchy of \nthe streets in favor of taking positive responsibility for their lives. \nAnd prevention of crime--particularly juvenile crime--is more important \nnow than ever before.\n  In 1994 more than 2.7 million children under the age of 18 were \narrested. Half of these arrests--1.4 million--were children under the \nage of 16.\n  There is a fairly simple answer to this problem--provide supervised \nactivities for children during the high-crime hours of the late \nafternoon and early evening. The key is to keep children off the \nstreets and out of trouble during the times they are most likely to get \ninto trouble.\n  This is not complicated. We can--indeed we must--recognize this fact \nand take all the actions necessary to fill the crime-likely hours with \nsupervised activities. Constructive after-school prevention programs \nlike Boys & Girls Clubs are the best way tool we have to stop juvenile \ncrime, juvenile drug use, and juvenile victimization by other youth.\n  We have a choice. We can work to prevent crime before it happens.\n  If we don't, we are merely postponing the inevitable--dealing with \njuveniles after the shots are fired, after the children become addicted \nto drugs, after more lives are ruined.\n  When a life about to go wrong is set back on the right track--that is \na testament to hope.\n  We build hope by showing children that they matter and by contrasting \nthe dead end of violence with the opportunity for a constructive life.\n  This amendment deserves full bipartisan support. This is crime \nprevention--as far as I know, the Boys & Girls Club is a program \neveryone on both sides of the aisle has claimed to support.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to fund this proven prevention program \nand join me in helping to stem the tide of children who would otherwise \nbe lost to drugs and violence.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment, which is a Biden amendment, \nwould earmark funds for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. It has no \nbudgetary impact. It has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3491) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3492 to amendment no. 3466\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a lockbox for deficit reduction and revenues \n                         generated by tax cuts)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Coats, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Helms, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3492 to amendment No. 3466.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.''\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues, Senator McCain, \nSenator Faircloth, Senator Coats, Senator Helms, and Senator Inhofe, I \nrise to offer the taxpayer protection lockbox amendment.\n  Today, as Congress fights to bring down the deficit and set the \nNation on the track toward fiscal sanity, President Clinton is \ncontinuing his demand for an additional $8 billion in taxpayer money \nthis year to finance even bigger Government. He says he is offsetting \nthe increased spending, but most of his so-called savings are no more \nthan budget gimmicks--increased taxes, fees, and one-time asset sales \nfinanced directly by the taxpayers.\n  Congress wants to eliminate the deficit but President Clinton wants \nto spend almost 50 cents of every dollar that working Americans have \nsacrificed toward a balanced budget this year.\n  The President said in January that ``the era of big government is \nover,'' but if he has his way big government will only continue to \ngrow, at the expense of taxpayers today and our children tomorrow. If \nwe do not take immediate action to stop this pattern of abuse, we are \nrisking leaving behind a legacy of debts that our kids will be forced \nto inherit.\n  While we still have the opportunity, we must do everything possible \nto change the rules of the tax-and-spending game and do what is best \nfor taxpayers, for our children and for the Nation as a whole. And for \nthat reason we are offering the Taxpayer Protection Lockbox Act as an \namendment to the continuing resolution.\n  Our amendment would make two important changes to the budget and \nappropriations process, a process which has served only to encourage \nabuse of spending and fiscal irresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n  First, this amendment would return honesty to the budget process by \nensuring that a cut in spending is truly a cut.\n  Contrary to popular opinion, under current law, dollars cut from \nappropriations bills are not returned to the Treasury for deficit \nreduction purposes as they ought to be. Instead, they are quietly \nstashed away in a slush fund to be spent later on other programs.\n  Our amendment would put an end to this practice by locking any \nappropriations savings into a deficit reduction lockbox and dedicating \nthose dollars to deficit reduction. In other words, if Congress cuts \n$10 million in an appropriations bill, the taxpayers will save $10 \nmillion. It does not get spent somewhere else.\n  Second, our amendment would create a revenue lockbox which would be \nused to direct any future revenues that exceed current economic \nprojections toward deficit reduction and/or tax relief.\n\n  It would create a fast-track process for Congress and the President \nto use these funds for tax relief with the remainder going for deficit \nreduction. At the same time, our amendment would prohibit the \nGovernment from simply using those dollars for additional spending. \nThis is only fair, because, after all, these additional funds would \nbecome available only because of the hard work and productivity of the \nAmerican people. So it makes sense then to return those dollars to the \ntaxpayers to encourage even greater productivity on their part rather \nthan allowing Congress to waste money that is not even theirs to begin \nwith.\n  All in all, our amendment is a simple proposal to restore honesty and \ncommon sense to the budget process, allow taxpayers to keep more of \nwhat they earn and also place further restrictions on abusive \nGovernment spending.\n  Given the most recent demand on tax dollars from the White House, it \ncertainly cannot have come at a better time.\n  Mr. President, our legislation has been endorsed by a number of \ncitizens and taxpayer groups including the National Taxpayers Union, \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, and the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses. With their support and the support of our \ncolleagues, I am confident that we can win a big victory for the \nAmerican taxpayer by passing the taxpayer protection lockbox amendment \nthis week.\n  Mr. President, that is the conclusion of my statement, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator does \nnot want to push for a vote at this time on his amendment. I assume he \nexpects to get consent to set the vote on the amendment aside until we \ndispose of the Gramm amendment and maybe other amendments tonight; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAMS. That will be fine.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3490, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify my \namendment. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification of the \namendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3490), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II of the committee substitute, add the \n     following:\n       (a) Each amount provided in a nonexempt discretionary \n     spending nondefense account for fiscal year 1996 is reduced \n     by the uniform percentage necessary to offset non-defense \n     discretionary amounts provided in this title. The reductions \n     required by this subsection shall be implemented generally in \n     accordance with section 251 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, reserving \nthe right to object----\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Chair had already ruled.\n  If I might say to my colleague, all I did was take out a paragraph \nthat created a point of order. It did not change the nature of the \namendment in any way.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I understand the Chair had previously \nruled. Therefore, I have no objection to the Senator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified. Who yields time \non the amendment?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, what Senator Gramm did in his \nmodification is really identical to what the House has done in their \nbill. The House does actually declare an emergency, but they actually \ndo not exceed their caps. What Senator Gramm is going to do, the effect \nof his amendment is to keep the emergency declared and pay for it, so \nwe do not exceed the overall budget cap as opposed to the caps on \nspecific subcommittees. I think that makes perfectly good sense, to \nmake sure that we pay for this within the whole appropriations account \nas opposed to just targeting specific subcommittees because of these \noccasionally arcane budget rules that we have to deal with in this \nbody.\n  I want to reiterate that I hope on this matter we can get a strong \nvote of support, frankly, from both sides of the aisle, that we are no \nlonger going to continue the practice of previous Congresses--not this \nCongress, but of previous Congresses--every time that we have a \ndisaster. On an annual basis, we do not appropriate for those. We do \nnot appropriate money. With the exception of a couple of hundred \nmillion dollars annually for FEMA, we do not appropriate money for \ndisasters. We wait until they happen, as they surely will, and then we \nask for emergency authority to borrow the money and not put it on the \nbudget.\n  We know there are going to be disasters. We should be able to budget \nfor those disasters, either beforehand or be able to rearrange \npriorities once they occur. That is what we do here. We arrange \npriorities.\n  This is not about whether we are going to provide relief to the \nvictims of fire, relief to the victims of floods or storms. What we are \ntalking about is providing a reasonable, commonsense way to pay for it. \nThat is something that all of us in this body have said we want to do. \nWe want to balance this budget. We want to set priorities.\n\n  Many people in this body opposed the balanced budget amendment. When \nthey opposed that balanced budget amendment, they said, ``We do not \nneed a balanced budget amendment; we can do it ourselves. We have the \nability to set priorities in this body without the hammer of a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.''\n  It is put-up time. If, in fact, you believe that we should have a \nbalanced budget, then this is the first step to making that happen--to \nstop this practice of adding tens of billions of dollars. Senator Gramm \narticulated that earlier in the debate, that we have added close to \n$100 billion to the deficit with these emergency declarations.\n  This is not just a billion dollars. To many people who might be \nwatching this debate who are not Senators, a billion dollars actually \nis a lot of money, it sounds like a lot of money. Here it does not \nsound like a lot of money. But when you add up a billion here and \nthere, we have gotten to $100 billion over the last 6 years. That is a \nlot of money even for here.\n  So let us not continue this practice. If anyone has an interest in \nseeing that this disaster relief is passed, it is the Senator from \nPennsylvania. We have had $1 billion in flood damage in our \ncommonwealth. We have had over 100 people killed, 50,000 homes damaged \nor destroyed, 2,000 businesses washed away. We need that help, but we \nneed to do it responsibly.\n  This Senator is not going to be a hypocrite and say, ``Well, I'm for \nreducing the deficit except, of course, when the money comes home and \nthen, well, let's just spend it all.'' I will vote against this measure \nif we do not adopt\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\nthis, or something like it. I have several other amendments. I am \nprepared to stay here all night long offering amendment after \namendment, which I will require votes on, to find some way to pay for \nthis disaster that is acceptable to this body.\n  So I hope that we are in for a good day of votes, whether it is \ntonight or tomorrow, because if we do not succeed, we are going to have \nvotes and you are going to have to stand up to the American public and \nsay, ``This is not the way to do business. The way to do business is to \nadd it on to the deficit. Fine, but we are going to be here.''\n  I am going to be here tonight, tomorrow, the next day, whatever it \ntakes, so we do this responsibly. I hope we do it on a bipartisan \nbasis. Balancing the budget is a bipartisan affair, and it is something \nI know we all want to do. Let us put into practice tonight what we \npreach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think this issue has been fully \ndiscussed on the floor tonight. I know Senator Hatfield, when he was \nhere a moment ago discussing the issue, laid out all the reasons why \nthis amendment is not a good idea.\n  In 1990, there was a long, drawn-out negotiation over procedures in \nthe budget and how appropriations would be made in case of national \nemergencies and whether or not they were under the same requirements \nfor offsets as routine operating expenses were.\n  It was decided by the Congress in 1990, in concert with \nthe administration, a Republican administration, that these would be \nthe rules.\n\n  This amendment is an effort to legislate a rules change on an \nappropriations bill. We think it an amendment that ought to be rejected \nby the Senate. Therefore, I am prepared to yield back the remainder of \nthe time on this side of the amendment and hope others will yield back \ntheir time, and I then will move to table the amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  With that understanding, I yield back all the time on this side on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield back \nhis time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 3490. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 32 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Coats\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kassebaum\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3490) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very critical day in the U.S. \nSenate. By adopting this omnibus appropriations bill we will be \nproviding critical funding to programs on which many Americans depend. \nIf the President signs this bill, then service providers of every sort \nwill be able to better plan their budgets for the remainder of the year \nand the upcoming fiscal year.\n  It is vitally important that we have put together a bill that the \nPresident should be able to sign. I wish to thank the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Hatfield for the fine job he has done to try and \naddress the administration's concerns in this bill.\n  Title I of the Senate-reported omnibus appropriations bill provides \n$331.9 billion in budget authority and $247 billion in new outlays for \nthe remainder of fiscal year 1996 for the Departments and Agencies \nfunded by the five appropriation bills not yet enacted, including: \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education; Commerce, Justice, and \nState, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies; Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies; Interior; and \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Of this amount, $149.4 billion in budget authority and $78.4 billion \nin new outlays is for discretionary spending. When outlays from prior-\nyear budget authority and other completed actions are taken into \naccount, the Senate-reported bill totals $163.8 billion in budget \nauthority and $183 billion in outlays for discretionary spending in \nfiscal year 1996.\n  The Senate-reported bill is below the 602(b) allocations of all \nsubcommittees by a total of $4 million in BA and $38 million in \noutlays.\n  The Senate-reported bill is $23.9 billion in budget authority and \n$9.2 billion in outlays below the President's budget request of just \nover a year ago. The Senate bill is $6.4 billion in budget authority \nand $3.9 billion in outlays below the 1995 level. It is $836 million in \nBA above the House-passed bill and $99 million in outlays below the \nHouse-passed bill.\n  While I may not agree with all of the priorities established by this \nbill, I would like to thank the chairman for the $22 million increase \nabove the conference level provided for the Legal Services Corporation. \nThe bill provides $300 million for this purpose, and another $9 million \nif Congress and the President reach a budget agreement.\n  We have worked very closely with the House on restructuring the Legal \nServices Corporation to disengage grantees involvement in controversial \nlitigation, and restrict them to providing traditional legal services \nfor the poor. While some may not like these restrictions, they are \nnecessary to control the controversial activities of some grantees and \nto protect LSC from the negative perceptions of those who wish to see \nits termination.\n  I have been very concerned about the proposed $414 million reduction \nin title I, education for the disadvantaged. I am thankful to Senator \nSpecter for offering an amendment during the Senate committee markup \nand a further amendment on the floor that restored $814.5 million to \nthe title I program, $1.3 billion higher than the conference level and \n$110 million higher than the 1995 level.\n  I am empathetic to the use of a contingency appropriations to provide \nadditional funding for discretionary priorities. I realize that the \ndiscretionary spending caps have been very tight on the Appropriations \nCommittee this year as we seek a balanced Federal budget.\n  With a broader budget agreement remaining elusive, I can appreciate \nthe frustration of the Appropriations Subcommittee chairmen in trying \nto live within these tight appropriation caps.\n  I remain concerned about attempts to use entitlement reforms \ncontained in the Balanced Budget Act to offset discretionary spending \nincluded in this bill as contingency funding, and with the possible use \nof the emergency designation that one could argue in some cases does \nnot fit the traditional definition of such expenditures.\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\n  Overall, I believe the committee has done a very good job on this \nbill. The committee has tried to address significant priorities in the \nremaining bills.\n  It provides funding to meet the President's major domestic concerns \nbut continues to pressure both Congress and the President to work \ntoward a budget agreement. It provides disaster aid and support for the \nUnited States military mission in Bosnia. I urge the Senate to adopt \nthe bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Budget Committee table \ndisplaying the budgetary effects of this bill be placed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                                    CONSOLIDATED OMNIBUS

Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's \ntime to discuss the Specter education amendment to the continuing \nresolution--S. 1594. As you know, the Senate adopted the Specter \namendment yesterday by a vote of 84 to 16. This amendment provides $2.7 \nbillion in additional funding for Head Start, job training, title I, \nand other education programs. Given that these additional funds are \nfully offset by spending cuts elsewhere, I supported the amendment.\n  Senator Specter offered his amendment in the second degree to the \nDaschle amendment. Like the Specter amendment, Senator Daschle's \namendment would have provided additional funding for various Federal \neducation programs. Unlike the Specter amendment, however, the Daschle \namendment was not fully offset and violated the Budget Act. In other \nwords, while both amendments provided additional funding for education \nprograms, the Specter amendment provides those funds in a responsible \nmanner that does not bust the budget.\n  On the other hand, both the Daschle and Specter amendments also \nprovided an additional $60 million for President Clinton's Goals 2000 \nProgram. I want to make clear that my support for the Specter amendment \nshould not be interpreted as support for this program. Instead of \nfunding Goals 2000, I would have preferred to use the funding for \neducation vouchers or charter schools.\n\n\n                  transfer of f-16 aircraft to jordan\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a matter which \ncould profoundly affect the U.S. defense industrial base. It is my \nunderstanding that the Committee on Appropriations recommends the \nappropriation of an additional $70 million in fiscal year 1996 funds \nfor the Foreign Military Financing Program. These funds would be joined \nwith $30 million in previously appropriated funds to provide initial \ngrant funding in support of the transfer of F-16 aircraft to Jordan. \nUltimately, 16 F-16 aircraft are to be upgraded and then leased to \nJordan in support of its participation in the Middle East peace \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, I have recently received information which suggests \nthat the necessary upgrades will be performed on these aircraft in the \nUnited States prior to making them available to Jordan. If that is the \ncase, I will support the committee's recommendation, because I believe \nthe required work will enhance the defense industrial base.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the junior Senator from Kentucky, who \nserves as the chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, who has \nserved on that subcommittee as a champion of U.S. private sector \nexports and who has insisted that American foreign aid programs serve \nour national interests, is this what the committee intends by its \nrecommendation? Does the committee intend that engine upgrades and \nstructural upgrades will be made by the U.S. private sector prior to \nthe lease of these F-16's to Jordan?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I can answer my colleague's question \nvery directly and without ambiguity. Yes.\n  Yes, the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations recognizes the commitment \nthat Jordan has made to peace in the\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nMiddle East. Jordan has joined with Israel in a treaty of peace. The \nsubcommittee believes that the lease of F-16 aircraft to Jordan, a \ntransfer of military equipment which is supported by Israel, will \nstrengthen Jordan militarily and provide a strong signal of United \nStates support for King Hussein and the people of Jordan as partners \nwith Israel in the quest for peace in the Middle East.\n  It is the subcommittee's intention that the grant funding which we \nrecommend to finance the required upgrades will be used to support the \nU.S. private sector and further serve U.S. interests by enhancing the \ndefense industrial base. While third countries may participate in \nmaintenance programs at a later date, the subcommittee believes that, \ninsofar as the upgrades are concerned, the original U.S. manufacturer \ncan best insure quality control, cost management, and interoperability \nwith U.S. Air Force units.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I \nthink that we have clearly established the intent of the Senate. These \naircraft are to be provided to Jordan, in support of Jordan's \nparticipation in the Middle East peace process. Furthermore, to support \nU.S. exports and to help preserve the private sector defense industrial \nbase, the required engine, structural, and related upgrades are to be \nperformed in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1933-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1965-S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRESERVE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I strongly endorse the Hollings-\nDaschle-Kerrey-Lieberman-Bingaman-Rockefeller-Kerry Amendment to H.R. \n3019 that was debated last night, and to praise Senator Hollings for \noffering this amendment that I cosponsored. This amendment would have \nrestored funds for three key Department of Commerce programs: the \nAdvanced Technology Program, National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration (NTIA) Telecommunications and Information \nInfrastructure Assistance Program, and Technology Administration as \nwell as funding for Educational and Environmental Technologies. \nRestoring these funds is essential to making progress in generating \nmore jobs for Americans, a better education system, protecting the \nenvironment, and maintaining our Nation's ability to compete and excel \nin research.\n  As a nation, we have used the best mix of individual innovation and \nnational cooperative efforts to develop the most advanced and most \nproductive economy in the world. Cooperative government and industry \ninvestments have brought us computers, the Internet, new treatments for \ndisease, a better environment, and the moon. And these investments have \nbrought us new industries; high-quality, high-paying jobs; and an \nimproved standard of living.\n  But today, Americans understand that the ground underneath them is \nshifting--they have seen their work and workplaces transformed by new \ntechnologies and global competition. These changes and their \nconsequences are as profound as the economic shifts that moved us from \nfarms to factories more than a century ago. Now, as then, there is no \nway to reverse the tide. Now, as then, the fortunes of working people \nare uncertain as the landscape around them is remade.\n  Working Americans have reason to be worried, reasons, even, to be \nangry. They are working harder than ever, but their jobs are less \nsecure, their wages are stagnant, and their benefits and pensions are \nshrinking. All this when company profits and CEO salaries are rising.\n  Parents are putting in more hours at the office. Precious time taken \nfrom Little League games and PTA meetings and family dinners. And the \nstrain--on families, schools, neighborhoods, on what makes a civil \nsociety--is all too apparent.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, ``Reaganomics'' can't seem to \ndisappear for good, no matter how clear the evidence is from the 1980's \nthat this is a dangerous course and bad economic policy. The Reagan \nmanifesto might have been written for a Warren G. Harding campaign \nspeech. Big tax breaks for top-income earners and corporations--a \ntrickle from the top will grow jobs and wages. Drop safety standards \nand environmental safeguards--an invisible hand will protect workers \nand consumers. Push the disabled, elderly, and poor children off the \nwagon.\n  In a trance, Congress cooperated in the eighties when Reagan told \nthem to cut taxes on the rich and corporations. In the last decade tax \nrates for top-income brackets were lowered from 70 percent to 40 \npercent. And, the share of the tax burden that corporations pay has \nbeen reduced from 15 percent to 10 percent over the last decade.\n  The minimum wage was stunted. And, domestic spending was cut from \nnearly 5 percent of the Federal budget to about 3\\1/2\\ percent since \n1980.\n  To what end? Some people benefitted--some a whole lot. Since 1980, \nmore than $800 billion was added to household incomes--but 98 percent \nof that money went to the richest 20 percent. That means all the rest, \n80 percent of American households, shared just 2 percent of the gains. \nIn fact, the average American family is now getting by on less than \nthey had in 1980.\n  For a fortunate handful of Americans, the transformation from an \nindustrial to an information economy offers unlimited opportunity and \nfantastic profit. But for most, right now, this new economy demands \nmore and offers less--it demands more education, more skills, more \nflexibility, more time; but offers less pay, less benefits, and less \nsecurity. Working families are running faster and losing ground--a raw \ndeal that undermines the crucial link between work and personal \nprogress, and breeds the anger and cynicism that are poisoning our \nsociety and our political debate.\n  I believe there are clear, common-sense, approaches that must be \nfollowed to enable all Americans to gain the fruits of our success.\n  Our trade and monetary policies must work for working people. We need \ntrade agreements based on only giving access when we get exactly that \nfor our products. We have to say no to agreements that push our jobs \nacross our borders. Let's live in the real world, and demand other \ncountries to live up to environmental and labor standards they avoid to \nget the upper hand.\n  The Fed should be as aggressive in promoting growth to benefit \nworkers as they are with managing inflation to benefit bondholders.\n  And we must have investments in education, training, infrastructure, \nand technology that produce dividends for working people here at home. \nInvestments in people are every bit as important as investment in \nequipment. But unless that's better known and understood, human \ninvestments will keep shriveling through the budget cuts already being \nmade. Behind the banner of a balanced budget, we are in danger of \nsurrendering what really spreads opportunity in America--the chance to \nlearn, to train, and to excel.\n  Investments in science and technology are a key part of the solution. \nAs the President's Council of Economic Advisors recently reported, \ninvestments in innovation have been responsible for almost one-half of \nthe Nation's economic growth.\n  This Nation has had a 50-year consensus on investments in science in \ntechnology. We have made these investments to expand the basic store of \nknowledge both because of our exploring, inquisitive nature and because \nwe know the benefits are unpredictable. We have invested in biological \nresearch that improves our ability to feed our people and attack \ndisease. And we have invested in new technologies in support of Federal \nmissions, technologies that created new industries and jobs in \naviation, electronics, software, and communications.\n  But those very programs that are key to our technological progress \nare now under threat. If it had passed, our Hollings-Daschle-Kerry \nAmendment would have lessened that threat by restoring funds for \ntechnology programs that invest in new innovations with broad benefits \nfor the Nation.\n  Recently, we have realized that with fierce global competition, this \nNation must invest in innovation to advance economic growth. We are \ninvesting in the Advanced Technology Program with bipartisan support.\n  President Bush's science advisor, D. Allan Bromley, realized that we \ncan support key technologies without intervening in the market's \nselection of winners and losers. The Advanced Technology Program was \nfirst funded\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\nin 1991 under President George Bush. This program is important because \nit invests in precompetitive or generic technologies, in the neglected \nzone between pure research and product development. These technologies \nare essential to technological progress for several industries or \ncompanies and are too risky for individual companies to fund on their \nown. The ATP will help to develop new technologies and new industries \nbefore other countries do.\n  We must keep investing in the Department of Commerce Technology \nAdministration. This is the one office in the Federal Government that \nis dedicated to advancing national investments in technology in support \nof economic growth. TA works to develop policies and partnerships that \nassist industrial innovation. And the office is supporting cooperative \ntechnology ventures between United States and Israeli companies that \nwill be a win-win effort for both nations. This commitment is \nespecially crucial now, as Israel reels from a string of devastating \nterrorist attacks.\n  We must keep investing in educational technologies, technologies that \nwill improve classroom learning and increase our student's chance to \nexcel and succeed.\n  And we must invest in connecting schools, libraries, and hospitals to \nthe world of the Internet. Funding grants from the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA] \nTelecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program \n[TIIAP] will enable these institutions to develop new applications that \nwill increase students skills, improve health care, and extend \ntelephone service in rural areas. This is particularly important to my \nhome State of West Virginia, a heavily rural State. A TIIAP grant to \nthe State library system will give citizens of West Virginia access to \ninformation around the globe.\n  We must keep investing in new, innovative environmental technologies, \nthat will result in higher levels of environmental protection at lower \ncosts for industry. These new technologies offer U.S. companies \nopportunities for increased exports and more jobs here at home.\n  These programs are essential investments to our Nation's economic \nfuture. They mean new industries and high-quality, high-wage jobs. They \nmean an improved environment. They mean a better education and greater \nopportunities for students and workers.\n  Our Nation must act--if we do not, our competitors are ready to take \nadvantage. While we are considering cutting our investments in \nnondefense R by 30 percent by 2002, Japan is about to double its \nGovernment's investments.\n  We cannot go back and we should not go back--old policies need to \nchange to meet new needs. But we should hold on to what we learned in \nthat earlier era, and carry those lessons into the 1990's and the 21st \ncentury. Lessons of hard work and fair play, of balance between \nbusiness and worker, of investment in people and technology should \nguide us as we meet the challenges of today and the future.\n  With the continued leadership of Senator Hollings for America's \neconomic strength and jobs, I will persist as well in pressing the case \nfor the investments that our amendment attempted to rescue. We will not \ngive up, because jobs for our people and the American dream are at \nstake.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATFIELD.

As of yesterday at the close of business, a total of \n$1,191,392,298,843.23 has been added to the Federal debt since February \n26, 1992.\n  This means that as of the close of business yesterday, Tuesday, March \n12, 1996, the Federal debt total was exactly $5,017,283,591,910.03. (On \na per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes \n$19,044.03 as his or her share of the Federal debt.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1967-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE NOMINATION OF COMMANDER ROBERT STUMPF\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee \nagreed on March 13, 1996 to issue the following statement concerning \nthe consideration of the nomination of Commander Robert Stumpf, U.S. \nNavy.\n  On March 11, 1994, the President submitted various nominations for \npromotion in the Navy to the grade of Captain (0-6), including a list \ncontaining the nomination of Commander Stumpf. On the same date, the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense, in the letter required by the committee \non all Navy and Marine Corps nominees, advised the committee that none \nof the officers had been identified as potentially implicated on \nmatters related to Tailhook. The list was reported favorably to the \nSenate on May 19, 1994, and all nominations on the list were confirmed \nby the Senate on May 24, 1994.\n  Subsequent to the Senate's confirmation of the list, but prior to the \nappointment by the President of Commander Stumpf to the grade of \nCaptain, the committee was advised by the Department of Defense that \nthe March 11, 1994 letter had been in error because the Navy had failed \nto inform the Office of the Secretary of Defense that Commander Stumpf \nhad been identified as potentially implicated in Tailhook. On June 30, \n1994, the committee requested that the Navy withhold action on the \npromotion until the committee had an opportunity to review the \ninformation that had not been made available to the Senate during the \nconfirmation proceedings.\n  On April 4, 1995, the Navy provided the Committee with the report of \nthe investigation and related information concerning Commander Stumpf, \nand subsequently provided additional information in response to \nrequests from the committee. On October 25, 1995, the committee met in \nclosed session--consistent with longstanding practice--to consider a \nnumber of nominations and to consider the matter involving Commander \nStumpf. The committee directed the Chairman and Ranking Member to \nadvise the Secretary of the Navy that ``had the information regarding \nCommander Stumpf's activities surrounding Tailhook `91 been available \nto the committee, as required, at the time of the nomination, the \ncommittee would not have recommended that the Senate confirm his \nnomination to the grade of Captain.'' The committee also directed that \nthe letter advise the Secretary that: ``The committee recognizes that, \nin light of the Senate having earlier given its advice and consent to \nCommander Stumpf's nomination, the decision to promote him rests solely \nwith the Executive Branch.'' A draft letter was prepared, made \navailable for review by all members of the committee, and was \ntransmitted to the Secretary on November 13, 1995. On December 22, \n1995, the Secretary of the Navy removed Commander Stumpf's name from \nthe promotion list.\n  The committee met on March 12, 1996, to review the committee's \nprocedures for considering Navy and Marine Corps nominations in the \naftermath of Tailhook. At that meeting, the committee reviewed the \nproceedings concerning Commander Stumpf.\n  The committee, in considering the promotion of Commander Stumpf, \nacted in good faith and in accordance with established rules and \nprocedures, including procedures designed to protect the privacy and \nreputation of nominees, with appropriate regard for the rights of \nCommander Stumpf. The Chief of Naval Operations has testified that he \nbelieves such confidentiality should be maintained. The committee made \nits November 13, 1995 recommendation based upon information that was \nmade available by the Navy.\n  At the present time, no nomination concerning Commander Stumpf is \npending before the committee, and the Secretary of the Navy has removed \nhis name from the promotion list. The committee has been advised by the \nNavy's General Counsel that this administrative action taken by the \nSecretary of the Navy is final and that the Secretary cannot act \nunilaterally to promote Commander Stumpf.\n  The committee notes that much of the material that has appeared in \nthe media about the substantive and procedural issues concerning this \nmatter, is inaccurate and incomplete.\n  As with any nominee whose name has been removed from a promotion \nlist, Commander Stumpf remains eligible for further nomination by the \nPresident. If he is nominated again for promotion to Captain, the \ncommittee will give the nomination the same careful consideration it \nwould give any nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1967-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMs. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the Bill (H.R. \n1561) to consolidate the foreign affairs agencies of the United States; \nto authorize appropriations for the Department of State and related \nagencies for fiscal year 1996 and 1997; to responsibly reduce the \nauthorizations of appropriations for United States foreign assistance \nprograms for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the amendments of \nthe Senate to the bill (H.R. 2036) to amend the Solid Waste Disposal \nAct to make certain adjustments in the land disposal program to provide \nneeded flexibility, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills and joint resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2064.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe standards used for determining whether individuals are not \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n       The Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, determining worker classification is one of \nthe most important tax issues facing small business today. Indeed, and \nin fact, it was rated No. 1 by the delegates to the White House \nConference on Small Business. They said this is something that must be \ndealt with because the ambiguity in the current law makes it extremely \ndifficult for business owners to determine whether a worker is an \nindependent contractor or an employee. Today I will be introducing the \nIndependent Contractor Tax Simplification Act on behalf of myself, \nSenator Nickles, Senator Dole, Senator D'Amato, Senator Murkowski and \nSenator Lott.\n  For years, now, the Internal Revenue Service has used a 20-factor \ncommon law test to determine worker status. Frankly, the test is a \nnightmare of subjectivity and unpredictability for small business \nowners who often get their tutorial on the subtleties of the issue \nduring an IRS audit--certainly an unfortunate time to be learning how \ntricky the law is.\n  IRS agents are required to consider 20 different factors to determine \nwhether an employer/employee relationship exists. The problem is that \nthe small business taxpayer is not able to predict which of the 20 \nfactors is going to be more important to a particular IRS agent, and \nfinding a certain number of these factors present in a case does not \nalways determine the result.\n  Inevitably, what has been happening is that agents are resolving far \ntoo many cases in favor of the IRS and its tendency to find the \nexistence of an employment relationship at the expense and disruption \nof bona fide independent contractor arrangements.\n  Let me make perfectly clear, the IRS has every right to obtain \ninformation on payments, whether they are made to an employee or to an \nindependent contractor. It is our position that simplifying IRS \ncollection does not warrant the IRS going beyond tax law to determine \nbusiness organization, so long as the organizations are legitimate \nstructures and the IRS has the information on payments so they may \ncollect appropriate taxes.\n  This lack of a clear standard in existing law has made some small \nbusiness owners reluctant to hire independent contractors and put \nothers in great concern and risk of being pursued for back taxes.\n  In some cases, the concern is so great that it stifles business \nexpansion. As I indicated earlier, the depth of the problem was made \nclear last summer when the White Conference on Small Business, a \nnationwide group of almost 2,000 small business delegates, voted the \nindependent contractor issue first on its list for recommended changes.\n  Today, together with Senator Nickles and the other Senators whom I \nmentioned, Senator Nickles having been a long and consistent supporter \nof small business legislation, we introduce a bill that solves this \nproblem. Our bill provides a short list of simple, clear objective \nstandards that will allow all taxpayers to understand what the law says \nabout who is an employee and who is an independent contractor. When \nthis law is enacted, IRS agents will have clear direction, small \nbusiness will have clear direction, but the IRS will no longer have the \nupper hand in today's confusing independent contractor law, which gives \nthe IRS agent, when they deal with our country's small business \ntaxpayers, advantage in determining their business organization.\n\n  I especially thank Senator Nickles for his willingness to allow us to \nwork on this bill together. Last September at a hearing, I held in the \nSmall Business Committee, Senator Nickles testified about his personal \nexperience with this issue dating back to the small business that he \nbegan while he was a college student. For Senator Nickles' company, \nlike many startup companies and small businesses, it seemed to make \nperfect sense to hire independent contractors in certain situations. \nMore established, larger businesses also need to hire independent \ncontractors to accomplish specific tasks that may require specialized \nskill. In fact, many of America's entrepreneurs are in business as \nindependent contractors whose livelihood is dependent upon the fact \nthat other companies need their service and expertise. These \nentrepreneurs have no desire, nor do they have any need, to become \nemployees of the businesses who purchase their services.\n  Others in our Small Business Committee hearing testified about their \nexperiences with IRS agents regarding worker status, telling us about \nreceiving IRS penalties as high as a quarter of a million dollars. \nBetween these outrageously high penalties and the complexity of the 20-\nfactor test, this issue, understandably, infuriates many small business \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Honorable \nMargaret Richardson, in a speech to last summer's small business \nconference delegates, told them the IRS does not care whether someone \nis an employee or independent contractor, as long as they properly \nreport their income, and that is as it should be. Yet, the IRS \ncontinues to pursue this issue fiercely during its audits. It has been \nreported that in a recent 4-year span, the IRS reclassified 338,000 \nworkers as employees. The same report indicates the IRS prevails in 9 \nout of 10 worker classification audits. Little wonder when they have \nthe upper hand with a very confusing, very complex 20-factor test.\n  Just last week, I received a copy of the ``Revised Internal Revenue \nService Worker Classification Training Materials.'' This was \ndistributed by Commissioner Richardson. In her memo accompanying the \ndocument, she describes the purchase of the document as an attempt to \nidentify, simplify and clarify the factors that should be applied in \norder to accurately determine worker classification.\n  There could be no more compelling justification for the importance of \nour immediate passage of the legislation than this document. We commend \nCommissioner Richardson for seeking to simplify, but this document is \nover 100 pages long. If it takes that much paper and that much ink to \ninstruct IRS agents on how to simplify and clarify a small business tax \nissue, I think we can be pretty sure how simple and clear it is going \nto seem to the taxpayer sitting across the desk from an IRS agent \nduring an audit.\n  As those who follow this issue know, what makes this problem \nespecially frustrating is that unlike most interpretive actions of the \nIRS where they must determine the proper amount of income or deductions \nso Treasury can collect the amount of tax legally due to it, the \nindependent contractor issue is not about how much tax the Government \nreceives. The classification decision does not alter aggregate tax \nliability to the Government at all. This problem exists because of \nIRS's apparent desire to recast economic relationships between private \nparties that these parties have already determined for themselves. The \nIndependent Contractor Tax Simplification Act will help move the IRS \nout of its de facto role of setting employment policy and back into its \nrole of revenue collection.\n\n  Our bill sets out three simple questions to be asked in determining \nwhether a person providing services is an employee or independent \ncontractor.\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\n  First, is there a written agreement between the parties?\n  Second, does it appear the worker has made some investment, such as \nincurring substantial unreimbursed expenses or being paid primarily on \na commission basis?\n  Third, does the worker appear to have some independence, such as \nhaving his or her own place of business?\n  In other words, under this bill, if there is a written contract \nbetween the parties and if basic investment and independence criteria \nare met, then the worker is an independent contractor. Plain, simple, \npredictable. Fine. To take advantage of this simple rule, the party \nmust properly report payments above $600 to the IRS just like under \ncurrent law. This ensures all taxes properly due to the Treasury can be \ncollected.\n  The legislation is written to provide immediate clarification and \nrelief to taxpayers undergoing IRS examinations currently. The change, \nno doubt, would save many businesses from a protracted and expensive \nbattle with IRS. For some, it may even save the business.\n  When we in Congress find an opportunity to take action in a tax area \nso strongly supported by many small businesses, and when it is one that \ndoes not involve any loss to the Federal Treasury, we should act \nwithout delay. I am confident the Finance Committee can find an \nacceptable revenue offset for this worthy purpose to the extent that \nany revenue is lost. The revenue estimate for the bill should be fairly \nsimple, reflecting the bill's provisions that assure continued \ncollection of all taxes due the Federal Government.\n  Small businesses cannot afford to wait any longer for resolution of \nthis problem, and they should not be expected to do so. They have \nwaited for decades. We now have a bill that will solve the problem.\n  The companion bill has been introduced in the other body. I am told \nit has over 200 cosponsors. It is time Congress steps up to the plate \nand delivers for small business. I urge members of the Finance \nCommittee to work with Senator Nickles and others to report out a bill \nthat provides this much-needed change.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the bill, a section-by-section analysis and copies of some \nletters of support for the bill we have received.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senators Dole, D'Amato, Lott, \nMurkowski, and Inhofe be shown as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independent Contractor Tax \n     Simplification Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Simplifying the tax rules with respect to independent \n     contractors was the top vote-getter at the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Small Business. Conference delegates \n     recommended that Congress ``should recognize the legitimacy \n     of an independent contractor''.

IRS audit \n     determinations of misclassification often result in heavy tax \n     penalties. Clarifying independent contractor rules was \n     considered the top small business priority by conference \n     delegates at the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business.\n       Instead of trying to define who is an employee (the common \n     law 20-point test), this legislation creates a simple \n     definition of who is not an employee.\n\n\n                              General Rule\n\n       If this legislation's requirements are met with respect to \n     any service performed by any individual, then the service \n     provider shall not be treated as an employee, the service \n     recipient shall not be treated as an employer, the payor \n     shall not be treated as an employer, and the compensation \n     paid shall not be treated as paid with respect to employment.\n\n\n                        investment/training/risk\n\n       With regard to the service being performed, the service \n     provider must--\n       (1) have a significant investment in assets and/or \n     training, or\n       (2) incur significant unreimbursed expenses, or\n       (3) agree to perform the service for a particular amount of \n     time or to complete a specific result and is liable for \n     damages for early termination without cause, or\n       (4) be paid primarily on a commissioned or per-unit basis, \n     or\n       (5) purchase products for resale.\n\n\n                principal place of business/advertising\n\n       With regard to other parties, the service provider must--\n       (1) have a principal place of business, or\n       (2) not primarily provide the service in the recipient's \n     facilities unless the provider is paying a fair market rent \n     for this use, or\n       (3) operate primarily from equipment not supplied by the \n     service recipient, or\n       (4) not be required to perform service exclusively for the \n     service recipient, and\n       (a) have recently performed a significant amount of service \n     for other persons, or\n       (b) have offered to perform service for persons through \n     advertising, individual solicitations, listing with \n     registries, etc, or other similar activities, or\n       (c) have provided service under a registered or licensed \n     business name.\n\n\n                     written document requirements\n\n       The services of a provider must be performed pursuant to a \n     written contract between such individual and the service \n     recipient stating that the provider will not be treated as an \n     employee.\n\n\n                             special rules\n\n       If any service recipient fails to meet the applicable IRS \n     reporting requirements with respect to a service provider, \n     then they may not rely upon these simplified independent \n     contractor guidelines and are subject to the existing 20-\n     point common law test.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n                                             Independent Business,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 1996.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On behalf of the more than 600,000 \n     members of the National Federation of Independent Business \n     (NFIB), I am writing to offer our strong support of the \n     Independent Contractor Simplification Act. The independent \n     contractor issue has been confusing and burdensome for small \n     business owners for decades. As you know, the independent \n     contractor issue was the top recommendation of the 1995 White \n     House Conference on Small Business.\n       Small businesses are put in a lose-lose situation with the \n     Internal Revenue Service. Under the current law, they are \n     required to classify individuals as independent contractors \n     or employees based on extremely vague and ambiguous IRS \n     guidelines. When a small business owner mistakenly \n     misclassifies a worker based on these vague criteria, the IRS \n     audits the business and levies back tax penalties. Even if \n     the employer fully reported all payments to the independent \n     contractor and the mistake was unintentional, these penalties \n     are still levied. This misunderstanding can put the employer \n     out of business. For small businesses, misinterpreting these \n     nebulous IRS guidelines can be financially devastating.\n       The Independent Contractor Simplification Act sets forth an \n     alternate set of clear and distinct criteria for businesses \n     to follow when classifying their workers. It solves the \n     independent contractor problem by defining who is not an \n     employee. Most importantly, the legislation puts forth \n     safeguards against abusing this classification by prohibiting \n     both independent contractor and employer from relying on \n     these new rules if all payments for service are not properly \n     reported to the IRS.\n       We commend you on your legislation which sends much needed \n     relief to our nation's small business owners and the million \n     of budding entrepreneurs who have an interest in being an \n     independent contractor. We look forward to working with you \n     to move the Independent Contractor Simplification Act through \n     the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Donald A. Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                   The Independent\n\n\n                                         Contractor Coalition,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kit Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We the undersigned, representing a \n     cross-section of close to one million businesses and \n     individuals, are writing to offer our strong support for the \n     Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act.\n       This legislation will bring much needed relief to millions \n     of businesses and budding entrepreneurs in addressing \n     ambiguities in the IRS guidelines for determining independent \n     contractor status.\n       At a minimum, the current system by which the IRS enforces \n     laws and regulations governing an individual's employment tax \n     status promotes uncertainty and inhibits entry of aspiring \n     entrepreneurs into the free market system as independent \n     contractors. At its worst, the current system is unfairly \n     biased against the use of independent contractors and \n     constrains economic expansion of our nation's free market \n     system.\n       The Bond/Nickles bill will settle many of the problems \n     associated with the current system. By setting forth a clear \n     set of alternate criteria, this legislation will resolve many \n     of the long standing complaints businesses and individuals \n     have had with the vague and often subjective guidelines the \n     IRS uses to classify workers as employees or independent \n     contractors.\n       As the leading coalition of businesses and individuals \n     working to clarify independent contractor status, we commend \n     you on your effort and look forward to working with you to \n     move this legislation through the Senate.\n       Allow the free enterprise system to work for the benefit of \n     our economy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Nelson Litterst,\n                                                   NFIB, Co-Chair.\n                                                     John Satagaj,\n                                                   SBLC, Co-Chair.\n\n\n THE BOND/NICKLES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR LEGISLATION--Endorsement List\n\n       Agricultural & Industrial Manuf.

Christopher Bond,\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Bond and Nickles: On behalf of the Small \n     Business Legislative Council (SBLC), I wish to express our \n     strong support for your legislation to establish clear and \n     objective rules for the purposes of determining whether an \n     individual is an independent contractor or employee.\n       This is a long-time concern of the SBLC. Indeed, one of the \n     founding principles of the organization, when it was \n     established in the mid-1970s, was to work to encourage \n     individuals to pursue the American Dream--owning and managing \n     their own business. Becoming an independent contractor is \n     both the means and the end to that goal.\n       As you know, the delegates to the 1995 White House \n     Conference on Small Business made this one of their priority \n     recommendations. Indeed, while there was no official ranking, \n     this was the top vote-getter in the final balloting.\n       Congratulations on this initiative! We look forward to \n     working with you towards the passage and enactment.\n       The Small Business Legislative Council (SBLC) is a \n     permanent, independent coalition of nearly one hundred trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interests of small businesses in such diverse economic \n     sectors as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, \n     professional and technical services, construction, \n     transportation and agriculture.

We feel our industry practice is the epitome of \n     the American tradition of selling products and services \n     through independent sales representatives.\n       We strongly believe clear and objective rules that will put \n     the ongoing battle between the IRS and small business over \n     this issue behind us are needed and welcomed.

Stephen Slagle,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one of the most fundamental concepts in \nour free enterprise economy is the ability of any American to use \ntalent, intelligence, and hard work to start a business. The small, \nindependent business is the engine which drives innovation, job \ncreation, and increased economic activity in this country.\n  For many small, start-up companies, independent contractor status is \nthe best way, and sometimes the only way, they can do business. \nSimilarly, many larger, established businesses find that using \nindependent contractors is the most effective way of handling projects \nthat require special talents. There are five million independent \ncontractors in America according to the Small Business Administration, \nand almost one-third of all companies use independent contractors to \nsome degree. Independent contractor status gives both the service \nprovider and the service recipient the flexibility needed to be \ncompetitive in today's economic environment.\n  Before coming to the U.S. Senate, I had first hand experience with \nthese issues; both working as and employing independent contractors. \nThe janitorial service I began as a student at Oklahoma State \nUniversity could not have existed if I had been required to work as an \nemployee, and it never would have expanded if I could not have hired \nother students as independent contractors to handle specific jobs.\n  Despite the obvious importance of independent contractors to our \neconomy, Congress has amazingly failed to give workers or businesses \nadequate guidance as to who is an employee and who is an independent \ncontractor. Unfortunately, this lack of decisive congressional action \ncombined with aggressive dislike of independent contractors by the \nInternal Revenue Service has subjected many businesses to abusive \naudits and unfair penalties. In effect, our Government is killing the \nindependent contractor.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Missouri, Senator \nBond, to introduce the Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act. \nThis legislation is the Senate companion of a H.R. 1972, a bill \nintroduced last year by Congressman Jon Christensen which now has 215 \ncosponsors. Our bill, which is supported by over 50 trade and industry \nassociations, cuts through the horrendously complicated and ambiguous \ncurrent law rules and provides relief and confidence to independent \ncontractors and service recipients alike.\n  Why is congressional action needed, Mr. President? In the mid-1970's, \nthe IRS undertook a major initiative to reclassify workers as \nemployees. In response to the tremendous outcry from business owners, \nCongress in 1978 enacted what was intended to be a temporary solution, \nthe section 530 safe harbor provisions. Section 530 prohibited the IRS \nfrom reclassifying workers as employees if the employer had a \nreasonable basis for treatment of the workers as independent \ncontractors, or if a past IRS audit did not dispute the workers' \nclassification.\n  So for two decades, independent contractor status has been controlled \nby this temporary solution, related IRS rulings, judicial precedent, \nand legislation targeted at specific industries. Those contractors and \nbusinesses who are unable to rely upon section 530 are subjected to a \n20-point command law test which attempts to define an employer's \ncontrol over workers. This common law test is the bane of employers and \nworkers across the country, and is at the heart of the problems my \nlegislation intends to address. The General Accounting Office calls the \ncommon law test ``unclear and subject to conflicting interpretations''. \nEven the Treasury Department has testified that ``applying the common \nlaw test in employment tax issues does not yield clear, consistent, or \neven satisfactory answers, and reasonable persons may differ as to the \ncorrect classification''.\n  The horror stories surrounding this issue are numerous and \ndisturbing, Mr. President. Last year, ``NBC Nightly News'' ran a story \non two business owners who are facing hundreds of thousands of dollars \nin back taxes and penalties because the IRS decided to reclassify their \nindependent contractors as employees. One of these citizens, who owns a \ntravel agency, received a bill for almost $200,000 in back taxes, \npenalties, and interest, despite the fact that his independent \ncontractors had already paid their taxes! Mr. President, a $200,000 tax \nbill will close the doors of most small businesses.\n  According to the NBC report, the IRS has used these worker \nclassification audits to collect more than three-quarters of a billion \ndollars from business owners over the last 7 years in disputed \nemployment taxes, even though many of the independent contractors had \nalready paid these taxes.\n  The Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act replaces the \ncomplicated and arbitrary common law test with a simple definition of \nwho is not an employee.\n  To qualify for independent contractor status, my legislation requires \nthe service provider to have a significant investment in assets and/or \ntraining, or incur significant unreimbursed expenses, or agree to \nperform the service for a particular amount of time or to, complete a \nspecific result and is liable for damages for early termination without \ncause, or be paid primarily on a commissioned or per-unit basis, or \npurchase products for resale.\n  Further, under my legislation the service provider must have a \nprincipal place of business, or not primarily provide the service in \nthe recipient's facilities unless the provider is paying a fair market \nrent for their use, or operate primarily from equipment not supplied by \nthe service recipient or not be required to perform service exclusively \nfor the service recipient, and have recently performed a significant \namount of service for other persons, or have offered to perform service \nfor other persons through advertising, individual solicitations, \nlisting with registries, et cetera or other similar activities, or have \nprovided service under a registered or licensed business name.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation requires businesses and \nindependent contractors to enter into a written contract and comply \nwith all applicable IRS reporting requirements to ensure that payments \nto independent contractors are properly reported in order to prevent \ntaxpayer arbitrage.\n  I would like to stress, Mr. President, that this legislation is not a \ncomprehensive rewrite of all independent contractor law. It is very \ndifficult to address all worker classification issues in one bill, \nbecause there is an unlimited number of employment situations and each \none presents different challenges. Further, many individuals, \nbusinesses, and trade associations have resolved their problems with \nthe IRS, and they fear that a comprehensive change in the law will \nforce them to renew old arguments with the Government or impose \nunwanted conditions on their employment practices, such as tax \nwithholding. The Independent Contractor Tax Simplification Act will \nbenefit those businesses and contractors who have not resolved their \nstatus with the IRS, while preserving current law for those who are \nsatisfied with it.\n  Mr. President, it is not fair to business, nor is it conducive to the \nentrepreneurial spirit of this country, to leave the question of worker \nclassification up to the whim of the IRS. The importance and timeliness \nof this issue was made clear last summer when delegates to the White \nHouse Conference on Small Business made clarifying independent \ncontractor rules their No. 1 small business priority. I believe \nCongress should act decisively to recognize the importance of \nindependent contractors, and I invite my colleagues to join me in this \ninitiative.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1611. A bill to establish the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n[[Page S1975]]\n\n        the kentucky national wildlife refuge authorization act\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to establish \nthe Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge. The designation will give \nKentucky something that 49 other States have enjoyed for a long time: \nits own national wildlife refuge. What this means to my State is new \ntourism opportunities and a pristine environmental preserve that will \nbe part of our legacy to future generations.\n  Nearly 100 years ago, President Theodore Roosevelt established the \nNational Wildlife Refuge System to protect our Nation's open lands, \nwater, and wildlife for the future. It was one of the first Federal \nenvironmental programs in our history.\n  Today, the National Wildlife Refuge System is made up of 571 refuges \nin 49 States and U.S. Territories, totaling nearly 92 million acres of \nthe Nation's best wildlife habitat. Until now, Kentucky has been the \nonly State without its own independently managed refuge.\n  The legislation I am proposing will authorize the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service to purchase up to 20,000 acres in western Kentucky \nlocated in the east fork of the Clarks River. This site, located near \nBenton, is the only major bottomland hardwood area remaining in western \nKentucky.\n  Once established, the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge will showcase \na unique ecosystem, protecting wildlife and offering a variety of \neducational opportunities for the public. This refuge will also provide \nrecreational activities, including bird-watching, hiking, hunting, and \nthe fishing.\n  The refuge area is situated on an important migratory fly-way and \nbreeding area for a variety of waterfowl. A large number of migratory \nbirds including wood ducks, song birds, and the threatened bald eagle \nmake their home here. The hardwood forests make an ideal habitat for \nnumerous woodpeckers, hawks, and the eastern wild turkey. Other \nwildlife which would thrive in this area include deer, beavers, otters, \nand bobcats.\n  For visitors, the refuge is conveniently located near Paducah, \nMayfield, Murray, and Benton, and is just 15 miles from Land Between \nthe Lakes, which draws nearly 2 million visitors a year. This refuge is \nideally suited to serve surrounding schools, recreational hikers, and \nhunters. The Clarks River will also appeal to those who enjoy canoeing \nand fishing as well.\n  In addition to the environmental and educational benefits, the \ndesignation of the Kentucky Wildlife Refuge will also provide a \nsignificant economic boost to the area. The creation of Kentucky's \nfirst refuge will help keep tourist dollars in the State. A perfect \nexample of this is a trip, planned by the Louisville Zoo, to a National \nWildlife Refuge in Tennessee. This trip is for Kentuckians who are \ninterested in eagle-watching. By creating a Kentucky wildlife refuge, \npeople who are interested in outdoor activities would have an \nopportunity here in Kentucky--something that nature lovers and the \nState would benefit from.\n  I have worked hard to ensure that my proposal is fair in protecting \nthe rights of individual landowners, while preserving this important \nhabitat. Contained in my bill is language to ensure that the \nacquisition of refuge lands will be from willing sellers, donations, or \nexchanges only.\n  I am sensitive to the property rights and concerns of local \nlandowners; and for this reason I will closely follow the project to \nensure that their rights are protected.\n  I have also worked closely with the Kentucky Farm Bureau to guarantee \nthat the management of the refuge will not impact surrounding farmers \nor unduly restrict agricultural activities. I am confident that both \nagricultural interests and conservation interests can exist side-by-\nside in this region.\n  Finally, it is deeply gratifying to have such a broad array of \nsupport for my proposal, including State and local public officials, \nconservation groups, and sportsmen. I would like to commend Tom \nBennett, commissioner of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife \nResources, and his staff, for their efforts to establish consensus \namong the various groups. This refuge could never have been established \nwithout the strong support of people like Tom, as well as the \ncooperation we have received from the surrounding communities.\n  It has been 92 years since Teddy Roosevelt created the National \nWildlife Refuge System. The time is long overdue for Kentucky to join \nthat system at last.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record and a list of organizations and individuals who \nhave endorsed the creation of the wildlife refuge also be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Kentucky National Wildlife \n     Refuge Authorization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the area known as the Clarks River Basin, consisting of \n     20,000 acres of bottomland hardwood and associated wetlands \n     along the Clarks River and the East Fork of the Clarks River \n     in Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties, Kentucky, is of \n     critical importance to a variety of migratory and resident \n     waterfowl, neotropical migratory birds, forest wildlife, and \n     riverine species, and a wide array of other species \n     associated with bottomland communities;\n       (2) the area is the only major, natural (unchannelized) \n     bottomland hardwood wetland ecosystem remaining in western \n     Kentucky and attracts wintering migratory waterfowl, \n     neotropical migratory birds, and an array of raptors;\n       (3) the area provides extraordinary recreational, research, \n     and educational opportunities for students, scientists, \n     birdwatchers, wildlife observers, hunters, anglers, hikers, \n     and nature photographers;\n       (4) the area is an internationally significant \n     environmental resource that is unprotected and requires \n     active management to prevent vegetative encroachment and to \n     otherwise protect and enhance the value of the area as fish \n     and wildlife habitat;\n       (5) the Clarks River Basin has been identified in the \n     preliminary project proposal plan for the establishment of \n     the Kentucky National Wildlife Refuge, prepared by the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service (Southeast Region), as an \n     area deserving permanent protection; and\n       (6) since agriculture and silviculture are essential to the \n     economies of Graves, Marshall, and McCracken Counties and can \n     contribute to healthy ecosystems for wildlife, the refuge \n     should not restrict agricultural and silvicultural activities \n     on private lands.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Kentucky \n     National Wildlife Refuge to be managed--\n       (1) to conserve fish and wildlife populations and the \n     habitats of the populations, including habitats of bald \n     eagles, golden eagles, Indiana bats, wood ducks, neotropical \n     migratory birds, shorebirds, and other migratory birds;\n       (2) to preserve and showcase the concepts of biodiversity \n     and ecosystem management;\n       (3) to enhance and provide a vital link to public areas \n     containing habitat managed for waterfowl and other migratory \n     birds;\n       (4) to fulfill international treaty obligations of the \n     United States with regard to fish and wildlife and the \n     habitats of the fish and wildlife;\n       (5) to restore and maintain the physical and biological \n     integrity of wetlands and other waters within the refuge;\n       (6) to conserve species known to be threatened with \n     extinction; and\n       (7) to provide opportunities for scientific research, \n     environmental education, and fish- and wildlife-associated \n     recreation (including hunting, trapping, and fishing) and \n     access to the extent compatible with the management purposes \n     specified in paragraphs (1) through (6).\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Land.--The term ``land'' includes an interest in land.\n       (2) Refuge.--The term ``refuge'' means the Kentucky \n     National Wildlife Refuge established under section 5.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       (4) Water.--The term ``water'' includes an interest in \n     water.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to provide for increased mandatory minimum sentences \nfor criminals possessing firearms, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                mandatory minimum sentencing legislation\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, a drug trafficker who in 1992 was convicted \nin the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina \nwas released from prison 2 days ago, Monday, March 11, as the tragic \nresult of an unfortunate and unwise Supreme Court decision.\n  Although the drug trafficker had 5 more years to serve, the U.S. \nSupreme Court, using the flimsiest of reasoning, set this convicted \ndrug trafficker free. So, Mr. President, the bill I am introducing \ntoday will prevent future criminals from being set free. I am advised \nthat my bill is being numbered S. 1612.\n  Mr. President, S. 1612 provides that a 10-year minimum mandatory \nsentence shall be imposed upon any criminal possessing a gun during and \nin relation to the commission of a violent or drug trafficking crime. \nThis, of course, does not apply to lawful possession of a gun.\n  This bill will obviously crack down on gun-toting thugs who commit \nviolent felonies and drug trafficking offenses and other felonies. \nMoreover, it will ensure that criminals possessing a firearm while \ncommitting a violent or drug trafficking felony shall receive a stiff \npunishment.\n  This is just common sense, Mr. President; violent felons who possess \nfirearms are more dangerous than those who do not.\n  Current Federal law provides that a person who, during a Federal \ncrime of violence or drug trafficking crime, uses or carries a firearm \nshall be sentenced to 5 years in prison. That law has been used \neffectively by Federal prosecutors across the country to add 5 \nadditional years to the prison sentences of criminals who use or carry \nfirearms.\n  However, a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision threatens to undermine \nthe efforts of prosecutors to use this statute effectively. The Supreme \nCourt's decision, Bailey versus United States, interpreted the law to \nrequire that a violent felon actively employ a firearm as a \nprecondition of receiving an additional 5 year sentence. The Court in \nBailey held that the firearm must be brandished, fired or otherwise \nactively used before the additional 5 year sentence may be imposed. So \nif a criminal merely possesses a firearm, but does not fire or \notherwise use it, he gets off without the additional 5 year penalty.\n  Mr. President, this Supreme Court decision poses serious problems for \nlaw enforcement. It weakens the Federal\n\n[[Page S1977]]\n\ncriminal law; it is leading to the early release of hundreds of violent \ncriminals. Before this Supreme Court's error of judgment, in the Bailey \nversus U.S. decision, armed criminals committing violent or drug \ntrafficking felonies were jailed for an additional 5 years, regardless \nof whether they actively employed their weapons. Now, as a result of \nthe Court's decision, the prison revolving door is in full swing. Yet \nanother roadblock has been erected between a savage criminal act and \nswift, certain punishment.\n  Mr. President, now that the word is out, prisoners already are \npreparing and filing motions to get out of jail as fast as they can \nwrite. U.S. attorneys are receiving petitions from criminals every \nday--for example consider the case of Lancelot Martin, who ran a drug \ntrafficking operation out of Raleigh, NC: In 1992, Martin had attempted \nto use the U.S. Postal Service to receive and sell drugs. Martin was \narrested by a Raleigh crime task force. The authorities obtained a \nwarrant, searched his apartment, seized his drugs and recovered a 9 mm. \nsemi-automatic pistol that Martin used to protect his drug business.\n  Martin was convicted of drug trafficking charges and received a 5 \nyear sentence for using the gun. But Monday, well before his sentence \nexpired, Martin walked free, simply because his gun and a hefty supply \nof drugs were found--but the Court somehow held that the gun was not \nactively employed during his drug trafficking crime.\n  So, Mr. President, my bill will ensure that future criminals \npossessing guns, like Lancelot Martin, serve real time when they use a \ngun in furtherance of a violent or drug trafficking crime. There are \nmany other examples similar to the episode involving Lancelot Martin.\n  As a result of the Court's decision, any thug who hides a gun under \nthe back seat of his car, or who stashes a gun with his drugs, may now \nget off with a slap on the wrist. Or if a criminal stores a sub-\nmachinegun in a crack-house where he runs a drug trafficking operation, \nhe can now avoid the additional penalty. The fact is, Mr. President, \nthat firearms are the tools of the trade of most drug traffickers. \nWeapons clearly facilitate the criminal transactions and embolden \nviolent thugs to commit their crimes.\n  I believe that mere possession of a firearm, during the commission of \na violent felony--even if the weapon is not actively used--should \nnonetheless be punished--because of the heightened risk of violence \nwhen firearms are present. In its opinion, the Supreme Court observed, \n``Had Congress intended possession alone to trigger liability . . . it \neasily could have so provided.'' That, Mr. President, is precisely the \nintent of this legislation--to make clear that ``possession alone'' \ndoes indeed ``trigger liability.''\n  This legislation will increase the mandatory--repeat, mandatory--\nsentences for violent armed felons from 5 to 10 years--and if the \nfirearm is discharged, the term of imprisonment is 20 years. This \nlegislation also increases to 25 years the mandatory sentences for \nsecond and subsequent offenses.\n   Mr. President, this bill is a necessary and appropriate response to \nthe Supreme Court's judicial limitation of the mandatory penalty for \ngun-toting criminals. According to Sentencing Commission statistics, \nmore than 9,000 armed violent felons were convicted from April, 1991, \nthrough October, 1995. In North Carolina alone, this statute was used \nto help imprison over 800 violent criminals. We must strengthen law \nenforcement's ability to use this strong anticrime provision.\n  Fighting crime is, and should be, a top concern in America. It has \nbeen estimated that in the United States one violent crime is committed \nevery 16 seconds. And with youth-related violent crime at an all-time \nhigh, we must fight back with the most severe punishment possible for \nthose who terrorize law-abiding citizens.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1612\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASED MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR \n                   CRIMINALS POSSESSING FIREARMS.\n\n       Section 924(c)(1) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(c)(1)(A) Except to the extent a greater minimum sentence \n     is otherwise provided by any other provision of this \n     subsection or any other law, a person who, during and in \n     relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \n     (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime \n     which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the \n     use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which a \n     person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, \n     possesses a firearm shall, in addition to the punishment \n     provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking \n     crime--\n       ``(i) be punished by imprisonment for not less than 10 \n     years;\n       ``(ii) if the firearm is discharged, be punished by \n     imprisonment for not less than 20 years; and\n       ``(iii) if the death of a person results, be punished by \n     the death penalty or by imprisonment for not less than life.\n       ``(B) If the firearm possessed by a person convicted under \n     this subsection is a machinegun or a destructive device, or \n     is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, such \n     person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than \n     30 years.\n       ``(C) In the case of a second or subsequent conviction \n     under this subsection, such person shall be sentenced to \n     imprisonment for not less than 25 years, and if the firearm \n     is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is equipped with \n     a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to life imprisonment \n     without release.\n       ``(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the court \n     shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any \n     person convicted of a violation of this subsection, nor shall \n     the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run \n     concurrently with any other term of imprisonment including \n     that imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking \n     crime in which the firearm was possessed.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

ADJUSTMENT FOR STIMULATIVE EFFECT OF REVENUE \n                   REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Amount of Adjustment.--\n       (1) OMB.--Effective in 1997 and not later than October 15 \n     of each year, the Director of OMB shall estimate the amount \n     of the stimulative economic effect of any provisions enacted \n     beginning with calendar year 1997 reducing revenues with \n     respect to increasing revenues in the fiscal year ending in \n     the year of the estimate. The Director of OMB shall calculate \n     stimulative effect by determining the amount by which actual \n     revenues exceed the projected level of revenues and then \n     estimating the amount of the excess (fiscal dividend excess) \n     attributable to enacted revenue reduction provisions.\n       (2) CBO certification.--Not later than October 20, the \n     Director of the CBO shall certify the estimates and \n     projections of the Director of OMB made under this \n     subsection.

If the bill described in the \n     preceding sentence is not introduced as provided in the \n     preceding sentence, then, on the 4th day after the submission \n     of the legislative proposal by the President, any Member of \n     that House may introduce the bill.\n       (2) Referral to committee.--A bill described in paragraph \n     (1) introduced in the House of Representatives shall be \n     referred to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives. A bill described in paragraph (1) introduced \n     in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee on Finance \n     of the Senate. If more than 1 bill is introduced as provided \n     in paragraph (1), the committee shall consider and report the \n     first bill introduced. Amendments to the bill in committee \n     may not reduce revenues in the bill below the amount proposed \n     by the President. Such a bill may not be reported before the \n     8th day after its introduction.\n       (3) Discharge of committee.--If the committee to which is \n     referred a bill described in paragraph (1) has not reported \n     such bill at the end of 15 calendar days after its \n     introduction, such committee shall be deemed to be discharged \n     from further consideration of such bill and such bill shall \n     be placed on the appropriate calendar of the House involved.\n       (4) Floor consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--When the committee to which a bill is \n     referred has reported, or has been deemed to be discharged \n     (under paragraph (3)) from further consideration of, a bill \n     described in paragraph (1), it is at any time thereafter in \n     order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to \n     move to proceed to the consideration of the bill, and all \n     points of order against the bill (and against consideration \n     of the bill) are waived. The motion is highly privileged in \n     the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate \n     and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, \n     or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall \n     not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration \n     of the bill is agreed to, the bill shall remain the \n     unfinished business of the respective House until disposed \n     of.\n       (B) Debate.--Consideration of the bill, and on all \n     debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall \n     be limited to not more than 20 hours, which shall be divided \n     equally between those favoring and those opposing the bill. A \n     motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. \n     A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the \n     bill is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by \n     which the bill is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order. \n     Debate on amendments to the bill shall be limited to 30 \n     minutes equally divided. Amendments to the bill may not \n     reduce revenues in the bill below the amount proposed by the \n     President.\n       (C) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on a bill described in paragraph \n     (1), and a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate \n     if requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate \n     House, the vote on final passage of the bill shall occur.\n       (D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the \n     case may be, to the procedure relating to a bill described in \n     paragraph (1) shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Coordination with action by other house.--If, before \n     the passage by one House of a bill of that House described in \n     paragraph (1), that House receives from the other House a \n     bill described in paragraph (1), then the following \n     procedures shall apply:\n       (A) The bill of the other House shall not be referred to a \n     committee.\n       (B) With respect to a bill described in paragraph (1) of \n     the House receiving the bill--\n       (i) the procedure in that House shall be the same as if no \n     bill had been received from the other House; but\n       (ii) the vote on final passage shall be on the bill of the \n     other House.\n       (6) Rules of house of representatives and senate.--This \n     subsection is enacted by Congress--\n       (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and House of Representatives, respectively, and as such it is \n     deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a bill described in paragraph \n     (1), and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it \n     is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the \n     procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and \n     to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that \n     House.\n       (d) Deficit Reduction if Tax Reductions Not Enacted.--If \n     tax reductions are not enacted by December 31 of the year of \n     the submission of a legislative proposal under subsection \n     (b)(2), the President shall pay an amount equal to the amount \n     by which revenues are not reduced to deficit reduction as \n     provided in subsection (b)(1).\n       (e) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``stimulative economic effect of any laws reducing revenues'' \n     refers to laws that have the effect of stimulating savings, \n     investment, job creation, and economic growth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1978-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n             Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I would like to commend New \nHampshire's Public Television ``Knowledge Network'' for organizing the \nApril National Teacher Training Institute for Math, Science and \nTechnology in Waterville, NH. Granite State teachers participating in \nthe April Institute will learn interactive methods for using television \nand technology in math and science instruction. Technology is a vital \ntool in the future of education, and this institute will prove valuable \nto the teachers and students in New Hampshire. The more we can use \ntechnology in the classroom and the more we can teach our students how \nto effectively use the information highway, the brighter and wiser our \nstudents will be.\n  The National Teacher Training Institute was launched in 1990 and has \nexpanded rapidly from 10 sites in 1991 to 26 for the 1995-96 school \nyear. Teachers attend 2 days of workshops in the interactive use of \ninstructional video, on-line telecommunications networks, and other new \ntechnologies. Approximately 100 teachers from every grade level will \nattend the institute. According to a Columbia University study, 94 \npercent of the teachers that attend pass along the information they \nacquire to their colleagues. Teachers teaching teachers is a crucial \nfacet in the educational community and is proudly supported at the \nInstitute.\n  The instruction provided by the National Teacher Training Institute \nis outstanding. Even more notable is the fact that so much of what is \ntaught is passed on to other teachers who were not able to attend. I am \nproud that the Public Television Knowledge Network has organized such a \nvaluable educational program, and am also pleased to see so many New \nHampshire teachers taking advantage of these important workshops. As a \nformer teacher, I congratulate the participating educators for their \nactive role in furthering the opportunities for New Hampshire students. \nHelping students to understand math and science through technology \nprovides them with the tools to be very successful in the future.\n  I commend New Hampshire Public Television and our distinguished \nteachers for their outstanding contribution to our educational system \nin New Hampshire and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1990-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1990-S1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOW FAR TO SUPPORT TAIWAN?\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, there are times when diplomacy \nshould leave messages unclear.\n  But today the message to China ought to be crystal clear: If they \ninvade or have missile attacks on Taiwan, the United States will \nintervene militarily. We do not need to spell out how we intervene. My \nown feeling is that it can include weapons to Taiwan, the use of air \npower, and other options that can be effective but do not involve \nUnited States troops.\n  I welcome the steps that have been taken, but I don't want any \nChinese leader, during this period of leadership uncertainty, to gamble \non what will take place.\n  An article that I call to the attention of my colleagues appeared \nrecently and merits careful reflection. It appeared in the New York \nTimes, written by David Shambaugh, titled ``How Far to Support \nTaiwan?'' I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The article follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 10, 1996]\n\n                       How Far To Support Taiwan?\n\n                          (By David Shambaugh)\n\n       By firing ballistic missiles within Taiwan's territorial \n     waters, China is sending political and military messages to \n     both the United States and Taiwan. Unless the Clinton \n     Administration delivers a demonstrably tough response--both \n     diplomatically and militarily--the exercises could escalate \n     dangerously and Beijing will be convinced it can act with \n     impunity.\n       The military exercises are but the latest in a long list of \n     irritants, including Beijing's human rights violations and \n     its sale of international arms. The Clinton Administration \n     has bent over backwards to engage China constructively and \n     help it integrate into the world order.\n       But Beijing's crude tactics are provocative and \n     irresponsible for a country seeking international recognition \n     as a great power. They also potentially force the United \n     States into choosing between its relationship with China and \n     its longstanding ties with Taiwan. America understandably \n     does not want war with the largest nation on earth, but it is \n     time to lay down markers and protect American national \n     interests.\n       Washington should begin by sending clear and unambiguous \n     warnings to Beijing about its coercive behavior toward \n     Taiwan. The Administration's condemnation of the missile \n     tests does not go far enough. President Clinton should \n     publicly restate America's commitment under the Taiwan \n     Relations Act to assist the island in defending itself. He \n     should reiterate that America's entire relationship with \n     China--since President Richard Nixon's visit in 1972--has \n     been premised on the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan \n     issue. President Clinton must clearly state that China's \n     recent actions call the entire relationship into question.\n       Words are important, but China respects power and action. \n     The United States Navy should dispatch the carrier \n     Independence (which has been cruising north of Taiwan) \n     through the Taiwan Strait--an international passage through \n     which Navy ships pass regularly to insure freedom of \n     navigation.\n       China's decision to fire missiles into the two ``impact \n     zones'' within 20 miles of Taiwan's two largest ports, \n     Keelung and Kaohsiung, constitutes a de facto blockade. \n     Seventy percent of the island's trade and all of its oil \n     imports pass through these ports. Such a partial blockade may \n     be an act of war under international law and thus a matter \n     for the United Nations Security Council. China must not be \n     allowed to close Taiwan's harbors, as it will bring the \n     island's economy to its knees.\n       The missiles are just the beginning. Leading up to Taiwan's \n     first-ever free presidential election, on March 23, China \n     will conduct the largest military maneuvers in its history. \n     More than 150,000 troops have been mobilized. The exercises \n     will involve mock bombing runs, simulated naval blockades and \n     amphibious assaults on islands north of Taiwan.\n       The exercises may be an attempt to provoke a military \n     response from Taiwan, which Beijing could then use as a \n     pretext for ``retaliation.'' Clearly the exercises are \n     intended to intimidate the Taiwanese electorate and to quell \n     the rising sentiment for autonomy and independence.\n       Most China analysts are confident that the exercises will \n     cease soon after the elections.\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n     Taiwanese diplomats are already putting out the word that \n     Taiwan's President, Lee Teng-hui, who is almost certain to be \n     re-elected, will call for a truce and seek to establish \n     direct trade, shipping and air services.\n       But for China the essence of the problem is Taiwan's quest \n     for international recognition. It is likely to continue its \n     military harassment until Taipei officially abandons its \n     aspirations for statehood. But Mr. Lee is unlikely to do so, \n     giving the United States a stark choice between supporting \n     the forces of freedom and self-determination on the island or \n     those of suppression and belligerence on the mainland.\n       This is a choice America needs to avoid. By standing firm \n     against Beijing and counseling Taipei to be cautious, America \n     may be able to bring both sides to the negotiating table.\n       Given China's current hypernationalistic atmosphere and the \n     struggle to succeed Deng Xiaoping, it is doubtful that it \n     will show restraint on Taiwan if left unchecked. It is up to \n     the United States, with the support of its Asian and European \n     partners, to deter China's aggression. The alternative is \n     escalating tension and possibly war over Taiwan.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1990-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SP4C MICHAEL FITZMAURICE--VIETNAM VETERAN FROM SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today \nto Michael Fitzmaurice, a South Dakotan and fellow Vietnam veteran who \nwent far beyond the call of duty during his service for our country. \nMichael is a native of Cavour, SD, and served as an Army specialist \n[SPC] 4th Class. Michael's singular accomplishment in Vietnam came when \nhe singlehandedly saved the lives of three of his fellow soldiers. \nThese reminders of his heroism couldn't be more appropriately timed \ngiven the presence of our brave troops currently stationed in and \naround Bosnia. Recently, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader and the Hartford \nArea News published articles about Michael.\n  Leaping onto a grenade and saving the lives of three soldiers; \ntossing two live grenades back at the enemy; charging North Vietnamese \ntroops--weaponless in the midst of combat--these are all accounts of \nSPC Michael Fitzmaurice's courage during battle. Michael's actions fill \nme with a sense of respect and pride. Americans can rest easy knowing \nmen and women such as Specialist Fitzmaurice defend the values for \nwhich our country stands. I commend Specialist Fitzmaurice's example of \ncommitment and bravery. He is truly a worthy recipient of the \nprestigious Congressional Medal of Honor for bravery.\n  Mr. President, part of what makes a soldier fight to the finish lies \nin the sense of dignity and respect for humanity our parents and \ncommunities instill within us. Having grown up not far from Specialist \nFitzmaurice, I can vouch for the family-oriented atmosphere in which we \nwere raised. The Golden Rule was not just an adage, but words by which \nwe were taught to live by each and every day. Michael's heroic actions \nwere premised by years of being taught respect for one's country, \ncommunity, and fellow man.\n  Courage. Bravery. Selflessness. These are the things of which heroes \nlike SPC Michael Fitzmaurice are made. I would like to extend my \ndeepest gratitude for the example set by Michael and the thousands of \nbrave men and women who similarly have fought or even died so that \nothers might experience freedom. Time and again, people like Michael \nFitzmaurice demonstrate to us the interminable vigor of the human \nspirit. Mr. President, I ask that articles which recently appeared in \nthe Sioux Falls Argus Leader and the Hartford Area News, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                 Hartford Man To Be Honored for Heroism\n\n       Pierre.--Michael John Fitzmaurice of Hartford will receive \n     a unique honor later this year for heroism while serving in \n     Vietnam 25 years ago.\n       Legislation providing the Hartford man with the state's \n     only set of Congressional Medal of Honor license plates is \n     nearing the end of its Statehouse journey.\n       The bill was approved 66-1 Tuesday in the House; it had \n     cleared the Senate earlier but must be returned there because \n     of changes made by the House.\n       Fitzmaurice received the Medal of Honor for bravery in \n     1971. When three North Vietnamese hand grenades were lobbed \n     into the bunker where Fitzmaurice and four fellow soldiers \n     hid, he pitched two of them out and dropped on the third one.\n       ``He absorbed the blast, shielded his fellow soldiers,'' \n     said Rep. Hal Wick, R-Sioux Falls, ``and although suffering \n     from serious multiple wounds and partial loss of sight, he \n     charged out of the bunker, engaged the enemy until his rifle \n     was damaged by the blast of an enemy hand grenade, and then \n     while in search of another weapon, encountered an enemy in \n     hand-to-hand combat.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                          Medal of Honor Hero\n\n                             (By Pat Smith)\n\n       Michael Fitzmaurice is South Dakota's only resident \n     Congressional Medal of Honor Hero. He lives quietly on Second \n     Street and you will find him at church on Sunday, perhaps a \n     basketball or volleyball game on Friday. He helps with \n     softball, Jamboree Days, kids games, the parade (of which he \n     was marshal this year) and many other activities in our town. \n     A quiet man with a loving spirit. Overwhelmed by the fact \n     that he received the Medal of Honor and will tell you that he \n     was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . . . but he \n     was doing the right thing.\n       This quiet man will be honored by the South Dakota \n     Legislature with a distinctive license plate. Senate Bill #98 \n     has passed the Senate and House and will be sent for the \n     governor's signature this week.\n       Michael received his Congressional Medal of Honor the same \n     day as Leo Thorsness at the White House from then president, \n     Richard Nixon in 1973. He received it for saving the lives of \n     his comrades during a battle in Vietnam. He threw two enemy \n     hands grenades up in the air and fell on the remaining one to \n     save their lives. The results were eye damage, shrapnel \n     wounds and broken ear drums, but saved lives.\n       This is a story like something you might see on television. \n     A real life hero living in a small town, going about his \n     life, volunteering to serve his country, saving lives, then \n     going back to living his life in a small town again. And the \n     reason this is such a great story is, although Michael \n     Fitzmaurice is a Congressional Medal of Honor hero, he puts \n     on no airs. He is a hero going to work each day, helping put \n     up and take down chairs at meetings, supporting his town, \n     school and church and just being a friend and neighbor. If \n     the media didn't bring it up, you would never know. Maybe \n     that is what a real hero is . . . doing what must be done and \n     then just going on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1991-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1991-S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INDICTING CHINA'S TERRORISM\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, A.M. Rosenthal has a thoughtful \ncolumn on the situation regarding China in the New York Times, and I \nask that it be printed in the Record.\n  I am not as certain as he is that the case should be brought to the \nUnited Nations because I'm not sure what the other countries would do. \nBut at the very least, that possibility should be explored.\n  A firmness is needed in this present situation. The Rosenthal column, \namong other things, cites a sentence from the recent State Department \nhuman rights report: ``The experience of China in the past few years \ndemonstrates that while economic growth, trade and social mobility \ncreate an improved standard of living they cannot by themselves bring \nabout greater respect for human rights in the absence of a willingness \nby political authorities to abide by the fundamental international \nnorms.''\n  There are times when the international situation demands clear-cut \npolicies. This is one of them.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 12, 1996]\n\n   Indicting China's Terrorism--Bring the Case to the United Nations\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal]\n\n       By firing missiles into the waters off Taiwan, Communist \n     China is committing open, deliberate international terrorism \n     of enormous danger.\n       Americans count on Beijing's survival instincts to stop the \n     terrorism short of the disaster of war with the U.S. That may \n     happen--this time.\n       But every day that Washington fails to bring the missile \n     blackmail and blockade of Taiwan before the U.N. increases \n     the chances it will happen again, or something worse, until \n     the disaster does take place.\n       The Communists' rage and fear at the example of Taiwan's \n     democracy off their shores will not let them rest unless the \n     Taiwanese give it up.\n       That is not likely. If any pro-democracy majority is \n     elected in the March 20 voting, before long there will be \n     another round of terrorism.\n       That may include some Chinese military landings on Taiwan. \n     U.S. vessels will have to move in to live up to American word \n     and legislation that the Taiwan-China relationship will not \n     be changed by force.\n       So far, the U.S. has had to act alone. The Japanese do not \n     have the political courage to make any strong public protest \n     against the terrorism. I have not heard our European allies \n     warn the Chinese that if it comes to it, they will \n     immediately line up with the U.S.\n       U.S. failure to bring the Chinese before the U.N. will \n     destroy a basic purpose of the U.N. The U.N. was not created \n     simply to end wars but to stop them before they begin. \n     Article 34 of its charter authorizes the Security Council to \n     take up any matter that might lead to ``international \n     friction or dispute.''\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\n       Any member of the U.N.--or the Secretary General--can bring \n     a threat to the peace before the Council. China's veto power \n     cannot be used to prevent putting a threat to peace on the \n     Council agenda.\n       Separately, the U.S. and any country that considers itself \n     a friend both of peace and America can condemn Chinese \n     terrorism. Together they can present a resolution speaking \n     for the U.N.\n       China will veto that. But if Beijing is so out of control \n     as to threaten more terrorism in the face of a U.N. \n     condemnation prevented only by a veto, we should know it as \n     soon as possible.\n       Meantime, President Clinton should consider one sentence \n     that tells how his Administration got to this point.\n       ``The experience of China in the past few years \n     demonstrates that while economic growth, trade and social \n     mobility create an improved standard of living they cannot by \n     themselves bring about greater respect for human rights in \n     the absence of a willingness by political authorities to \n     abide by the fundamental international norms.''\n       The sentence in itself is not remarkable. It sums up the \n     message of human rights victims around the world: \n     strengthening our oppressors empowers them to torture us \n     further. But it comes from the latest report on human rights \n     of the State Department. It took courage by those officials \n     who wrote or agreed to it.\n       Since 1993, the Administration has based its China policy \n     on a contrary vision of morality and history. It insisted \n     that economic growth in China would create a willingness by \n     the dictatorship to live up to those ``fundamental \n     international norms.'' Beijing would give Chinese more human \n     rights. It would stick to agreements against selling nuclear \n     weapon technology. It would allow the people of territories \n     it claims as its own, such as Tibet and Taiwan, to live in \n     peace and dignity.\n       China's economy certainly has grown, stimulated nicely by \n     $40 billion more that it sells to America than it buys from \n     America.\n       So: Torture and political repression have increased. And so \n     have oppression of religion, and forced abortion. The choke-\n     leash around Tibet tightens. The chief economic beneficiary \n     of the trade that led to economic growth has been the \n     Communist army, which owns vast parts of the economy, \n     including the forced-labor camps.\n       The new, richer China has sold nuclear technology to \n     Pakistan and has become the missile salesman to the world's \n     dictatorships.\n       President Clinton promised to struggle for human rights in \n     China. He did not.\n       Now his China policy lies adrift in the Strait of Taiwan. \n     He owes us a new one. Its moral principle and historic \n     reality were written for him by the meaning of that sentence \n     in the State Department report: enrichment of dictators \n     enchains their victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1991-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS TO COMBAT INTERNATIONAL BRIBERY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, most of us believe that a key \nfactor in America's economic growth will be an increase of U.S. exports \noverseas, and accordingly, we have concentrated our efforts on \novercoming obstacles which U.S. businesses face overseas. One of the \nreal problems which has not received enough attention, though, is \nbribery and corruption.\n  Bribery as a way of doing business is widespread. But it is \ninefficient: it skews international markets, it discriminates against \nthe honest, and it taints the overall image of a company. No one \nbenefits in the long-term from contracts based on bribery.\n  U.S. business is prohibited from engaging in bribery under the \nForeign Corrupt Practices Act [FCPA]. I am proud of this law, and \nbelieve that it promotes good business. But, in a perverse irony, our \nbusinesses are disadvantaged in the international marketplace because \nthey can't pay bribes. Some have suggested repealing the FCPA, which is \nvery short-sighted. Rather, a more constructive alternative is to work \nfor international acceptance of the principles of the FCPA. In light of \nthe corruption scandals that have rocked Taiwan, France, and NATO, to \nname a few, there are serious moves afoot on the national level as well \nas among the grassroots to do so.\n  This is a sensitive topic because it involves moral, financial, and \nintellectual concerns with, in many cases, our friends. But that \nsensitivity cannot deter us from addressing the subject seriously. U.S. \nbusinesses cannot afford their Government avoiding the issue.\n  For these reasons, I am very pleased that the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Mickey Kantor, has made the countering of bribery and \ncorruption a high priority in U.S. trade policy. Last week he gave an \nencouraging speech which identified bribery as the triple obstacle that \nit is: a barrier to U.S. exports; a burden to developed countries \nseeking to do business; and an obstacle to the establishment of sound \ngovernments in developing nations.\n  The full remarks of Ambassador Kantor are unfortunately too extensive \nto include in the Record, so alternatively, I ask to have printed in \nthe Record an editorial which appeared in Sunday's Washington Post \napplauding Ambassador Kantor's initiative, and encouraging the \nadministration to maintain the pressure.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 10, 1996]\n\n                           Trading on Bribes\n\n       Ever since 1977, when the United States barred U.S. \n     corporations from paying bribes overseas, U.S. executives \n     have complained that enforced honesty was costing them \n     business. European and Asian competitors were beating them \n     out all over the world--and then going home and deducting the \n     bribes from their taxes.\n       How much of this lost business was real, and how much \n     involved sour grapes, has never been clear. Some studies have \n     shown only marginal losses to U.S. business. Some U.S. firms \n     have found ways around the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as \n     the 1977 law is called, And many executives agree that the \n     act has also helped them at times, by giving them an excuse \n     not to pay costly bribes that might in any case bring small \n     or no returns.\n       Still, no one denies that the act can handicap U.S. firms. \n     And with trade now accounting for 30 percent of our total \n     economy and a sizable number of domestic jobs, any such \n     impediment has to be taken seriously.\n       U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor this week \n     identified bribery and corruption in overseas business as \n     significant and unfair barriers to trade. Rather than \n     softening the U.S. law, he said, Washington will now press \n     other nations to deal more honestly.\n       Fat chance, you may say. And of course corruption will \n     never be entirely uncoupled from international business, any \n     more than the influence of money can be entirely leached out \n     of politics.\n       But in two areas a full-court press would not be entirely \n     quixotic. The first is to press other developed countries to \n     play more by our rules. The Organization of Economic \n     Cooperation and Development, which includes the nations of \n     western Europe, North America and Japan, is moving toward \n     adoption of a policy barring tax-deductibility of overseas \n     bribes. That policy should be encouraged as a bare minimum, \n     with criminalization of bribery to follow.\n       The second goal is to persuade developing countries to \n     adopt fair rules for government procurement contracts in \n     telecommunications, energy and other, dollar-rich sectors. \n     The more open such processes are, the less opportunity is \n     provided for bribery.\n       Such a campaign would be as much in the interest of the \n     developing countries themselves as it would benefit U.S. \n     firms. Widespread corruption usually enriches a small elite \n     while discouraging foreign investment and impoverishing the \n     economy as a whole. Even many of our competitors would \n     welcome a clearer set of rules, if they knew everyone was \n     playing by the same ones.\n       Clinton administration officials have raised these issues \n     before. This time they should maintain the pressure. Pushing \n     for honest trade is not an unfair trade practice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1992-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1992-S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO STU CARMICHAEL ON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear friend \nand faithful staffer in my Portsmouth Congressional office --Stu \nCarmichael. Stu has worked for me since I first entered politics in \n1980, over 16 years ago. He is retiring next week and we will all miss \nhim dearly.\n  Stu Carmichael joined the Air Force in 1950 upon graduation from East \nProvidence High School in Rhode Island, and served for 4 years as a \nradio operator in the Korean war. Occasionally, he still proudly wears \nhis flight jacket into the office and asks the staff to take note of a \nspecial shiny pen in the left sleeve. He quickly yanks at this writing \nutensil and proceeds to show everyone how it was made to write upside \ndown. ``Something every astronaut cannot live without'' he always \nnotes.\n  We all know Stu for his delightful sense of humor and his wit. He \nimpresses everyone he meets with a new anecdote or joke that usually \nleaves his friends laughing long after he has gone. Many of my staff \ncan still recount some of his original stories and humorous incidents \nhe concocted. We love him for that. That is Stu's legacy--one we will \nfondly remember for years to come.\n  When Stu graduated in 1958 from the University of Rhode Island with a \nbachelor's degree in business, he quickly went on to pursue an \nextensive career in the benefit management business. Several actuarial \nfirms sent him all over the country and he ended up on\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nthe west coast. In 1980, he returned to New England and purchased the \nKingston Country Store in Kingston, NH. It was there in 1980, that I \nmet Stu and we began to talk about politics. In fact, it was Stu \nCarmichael and his good friends, Louis and Lois Beaulieu and other \nearly supporters, who encouraged me to run for Congress in 1980. That \nyear, Stu served as my first finance manager. As our mutual friend, \nLois Beaulieu, remembers, ``Stu was a motivator, hard worker and loyal \nto Senator Smith. He has been with Bob Smith through the worst and the \nbest. Our motto during that first campaign was `Fake it until we make \nit' and with many thanks to Stu, our loyal grassroots people and the \nGood Lord, we made it.''\n  In 1985, after I was elected on my third attempt, Stu joined my \ncongressional staff and has served me in a variety of capacities both \nwhen I was a Congressman and now as a Senator.\n  Over the years, Stu has also unselfishly served the people of New \nHampshire by helping countless veterans with their benefits and working \non a variety of other cases for constituents who need assistance \ncutting through Government bureacracy. He also was instrumental in \nestablishing a veterans cemetery in Boscawen, NH.\n  I am truly indebted to such a hard working and admirable friend. Stu \nhelped me with my start in politics, and stayed with me all these years \nuntil his retirement. Every Senator wishes for commitment like this and \nI am sorry to see him go.\n  The Granite State will feel a void with Stu's absence. New \nHampshire's loss is South Carolina's gain. In fact, if Stu wanted to \nstart another career, he could always work for Strom Thurmond for \nanother 20 years.\n  Our Portsmouth, NH, staff, his other fellow coworkers, and the \ncitizens of New Hampshire whom Stu has helped will miss this character \nwe have come to love. My sincere appreciation to you Stu, for all the \nyears of friendship and for your service to the people of New \nHampshire, especially your fellow veterans.\n  As a dedicated father, husband and grandfather, Stu Carmichael will \nnow have plenty of time to spend with his family and grandchildren. He \nand his wonderful wife, Priscilla, have carefully built a special new \nhome in Pickens, SC and plan to enjoy their retirement there. As an \navid golfer, Stu will undoubtedly be a consant sight on the golf \ncourses he has yet to discover in South Carolina.\n  And Stu, remember, ``Golf is a love affair; if you don't take it \nseriously its no fun; if you do take it seriously it breaks your \nheart.''\n  May all your putts be swift, stable, and accurate, and may all the \ngreens rise to meet you whether you are in New Hampshire or in South \nCarolina.\n  Stu, you are one of the very best and I wish you every happiness as \nyou embrace retirement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1992-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SALUTING IDAHO'S NATIONAL CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to offer my \ncongratulations to Coach Marty Holly and his Albertson College of Idaho \nbasketball team.\n  Last night, the Coyotes won the National Association of \nIntercollegiate Athletics Division II men s national basketball \nchampionship. The 'Yotes beat Whitworth College in a thrilling overtime \ngame, 81-72.\n  Albertson College of Idaho was founded in Caldwell in 1891 as the \nCollege of Idaho and is the State's oldest 4-year institution of higher \nlearning. Six hundred students attend the private liberal arts college. \nThe school has been recognized by U.S. News and World Report as one of \nthe best small colleges in the country.\n  Mr. President, this victory is more than the school's first national \ntitle. It is a testament to the outstanding talents of head coach and \nathletic director Marty Holly. In his 15 years as coach at Albertson \nCollege, Marty Holly has compiled a record of 345 wins and only 113 \nlosses, for a winning percentage of 75 percent. For all his success, \nthis year may have been his best.\n  Everyone expected the 'Yotes to be good this year. They were highly \nranked in the polls all season. Expectations were high. And as my \ncolleagues know, when expectations are high, the pressure to meet those \nexpectations is great. So Marty and his team were under a tremendous \namount of pressure to win it all. Despite that pressure, Albertson \nCollege turned out its best season in school history. They finished 31-\n3, the best winning percentage in school history. They won a record 12 \ngames in a row. All this while maintaining their high standards in the \nclassroom.\n  Last night's game was a classic. Albertson trailed by 3 at halftime \nbefore tournament Most Valuable Player Damon Archibald got hot. He \nscored 23 of his game-high 29 points after intermission, including 15 \nin an 8-minute stretch in the second half.\n  Still, to their credit, Whitworth fought back and forced the game to \novertime. There, the Coyotes took over and seized the victory. After \nthe game Coach Holly said every player ``stepped it up.'' They did \nindeed.\n  Jimmy Kolyszko and Jared Klassen joined Archibald on the all-\ntournament team, and each did step it up in the title game.

Mr. President, two items I have read on Burundi recently \nsuggest that continued interest and support for peacemaking endeavors \nand positive solutions really can be of help.\n  The one is an article in the New York Times by two distinguished \nAmericans, former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and David Hamburg, who \nheads the Carnegie Foundation. They co-chair the Carnegie Commission on \nPreventing Deadly Conflict.\n  The other article, written by Jonathan Frerichs, appeared in the \nChristian Century.\n  Both articles, which I ask be printed in the Record, suggest that \nanarchy and needless death can be avoided if we pay attention to this \ntroubled land.\n  I urge my colleagues and their staffs to read these two articles.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                      Avoiding Anarchy in Burundi\n\n                (By Cyrus R. Vance and David A. Hamburg)\n\n       Washington.--A world grown accustomed to human disaster in \n     the face of diplomatic failure has more to hope for in the \n     coming days. Next Saturday, a meeting of African leaders in \n     Tunis, brokered by former President Jimmy Carter, will test \n     the proposition that breaking the cycle of mass violence in \n     Central Africa may at last be possible. They need the \n     international community's help.\n       Burundi is pivotal. The right mix of political pressures \n     can sustain the balance of power in a country on the brink of \n     repeating the slaughter that tore apart Rwanda. Maintaining \n     that balance could spare thousands of lives. It would also \n     reduce the risk of the United Nations being forced into \n     another crisis without the mandate, materials and money \n     needed to be effective.\n       Burundi's government, a coalition of moderate Tutsi and \n     Hutu leaders, is fragile. Tutsi extremists have recently \n     attempted to close down the capital, Bujumbura, with labor \n     strikes and blockades. Attacks by Hutu guerrillas in the \n     countryside raise fears of genocide among the Tutsi minority.\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\n       But there is some reason for hope. Moderate Tutsi and Hutu \n     leaders are committed to a national debate, open to all \n     political factions. The goal is to settle the terms of power-\n     sharing and guarantees for minority rights before any further \n     elections.\n       To reinforce this process we must be clear not only about \n     the differences between Burundi and Rwanda but also about who \n     must take primary responsibility for a peace plan.\n       Rwanda and Burundi are both poor, isolated countries. Their \n     colonizers' divide-and-rule policies left seemingly insoluble \n     conflict between the agrarian Hutu, who make up about 85 \n     percent of each country, and the Tutsi, who predominate in \n     business, government and the military.\n       The Belgians left the Tutsi elite in control of Burundi, \n     but gave way to the Hutu majority in Rwanda. Since then \n     demagogues in both countries have exploited ethnic fear and \n     pride.\n       This spiral of hate climaxed in 1994, when Hutu and Rwanda \n     shot or hacked to death at least 500,000 people, primarily \n     Tutsi. When Tutsi exiles from Uganda overthrew the Hutu \n     government, more than two million Hutu fled to nearby \n     countries, where 1.7 million remain.\n       In Burundi, the core question is whether the country's \n     citizens can avoid Rwanda's tragedy by devising a power-\n     sharing formula that offers enough security for the Tutsi to \n     open the way for majority democratic rule.\n       Outsiders can help in several ways. First, there must be \n     diplomatic efforts to persuade extremists in both ethnic \n     groups of the futility and dreadful consequences of violence. \n     Killings in Bujumbura rose to more than 100 a week, and \n     anarchy threatens. The United States and European governments \n     should impose an arms embargo, block international financial \n     transactions by Burundi's extremist leaders and threaten to \n     halt trade other than humanitarian relief.\n       Second, African leaders should be given help in securing a \n     power-sharing agreement in Bujumbura and the return of \n     refugees to both Burundi and Rwanda. In November, Mr. Carter \n     arranged a meeting of the Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda, \n     Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire. It is these talks that resume \n     next week.\n       Third, donor governments and the World Bank should draw up \n     a ``road map'' linking political progress in Burundi and the \n     other countries of Central Africa to the restoration of \n     development assistance.\n       For the moment, however, everything depends on reaching an \n     agreement to contain the cancer of ethnic conflict. What is \n     learned from this experience can help prevent mass violence \n     elsewhere.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Christian Century, March 6, 1996]\n\n                    Causes for Hope--Saving Burundi\n\n                         (By Jonathan Frerichs)\n\n       If we hear anything at all about Burundi, it is that this \n     small African country is Rwanda in slow motion. There is, \n     indeed, justification for seeing Burundi as a catastrophe in \n     the making. It has a vicious cycle of intergroup violence, \n     with militias pre-empting politics and crowds of refugees on \n     the move.\n       Approximately 800 people are dying there each month, \n     according to a United Nations estimate. Like its neighbor, \n     Rwanda, Burundi has a population of about 85 percent Hutu and \n     15 percent Tutsi. Tutsi militias operate with help from \n     Burundi's army, an army that has usually taken its orders \n     from ethnic leaders rather than from the moderate civilian \n     government. The actions of Hutu guerrillas puts the majority \n     population at risk of reprisal. The countryside, like the \n     capital, is increasingly balkanized. A fragile national \n     ``convention,'' an agreement on power-sharing, barely merits \n     being called a government.\n       Yet to equate Burundi with Rwanda is inaccurate and \n     dangerously self-defeating. In Burundi there is still scope \n     for remedial action, for taking steps largely untried in \n     Rwanda--as certain Burundian Christians and aid partners are \n     demonstrating. The balance of power, the course of events and \n     the rule of the churches in Burundi differ significantly from \n     those in Rwanda.\n       There is no ``final solution'' underway in Burundi, as \n     there was in Rwanda. Because they are a minority, Burundi's \n     Tutsi extremists cannot implicate a whole population in the \n     perpetration of genocide, as Rwanda's Hutu majority did in \n     1994. The 1.5 million Rwandans still encamped outside their \n     country today fled not genocide but fear of reprisal for the \n     slaughter they had allowed to happen in their name. In Rwanda \n     the majority Hutus had the arms. In Burundi most of the arms \n     are still in the hands of the minority Tutsis.\n       The Tutsi-dominated national army is searching for Hutu \n     insurgents and punishing the Hutu majority for allegedly \n     sheltering them. Tutsi militia with names like ``The \n     Undefeated'' and ``The Infallibles'' operate in the capital, \n     Bujumbura, and in the northern provinces. When these \n     extremists have targeted a community for a ``ville mort'' \n     (dead city) campaign, the army sometimes has stood by without \n     intervening or has even helped. These campaigns force Hutus \n     out of Tutsi areas.\n       The Hutu guerrillas opposing these tactics are not well \n     organized, according to aid workers in Bujumbura, but they \n     were strong enough to mount an attack on the capital in early \n     December. One day members of one community are killed, next \n     day members of the other. A rough balance of power and fear \n     prevails, a legacy of a century of national and colonial \n     political practices. As extremists within both ethnic groups \n     undermine the convention government, the army is forced to \n     choose between trying to re-establish Tutsi supremacy and \n     maintaining some version of the status quo. An incident in \n     January may indicate a shift in the army's position. When \n     Tutsi militia declared a ``ville mort'' in Bujumbura, \n     hoping to force out the Hutu president, the army actually \n     blocked the campaign in some quarters of the city. Since \n     then, the militia cannot count on army support, say aid \n     officials. Two Tutsi extremist leaders were actually \n     arrested recently. Some local observers suggest that the \n     army may merely want to improve its image abroad while \n     deflecting talk of international intervention. However, it \n     may also fear that militia politics will end in collective \n     suicide.\n       Burundi's government wants to do what is right for the \n     public at large, but it is not in control, according to \n     Susanne Riveles, Africa director of Lutheran World Relief. In \n     contrast, in early 1994 the Rwandan government was in control \n     but wanted to do the wrong thing. That there are moderates at \n     the highest levels of Burundi's government makes it possible \n     to keep humanitarian issues in focus.\n       A second cause for hope in Burundi is that its churches are \n     not swept up in the conflict, as happened in Rwanda. Some \n     church leaders are increasingly willing to oppose the \n     violence. But they need support. In Rwanda, certain religious \n     leaders were linked so closely to the government that, even \n     during the genocide, they did not dissociate themselves from \n     that government. Some even went abroad to engage in damage \n     control. When the old regime fell and fled, such people fled \n     with it--which eliminated all doubt about where they had \n     stood. Some are still not willing to return home. In \n     contrast, the bishops and archbishops of Burundi do not sit \n     on permanent councils of state.\n       ``In the last four or five months, there is a feeling among \n     the Protestant churches that they have to gather people \n     across ethnic lines to protest and to work together,'' says \n     Eliane Duthoit-Privat of Christian Aid in Bunumbura. Church \n     programs include humanitarian and peace initiatives. One \n     example is local peace committees of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa (who \n     constitute about 1 percent of the population). Citizens \n     gather to air grievances, clarify information and address the \n     kill-or-be-killed mentality. ``In these meetings, \n     participants can say: `I don't have to kill the person in \n     front of me so that he won't kill me,' '' notes Duthoit-\n     Privat.\n       Some of the groups are moving from words to deeds. Several \n     Tutsi and Hutu families may join hands to repair the damage \n     done by raiding militia or soldiers--rebuilding a house for a \n     vulnerable neighbor, for example, or a local dispensary. \n     These pioneering ``Discussion sur La Paix'' are led by local \n     Quakers with support from the Mennonite Central Committee. \n     Other Protestants are considering them as a model for \n     standing up to the spread of violence. Protestants number \n     about 15 percent of the population, and include Anglicans and \n     Pentecostals (the two largest non-Catholic groups), varieties \n     of Methodists, plus Baptists, Quakers and Kimbanguists (an \n     indigenous African body).\n       The Roman Catholic Church (84 percent of the population) is \n     also beginning to mobilize for national reconciliation, says \n     Annemarie Reilly, Burundi program director of Catholic Relief \n     Services. Drawing on the church's experience in Latin \n     America, it has brought people of different ethnic and \n     economic backgrounds together for work and worship. A pilot \n     phase has been completed in three dioceses and is ready to be \n     expanded across the country.\n       Some prominent churchpeople are risking their lives for \n     peace. University teacher Adrian Ntabona, who heads the \n     reconciliation project, strongly condemned a recent killing \n     before a student group that included members of the Tutsi \n     militia widely assumed to be responsible. In Babanza, the \n     northern province where foreign church and relief workers \n     have been withdrawn because of the violence, and where some \n     priests have been killed and others made virtual prisoners in \n     their own compounds, Catholic Bishop Evariste Ngoyagoye works \n     as a one-person relief agency and keeper of peace. Though \n     recently the archbishop of Gitega was ambushed and a priest \n     in his party was killed, the incident has not stopped the \n     archbishop from traveling in his region.\n       Churches are providing food and other supplies to people \n     forced to flee from their homes. The Burundian Council of \n     Churches purchases and distributes seeds, tools, soap and \n     non-food items, and the Episcopal Church brings food to camps \n     of displaced people. The Evangelical Friends Church, which \n     formed the peace committees, also runs mobile health clinics. \n     Christian Aid, a British agency, maintains a stockpile of \n     emergency supplies for 10,000 families. The agency is the \n     focus for an international, interchurch aid coalition called \n     ACT (Action by Churches Together). All church programs are \n     hobbled by restrictions on movement. In relatively secure \n     areas, ACT has plans for agricultural rehabilitation, the \n     rebuilding of houses and small income projects for women.\n       We can do much to help Burundi avert disaster. A colossal \n     sin of omission was committed against Rwanda. The cost of \n     preventing another disaster in Burundi is negligible compared \n     to the expense of a major emergency rescue operation. \n     ``Burundi needs our eyes and ears. It needs a solid, \n     multilateral\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n     outside presence,'' says Riveles. ``Burundi needs \n     international civilians inside the country, not foreign \n     troops at the border.\n       John Langan, S.J., argued in these pages (January 24) for a \n     new rule of intervention that would involve massive and early \n     deployment with a cautious use of force. The UN recently \n     discussed positioning a force in Zaire for possible Burundi \n     intervention. Massive and early civilian rather than military \n     deployment seems the best prescription for Burundi. Human \n     rights observers are urgently needed, as is strong support \n     for existing Burundian peace initiatives.\n       Another key area for international observers and personnel \n     is the judicial system. Riveles suggests that foreign aid and \n     human rights workers may be able to ``bring to bear insights \n     on truth-finding and reconciliation from the apartheid \n     experience and from the Holocaust.'' Through personal \n     diplomacy, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu has been making a \n     similar point. Now head of South Africa's Truth Commission, \n     he is also active in peace initiatives for the Great Lakes \n     region of Africa.\n       In Rwanda, extremist media propaganda was used to support \n     political and militia coercion. In Burundi, such propaganda \n     must be stopped--whether by international political pressure \n     or by jamming or other technical means. The UN Security \n     Council recently called on member states to identify and \n     dismantle any mobile stations operating outside Burundi that \n     broadcast Hutu extremist propaganda into the country.\n       To regard African countries like Burundi as hopeless or to \n     dismiss its problems as a case of unsolvable ``ethnic \n     conflict'' is to trap ourselves. Rather than debate past \n     holocausts, we can calculate how to stop a new round of \n     death.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1993-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1995-S1997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PORTUGAL'S NEW PRESIDENT\n\n Mr. PELL. Mr. President, this weekend, I had the honor of \nleading a congressional delegation to Lisbon for the inauguration of \nPortugal's new president. I was pleased to participate in this event \nmarking the passing of the torch from Mario Soares to Jorge Sampaio, \nwhich was a strong signal of Portugal's continued commitment to \ndemocracy.\n  The delegation's presence at the inauguration contributed to \ncontinued good relations between Portugal and the United States. \nPortuguese-United States relations remain solid. The new government, \nheaded by Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, has demonstrated his \ncontinued commitment to a strong United States-Portuguese relationship. \nThe new agreement on cooperation and defense providing for United \nStates access to the Lajes Base in the Azores and Portuguese-United \nStates cooperation in the implementation force in Bosnia are also \nimportant signs of the strong ties between our two countries.\n  President Sampaio delivered a truly inspirational inaugural speech in \nwhich he described a Portugal firmly rooted in Europe and committed to \na foreign policy that places a priority on good relations with \nPortuguese-speaking countries throughout the world. He paid tribute to \nhis predecessor Mario Soares as the symbol of the constant struggle for \nfreedom and democracy both at home and abroad. President Sampaio called \non the Portuguese people to work for a more cohesive Portugal, and \npledged to do his part to encourage consensus in Portuguese society. \nEver aware of Portugal's past political experiences, President Sampaio \nunderscored that he will respect the wishes of the Portuguese people \nand to exercise his constitutional powers with impartiality.\n  Mr. President, I commend President Sampaio's speech to my colleagues, \nand ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n       Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Heads of \n     State, Prime Ministers and High Representatives of Friendly \n     States and Peoples, Prime Minister, Members of the Government \n     and High Portuguese Authorities, His Eminence the Cardinal of \n     Lisbon, Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentleman:\n       After twenty years of democracy and a decade of European \n     integration, Portugal has completed a cycle in her \n     contemporary history. The democratic regime has been \n     consolidated. Accession to the European Community has proved \n     to be the right choice and has provided the country with \n     conditions for development and structural changes which would \n     otherwise have been impossible.\n       Such major conditions for Portugal's modernization may seem \n     obvious and even natural to the new generations coming of age \n     today. It is good that it should be so. However, it required \n     several generations to fight for Freedom and Democracy, \n     generations whose courage and determination gave the example \n     to be followed. The 25 of April Revolution, which I would \n     feelingly like to remember here, represents the end of a long \n     journey during which people paid for their dedication to the \n     cause of democracy with their freedom and their lives.\n       Being elected President of the Republic represents an \n     incomparable responsibility and honour in a politician's \n     life. Circumstances have contrived, however, to give me the \n     added pleasure of receiving the badge of office from that \n     outstanding figure of Portuguese democracy; the outgoing \n     President, Mario Soares.\n       Dr. Mario Soares is the symbol of the constant struggle for \n     Freedom and Democracy both at home and abroad. A struggle \n     which knew no vacillations or concessions.\n       The political cycle which coincidentally closes with the \n     end of his term of office will forever be linked to his name. \n     In the last decades no-one has marked Portuguese political \n     life so persistently and profoundly.\n       Today, as President of the Republic, I would like to say \n     how deeply grateful our country is to you, Dr. Mario Soares, \n     for a lifetime dedicated to seeking the best for Portugal and \n     the Portuguese.\n       Owing to the many areas in which you left your mark it is \n     difficult to sum up your life in one word. There is one word \n     however, which stands out above all others. You are a man of \n     Freedom. It was essential that my first gesture as President \n     should be to award you the Grand Collar of the Order of \n     Freedom, at another ceremony which will take place today.\n       Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic. I would like \n     to thank you most feelingly for the warm word you addressed \n     to me in your eloquent speech. This is the seat that \n     represents the sovereign will of the Portuguese people. I \n     know this house well, having survived intense years of \n     parliamentary activity here, believe me, Mr. President, the \n     Assembly of the Republic may always rely on the solidarity \n     and institutional cooperation of the President of the \n     Republic.\n       I would like to say how honoured I am by the presence today \n     at this inauguration of Heads of State, Prime Ministers and \n     high representatives of friendly countries. I would like to \n     welcome you all warmly and to thank you for your \n     distinguished presence at this ceremony.\n       Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen, the coming years are decisive for Portugal's \n     future. The country faces the challenge of ensuring important \n     modernization efforts without causing political and social \n     breaches which may undermine national cohesion.\n       Our national strategy must encompass the firmness of \n     Portugal's participation in the European Union, the \n     achievement of a sustained effort to modernize the productive \n     sections and constant attention to social policies.\n       I regard Portugal's future with confidence. We are a \n     quasimillenary country. We are possessed of a culture which, \n     century after century, has maintained its diversity and \n     richness. Our language was spread by the Portuguese ``to the \n     seven corners of the world'' and today is spoken by over two \n     hundred million.\n       It was our people's courage and determination that created \n     the wealth of our history, our culture and our language. It \n     is that courage that will always give me faith in the future.\n       I have acquired and developed a profound knowledge of the \n     Portuguese and this is without any doubt the heritage that I \n     most value in a political career which began more than thirty \n     five years ago.\n       I know that the Portuguese people will always be able to \n     find the energy and means required to guarantee Portugal's \n     future. I also know that this new political cycle goes hand \n     in hand with the Portuguese people's more demanding attitude \n     in their relationship with the political system, particularly \n     with the need for greater transparency and renewed capacity \n     to provide concrete answer to the expectations and concerns \n     in people's day-to-day lives.\n       The Portuguese know how I conceive the presidential \n     function. It is built on a concern to which I will pay the \n     greatest attention. In a world and a time increasingly \n     subject to massification, to violent desegregating tensions \n     and to the loss of the collective memory, the values of \n     identify must be reinforced. It is necessary to exercise a \n     magistrature that will defend, guarantee and strengthen \n     national cohesion.\n       I feel that there are factors nowadays in Portugal which \n     are affecting that cohesion. There are unequivocal signs that \n     social inequalities are on the increase. The profound \n     regional asymetries in national development and the phenomena \n     of minorities' exclusion and marginalization have accumulated \n     and increased to worrying levels. There is an increased loss \n     of solidarity between generations. The role of the family, \n     even its articulation with the educational system, require \n     profound thought.\n       One of the indications of the loss of national cohesion is \n     the growing signs of insecurity, increased factors of \n     discord, accumulated inter-regional tensions, intolerance and \n     intransigence that I see with concern to evolve.\n       The strengthening of national cohesion requires far-\n     reaching reforms both to achieve policies of decentralization \n     and to adjust educational and social policies. Also both to \n     restore citizens' trust in the political system and to \n     guarantee the effectiveness of the State's role.\n       The strengthening of national cohesion signifies that a \n     solution must be found to\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\n     strengthen municipal and local institutions as well as \n     organized forms of society representation. In the search for \n     that solution the unity of the State must never be \n     questioned.\n       However, the strengthening of national cohesion also means \n     finding an institutionally stable solution of consensus for \n     the problem of formulating the Continent's political and \n     administrative decentralization. This problem has been \n     awaiting a solution for far too long.\n       I would like to welcome the organs of the autonomous \n     Regions and give them my assurance that I will cooperate with \n     them wholeheartedly. The regional autonomies were decisive in \n     transforming the lives of the populations of the Azores and \n     Madeira archipelagos. The model of regional autonomy has \n     given proof of its legitimacy and all our efforts must be to \n     ensure its improvement and consolidation.\n       National cohesion also depends on how we respect our \n     acquired social rights, guaranteeing some level of security \n     for families; and their expectations for retirement, \n     particularly for the underprivileged, outcast and jeopardized \n     by a process of modernization which is often pursued with \n     total disregard for the values of solidarity.\n       As President of the Republic I will do all I can to \n     encourage the consensuses in Portuguese society. Only these \n     that can pave the way for a new strategic concentration, able \n     to meet the demands of national cohesion at a time of \n     accelerated change and accelerated national mobilization.\n       The mandate I received from the Portuguese people is very \n     clear. The President of the Republic must be a guarantor of \n     political and institutional stability and perform his office \n     in such a way as to ensure institutional balances.\n       I am, of course, aware that it is my duty to respect the \n     democratically expressed wish of the Portuguese and to see \n     that it is respected. Just as I will also faithfully respect \n     the spheres of competence of the other organs of sovereignty. \n     I shall commit myself to create the required conditions to \n     ensure that Parliament and the Government carry out their \n     duties and fulfill their mandates. Loyalty and institutional \n     cooperation by contributing to political stability will also \n     play a decisive role in allowing the Portuguese to see \n     themselves mirrored in the institutions of the Republic.\n       The Government led by Mr. Antonio Guterras, which emerged \n     from elections which gave it the unequivocal vote of the \n     Portuguese people, can naturally rely on my institutional \n     cooperation.\n       I will exercise my constitutional powers with impartiality. \n     It is incumbent upon me to work with all majorities and all \n     legitimate governments.\n       The principle of institutional cooperation cannot be \n     synonymous with unanimity. Normal functioning of the \n     political institutions demands that all of us: President, \n     Assembly and Government, must exercise their powers with \n     rigour, and respect the manifestation of reciprocal \n     competences.\n       I will remain constant to the form of my institutional \n     cooperation with the government. I will also be firm in the \n     exercise of the powers vested in me by the Constitution.\n       With the Assembly of the Republic, the centre ``par \n     excellence'' of national democratic life, I will uphold a \n     relationship of respect and solidarity and will maintain a \n     constant dialogue with all parties. The opposition will have \n     in me an attentive observer, responsive to the protection of \n     its important constitutional rights as a means of preserving \n     conditions in which the democratic alternatives can freely be \n     chosen.\n       I would like here to greet the Portuguese Armed Forces, the \n     guarantor of national defence and security, whose \n     institutional loyalty was decisive in consolidating the \n     democratic regime which emerged after the 25 of April \n     revolution.\n       On becoming, by reason of office, the Supreme Commander of \n     the Armed Forces I would like to reiterate my total \n     commitment to the success of the peace mission in Bosnia and \n     Hercegovina, on which the stability of Europe at the end of \n     the millennium partly depends.\n       Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Ladies and \n     Gentlemen, the essence of Portugal's destiny is played out in \n     Europe. This, today, is an incontrovertible factor of the \n     country's international position. It is not moved by \n     apprehensive and defensive policies but rather counsels firm \n     political policies upheld by the clear determination of our \n     national interests.\n       Both the difficulties of recent years and the demands of \n     this new phase of European construction require the \n     reinforcement of suitable internal consensuses which can \n     withstand the permanent demands of the Portuguese strategy \n     for Europe.\n       That strategy can no longer be based on secretiveness and \n     the ``fait accompli'', factors which undermined previous \n     consensuses. Today it will invariably have to depend on, \n     transparent policy about the options to be made and their \n     requirements. Today it will have to be based on the enlarged \n     participation of the social and political forces and on the \n     citizens' opinion. Only thus will the Portuguese understand \n     that the European Union is a community of sovereign states, \n     from which we cannot, therefore, just merely wish to reap \n     benefits without having to share responsibilities.\n       The challenges facing the European Union at the turn of the \n     century--the intensification of economic integration within a \n     framework of international cohesion, and the expansion of the \n     Union's borders to embrace the new European democracies--\n     present challenges for Portugal. The answer to these \n     challenges lies not in hesitation but in the identification \n     of pre-eminent objectives for the establishment of national \n     consensuses and for a firm, determined Portuguese foreign \n     policy.\n       A strong, united Europe will be a Europe which is open to \n     the outside world, ready to guarantee a framework of regional \n     stability. This condition is important for the continuance of \n     the transatlantic community, namely the alliance between the \n     United States and Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization continues to be the cornerstone of our security, \n     although present circumstances demand the emphatic \n     development of the European pillar as sign of the European \n     allies' real capacity to assume added responsibilities in \n     collective defence.\n       Naturally, the relations with Portuguese-speaking countries \n     have a special position in our foreign policy. Those \n     relations represent a link with our own extensive history \n     which is shared with the peoples of Angola, Brazil, Cape \n     Verde, Guinea. Mozambique, Sao Tome and Principe and of \n     course with the people of East Timor. The language, the rich \n     variety of cultures expressed in that same language, history \n     and the effective solidarity between the peoples of these \n     seven states and of the territory of East Timor make it \n     necessary to form a Community of Portuguese-Speaking States \n     and Peoples. I shall dedicate great attention to this \n     project.\n       Unfortunately, East Timor will not be able to take part in \n     this project as a free and self determined State.\n       Portugal has an unalienable historical responsibility \n     towards East Timor and the Timorese community. As the \n     territory's administrating power Portugal has a clear \n     political duty vis-a-vis the international community: it must \n     guarantee the completion of the decolonization process \n     through a free and democratic referendum supervised by the \n     United Nations in which the Timorese may, with dignity, \n     exercise their right to self-determination. To fulfill this \n     objective the competent organs of sovereignty must always \n     seek the ways and means which are best suited to the \n     evolution of international circumstances.\n       Portugal must continue to fight for the cause of East Timor \n     in all international fora and to support the efforts of the \n     UN Secretary-General in fulfilling his mandate, seeking a \n     just and internationally accepted solution for the question \n     of East Timor, with the participation of all the interested \n     parties.\n       National commitment to this issue is, in fact, provided in \n     consonance with an essential reference value of the \n     Portuguese state's foreign actions: the defence of peoples \n     freedom peoples and the defence of human rights.\n       The President of the Republic has particular \n     responsibilities with Macao, I believe that there must be \n     close agreement with the Government both for the \n     administration of the territory and the framework of our \n     relations with the People's Republic of China.\n       The Portuguese policy is very clear: guarantee the \n     stability and prosperity of the territory of Macao as well as \n     the protection of the rights and interests of its \n     inhabitants, never forgetting that Portugal has an \n     unalienable responsibility to protect the rights of all \n     Portuguese citizens in Macao.\n       Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Ladies and \n     Gentleman, the modern evolution of societies and political \n     systems implies a new perception of relations between the \n     citizen and the political power. This relation must be based \n     on information and on the proximity of the political \n     decision, implying new forms for citizens' democratic \n     participation and the enlargement of their rights.\n       Unless such new demands are incorporated within the \n     political system it will not be possible to adapt \n     representative democracy to the complexity of social \n     relations at the end of the millennium.\n       The tendency in modern societies is to develop a culture of \n     civic intervention and of salutary intransigence when \n     protecting the citizen's legitimate rights in relation to the \n     state.\n       The pressure on the Portuguese political system is already \n     great, due to the fact that a persistent centralizing policy \n     has postponed the natural development of institutional \n     reforms to decentralize power.\n       Guaranteeing the stability of democracy signifies a \n     constant commitment to defend the prestige of the \n     representative institutions and the citizens' political \n     participation. I have and assume the obligation to encourage \n     a culture of democratic demand. But I also believe that it is \n     essential to ensure respect for the rule of law and the \n     defence of the prestige of the institutions which define and \n     apply such rule of law, as a means to guarantee the trust \n     citizens place in the institutions of the Republic. The \n     respect for the state of law is a fundamental basis of the \n     democratic regime. On this there can be no compromise.\n       As President I will be close to the people. This intention \n     will be the mark of my term of office. I will listen \n     carefully to the Portuguese. To all Portuguese. I will be \n     particularly attentive, however, to those who are excluded \n     from the system and policies and who, because of the way in \n     which the modernization process in this country has occurred, \n     have been relegated to the statute of expendability. There \n     are no expendable Portuguese. The very idea is intolerable.\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\n       I will pay particular attention to the problems of \n     Portuguese families. I am aware of the multiple issues \n     affecting them and cannot fail here to express my concern \n     with all forms of family violence--in which women and \n     children are the principal victims. Within the competencies \n     of my office I will support all efforts which contribute to \n     finding ways for parents to invest increasingly in their \n     children's education as well as to conciliate mothers' and \n     fathers' careers with family life, for I am fully aware of \n     the growing importance of affectivity in the construction of \n     our individual lives.\n       Solidarity must be a fundamental value of Portuguese \n     society. It must be present during the formulation of the \n     policies of modernization, employment and the reform of \n     social security. It is the only way to modernize the country \n     whilst maintaining national cohesion and the sense of sharing \n     a collective future. The most worrying expression of the loss \n     of solidarity is the evolution in recent years of increasing \n     signs of political, social and even religious intolerance.\n       Portugal, which is a cohesive country with no ethnic, \n     regional, linguistic or religious issues, must know how to \n     preserve this unique asset without which (as we have seen in \n     many countries) everything would be at peril: civic peace, \n     progress, solidarity, prestige and our position before the \n     world. The Portuguese are well aware of this fact.\n       A strong patriotism conspicuously based on democratic \n     values, culturally enlightened and civically assumed, is the \n     best protection we have against aggressive nationalism, \n     xenophobia and racism and is also the most efficient reply to \n     insecurity and fear of the future.\n       I would like here and now to express with great fervour how \n     proud I am to be Portuguese and to declare my love for \n     Portugal which I want to serve with all my capabilities, \n     honouring the mandate I have received from the Portuguese.\n       Our culture, which is both rich and varied in its popular \n     and erudite forms and so strong in its characteristic traits, \n     is the manifestation of a great People (accessible to others, \n     to the universe, to all that is new, to the unknown) and of a \n     nation that for five centuries united the human species and \n     globalized communication; a nation which, although small, was \n     able to travel to the ends of the seas and the Earth, where \n     it left its marks, the greatest of which is the language and \n     the memories which endure, and of which we constantly receive \n     grateful signs.\n       Today I would like to encourage the Portuguese--and \n     particularly the young Portuguese--to study and become \n     acquainted with our history, our culture, our heritage, both \n     natural and created, our geography, the roots and foundations \n     of our identity. We must provide our new generations with an \n     exigent education which will prepare them to face the \n     challenges of the open market. But we must also provide them \n     with prospects for the future, with opportunities, with the \n     capacity to look hopefully to the start of their professional \n     and family life. Without all this it will be difficult to \n     solve many of the problems which affect young people in \n     Portugal today.\n       It is by strengthening our identity that we can procure the \n     energy and the trust to set off boldly on the adventure of \n     the future, fearless and with audacity, in the firm \n     conviction that we were great whenever we put aside the \n     small-minded, petty issues which divide and diminish us. We \n     performed great feats and took our place as a People and a \n     Nation whenever we were able to unite and concentrate on the \n     essentials, opening up to modernity, to the values of freedom \n     and universalism, practising a culture of tolerance towards \n     and curiosity for all that was different, in a way, which is \n     peculiar to us, of affection and human closeness.\n       It is a lesson for our times. Now, more than ever, they \n     must assume such values. That is precisely why this is the \n     unique contribution we can give to the construction of a \n     Europe of solidarity and citizenship, to the edification of a \n     World of peace and liberty.\n       When I stood for office I stated unequivocally: there are \n     no presidential majorities. I will be President of all the \n     Portuguese. Of all, without exception.\n       Long live Portugal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1997-S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       S. 1494, HOUSING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM EXTENSION ACT OF 1995\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate for passing S. \n1494, the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1995. I also \nwant to thank my cosponsors, including Senators D'Amato, Mack, and \nSarbanes. This legislation provides critical authority for a number of \ncommunity development and affordable housing programs and activities \nwhich are strongly supported by the American public. This bill also is \nan important step in reforming HUD's housing and community development \nprograms, and is consistent with a number of significant reforms which \nwere initiated in the VA/HUD fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill, \nwhich was vetoed by the President.\n  Most importantly, this legislation adopts the reformed low-income \nhousing preservation program which was contained in the VA/HUD fiscal \nyear 1996 appropriations bill vetoed by the President. There are \napproximately 75,000 to 100,000 low-income units in the preservation \npipeline that are eligible for prepayment but also remain eligible \ncandidates for preservation funding. These units have been in the \npreservation processing pipeline for some time, often years, and \ninclude a mix between equity take-out deals for owners which are \nfinanced through long-term section 8 assistance, and the financing of \npurchases by tenant groups and nonprofits. This reform would replace \nthe existing preservation program, with its long-term dependence on \nexpensive project-based section 8 assistance, with a capital loan--or \ncapital grant in the case of purchasers, that ensures low-income use at \nthe minimum cost to the Federal Government.\n  S. 1494 also would provide clear statutory guidance to empower PHA's \nand assisted property owners with the tools to screen out and evict \nfrom public and assisted housing persons who illegally use drugs or \nwhose abuse of alcohol is a risk to other tenants. I cannot emphasize \nenough the need to take responsible and meaningful action to preserve \nour low-income housing from criminal and destructive activities.\n  In addition, this legislation addresses the problem of mixed housing \nwhere the elderly and the disabled, including persons with drug and \nalcohol disabilities, are warehoused in the same public housing \nprojects. This does not work, and I am particularly troubled by some \nhorror stories I have heard where elderly tenants have been harassed \nand frightened by young tenants with significant drug abuse problems. \nThis provision would provide PHA's with clear authority to establish \nelderly- and disabled-only housing.\n  Moreover, S. 1494 would extend a number of other key housing programs \nwhich need affirmative legislation to operate: permit the renewal of \nexpiring section 8 moderate rehabilitation contracts; permit CDBG \nhomeownership assistance; extend the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage \n[HECM] Program; extend the FHA multifamily mortgage risk-sharing \nprograms; and reauthorize the National Cities in School Program and the \nNational Community Development initiative.\n  This bill also would establish a new loan guarantee program for rural \nmultifamily housing which terminates after 1 year and is supported by a \n$1-million credit subsidy under the Agriculture fiscal year 1996 \nappropriation bill, as enacted. This program is needed in rural areas \nwhere there is a critical need to develop affordable low-income rental \nhousing.\n  Finally, the legislation would establish a new Habitat for Humanity \ninitiative. Habitat for Humanity is one of the best models in this \ncountry for the development of affordable low-income housing through \nsweat equity. Since 1976, Habitat has constructed over 40,000 homes \nworldwide, in every U.S. State and in 45 other countries. As a \nconsequence, some 250,000 people are living in decent, safe, and \naffordable housing.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is bipartisan, simple, \nstraightforward and necessary. I look forward to this measure becoming \nlaw.\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nS. 1494, the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996. Mr. \nPresident, this bill is important to the country and particularly \nimportant to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I thank the other \nMembers of the Senate for their support of this legislation.\n  S. 1494 extends several housing authorizations that expired at the \nend of the last fiscal year. Among these are the Community Development \nBlock Grant direct homeownership assistance provisions which have \nproven useful to the city of Boston and other communities in my home \nState, and the Federal Housing Administration's multifamily risk-\nsharing program in which the Massachusetts State Housing Finance Agency \nis an important participant. The bill also extends the Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage Program, that provides elderly homeowners with the \nability to use the equity in their home without having to sell the \nhouse. This bill also extends the section 515 rural rental housing \nprogram and two important set-asides within the program--a set-aside \nfor nonprofit developers and a set-aside for underserved\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nareas. Mr. President, the section 515 program is one of the few Federal \nhousing programs providing much needed affordable housing assistance in \nrural areas.\n  The passage of this bill also sends to the President provisions from \nan amendment that I cosponsored with Senator Grams in the Banking \nCommittee. This amendment would limit access to public housing by drug \nabusers and alcohol abusers. We need to make sure that our federally \nassisted housing provides a decent, safe, and peaceful living \nenvironment for its residents. The final version of this bill addresses \none of my principal concerns with earlier versions: it makes it clear \nthat a public housing authority should look at a person's pattern of \ndrug or alcohol abuse--rather than their history of drug or alcohol \nabuse--when screening candidates for admission. S. 1494 also enacts \nprovisions that will streamline the process that public housing \nauthorities must follow to designate a building as elderly-only or \ndisabled-only housing. I would like to thank the managers of this \nlegislation for also including language I recommended to authorize \nvouchers for people who may be adversely affected by a PHA's \ndesignation decision.\n  I would like to mention that this bill includes an extremely helpful \nprovision that extends the timetables for processing and approving \nsales to nonprofits under the low-income housing preservation program. \nMany residents of HUD-assisted housing around the country--and \nespecially in Massachusetts--have been working very hard to purchase \ntheir buildings under the preservation program. Extending the deadline \nwill ensure that these people's efforts will have time to come to \nfruition.\n  Finally, Mr. President, S. 1494 allows the HUD Secretary to transfer \nup to $60 million in support of national nonprofit housing and \ncommunity development organizations. The bill authorizes $25 million \nfor Habitat for Humanity, $15 million for other similar self-help \nhousing programs, $10 million for the National Community Development \nInitiative--which includes the Local Initiatives Support Corporation \nand the Enterprise Foundation--and $10 million for National Cities in \nSchools. These are all excellent organizations and I am pleased to lend \nmy support for this authorization.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to express strong support for The \nHousing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1995 (S. 1494). I wish to \nexpress my thanks to Senators Mack, Bond, Shelby, Bennett, and Domenici \nfor their cosponsorship of this important legislation. In addition, I \nwould like to offer thanks to Senator Sarbanes, Senator Kerry, and all \nmembers of the committee for their dedication to this bill.\n  The Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1995 represents a \nbipartisan effort which would: provide short-term extensions of housing \nauthority which have expired; preserve assisted housing; protect \nelderly tenants in public and assisted housing; and promote self-help \nhousing and community development programs.\n  This legislation originally passed the Senate on January 24, 1996. \nThe House of Representatives passed a House amendment in the nature of \na substitute to S. 1494 on February 27, 1996. The House amendment \nrepresents a bicameral effort to gain consensus on an immediate \ndirection for Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] housing \nprograms.\n  To that end, the bill protects the needy recipients of various \nhousing programs that have lapsed authority. For instance, S. 1494 \nextends the HUD Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Demonstration [HECM] \nProgram through September 2000. Last November I introduced legislation, \nS. 1409, to provide a 5-year extension of this successful and much \nneeded program. The HECM Program offers elderly homeowners the \nopportunity to borrow against the equity in their homes. Without this \nprogram, senior citizens with low incomes might be forced to sell their \nhomes and spend their golden years elsewhere. In addition, S. 1494 \nextends the following programs until September 1996: the HUD community \ndevelopment block grant homeownership program; the Rural Housing \nService section 515 multifamily loan program; and the Federal Housing \nAdministration multifamily housing risk-sharing programs.\n  The legislation provides authority to the HUD Secretary to operate \nthe preservation program as passed in title II of the fiscal year 1996 \nVA/HUD appropriations legislation, H.R. 2099, on December 7, 1995. This \nprovision is needed to protect existing tenants in HUD insured \nprojects, to preserve the existing housing stock, and to recognize the \nrights of owners.\n  Further, S. 1494 would provide greater safety and security for our \nNation's elderly tenants in public and assisted housing. The bill would \nstreamline procedures for public housing authorities to designate \npublic housing facilities as ``elderly only,'' ``disabled only,'' or \n``elderly and disabled families only.'' Public housing authorities \nwould be authorized to evict residents in these designated facilities \nwhose pattern of drug or alcohol abuse would jeopardize the safety of \nelderly and disabled residents. In addition, housing authorities would \nbe required to provide occupancy standards and an expedited grievance \nprocedure for the eviction of tenants who have a pattern of drug or \nalcohol abuse.\n  The Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act would encourage self-\nhelp and community development programs which require little or no HUD \nregulation. HUD would be authorized to provide grants to capable \nnonprofit organizations, such as Habitat-for-Humanity. In addition, the \nbill would permit HUD the discretion to utilize reprogrammed funds for \nthe Cities in Schools Program. The Cities in Schools Program is our \ncountry's largest and most successful student dropout prevention \nnetwork. It serves as a model of how effective a public/private \npartnership organization can be in serving our national goals.\n  The legislation would also provide an authorization of commitment \nauthority to the Government National Mortgage Association of $110 \nbillion for fiscal year 1996 and increase the HUD section 108 loan \nguarantee aggregate limit from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion.\n  The Banking Committee and its Housing Subcommittee continue to \nanalyze proposals for the reorganization and elimination of the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development. After the opportunity for \nfurther debate and hearings on existing HUD and Department of \nAgriculture housing programs, housing reform legislation will be \nintroduced this Spring. Until passage of more comprehensive \nlegislation, the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1995 is \nessential for the continued operation of our Nation's housing delivery \nsystem. I thank my colleagues for their support for passage of S. 1494.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1494, which I \nwas pleased to cosponsor with Senators D'Amato and Bond. This \nlegislation extends certain critical HUD and USDA housing programs \nwhose authorizations have expired. It also makes certain other changes \nin housing policy to reflect priorities of the Congress as well as the \nadministration.\n  When S. 1494 originally passed the Senate on January 24, 1996, it was \nlimited in scope to only those provisions that needed affirmative \nlegislative authority to continue to operate, such as the Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage Demonstration program for the elderly (HECM), the \nCDBG home ownership program, the FHA multifamily risk-sharing \ndemonstration, and the Section 515 rural rental housing program.\n  The other body passed S. 1494 as amended on February 27, and the \nHouse-passed version contains changes that were negotiated between the \nHouse and the Senate. The amended bill we are considering today thus \ncontains some positive additions to the bill the Senate initially \napproved.\n  Most notably, S. 1494 now includes provisions that make it easier to \nevict from public housing tenants who are engaged in criminal \nactivities or who have a pattern of alcohol or drug abuse, and it gives \npublic housing authorities access to criminal records for the screening \nand eviction of public housing tenants. These provisions aid in the \nimplementation of what the President calls a ``one strike and you're \nout'' policy for public housing, and they were part of S. 1260, the \nPublic Housing Reform and Empowerment Act, which this body approved on \nJanuary 10, and which is awaiting action in the other body.\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\n  The bill also streamlines procedures for public housing authorities \nto designate public housing facilities as ``elderly only,'' ``disabled \nonly,'' or ``elderly and disabled families only.'' S. 1494 provides the \nauthority to evict from these designated facilities those whose pattern \nof drug or alcohol abuse would jeopardize the safety and security of \nthe elderly and disabled residents. These provisions reflect concerns \nraised by advocates for the elderly about the mixing of elderly and \ndisabled populations, but they provide a balanced policy that will help \nprovide access to affordable housing for both of these special needs \npopulations. Again, these provisions are similar to those contained in \nthe Public Housing Reform and Empowerment Act.\n  S. 1494 also extends the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage \nDemonstration for the elderly through September 30, 2000, instead of \nthe 1-year extension originally passed by the Senate.\n  The bill provides authority for the HUD Secretary to operate the low-\nincome housing preservation program passed by Congress in the vetoed \nfiscal year 1996 VA-HUD appropriation bill. These provisions are \nnecessary to prevent large-scale mortgage prepayments of FHA-insured \nmortgages and thus preserve the existing supply of affordable low-\nincome housing.\n  In addition, S. 1494 creates a self-help housing program under which \nHUD will provide grants to capable nonprofit organizations, like \nHabitat for Humanity. Grand funds must be used for the payment of land \nacquisition and infrastructure costs. These funds will supplement \ndonations and contributions of products, volunteer labor and sweat \nequity, on which groups like Habitat now depend.\n  Finally, S. 1494 authorizes only through September 30, 1996, the \nsection 515 rural rental housing program administered by USDA's Rural \nHousing Service [RHS]. Before the program is authorized beyond the \ncurrent fiscal year, oversight hearings should be held and reforms \nimplemented to guard against waste, abuse, and misuse of funds. The RHS \nhas taken significant steps to correct problems in the section 515 \nprogram which have been identified by the USDA IG and the GAO. However, \nlegislative action is required to assure that program funds are \nallocated properly and that the program is not abused by developers, \nowners, or tenants. The Banking Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and \nCommunity Development, which I chair, will hold hearings on the section \n515 program early this spring.\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1494, the \nHousing Opportunity Program Extension Act. This bill addresses some \nimportant and time-sensitive matters in the housing area. S. 1494 \nextends program authorities that have expired and makes some other \nneeded changes in authorizing statutes. Finally, it provides HUD with \nthe authority to support several national nonprofit organizations that \nare making a huge difference in America's communities. I thank the \nother members of the Senate for their support of this legislation.\n  S. 1494 extends several housing authorizations that expired October \n1, 1995. Among these are the Community Development Block Grant direct \nhomeownership assistance provisions, the Federal Housing Administration \n[FHA] multifamily insurance risk-sharing programs, and the Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage program. Each of these programs is a valuable tool \nin our efforts to make sure that Americans remain the best-housed \npeople in the world.\n  The program extensions on this bill also include the section 515 \nrural rental housing program and the set-asides within the program for \nnonprofit developers and for funding to underserved areas. This \nauthorization is necessary because the Rural Housing Service at the \nDepartment of Agriculture has been unable to utilize its $150 million \nappropriation until an authorization passed. Section 515 provides \nvaluable, low-interest credit to support affordable rental housing in \nrural areas.\n  The bill also includes authority for the HUD Secretary to spend up to \n$60 million supporting local nonprofit housing and community \ndevelopment activities. I would like to express my enthusiastic support \nfor these provisions. The bill authorizes $25 million for Habitat for \nHumanity, $15 million for other similar self-help housing programs, $10 \nmillion for the National Community Development Initiative, and $10 \nmillion for National Cities in Schools. Habitat for Humanity affiliates \nhave been operating in my State for years and creating homeowners among \nlow-income families. The National Community Development Initiative \ncombines Federal funds with funds from foundations to support capacity \nbuilding for community-based nonprofits. Two terrific national \nnonprofit intermediaries--the Enterprise Foundation which is based in \nColumbia, MD, and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation--are key \nparticipants in the NCDI program and are factors in the NCDI program's \nsuccess. The community-based nonprofit sector is an important and \ngrowing part of our delivery system of assistance to distressed \ncommunities. I am pleased with the recognition that this bill provides \nto these efforts.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to highlight the language in the \nbill that permits HUD to renew expiring Section 8 moderate \nrehabilitation contracts. This provision overturns language passed on \nthe continuing resolution that prohibited HUD from renewing moderate \nrehabilitation contracts. Clearly, HUD should not renew contracts on \nhousing that is not decent, safe, and sanitary. Likewise, we are \nworking with HUD to identify ways to reduce the cost of Section 8 \ncontracts where rent levels are excessive. However, HUD needs to take a \ncloser look at all of the developments assisted with project-based \nrental assistance and make decisions about their futures on a case-by-\ncase basis. Before converting project-based assistance to vouchers, HUD \nshould consider the future viability of the development, the ability of \nthe project to support its existing financing, the availability of \naffordable housing for voucher holders, and the desirability of \nretaining long-term, affordable housing in that location.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1997-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to speak about a \nbattle that is raging over the promotion of Navy Comdr. Robert Stump. \nThe battle is raging within the Senate Armed Services Committee, and it \nis being discussed, as well, in the press.\n  I have had my differences with this committee in the past, but I want \nto set the record straight. In this particular case, I think the \ncommittee is getting a bum rap. I think the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee is doing the right thing.\n  Commander Stump's promotion to the rank of captain has been denied by \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. It was denied because of his \nsuspected involvement in the inappropriate behavior at the Tailhook \nconvention.\n  I support the committee's decision to deny the promotion, and I \nsupport it 100 percent.\n  Unfortunately, Commander Stump believes that promotion is an \ninalienable right. Sadly, he believes that the Senate should not sit in \njudgment of his character, or even make judgments about his character. \nSo he has hired a lawyer and has been conducting a very ugly lobbying \ncampaign.\n  The committee is getting hammered with bad publicity. His supporters \nargue that Commander Stump has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing. \nThey argue that he is an innocent man, and they argue that he has been \ntreated unfairly and that the flagging procedure should be abolished.\n  Being cleared of criminal charges does not tell me that Commander \nStump is ready for promotion. Mr. President, this is a negative \nstandard of judgment. A negative standard of judgment will not help to \nnurture the kind of topnotch leadership that the Navy so badly needs.\n  To decide whether he is ready for promotion to captain, we need \nunambiguous answers to at least 5 questions:\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\n  No. 1, has he demonstrated excellence in the performance of his \nduties?\n  Two, has he demonstrated excellence in leadership and discipline?\n  Three, does he always set a good example?\n  Four, does he care for and respect the men and women who serve under \nhim in the Navy?\n  Five, and above all, is he a man of integrity?\n  In my mind, Mr. President, Commander Stump's activities at Tailhook \nraise questions about his ability to exert moral leadership. I \npersonally like the controversial ``flagging'' procedures. This \nprocedure was instituted by the Armed Services Committee. It is a \nprocedure for identifying the files of promotion candidates suspected \nof inappropriate behavior at Tailhook.\n\n  There is a good reason for doing this. The committee does not want to \nget bushwhacked on the floor by Senators like me, and other Senators, \nwho may be waiting for an inappropriate person to be advanced to the \nfloor for confirmation when they should not be that far along in the \nprocess anyway.\n  If we discover that a prospective nominee has engaged in misconduct \nat Tailhook, or anywhere else, they know that certain Senators on this \nfloor, including myself, will raise questions and maybe hold it up.\n  Too many Navy nominees have slipped through the Senate confirmation \nnet when damaging information about them lay hidden in Government \nfiles. It usually leaks out to the press after the fact. If that \ninformation had been exposed to public debate, some of the nominations \nwould have died. ``Flagging'' helps to fix this problem.\n  Mr. President, the only way to solve the Navy's leadership problem is \nto promote men and women who measure up to a standard of excellence.\n  I think it is clear that the Senate Armed Services Committee has done \nthe right thing in this particular nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S1999-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2000-S2003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TELECOMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \nwhich passed on February 1 and was signed into law February 8, is only \nthe first step in my reform agenda for national telecommunications \npolicy. As comprehensive as the new Telecommunications Act is, there \nare a number of profile and policy issues we were not able to \nadequately address, which need our attention.\n  Over the coming months, the Commerce Committee will be examining the \nFederal Communication Commission's regulatory structure. The key issue \nis whether the FCC, a regulatory agency devised in the 1930's, based on \nthe ICC model from the turn of the last century, makes sense today as \nwe prepare for the 21st century. We also need to ensure that \nFederal regulation does not become a roadblock to the deregulatory \npolicy changes engineered by the Congress with enactment of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996.\n\n  We also will move forward with national spectrum policy reform. I \nplan to chair four Commerce Committee hearings on spectrum policy \nreform, covering a broad range of issues concerning the management of \nthe electromagnetic radio frequency spectrum. Although the issue of the \nbroadcast advanced television spectrum captured headlines, there are a \nnumber of spectrum policy reform issues we need to address that are far \nmore important. I intend to move the spectrum policy debate firmly back \non the ground to the communications policy rather than the budgetary \nprocess which, to date, unfortunately, has dictated the terms of the \nspectrum reform debate.\n  Mr. President, the electromagnetic radio frequency spectrum is an \nimportant physical phenomenon--a natural, national resource. An \nincreasing number of telecommunications enterprises depend on access to \nthis resource. These enterprises include radio and television \nbroadcasting, communications satellites, the complex air-to-ground \nsystems needed to manage aviation, the wireless systems upon which law \nenforcement and public safety depend, and the burgeoning mobile radio \ntelephone business--cellular phones and personal communications \nservices [PCS].\n\n  Simply put, the spectrum is to the information age what oil and steel \nwere to the industrial age.\n  Today, there is a limited supply of available spectrum and an almost \nlimitless demand for its use. In other words, the spectrum is an \nenormously valuable yet finite natural resource. This is the crux of \nthe problem with our current spectrum policy structure. Unless a \nreformation plan is developed that will create a more effective and \nefficient use of the spectrum, as well as a more stable supply of \nspectrum for private sector use, a vast array of new spectrum-based \nproducts, services, and technologies will go unrealized for the \nAmerican people.\n  This is particularly disheartening when one considers the benefits \nthat are derived from current spectrum-based technology. For example, \ndirect broadcast satellite [DBS] has become a viable competitor to \ncable. High powered DBS satellites have the ability to process and \ntransmit as many as 216 video and audio channels simultaneously.\n  Cellular is another spectrum-based technology that is worth \nmentioning. In 1962, AT was operating its first experimental cellular \ntelephone system. It was not until 20 years later that the first \ncellular licenses were handed out. Today, the cellular industry \ngenerates about $14.2 billion in revenues a year and provides service \nto nearly 35 million customers.\n  From its very beginning, wireless communication has played a vital \nrole in protecting lives and property and, subsequently, through the \ndevelopment of radio and television broadcasting, in delivering \ninformation and entertainment programming to the public at large. More \nrecently, wireless, spectrum-based telecommunications services, \nproducts and technologies have proven to be indispensable enablers and \ndrivers of productivity and economic growth, as well as international \ncompetitiveness.\n  Wireless technology can deliver telecommunications and information \nservices directly: First, to individuals on the move, away from the \noffice desk or factory floor, thereby increasing their personal \nproductivity; and second, to fixed locations that cannot be served \neconomically by wireless facilities because of physical infeasibility \nor prohibitively high costs. Wireless services are also critically \nimportant in bringing competition to the wireline telephone network, \none of the key goals of the Telecommunications Act.\n  The use of this economic resource is largely determined through \nadministrative licensing procedures first developed in the 1920's. \nCompared to that of most other countries, the U.S. spectrum management \nsystem allows for a broad degree of private sector involvement in \nspectrum. Yet, the system still involves a large degree of central \ngovernment planning by federal regulators.\n  To a large extent, it is electromagnetic industrial policy.\n  The FCC must determine which services should be provided, the \nfrequencies on which they will be provided, the conditions under which \nthey will be provided, and often the specific technology to be used.\n  As with other systems of central planning, the spectrum management \nsystem currently utilized in the U.S. tends to result in inefficient \nuse of the spectrum resource. Federal regulators--rather than \nconsumers--decide whether taxis, telephone service, broadcasters, or \nforesters are in greatest need of spectrum. It is a highly politicized \nprocess. Most importantly, new services, products and technologies are \ndelayed or, worse yet, denied. This obviously harms consumers.\n  It typically takes years to get a new service approved by the FCC. \nThe lengthy delay in making cellular telephone service available, noted \nearlier, imposed tremendous cost on the economy. One study estimated \nthat the delay cost the economy $86 billion. As important, American \nconsumers were denied a new productivity and security tool for many \nyears.\n  Equally troubling, the system constrains competition. One of the most\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nimportant determinants of a competitive industry is the ability of new \nfirms to enter the business. The bureaucratic allocation process \ntypically provides for a set number of licenses for each service, \nprecluding additional competitors. Only two cellular franchises, for \ninstance, are allowed in each market.\n  These problems have long been the focus of criticisms by economists \nand other expert analysts. Changes in new communications technologies, \nespecially the digitization phenomenon, are making the system even more \nunworkable. New wireless communications technologies, services and \nproducts are being developed at an accelerated rate. Even if the FCC \nwere able to weigh accurately the needs and merits of the relatively \nfew spectrum-based services that existed in the 1930's, it is simply \nnot able to do so today. Even if it could, the lengthy delays \nassociated with the allocation and assignment processes, while perhaps \nacceptable in a slow changing world, are seriously out of step with the \nfast-changing world of today.\n  Pressures on the traditional radio frequency management structure are \nincreasing. This is because demand for channels is outstripping supply. \nSome of the major issues which have arisen in recent years include:\n\n\n                             government use\n\n  Many believe the Federal Government occupies too much of the radio \nspectrum resource today. They argue for reducing the government \nspectrum inventory in order to get this resource into the hands of the \nprivate sector where they believe it will be used more effectively and \nefficiently. Some also contend the traditional division of \nresponsibilities between the FCC and NTIA is obsolete. Establishing a \nsingle radio spectrum manager for the United States, they argue, would \nbe a significant improvement. Still others see the Government spectrum \ninventory as a potential source of revenues. They argue that the \nGovernment should be required to relinquish frequencies which could \nthen be auctioned. They believe spectrum auctions would return billions \nof dollars to the Treasury.\n\n\n                          spectrum flexibility\n\n  Many contend the Government should liberalize rules governing use of \nthe spectrum. The prevailing radio frequency management system limits \nthe uses that can be made of particular bands and channels. The \nchannels allocated to broadcasting and assigned to broadcast stations \nthus cannot legally be used for cellular phone service today. Many of \nthese frequency use limitations are grounded on traditional analog \nradio transmission technology. Many engineers and technical experts \ncontend that the trend toward digital transmission renders these \ntraditional limitations on channel use obsolete. Organizations \nincluding the Progress & Freedom Foundation have argued in favor of \naccording frequency users broad flexibility to use their channels as \nthey choose, subject to a no-interference requirement. Such a change \nwould greatly empower individual licensees. It would also eliminate the \nscarcity of radio channels upon which much government regulation is now \nbased.\n\n\n                        self-managed regulation\n\n  At present, the FCC controls which entities receive licenses and what \nthey can do with them. Much of the radio frequency engineering \nassociated with this regulatory system is conducted by the FCC in-\nhouse.\n  In some instances, the FCC has delegated some of its engineering and \nroutine licensing functions to user cooperatives called frequency \ncoordinator groups. Legislation passed by Congress in 1981 authorized \nthis approach. Some believe the FCC should expand this approach to \nencompass virtually all radio-based communications. This would reduce \nthe administrative burden on the agency, they maintain, while speeding \nup the overall process. Some have suggested that the FCC should make \nblock grants of the spectrum to the States. Governors could then \napportion channels among various State law enforcement, public service, \nand other users. This also would significantly reduce FCC costs, they \nargue, and could ensure more responsive frequency management.\n  The radio frequency management and use reforms outlined above hold \nsignificant promise. None represent a truly fundamental change in \nFederal policy. All would reduce regulatory burdens while fostering \nimportant public policies including advances in technology and \ninnovation, greater choice and more customer options, and more \neffective, efficient, and responsive use of this resource.\n\n\n           a spectrum policy reform proposal--government use\n\n  Several approaches have been advanced which, if adopted, would \nsignificantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of Federal use \nof the radio frequency spectrum, and with no discernible adverse impact \non the performance of the many Federal programs that now rely heavily \non radiocommunications.\n  First, legislation should build on the 1993 Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation law, which directed the Government within a specified \nperiod of time to relinquish control over a predetermined amount of \nradio frequency spectrum. This spectrum has been retroceded, in part, \nand should prove the basis for a variety of new private sector \ncommunications offerings.\n  Now, legislation requiring the Government to privatize a set \npercentage of its spectrum--20 to 25 percent--makes sense. A special \ntemporary congressional commission could be established to carry out \nthis task much like the Base Realignment and Closures Commission \n[BRAC]. Congress also has created special or temporary commissions in \nthe past to examine problems like the 1981 temporary Commission on \nAlternative Financing for Public Telecommunications.\n  Mr. President, the proposal here is that there would be either the \nBase Closure Commission or something like it to look at the spectrum \nthat the Defense Department and the CIA has to see if that could not be \nreleased in part or shared in part as new technology develops. Indeed, \none of our hearings that we are going to hold in the Commerce Committee \nwill be an off-the-record hearing on that subject. We certainly want \nour national defense to meet its requirements with spectrum, but we \nneed to take a look at it. It may well take an extension of the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission to look at the spectrum that the \nmilitary has.\n  If enacted, this initiative would have several positive consequences. \nTo begin with, it would give Federal agencies a powerful incentive to \nmodernize their communications facilities--to derive more \ncommunications capacity from the same or less channel bandwidth. \nReducing the amount of spectrum used by Government would also create a \npowerful economic engine that could help drive the deployment of common \nuser wireless communications systems generally.\n  At present, there are a number of private sector alternatives to the \nGovernment providing its own radio communications. These include \ncellular radiotelephones as well as the new PCS services which are \ndeveloping nationwide. As cellular radio moves from the conventional \nanalog to more advanced digital transmission techniques, the number of \ncellular channels--system capacity--may increase by five- or six-fold.\n  That is important to repeat. As cellular radio moves from the \nconventional analog to more advanced digital transmission techniques, \nthe number of cellular channels--system capacity--may increase by five- \nor six-fold. In other words, we may have five or six times as much \ncapacity on some of the same spectrum. Do not let me overstate this \nmatter because that is only true of certain types of spectrum. But we \nmay have five or six times as much use of that same band of beachfront \nspectrum in some instances.\n  That large-capacity increase, plus the proliferation of additional \nwireless systems, hold the promise of significantly lower customer \ncosts. Such costs could be even lower, if the volume of communications \nhandled by these wireless systems grows. Here, as in other cases, cost \nper message, and thus price to users, is highly dependent upon volume.\n  Not all Government radio communications requirements can necessarily \nbe fully satisfied by private-sector commercial mobile service [CMS] \nproviders. Through the standard Government procurement process, \nhowever, agencies could negotiate with CMS providers for special \nservices and capabilities. There is little reason to assume, at this \ntime, that an effectively competitive wireless communications business \ncould not adequately meet\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\nmany Government radio communications requirements. In the final \nanalysis, the cost to the Government of relying on private sector \nsupplies would be lower than the posted price because of the private \nsector's tax liabilities.\n  Second, legislation should be passed to consolidate U.S. frequency \nmanagement responsibilities under the FCC. The current practice of \nsplitting functions between the FCC and NTIA is a historical \nanachronism. The frequency management functions of NTIA, together with \nthe IRAC Secretariat and associated support activities--including \nNTIA's electromagnetic compatibility analysis operations--should be \ntransferred to the FCC. In order to take into account critical national \ndefense, law enforcement, and security concerns, the law should provide \nfor limited review of FCC decisions on Federal frequency management by \nthe President or his designee. At present, NTIA frequency allocation \ndecisions are reviewable by the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget, acting pursuant to delegation from the President. No appeal \nfrom an NTIA frequency decision apparently has ever been taken.\n  Such a consolidation makes sense. The FCC's engineering and routine \nradio frequency management chores can, for the most part, be assumed by \nprivate sector frequency coordinator groups. As Government users \nincreasingly rely on the private sector to meet communications needs, \nand the dimensions of the Government change as well, the NTIA workload \nis likely to shrink as well. It makes little sense for taxpayers to \nfund two separate, Federal agencies both responsible for the effective \nand efficient use of the same resource.\n\n\n                          Spectrum Flexibility\n\n  Radio frequency management traditionally has limited the permissible \nuses of allocated bands and assigned channels. This, in part, has been \na function of technology, as well as the technical characteristics \nassociated with particular frequencies.\n  For example, channels allocated to the Forest Products Service have \ntraditionally been quite low frequencies, because those frequencies \nhave been shown to have the greatest ability to penetrate underbrush, \nleaves, etc. In general, the higher the frequency range, the more the \ntransmission resembles visible light in terms of the phenomena that \ncause interference. Hence, at very high frequency ranges, fog, air \npollution, and rain cause interference which would not arise if lower \nfrequencies were used. New digital communications technologies, \nhowever, lessen this challenge. This is because digital technology \nincludes error correction and other features which lessen interference.\n  ``Spread spectrum'' and ``digital overlay'' techniques make it \npossible for multiple communications pathways to be established within \nthe same radio frequency channel. Using this technology, broadcasters \ncould transmit other communications in addition to video and sound \nsignals. Radio broadcast channels today already are providing local \nlinks for paging operations.\n  Government policy should encourage multiple, more intensive use of \nradio frequency resources where there is no perceptible adverse \ntechnical impact. Among other things, allowing radio frequency \nlicensees greater flexibility could facilitate equipment and systems \nmodernization and upgrading. For example, many public safety \ncommunications systems today are in need of modernization, to meet the \ndemand for more cost-effective and responsive law enforcement, fire \nsafety, and emergency medical services. The financial resources \navailable to many public safety communications organizations are \nlimited today, however, as a consequence of the fiscal austerity \nimperatives arising at virtually all levels of government.\n  If local police forces were permitted greater flexibility in use of \ntheir channels, however, this challenge would be less severe. Switching \nto new digital communications techniques typically achieves a \nsignificant increase in the total number of channels available--in some \ncases, by a factor of four or more. A local police department, \ntherefore, could increase the number of channels available to support \nits operations and, at the same time, have capacity available which it \ncould lease or barter with private communications organizations. Such \narrangements could generate the funds needed to finance modernization. \nGreater flexibility is a public interest win-win situation--an option \nthat benefits all involved and affords the general public both better \nservice and more communications options.\n  The FCC and NTIA have already taken steps to allow some radio \nlicensees more flexible use. The FCC's cellular radiotelephone rules, \nfor example, place few constraints on permissible communications. The \nsame is true in the case of the new PCS services. What is needed, \nhowever, is far greater application of this fundamental principle of \nflexible spectrum use.\n\n\n                        self-managed regulation\n\n  One of the more promising options for radio frequency management \nreform is expanded use of self-managed regulation--the use of private \nsector radio frequency coordinator groups to handle routine \nengineering, frequency coordination, and other functions which, in the \npast, had typically been undertaken by FCC staff.\n  At present, the FCC relies on frequency coordinators to handle many \nof the routine chores associated with private mobile radio systems. \nOrganizations such as the National Association of Business & \nEducational Radio [NABER], the Associated Public-Safety Communications \nOfficers [APCO], and the Special Industrial Radio Service Association \n[SIRSA] process applications, conduct engineering surveys, and \notherwise facilitate licensing and channel usage in these specific \nprivate radio services. The FCC does not generally rely on frequency \ncoordinators, however, with regard to broadcast services, satellite \ncommunications, and other large frequency-using services.\n  The task of being a frequency coordinator depends, in large part, \nupon access to computerized data bases, and having some radio frequency \nengineering expertise. Access to data bases today, of course, is \nroutine. The number of individuals with substantial radio frequency \nmanagement expertise is growing, moreover, in part because of Federal \nGovernment, and Defense Agency, downsizing. There is, in short, no good \nreason to assume that multiple frequency coordinators could not be \nsanctioned by the FCC. This would have the effect of broadening user's \noptions. Competition among and between frequency coordinator groups, \nmoreover, should have the effect of ensuring efficient charges and \neffective, responsive operations. That has been true in virtually every \nmarket where competition has been introduced, and should prove true in \nthis case as well. The FCC should be directed to expand substantially \nthe Agency's use of private sector frequency coordinator groups.\n  Let me say something about the public safety spectrum and begin to \nconclude by saying, at this time, the FCC should be directed to assess \nthe feasibility and desirability of making some spectrum block grants \nto States. In lieu of processing, issuing, and renewing tens of \nthousands of public safety communications licenses--at significant cost \nto licensees, as well as the FCC--the agency would issue 55 block \ngrants to the chief executive officer of each State, including Guam, \nPuerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. It \nwould then be the responsibility of State Governors to determine \neligibility, to ensure compliance with standard FCC--and other--\noperating rules, and to resolve disputes among public safety licensees \nwithin the jurisdiction.\n  This would reduce delays and heighten responsiveness to actual user \nrequirements, while also lessening substantially the burdens of \ntraditional regulation now borne by the FCC. Most importantly, it would \ntend to ensure more and better public safety communications for State \nresidents. Again, while States today have substantial radio frequency \nengineering expertise, such expertise is readily available in the \ncompetitive marketplace.\n  In conclusion, the radio frequency management and use reforms \noutlined above hold significant promise. All would reduce regulatory \nburdens while fostering important public policies including advances in \ntechnology and innovation, greater choice and more customer options, \nand more effective, efficient, and responsive use of this valuable \nnational resource. I look forward to receiving comment on these and \nother spectrum reform proposals as part of our comprehensive hearing \nprocess in the Commerce Committee.\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\n  Mr. President, as I look about the Chamber and in the galleries, I \nfeel as I did some months ago. I addressed our State Chamber of \nCommerce. I was our last speaker after a whole series of speakers. \nToward the end of my speech I noticed everyone was nodding their heads. \nEither they agreed with me or they were falling asleep.\n  I thank my colleagues for letting me make this speech on spectrum \nmanagement policy. Some of my basic thinking is we need to take a new \nlook at this spectrum. It is a national natural resource. We need to \nlook at what the Government has and what private areas have. We need to \nlook at what the broadcasters have; if they are going to migrate, if we \nare sure we are going to auction what they migrate from.\n  We have to look at giving authority to the States. If we find that \nthere is more spectrum to use, we need to consider the possibility of \nauctioning it or, if it is used for public use, letting some of the \nState Governors decide how to allocate it rather than have it be \nallocated here within the beltway.\n  Those are some things we need to think about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/13/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "13", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 14, 1996\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER.
