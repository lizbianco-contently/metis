Mr. President, yesterday was a day of ceremony and tribute \nin the Senate. It was a day of testimonials, emotional farewells, and I \nthink really a high point for this institution in the years that I have \nbeen here, because in a very bipartisan way, we all talked about the \ninstitution of the Senate and what it means to us as individuals, the \nuniqueness of how it operates, and what it means for our country.\n  Obviously, the Republican Members were touched by the moment that we \nsaw our leader of so many years, Bob Dole, exit the Chamber. But I also \nwas struck by the fact that the Democratic leadership--in fact, all of \nour colleagues on that side of the aisle--showed emotion and felt the \nspecialness of that moment, as was exhibited by the outstanding remarks \nof the distinguished Democratic leader who sits here today.\n  It was a day that all Senators will remember, just as we will always \nremember the leadership of Bob Dole.\n  Today, the Senate returns to business, and I am honored and humbled \nto stand here as the Senate majority leader. It is also a pleasure to \nhave with me in our leadership team the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, who will serve as the assistant majority \nleader, the whip. I know that he will do a great job, and I look \nforward to working with him and us working together as a team with the \nDemocratic leadership. We have already met with their entire leadership \nteam, and I think we are off to a very positive start.\n  Also, I want to, again, refer to my distinguished colleague from \nMississippi. We have stood together now through 23\\1/2\\ years in the \nCongress. He is truly a great leader for our State and for our country. \nHe sort of blazed the trail in our State for a Republican Party that \nused to meet in a very small room with room left over. He was the first \nSenator who was elected as a Republican from our State of Mississippi. \nSo he has set an example for all of us. He is an important part of a \nteam for our State that I will always enjoy working with. He will \ncontinue as the chairman of our conference.\n  He will be joined by the secretary of the conference, Connie Mack of \nFlorida, and the newly elected chairman of the policy committee, \nSenator Craig of Idaho.\n  Just as Senator Dole did yesterday in his final speech from this \npodium, I begin my first remarks as majority leader by thanking those \nto whom I am indebted for the privilege of serving in the Senate.\n  Foremost among those, other than my beloved Mississippi constituents, \nare the members of my family. People who know me best know that my \nhighest priority on this Earth is my family. I love my work in the \nSenate, but I will always give the highest priority to my family. To my \nparents, who instilled the values which still guide my life, and my \nwife and our two children, Tricia, Chet, and Tyler, they have always \nbeen patient and understanding as I pursued public service. They have \nbeen my inspiration. And they are today.\n\n  I thank the people of Mississippi for honoring me with their trust \neach time I have asked for it. And, of course, I thank my Republican \ncolleagues for allowing me to serve in a role that has been filled by \nso many giants in the Senate in the past.\n  I am the first majority leader in history from my State of \nMississippi, a poor State but a State that is struggling to pull itself \nup and move forward. It is a State that has gone from the bottom rung \nof every economic indicator to now being identified as one\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\nof the 10 top growth States in the Nation. We are proud to be a part of \nthe Nation's team. Mississippi will always, in the future, do \neverything we can to play our part of contributing to a better America.\n  It is no wonder that we are humbled when we reach these positions. I \nam most humbled because I know of the work we have to do. In fact, I \nhad a friend this morning ask me, ``Where's the party? Where's the \ncelebration?'' I said, ``Well, there'll be no party. There'll be no \ncelebration. There'll be a lot of `thank you's,' and then this comment: \nLet's go to work.''\n  To friends on the other side of the aisle, let me say that one lesson \nI learned very well from Bob Dole is that this place cannot operate \neffectively for our country if the two leaders do not have a \nrelationship of complete trust and respect. Senator Daschle had that \nrelationship with Senator Dole. And he will have it from me. We have \nbeen friends for many years in the House, now in the Senate. I have \ntalked to a lot of his colleagues. I believe we can work together. Oh, \nwe will disagree. We will have some good debate. But we will always \nremember that the best thing for us to do is to work together for our \ncountry. We can find a way to do that.\n  Mr. President, I do have just some brief comments on today's \nschedule. I am glad to withhold those if the Senator would like to \ncomment at this point.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The able Democratic leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6113-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATIONS TO THE NEW MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me compliment \nthe distinguished majority leader on his remarks, and congratulate him \non his election. His leadership team sits among those on the floor \ntoday who demonstrate, in my view, a new generation of leadership, a \ngeneration that has had a good deal of experience, a generation that \nrepresents geographical diversity, a generation that I believe \nrecognizes the importance of governance. We look forward to the \nopportunity of serving together.\n  As I consider the past, as I consider the record and the resume of \nthe distinguished majority leader, I find many things in common. He is \nfrom a small State, as am I. He was a staff member, as was I. He was a \nMember of the House, and now a Member of the Senate for not that long a \nperiod of time. And so given those similar experiences and given what I \nknow to be his desire to lead and to govern and to work together, I \nbegin this day and this new period in this session of Congress with \ngreat expectations, with optimism, with the belief that we can, as he \njust indicated, come together, as Senator Dole suggested we do \nyesterday.\n  I thought it was revealing yesterday in the remarkable speech made by \nthe former majority leader that the most significant accomplishments \nthat he chose to recognize as he looked back over his past were those \naccomplishments that were forged through bipartisan efforts. That \nincluded, of course, the legislation for the disabled, it included \nnutrition legislation, it included an array of issues dealing with \ncivil rights.\n  The majority leader looked back fondly at those accomplishments and \ncalled upon all of us to remember the great Senators who have come \nbefore, Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have no doubt that if, indeed, we are to rise again to that \nstandard, that there can be no other alternative but for us to work \ntogether. So it is with that intent and with a sincere desire to do so \nthat I congratulate the new team. And I look forward to working, \nbeginning today, to forge that compromise, to strike the opportunities \nthat we have while they are there, and to work to make this a better \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader \nfor his remarks, and the remarks made in other forums by my good friend \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Dorgan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6114-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to rise on \nthe floor of the Senate today to congratulate my good friend and State \ncolleague, Trent Lott, upon his election as the majority leader of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  You have to go back to 1937 to find an instance of a Mississippi \nSenator being so close to the powerful position that my friend now \noccupies. Senator Pat Harrison of Dove Port, MS, first was elected to \nCongress to represent the gulf coast district in Congress, and so was \nTrent Lott some many years later, 1972. Senator Harrison came to the \nSenate after serving several terms in the House and rose to become \nchairman of the Finance Committee here in the Senate, and he lost by \none vote in a race to be the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. \nIncidentally, the Senator who won that election was Alben Barkley of \nKentucky. After that, he became President pro tempore of the Senate. I \nmention this to put in context what has happened today. For the first \ntime in history, a Mississippian has been elected majority leader of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n\n  I feel very honored and pleased that I have had the pleasure and the \nprivilege of serving with Trent Lott for almost 24 years in Congress, \nfirst in the House and now in the Senate. I want to commit to him my \nwholehearted support and my cooperation in helping make his service as \nmajority leader of the Senate the most successful ever for any Senator.\n  We have been very fortunate in our State in having some outstanding \nrepresentation, even though none had ever been chosen to serve as \nmajority leader. As a matter of fact, this desk here has written in the \ndrawer the names of some of those distinguished Senators, beginning \nwith Jefferson Davis, who resigned his seat in the Senate from this \ndesk when Mississippi seceded from the Union. It also contains the \nsignatures of Pat Harrison, whom I mentioned, and John Sharp Williams, \nwho was the minority whip in the House before being elected to the \nSenate.\n  So Trent Lott joins a list of very distinguished leaders of both \nHouses in representing our State in this very important capacity.\n  We know that the days ahead are going to be difficult. And I know all \nof the Members on our side are going to work very closely together. I \ntrust the Members on the other side will, too, to help move the \nbusiness of the Senate along.\n  There are some who are predicting gridlock, confrontation, mean-\nspirited, election-year posturing. Well, let us not have it happen. I \nchallenge the Senate--and I know others feel this way, too--that we can \nachieve results that help solve problems for the American people in the \ntime we have ahead of us this year. We can do it under the able, \nenergetic, and very experienced leadership that Trent Lott brings to \nthe job of majority leader.\n  So I appreciate very much having the opportunity of being in the same \ncontest with him. Frankly, I learned a lot.\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\n I had never run against Trent Lott for anything before. In the \nconference he spoke in a very precise, clear way.\n  We were asked in the news conference about the election. I mentioned \nthat I started off in this campaign with a small base of support, and \nduring the campaign it got smaller. That was because of the proven \nleadership ability of Trent Lott and his obviously excellent \nqualifications for this job.\n  I am confident that he will be a great success as majority leader. \nAnd I am honored to work with him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would be pleased to defer to the \nSenator from South Carolina. I ask unanimous consent that I follow the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Senator Trent \nLott upon becoming the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. He is a man \nof integrity, ability, and dedication, and, in my opinion, will make \none of the finest majority leaders that this country has ever had. I \nbelieve as time goes by that people will see the wisdom of this man \nbeing elected. We are proud of him. We are proud of the State he comes \nfrom, the leadership it has produced. We predict great things to happen \nduring the term of Senator Lott as majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6114-4", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR THAD COCHRAN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, while I am talking, I also commend the \nother Senator from Mississippi, the able Senator Thad Cochran of \nMississippi, for the great service he has rendered to his State and \nNation.

Mr. President, I actually came to the floor to speak \nabout another issue, but I do want to, first of all, congratulate \nSenator Lott and Senator Cochran. I cannot pledge to my friend from \nMississippi my wholehearted political support, but I certainly can \npledge my personal support.\n  I wish you well, Senator Lott. And Senator Cochran, I do not think \nthere is anybody that at least I have had a chance to meet on the floor \nof the Senate, that is more honorable and more personable. When Senator \nCochran talks about civility and when he talks about good politics, of \nbringing people together, he epitomizes that. I mean that very \nsincerely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6115-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MENTAL HEALTH AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to talk about what I hope will \nbe a bipartisan approach, but I speak with a considerable amount of \nconcern. I have worked very closely with my colleague from New Mexico, \nSenator Domenici, a Republican, and very closely with my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Simpson, on a mental health amendment to the insurance \nreform bill.\n  That amendment passed, Mr. President, by a 68-to-30 vote. What that \namendment said was that as we look at insurance reform, we do not \nmandate benefits, but once plans are put into motion, and once there is \nan agreement about a particular plan for employees or for citizens, \nthis ought not to be discrimination against people who are struggling \nwith mental illness, illness that is diagnosable and treatable. That \namendment passed by a 68-to-30 vote.\n  What we were simply saying is, for gosh sakes, do not put people in a \nposition where they cannot work because they will not get the coverage, \nand they have to be on medical assistance. Do not put people in a \nposition where they could do well in school, but they cannot do well in \nschool. Do not put people in a position where they are homeless, and \nthey should not be homeless. Do not put people in a position where they \nwind up incarcerated, where that is not where they should be.\n  Mr. President, we had strong bipartisan support. It then went to what \nwill, hopefully, be a conference committee. It is with profound \ndisappointment and some indignation that I say on the floor of the \nSenate that what has now happened on the part of my Republican \ncolleagues on the House side is they have essentially knocked out the \nwhole amendment.\n  Mr. President, working with Senator Domenici, Senator Simpson, people \nlike Senator Conrad, we came up with a pared-down formulation that said \nat least for lifetime limits, at least for annual limits, have the same \ncaps as for physical illness, so that people who are struggling with \nmental illness are not put under economically, so that people can \nreceive the care that they need. We should end this discrimination.\n  This particular compromise would cost, according to CBO, 0.2 of a 1-\npercent increase. That is it. Mr. President, there is no good policy \nreason, I say to my colleagues on the floor of the Senate today, there \nis no good policy reason why this compromise that we presented to \nmembers of the conference committee on the House Republican side should \nnot have been accepted. It is fair. It is equitable. It economically \nmakes sense. It is just. It is the right thing to do. There is not one \nsingle article that can be made against it. Not one single argument \nthat can be made against it.\n  Now what we hear on the House side from Republicans is that what we \nwill get is a commission to study the problem. Senator Domenici does \nnot consider that acceptable. I do not consider that acceptable. \nSenator Simpson does not consider that acceptable. That is not even the \npoint. It is not acceptable for families all across this country who \nthought we were going to finally end this discrimination.\n  Mr. President, there will be a press conference this afternoon at 2 \no'clock. A lot of the families, men and women and children who are \nstruggling with mental illness, will be there. Several of us will be \nthere. I think what they will say is they are going to visit with every \nmember of that conference committee on the House side, Republican and \nDemocrat alike. They are going to visit, I say to my good colleague \nfrom Mississippi, Senator Lott, they are going to visit with \nleadership, and they are going to say to leaders and they are going to \nsay to Democrats and Republicans alike: ``Tell us why it is still not \ntime to end the discrimination. Tell us why you are unwilling to end \nthis discrimination against our children, against our wives, against \nour husbands. Tell us when it is not time to end discrimination.''\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Mississippi, if I could get \nhis attention, I want to mention this afternoon at 2 o'clock we will \nhave a press conference with some wonderful families who have been \nstruggling with mental illness. You know Senator Domenici cares so much \nabout this. They are going to meet with leadership and say, ``Look, the \nformulation that we now came up with,'' not the commission, ``at least \nshould not have arbitrary caps on lifetime and annual limits, costs 0.2 \nof 1 percent.'' It helps end the discrimination. Please do not shut our \nfamilies out.\n\n  I hope you will give them your utmost consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6115-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6115-S6116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO SENATOR LOTT\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, let me first add my congratulations to the \nnew majority leader. I think that Trent Lott will do an outstanding job \nand one that will certainly make our party proud, but the country proud \nas well. I was pleased to have his colleague, Thad Cochran, with whom \nwe both entered Congress, stand up in a true southern fashion, extend \nhis warmest wishes and willingness to work with you. It will be a great \nteam from Mississippi and for the rest of the country. I add my \naccolades to you, Mr. Leader.\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH CARE FRAUD AND ABUSE\n\n  Mr. COHEN. I want to take a few moments to talk about something that \nis of great importance to me. As is so often the case in Washington, \nmisinformation is flying about the effects of legislation being \nconsidered in Congress. It is customary in this country and in this \nCongress, to have, just as we are negotiating the last-minute details \nto legislation, some interest group come forward, place a provocative \nad in the newspaper, and try to destroy that legislation.\n  I am referring to the fraud and abuse provisions in the Kennedy-\nKassebaum health care legislation that is now in the final stages of a \nconference. Recently, the American Medical Association placed a full-\npage ad in the Wall Street Journal. The ads are slick and very clever--\nit shows a doctor, with a stethoscope hanging down, in the ``docks.'' \nIt says, ``We (the AMA) are opposed to fraud and abuse. We know it is a \nserious problem, but if doctors willfully and knowingly violate our \nNation's laws, they should be punished.''\n  Mr. President, this is precisely what the legislation does. Then the \nad goes on to say, ``But honest mistakes should not make physicians or \nany other citizens candidates for incarceration.'' We agree.\n  This legislation has been worked on for the past 3 years. As a matter \nof fact, this particular ad is not only misleading, it is false. It is \nabsolutely false advertising that the AMA has engaged in, along with \nother physician groups who have written articles.\n  To distort the intent and scope of the provisions in this fashion \nminimizes the very real threat that fraud poses to our health care \nsystem and, indeed, to the solvency of Medicare. Medicare trustees have \nsaid the trust fund is going broke--not in 6 years--but in 5 years. One \nof the reasons it is going broke is because so much fraud and abuse is \nbeing perpetrated on the American people. As we are asking Medicare \nbeneficiaries and honest providers to share the burden of changes to \narrest the growth of Medicare, it is our duty to do all we can to get \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse out the program.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, we are now losing as much \nas $100 billion from fraud and abuse every year. The losses to Federal \nhealth care programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and CHAMPUS, is about \n$40 billion or 40 percent of the total.\n  Mr. President, it is a grand scale of theft that is taking place. We \nhave heard testimony that organized crime has moved into health care \nfraud. We heard testimony that drug dealers have moved into health care \nfraud because there is more money and it is easier for them to \nperpetrate this crime rather than trying to sell drugs with the FBI \nbreathing down their neck. As Willie Sutton said, ``that's where the \nmoney is.''\n  Let me give you a couple of examples that have come to my attention. \nI have had hearing after hearing on this subject matter. Seven months \nago, a physician testified before the Senate about his involvement in a \nclinic scam in Los Angeles. The physician participated in a scheme that \ninvolved phony prescriptions, paid patients, and resulted in losses \nover $800,000 to the Medicaid Program.\n\n  In another case, the owner of a home health care company built a \nbeautiful $2.5 million mansion with money he made from phony Medicare \nbillings.\n  A New York physician defrauded the Medicaid Program of more than $1.5 \nmillion by fraudulently charging for 25,000 drug treatments never given \nto recipients.\n  We have even heard of a case where a psychiatrist billed for 50,000 \nphantom therapy sessions never given to patients.\n  That is just a small sample of what we are trying to deal with today. \nAnd that is why we passed this important legislation by overwhelming \nnumbers in this body.\n  The health care fraud provisions now being considered by the Senate \nand House conference committee do address this problem in a reasonable, \nmeasured manner that does not infringe on personal liberties nor \npenalize innocent mistakes. The bill closes loopholes in current law \nand provides criminal penalties for a defined set of serious and \negregious violations such as embezzlement. The fraud and abuse \nprovisions substantially mirror existing fraud statutes and are \ndesigned to give enforcement more precise tools to protect consumers \nagainst fraud and abuse. Contrary to claims that the bill will unleash \nan army of intrusive investigators trying to entrap innocent doctors, \nthe proposal simply provides adequate resources for prosecutors and \ninvestigators, long strapped by budget cuts and under staffing to go \nafter serious patterns and cases of abuse.\n  The AMA's claim that ``honest mistakes'' of doctors or any other \ncitizens makes them ``candidates for incarceration'' is simply false. \nFar from going after honest mistakes, the criminal sanctions will be \nused to prosecute egregious, intentional acts of fraud against health \nplans.\n  Mr. President, the final thrust of the attack ads that are being \nleveled against this legislation is that this is Clinton's health care \nplan revisited. That, too, is absolutely false. This legislation was \ndeveloped in response to the recommendations put forth by a task force \nput together by President Bush, which was headed by a Justice \nDepartment that was dominated at the top level by President Bush \nappointees. It has been endorsed by Bob Dole, our former majority \nleader, and virtually everybody in our leadership for many years. These \nprovisions have passed twice before during this Republican-controlled \nCongress and have been the subject of numerous hearings in both the \nSenate and House. The notion that somehow this is Clinton II slipping \nthrough the cracks at the last moment is completely false.\n  We have to deal with health care fraud in a direct and responsible \nfashion. The legislation we passed by an overwhelming majority in this \nbody, unanimously, as I recall, deserves not to be undercut by false \nand misleading advertising. I hope my colleagues reject these kinds of \nlast-minute scare tactics which the AMA and others are engaged in. The \nonly ones to gain from failing to pass this antifraud package are those \nwho are intentionally ripping off the system. All the rest of us are \nthe big losers--the vast majority of honest health care providers, \ntaxpayers, and families who are footing the bill for the fraudulent \nproviders in the form of higher taxes and health care costs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As he knows, we have had occasion to \nwork together on one bill, and it was ill-fated. It was a postponement \nof the base closure process. As I recall, we got 16 votes.

Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom California for her comments. I look forward to working with her. I \nremember that occasion very well. I think one of the reasons we did not \nget more than 16 votes is the Members could not figure out what the two \nof us were doing working together.

Mr. President, I have been authorized to allocate myself \nsuch time as may be required from the time allocated to the majority on \nthe conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Missouri \nyield for a bit of information?\n  Mr. BOND. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first I want to thank the Senator from \nMissouri for the good work he has been doing in this area. I have seen \nthe questions he has asked about the outyears in the budget as proposed \nby the administration, and how in the world they plan to meet those \nnumbers. In fact, you have had administration officials say, ``Well, we \ndo not really plan to.''\n  So I hope you will continue to pursue this because this is a very \nimportant question of whether or not we are getting accurate \ninformation, what this means for the future in terms of trying to get a \nbalanced budget.\n  So I hope you will continue to pursue aggressively those questions \nbecause we need to know the answers.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to advise \nMembers that it appears that the House will not be able to complete \naction on the budget resolution conference report by the 3:30 hour, and \npossibly not until much later this afternoon.\n  Therefore, there will not be a vote on the budget resolution \nconference report today. We will consult with the Budget Committee \nleaders and the Democratic leader and announce this afternoon exactly \nwhat time the vote will occur on Thursday.\n  I thank you for yielding.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the majority leader and join my colleagues in \noffering congratulations and tell him that we are delighted to have his \nleadership. We look forward to working with him, and I also appreciate \nyour comments about this measure.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to commend our chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and the staff who worked together to put an honest budget \ntogether which will get our budget to balance in the year 2002. It is \nan honest budget, and, therefore, it makes some tough choices. Some \npeople do not like it because it makes tough choices. It makes those \ntough choices honestly.\n  I think it is a fair subject to debate. We have had those debates in \nthis body. They had it on the other side, and we are now going to act \non a conference report.\n  I am a strong supporter of this budget even though it does have to \nmake some tough restrictions on our spending. Because I believe we have \na solemn commitment to our constituents, to future generations of \nAmericans to bring our budget in balance. I have been very disturbed in \nthe last several weeks to hear our budget attacked in comparison to a \nbudget submitted by the President which is far more generous in \nelection years and then purports to get to a balance by the year 2002 \nby making some draconian cuts in many discretionary spending programs.\n  In addition to serving on the Budget Committee I have the privilege \nof serving as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that deals \nwith the Veterans' Administration, HUD, and independent agencies. As my \ncolleagues know, we have a number of very large and very important \nentities that are funded in that budget. So I have been holding \nhearings in the appropriations subcommittee over the last several weeks \nknowing how important budgets are for planning, and for implementing \nour fiscal decisions down the road. I have been asking the \nadministration officials who have come before me how they plan to \nhandle the large cuts proposed by the President's budget for the years \n1998 to 2002.\n  We do not have to emphasize the fact that 1998 comes after the \ncurrent election cycle. Apparently, some people may think that the heat \nwill go off and they will not have to be quite so accountable.\n  Mr. President, I have been asking questions in the appropriations \nhearing as one who has dealt with budgets and agencies for many years. \nHow can you cut 23 percent out of the Veterans' Administration medical \ncare without some plan in place to close hospitals; to consolidate or \nswitch to outpatient care? If you intend to continue the care that we \nowe to our veterans and you believe, as the administration purports to \nrecognize in its budget--this document published at great expense at \nthe cost of many, many trees which shows that there will be almost $13 \nbillion cut out of the Veterans' Administration in the next 6 years--\nhow can this be done?\n  I was so concerned about it that I asked Secretary Brown how they \nplanned to live with the 23-percent reduction. Imagine my surprise when \nthe Secretary told me that he had no plan; that in fact he had no \nintent of creating a plan because he had been assured that the cuts \nwere not going to happen.\n  Mr. President, this book is what we are supposed to be operating \nfrom. This book is what we are supposed to be comparing as the \nadministration's budget plan versus the plan that will be before us for \na vote we hope later this week.\n  The numbers in the President's budget show that VA medical care drops \nfrom an annual appropriations of $17 billion to $13 billion over the \nnext 4 years. But the VA Secretary tells me that those are not real, \nthat the President's budget is not what he really proposes to do, that \nhe would be shocked if it were actually to happen.\n  So why are the numbers in the budget, in this booklet, if they are \nnot the President's plan? I did not have an opportunity to listen. But \nI have seen the transcript of the President's comments in his Memorial \nDay radio show which seemed to be geared along the same lines as was \nstated by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  He did not follow the line and warn the veterans on Memorial Day that \nhe would be proposing cuts that would shut down one-quarter of the VA \nmedical care system, hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes at a time \nwhen the veterans population is rapidly aging and in need of services.\n  The President said in his Memorial Day message:\n\n       Even as we balance our budget, my administration is working \n     to keep our solemn commitment to America's veterans by \n     improving the health care they receive.\n\n  So a fair question, I think, would be, Whose budget is that he is \ntalking about? Which budget is he talking about? Is there another \nbudget that perhaps has not been printed up that we have not seen?\n  I thought perhaps it was just the Veterans Administration which was \nsuffering from these mixed signals and maybe they were confused or \nmaybe they thought the best way to avoid the potential political \nconsequences of calling VA medical care unnecessary or a low priority \nwas to issue confusing statements to the veterans by saying, ``Don't \nworry about it, it won't really happen.''\n  So the next agency that came before our committee for a hearing was \nthat of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I asked the \nNASA Administrator Dan Goldin how he was going to plan for the over $3 \nbillion cuts in the 6-year plan for NASA, because they have already \ntaken very serious cuts. I commended Administrator Goldin for having \ndone a very responsible job in downsizing that agency. It seems to me \nthose cuts were unduly harsh and would, perhaps, imperil the mission of \nthat vital agency.\n  Much to my amazement, the NASA Administrator told me that OMB had \ntold him not to worry about the outyear cuts either.\n  Wait a minute, what is going on? Let me stop just for a moment and \nexplain why this matters.\n  The cuts I was asking about are those which the President needs and \nwhich he sets forth in his budget to be able to claim to the public he \nhas presented a balanced budget proposal. We need to have these budget \nplans, not only for what we expect to happen in the future, but how we \nplan to appropriate money for this year. If, for example, there is a \nway to eliminate $12.9 billion out of the VA Administration budget and \nnot harm veterans medical care, then maybe we ought to be looking at \nthat plan right now so we can make sure that we meet all our \ncommitments for housing for low-income people in this country, because \nwe are\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\ngoing to be very mightily squeezed to achieve the necessary funding \nthat we need for our ongoing commitments.\n  The President's budget asked for a couple of new hospitals. How is he \ngoing to build new hospitals when he is looking at a 23-percent cut \nthat is going to wind up shutting down at least one-quarter of the \ninstitutions now in the VA system? That makes the cuts on other \nfacilities even greater. There is no way responsibly you can be \nbuilding new hospitals and planning for an increase this year if you \nare going to take a 23-percent cut immediately thereafter. It does not \nmake any sense.\n  What appears to be going on here is that there are two sets of books. \nOne is what the President talks about whenever he wants to say he has a \nbalanced budget, because there are a lot of people--I know, I have \ntalked to a lot of people in my State who say we have to balance the \nbudget, we have to cut spending, and I agree with them, because we are \nmortgaging our future and threatening our children's security by \nspending more than we take in.\n\n  On the other hand, the President has another set of books whenever he \nwants to tell them that he is protecting their priorities and not \ncausing any political pain. It is truly breathtaking to see the ease \nwith which the President shifts effortlessly back and forth between the \ntwo sets of books. Using this set of books, he is a tough budget \ncutter.\n  Now, in the next speech, when he gets on the radio and talks to \nveterans on Veterans Day, he is the mainstream protector against those \nextremists, Republicans and other budget cutters, who are gutting these \nfavorite programs, cutting programs that are vital for the services we \nmust provide.\n  My question very simply is, Mr. President, which set of books are we \nto believe? That is why I, along with several of my colleagues on the \nBudget Committee, have written a series of letters to OMB Director \nRivlin asking for clarification and the details on which budget is \ngoing to be followed. We have also written to several agencies asking \nthem what actions they are taking to plan for the outyear cuts. We want \nto know from the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, Federal Highway Administration, the Under Secretary of \nAgriculture for the School Lunch Program and WIC Program how they would \nwork with those cuts.\n  Then, in a hearing before our committee, I asked the EPA \nAdministrator Browner what their plans would be for handling the \nreductions. The Administrator of EPA told me that EPA was a priority. \nShe was absolutely sure that EPA would not face the 10-percent cut in \n2001 and an additional 18-percent cut in 2002, as prescribed in this \nbook.\n  Then I joined another subcommittee on which I serve to question the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary Donna Shalala, about \nthe cuts that are being planned in her agency. Secretary Shalala told \nme that in her budget, she was absolutely convinced that NIH would not \nbe cut, Indian Health Services would not be cut, HCFA administrative \ncosts would not be cut, Head Start would not be cut, the Ryan White \nAIDS Program would not be cut, and there may be others as well.\n  So far, what I am getting back is, we see these drastic cuts \nproposed, but nobody is going to be cut. That has to be the best of all \npossible worlds. You are going to balance the budget with cuts, but you \nare not going to cut anybody.\n  I received an interesting followup, a response--actually, it was \naddressed to Senator Shelby who had joined with me in the letter I sent \nto the Food and Drug Administration. We sent a letter to Dr. Kessler \nasking how the FDA would handle their cuts. Well, they must have placed \na high priority on our request, because it was signed by the Acting \nAssociate Commissioner for Legislative Affairs, and she wrote back with \nthis very clear statement:\n\n       FDA is moving ahead with Agency budgeting plans for the \n     immediate future based on the budget authority by function \n     and program as contained in the health function forecasted to \n     the year 2002 of the President's fiscal year 1997 budget.\n\n  Let me interpret. As best I can understand, that means that the FDA \nis planning on a budget that reflects the figures in the initial book \npresentation prior to the triggered cuts. In other words, the figures \nin this book show spending that would be about $81 billion out of \nbalance. The only way the President gets to balance is to employ a \ntrigger mechanism to make 10 percent cuts in 2001 and 18 percent cuts \nin 2002.\n  So it appears that the FDA is planning on smooth sailing. They are \ngoing to sail along in the out-of-balance budget because they, too, \napparently do not plan on making any cuts.\n  So no one is being cut, yet somehow the budget is being balanced. Let \nus get at the truth. Which set of books is the real Clinton budget? Now \nthat the cat is out of the bag and we know that there are two sets of \nbooks, what is the administration's response?\n  Well, this is really interesting. I have just seen a Monday \nAssociated Press article, I believe it was printed June 11 in the \nWashington Times. It says:\n\n       In an unusual public admission, two top Clinton \n     administration officials say the White House will not \n     necessarily pursue some cuts in veterans and space programs.\n\n  Then they went on to say that the comments by the people who had \ntestified before my committee were politically awkward.\n\n       . . . another official said privately that Mr. Brown and \n     Mr. Goldin would be talked to.\n\n  That means somebody in the administration is going to talk to VA \nSecretary Brown and NASA Administrator Dan Goldin. They are going to be \ntalked to? Talked to about what? About telling the truth that the \nadministration has no intention of balancing the budget? That their \nbudget is a sham, exposing the second set of books to the light of day? \nOr does that mean they are going to be told to go back and start \nplanning on making those very serious cuts in their Agency?\n  Somehow, Mr. President, I do not believe they are being told they \nhave to go back and make those cuts. Now, I may be wrong. I am from \nMissouri, and you can show me. If the Veterans' Administration comes in \nwith a set of figures that shows how they take $12.9 billion out of \ntheir budget in the next 6 years, then we will take a look at it. But \nthat is why I have said recently that we want some honest answers to \nthe questions we have posed to OMB Director Rivlin: Where will the $67 \nbillion in triggered spending cuts fall? Are certain programs exempt \nfrom cuts as claimed--education, environment, law enforcement? Are the \nnumbers in their budget real for VA? Is Secretary Brown wrong or right \nin his claim that the President assured him the cuts proposed would not \nhappen? And if the VA numbers are not true, what else in the \nPresident's budget should we disbelieve?\n  If none of these programs are to be cut, are there really other cuts \nthat are going to be made in the administration's implementation of \ntheir budget? Too often in Washington, no one is accountable, but this \nissue is too important to be treated as if it were business as usual \nand it does not really matter.\n  A Cabinet Secretary and an agency head have apparently let the cat \nout of the bag, and for their candor, they are being talked to.\n  The administration officials who keep playing the Clinton budget \ngame, described in a column by David Broder on Sunday, have been talked \nto. But what are the creators of the two sets of books designed to fool \nthe public into doing? Are they being talked to? Only those two \nofficials who happen to tell Congress and the public what is actually \ngoing on, they are the ones to blame, according to this news article. \nThat is wrong.\n  Until we get some answers to the basic simple questions of which set \nof books is the real set, I will continue to pursue these questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article from the \nMonday Associated Press and the article by David Broder be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 10, 1996]\n\n           VA, NASA Chiefs Contradict Clinton Plans for Cuts\n\n       In an unusual public admission, two top Clinton \n     administration officials say the White House will not \n     necessarily pursue some cuts in veterans and space programs \n     that it proposed in its budget-balancing package just three \n     months ago.\n       The recent remarks by Veterans Affairs Secretary Jesse \n     Brown and NASA chief Daniel Goldin put the administration in \n     the position of disavowing details of its own plans for \n     eliminating deficits by 2002. And the comments come during \n     President Clinton's reelection campaign, in which one \n     Republican\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\n     strategy has been to attack his commitment to balancing the \n     budget.\n       ``They're keeping two sets of books, one to balance the \n     budget, the other to avoid cuts in agencies that would cause \n     problems in the election,'' said Sen. Christopher S. Bond, \n     Missouri Republican, who elicited the comments from Mr. Brown \n     and Mr. Goldin.\n       ``This is well thought through as a political avoidance \n     strategy, a downside-avoidance strategy,'' said Senate Budget \n     Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici, New Mexico Republican.\n       Administration officials and Democrats said Mr. Clinton was \n     sticking to his overall plan to eliminate annual deficits by \n     2002 but would review details every year, a fact of life in \n     the government's annual budgeting process.\n       ``The president is committed to the overall numbers. They \n     reflect his commitment to getting to a balanced budget by \n     2002,'' said Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget. ``But the priorities will be revisited \n     annually, as they are on the Hill.''\n       But conceding that the comments were politically awkward, \n     another official said privately that Mr. Brown and Mr. Goldin \n     would be talked to.\n       Mr. Clinton has proposed slight increases for education, \n     environment and technological research. Because there is a \n     fixed amount of money for these and other annually approved \n     programs, other areas must be cut.\n       Mr. Brown and Mr. Goldin made their comments in separate \n     appearance before the Senate Appropriation subcommittee that \n     oversees space, veterans and other programs, which was \n     holding hearings on the budget for fiscal 1997. The fiscal \n     year begins Oct. 1.\n       On May 3, Mr. Brown told the panel the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs ``cannot live'' with the cuts proposed in \n     the agency's budget beyond fiscal 1997 by either Mr. Clinton \n     or Congress. He said the Clinton cuts would force the agency \n     to deny care to 1 million veterans and close the equivalent \n     of 41 hospitals.\n       ``The president has told me personally . . . he will \n     negotiate the VA's budget each and ever year with the \n     veterans of this nation,'' Mr. Brown said.\n       Asked by Mr. Bond, the panel's chairman, whether he \n     expected to see the future-year cuts Clinton has proposed, \n     Mr. Brown responded, ``I would be shocked.''\n       On May 16, Mr. Goldin told the panel that ``the White House \n     has instructed us to make no precipitous action'' on cutting \n     NASA programs after 1997.\n       Mrs. Rivlin said the spending figures Mr. Clinton proposed \n     for many programs after 1997 were ``not finely tuned \n     assessments of what exactly would be needed each year.''\n       ``That's a normal thing,'' she added.\n       Democrats said GOP-written budgets have long included \n     unworkable long-range assumptions. For example, they said, \n     the new GOP budget-balancing plan assumes that proposed tax \n     cuts will get smaller in 2002, and that less should be spent \n     for defense than Mr. Clinton wants. Both are considered \n     politically unrealistic.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 10, 1996]\n\n                         Clinton's Budget Game\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       A recent exchange between Sen. Christopher (Kit) Bond (R-\n     Mo.) and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown casts a \n     clear light on the reality behind the partisan rhetoric of \n     the past week's budget debate.\n       Bond is chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that \n     handles the VA budget. He was grilling Brown on President \n     Clinton's budget proposal for veterans' health care and \n     hospitalization. For next year, Bond noted, Clinton is urging \n     a level of spending for this politically important \n     constituency more than $1 billion higher than it was in 1995. \n     But in the following two years--after the election--Clinton's \n     budget would cut that spending from $17 billion down to $14 \n     billion, and then slice it further.\n       How can you meet your obligations to veterans under that \n     budget? Bond asked. ``Sen. Bond, we cannot,'' Brown replied. \n     If funding were to remain flat (as Republicans have \n     proposed), ``it would force us to deny care to about a \n     million veterans and it would force us to close the \n     equivalent of 41 hospitals. So obviously . . . we will not be \n     able to live with the red line'' showing the postelection \n     cuts suggested by Clinton.\n       And then Brown made this eyebrow-raising statement: ``The \n     president understands that. I talked with him personally \n     about it and . . . he gave me his personal commitment that he \n     was going to make sure that the nation honors its commitments \n     to veterans and that he will negotiate the budget each and \n     every year . . . with the veterans of the nation.''\n       Bond: ``So you are saying that these out-years mean \n     nothing. It is all going to be negotiated in the future, so \n     we should not worry about the president's budget plan. . . . \n     You are not planning to live with that budget?''\n       Brown: ``I am not planning to live with it. I am not \n     planning to live with your budget . . . nor am I planning to \n     live with the president's line.''\n       Bond: ``You do not work for us. You work for the president. \n     You are saying that you do not like our budget, but you know \n     that his budget does not mean anything.''\n       After this remarkable exchange, Bond made similar inquiries \n     of the director of another huge agency, Dan Goldin of NASA. \n     He too said that White House budget officials had told him to \n     make no plans based on the sharp cuts indicated for future \n     years in Clinton's budget. As Goldin put it, ``the White \n     House has instructed us to take no precipitous action on out-\n     year budgets, and we are taking them at their word.''\n       To Bond and other Republicans, this looks suspiciously like \n     a shell game. The president has told Congress and the country \n     that he can achieve a balanced budget by 2002, without the \n     serious savings in Medicare and Medicaid that Republicans \n     have proposed. At the same time, he has said that he can keep \n     spending in five or six priority areas at least even with \n     inflation.\n       He can do all that, he has said, by cutting ``Less \n     important'' spending. Veterans and space budgets are not on \n     his priority list. But the men running these programs say \n     they have assurances that the numbers the White House has \n     given Congress are just paper figures--not mandates to \n     prepare for belt-tightening.\n       White House Budget Director Alice Rivlin has assured Bond \n     and his colleagues--and then tried to convince me--that there \n     is no contradiction. ``Simply put,'' Rivlin wrote Bond, ``the \n     president is committed to the discretionary savings needed to \n     help reach balance in 2002 . . . but will continue to revisit \n     decisions about specific programs one year at a time.''\n       ``Nobody is cheating,'' Rivlin insisted in an interview \n     with me.\n       ``I don't think it washes,'' Bond said. ``It's not an \n     honest budget.''\n       Two things are going on here. Clinton, in his desire to \n     dodge serious cuts in politically popular programs such as \n     Medicare and Medicaid, while promising more spending for \n     education, the environment and law enforcement, is projecting \n     cuts in other programs that are so severe they will be very \n     hard to achieve. That is why people like Brown and Goldin say \n     the cuts are unimaginable.\n       And second, in order to postpone the pain, Clinton is \n     telling not just the constituents of the endangered programs \n     but their managers that they will have plenty of \n     opportunities in future years to stave off the cuts.\n       That may not be ``cheating,'' as Rivlin says, but it is \n     playing a game that is too clever by half. Balancing the \n     budget means making tough choices. Clinton is postponing \n     those choices and--by giving people the sense that the goal \n     can be reached without giving up anything that is important--\n     making it that much harder when the crunch comes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I want to congratulate the Senator on this \neffort. For a couple of months he has been trying to tell the American \npeople that there were two sets of books and that, indeed, if you use \nthe set of books that gets a balanced budget in the same way that we \ndo--because the President now says, ``You asked me to get a balanced \nbudget using Congressional Budget Office assessments''--of the two \nsets, if you use the same set of numbers of economic assumptions that \nwe have been compelled to use, then all of those cuts that are called \ntriggered cuts have to be in the budget or it is not in balance. Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So what the President has done is he has two balanced \nbudgets, one using the same economic assumptions that we have used, \nwhich he told the American people, ``They have told me to use that, and \nI've used it, and I'm in balance,'' but he has another budget when he \ndoes not use those same economic assumptions. He uses his own, prepared \nby the Office of Management and Budget, under the direction of the \nexecutive branch. And that is the second set of books.\n  Which set of books are we telling the American people balances the \nbudget? I believe the President is making it very clear that he \nbalances the budget the same way we do. But then he produces a second \nset of books where he does not have to have as many cuts, he does not \nhave to have these triggered cuts because the economics are so much \nbetter that he can get by with less.\n  Let us make it very clear, if we talk about the President's budget \nthat is just like our budget in terms of which level you are jumping \nover, where is the stick that you are doing your high jump over? Using \nthe same one for both, then there is no way that the President can be \nin balance without cutting, in the last 2 years of this budget, \ndiscretionary programs by 10 percent and 18 percent respectively. Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. BOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it not in that regard that the Senator has been \ninquiring, and has the Senator not been saying, under the real budget, \nthe budget\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\nusing the Congressional Budget Office numbers, what are you going to do \nto the veterans? Is that not when the Senator is getting the answers \nthat they do not believe they are going to do this? Is that a fair \nassumption?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is actually worse than that. It is \nactually worse than that. It is not just the triggered cuts that fall \nvery heavily on the veterans.\n  But let me say, earlier in my remarks, I came to the floor to say \nthat the Senator from New Mexico, under his leadership, has produced a \nbalanced budget, an honest balanced budget that makes some very \ndifficult choices. People do not like it because it is an honest \nbudget, and it has had to make some difficult choices. But the \nPresident has submitted a budget which he claims is in balance, but he \nhas told his people not to worry about it.\n  Now the cuts in the Veterans' Administration are not just the result \nof the triggered cuts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No.\n  Mr. BOND. The cuts in the Veterans' Administration begin \nprecipitously in 1998, even under his OMB assumptions. Even using the \nrosy scenario, he would still chop that Veterans' Administration budget \nby 23 percent prior to the time that the triggering budget cuts would \nhave to be implemented in 2001 and 2002.\n\n  So regardless of which set of assumptions he uses, even under his \nfavorable budget, the favorable budget that he set up originally that \ndid not have the triggered cuts in it, he slashes VA by 23 percent, and \nthat was the first thing that tipped us off that maybe there was \nanother set of books that we had not seen.\n  He had apparently convinced the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the \nVeterans' Administration, that those cuts, even the ones he had in his \nOMB-approved numbers beginning in 1998, were not going to happen. That \nis why we cannot make an honest comparison between the numbers that the \nSenator has presented and the numbers that the Clinton administration \nclaim come to a zero deficit in the year 2002, if we are being assured \nby all of the agencies that they do not have to plan for these cuts. \nThey have no intention of making these cuts because the President and \nOMB have told them, ``Don't worry about making the cuts.'' Something is \namiss here.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Senator, one of the reasons that that \nprecipitous fall occurs, even under the OMB budget, is because the \nPresident desires to tell the American people that certain parts of \nGovernment are going to get increased and so he has built into that \nbudget these very large increases for education, for the environment, \nwhich end up, if you go that high on them, you have to take it out of \nsomewhere else. That is where the veterans get that big cut the Senator \nhas spoken to.\n  Mr. BOND. That is what happens when you establish priorities. If \nthat, in fact, is his priority that he wants to put veterans that far \ndown on the list, then we ought to be debating it. And we did have a \ndebate on this floor. The Republicans voted to amend the President's \nproposal by taking additional savings out of welfare. Even my \nDemocratic colleagues, who did vote for that proposal, had voted for \nanother one that restored those cuts. Nobody agrees with those \npriorities that the President has proposed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to thank the Senator once again for the \nexcellent work he has done. And it ought to be clear to everyone, the \nPresident of the United States does not have a balanced budget. He does \nnot have a balanced budget using the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, which he has touted across the land, unless he is willing to \nadmit that these programs get tremendous cuts starting in 1998, 1999, \n2000, 2001, 2002, which he clearly does not want to tell the American \npeople. That is how I see it.\n  These Cabinet members who are seeing these cuts are being told, \n``We'll look at them once every year. We're evaluating them every \nyear.'' You can evaluate them every year, but if there is a very large \ncut in a program, somebody has to be cut, right?\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for that very \nimportant clarification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BOND. Frankly, if it did not matter what we are going to spend in \nthe outyears because we would negotiate it anyhow, we would not present \nmultiyear budgets. We have to do that as part of a responsible plan \nprocess, Mr. President, so we know if we are on a path to get our \nFederal spending machine under control.\n\n  When we see a budget presented that claims to have significant cuts, \nbut the people who would be affected have been assured by the President \nand OMB that those cuts will not be made, we can only conclude that \neither there is a very secret second set of books which eliminates \nprograms we have not been able to identify, or the President and his \nOffice of Management and Budget are not serious about balancing the \nbudget and making the limitation in cuts in discretionary spending to \nachieve that balance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nproceed for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I did not come to respond to my friends \nfrom Missouri or New Mexico, but I find it kind of interesting. You \nknow, we deal with names and these issues so much, and we use the \njargon so much, that sometimes it is pretty interesting and pretty \nconfusing to the American people. I am not suggesting that the things \nthat either of my colleagues have said is not substantively correct, \nbut I would suggest it is out of context.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, would the Senator----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will not yield until I explain what I said. Then I will \nbe happy to yield.\n  First of all, the Republican-appointed Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office states in the latest CBO report--and I quote from the \nsummary page:\n\n       Both the Congress and the President, however, have proposed \n     changes in policies that would balance the budget in 2002.\n\n  Let me read it again.\n\n       Both the Congress and the President, however, have proposed \n     changes in policies that would balance the budget in the year \n     2002.\n\n  I am reading from the ``Economic and Budget Outlook, Fiscal Years \n1997 to 2002, Report to the Senate and House Committees on the Budget, \nCongress of the United States, Congressional Budget Office.''\n  The second point that I will make: That does not suggest that what my \nfriend said is not true, but it is kind of like you have to watch the \npea and the shells here.\n  The idea of these dual books, the President all along has said the \neconomy is going to grow more robustly, has all along said that the \nCBO's estimates are too cabined, that things are going to be better \nthan they say. So far he looks like he is right. But he said, ``You \nwant me to do it according to the way you want the numbers,'' which I \ndo not think are realistic numbers. I think they are too conservative. \nBusiness thinks they are too conservative. Everybody thinks they are \ntoo conservative except our conservative Republican friends.\n  He said, ``OK, if that's the deal, I'll submit a budget based on \nthat.'' And he submitted a budget based on that. Their Republican-\nappointed Director of the Congressional Budget Office said, ``Yeah, he \nsubmitted one on that, and it balances that way.''\n  It is not, then, inconsistent for the President to say, ``By the way, \nI submitted it,'' but basically saying, ``I am predicting to you things \nare going to be better than these economic forecasts called for. If it \nturns out the economic forecast is as bad as you all say it is going to \nbe, then this is what we're going to have to do to balance it. I will \nbalance it under those conditions.''\n  But what he is saying makes it sound sinister, this two-book thing. \nHe is saying, ``But my prediction to you is, you won't have to do it \nthis badly, you won't have to cut this much.'' He is not saying, ``I \nwon't do it if the economic forecasts turn out this way.'' He is just \nsaying, ``I don't think the economic forecasts are going to be that \nway.''\n  You know, it is kind of like my saying to my son or my daughter when \nthey were teenagers--they say, ``Dad, I want to go away to camp, and I \nwould like to go for 2 weeks to camp.'' I say, ``How much is camp, \nhoney?'' They say,\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\n``Well, it's $100 a week.'' I say, ``I don't have $200. I've got $100. \nWe'll sign you up for camp for 1 week. You're going, but I think I'm \ngoing to find another $100, and I think before it's time to go to camp \nyou'll get to go for 2 weeks because I think economically I'm going to \nfind another $100. But if I don't, you only go for 1 week.''\n  These guys make everything sound so sinister. Like, you know, ``Well, \nlet's find the fingerprints on budget No. 2.''\n  So all I am saying to you is, keep your eye on the ball. The bottom \nline in this budget debate, no pun intended, is the summary of the \nRepublican-led Congressional Budget Office that says--unless they \nchanged their mind in the last couple hours--both the Congress and the \nPresident, however, have proposed changes in policy that would balance \nthe budget in 2002.\n  Now, Mr. President, a number of our colleagues, including two who \nhave just spoken, have once again attacked the President's budget as \nproviding too little in appropriated spending. I find this a \nfascinating debate. They say, ``By the way, you are not going to \nbalance the budget because you have two books. You really do not mean \nit. You are really going to cut something you have not told us,'' et \ncetera. But then they say, ``By the way, one of the reasons we do not \nlike this President's budget is it provides too little in appropriated \nspending.''\n  They criticize the President's cuts as being too painful. It is true, \nthe President's budget does make substantial cuts in discretionary \nspending. But the cuts in the Republican budget are far deeper. Over \nthe 6 years of the budget, the Republican budget cuts appropriated \nspending by $68 billion more than the President's budget. In the year \nabout which the Senator from Missouri most complains, 2002, the \nRepublican budget cuts appropriated spending by $16 billion more than \ndoes the President's budget, using the assumptions that we are both \nusing.\n  If the Senator from Missouri and others find the President's budget \ncuts too painful, and they are painful, he must find the Republican \nbudget positively deadly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent two tables comparing the cuts \nin the Republican budget with those of the President's budget be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                COMPARISON OF BUDGET PLANS: 6-YEAR TOTALS               \n                        [In billions of dollars]                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   President's   Republican             \n                                      budget       budget     Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending cuts:                                                          \n    Discretionary................         -230         -298          -68\n    Mandatory:                                                          \n        Medicare.................         -117         -168          -51\n        Medicaid.................          -54          -72          -18\n        Other health \\1\\.........            9           10            1\n        Welfare..................          -38          -53          -15\n        EITC.....................           -5          -19          -14\n        Spectrum auctions........          -37          -19           18\n        Other mandatory..........          -24          -34          -10\n                                  --------------------------------------\n          Subtotal...............         -265         -355          -90\n                                  ======================================\nRevenues: \\2\\                                                           \n        Tax relief and other.....           99          180           81\n        Corporate reforms........          -40          -21           19\n        Other proposals..........           -5          (?)            5\n        Expiring provisions......          -43          -36            7\n                                  --------------------------------------\n          Subtotal...............           11          122          112\n                                  ======================================\nPolicy savings...................         -485         -531          -46\nDebt service.....................          -41          -49           -8\n                                  --------------------------------------\n      Total savings..............         -525         -580          -55\n2002 deficit/surplus.............            0            5            5\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Health care reforms in President's budget; GME add-back in          \n  Republican plan.                                                      \n\\2\\ The Republican plan reconciles a net tax change of $122 billion over\n  6 years, but includes reserve fund language that allows for additional\n  tax cuts on a revenue neutral basis.

Is the distinguished Senator from Delaware ready to respond \nto a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If you let me complete, I will take 12 minutes and respond \nto any questions you have. I know that if I start to respond--I did not \ncome to make the statement I just made. I am just responding to what I \nheard. Let me make the statement I came prepared to make and then yield \nto the Senator for anything he wants to say or ask.\n  Mr. President, to state the obvious, a budget, whether it is a \nhousehold budget, whether it is a company's budget, whether it is the \nNation's budget, is the formal expression of our priorities as a \ncompany or as a family or as a nation. It tells us, after all the talk \nis over, where we decided to spend our hard-earned money. In this case, \nthe hard-earned money of taxpayers like all of us.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the budget resolution before the \nSenate, in my view, fails to address the most fundamental issues before \nthe country. It fails to take care of the basic priorities that have \nmade our Nation great, the priorities that can help us meet the \nchallenges of the future. Again, I think we can all agree on one thing. \nI used to be on the Budget Committee. I am delighted I am no longer on \nthe Budget Committee. I was on it for a long time. When I used to be on \nthe Budget Committee and had to give it up to move over to other \ncommittees, new members come and say, ``What do you think about getting \non the Budget Committee?'' Or I speak to university groups or \nconstituents at home and they say, ``What about the Budget Committee?'' \nI say that the single most important thing a new Member of the Congress \ncan do is be a member of the Budget Committee. Just like the single \nmost important thing you can do if you go with a big company is look at \nthe company's budget.\n  When all the rhetoric is gone, and everything is stripped aside, \nwhere we spend our money says volumes about what our real priorities \nare. If we say we care about education and do not spend money on \neducation, then we obviously do not care about it very much. If we say \nwe care about crime in dealing with crime and do not allocate our \nresources there, we do not care about it very much. If we say we care a \nlot about a national defense, and we do spend our money on it, it \nestablishes we do care a lot about national defense. We say to \nstudents, if you want to know what a company really does, what a family \nreally cares about, what a nation cares about, go look at its budget, \nits budget. I do not think anybody could disagree with that, have any \nreasonable disagreement with that. It lays out our priorities as a \nnation.\n  The point I want to make in the next few minutes, I think we have in \nthe budget before the Senate, the Republican budget, our priorities out \nof whack. It is not a bad budget. It is not an awful budget, not a \ndraconian budget. We can say a lot of political things about it. The \nreal debate on this budget is no longer about no matter what you hear \npeople say here, we are going to balance the budget, are we committed \nto balance the budget; it is how we balance a budget, how we balance a \nbudget.\n  It is just like a family can decide if your child gets into Harvard \nUniversity whether you are going to spend $25,000, meaning that you \ncannot buy a car for the next 4 years. Or you can buy a new car for the \nnext 4 years and send your kid to my alma mater, the University of \nDelaware, which will cost $7,000. There are priorities. I happen to \nthink a Delaware education is better than a Harvard education, but that \nis a personal thing.\n  It is real important when we talk all the mumbo jumbo out of this and \nunderstand what this debate is about. It is about where we are going to \nspend money, and even more importantly in\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\nthis environment, where we will cut. There is no way to get from here \nto balance under anybody's numbers, anybody's numbers, any assumptions, \nshort of divine intervention by the Lord, without cutting.\n\n  It is a question. You can measure one's value system based on how \nmuch more they spend on something, how much more they cut. When you \nhave to cut, who do you cut it from? Do you cut it and decide you are \ngoing to cut it from your children's education and still go to the \nbeach for 2 weeks, or are you going to decide to cut the beach and \nspend it on your children's education? It says something about how much \na family values education. It says something about how much they value \nvacations. I am not making a value judgment. A vacation for one family \nmay be more therapeutically needed than an education for another child. \nThat is literally what it does. That is what this fight is about. That \nis the difference between Democrats and Republicans here. It is not \nthat we both decided to say, ``I like being with a party that has a \nletter that begins earlier in the alphabet.'' That is not the reason \nwhy I am a Democrat or why my friends are Republicans. We have \ndifferent priorities here.\n  How do you best make the Nation function? I do not doubt for one \nsecond the positive patriotic intentions of my Republican colleagues. \nThey proposed this budget not because they are mean-spirited. They \nproposed it because they believe this is truly the best way for the \nmost Americans to do the best. We have a disagreement. I think America \nwill not prosper spiritually, morally, economically, politically, as \nwell, under their set of budget priorities than they do under mine or \nmy parties or the President's. That is what this is about.\n  You all are going to get the smokescreen out. ``There are a secret \nset of books buried somewhere in the Capitol, and in the year 2002 we \nwill open them and you will find the fingerprints of John Q. Wilson who \nworked for the FBI in 1974''--what are we talking about? We should have \na straight up-and-down fight. They do not want to spend as much money \non education as we want to. They do not want to spend as much on the \nenvironment as we want to spend. They do not want to spend as much \nmoney in law enforcement as we do. We do not want to spend as much on \ndefense, or as much on the wealthy as they do, and so on. They are \nlegitimate, fundamental, disagreements. I think we should do the \nAmerican people a favor. Have a referendum on what they want, which \ntheory they buy into.\n  My comments, the remainder of them, are directed at why I think my \ntheory, my party's theory, my party's priorities, are better not only \nfor average Americans but for the community of America, than are those \nof my Republican friends. I do not doubt their good intentions, I want \nto make it clear. I do not think they sit in the Cloakroom and say, \n``You know, how can we make sure that John Kluge makes more money?'' \nSome of my left-wing friends think they sit there and say, ``Well, how \nare we going to get the wealthy to do better at the expense of the \npoor?'' I no more believe that than I think this chair can get up and \nlevitate. They believe the way to help the poor the best is to see that \nthose who have the most have the greatest freedom and prosperity to \ninvest. I found that theory does not necessarily follow. I have a \ndisagreement.\n  Let me make it clear, lest anyone come out here. I do not question \nthe intentions, motivation, or sincerity of any of my Republican \ncolleagues. I think they are wrong--not morally wrong--wrong. They will \nnot turn out as you predict.\n  Mr. President, each year education becomes ever more important to \nkeep our economy growing and to enable our citizens to become \nproductive members of society. This budget in question cuts, in my \nview, too much from education.\n  (Mr. BROWN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. By eliminating the guaranteed student loan program it \nmakes college education even more expensive, in my view. And far from \nincreasing our commitment to a better-trained work force, the budget \nprovides less and less money for education and training as we move into \nthe next century. In real terms, adjusted for inflation, their budget \ncuts spending by $25 billion for spending in this area over the next 6 \nyears.\n  Look, we can argue about elementary and secondary education, we can \nargue about whether or not prayer in school will change it, or we can \nargue about whether or not spending more money in title I will change \nit, and we can argue about how bad off our education is. There is one \nthing there is no argument about. We have the best higher education \nsystem in the world--in the world. It is the only place we do not have \nto look at any little thing and say we rank 7th, 17th, 91st--we rank \nNo. 1 in the world in higher education.\n  So what are we doing? As more and more people from different \ncountries are beating their brains out to get into our higher education \nsystem, we are--I suspect unintentionally--making it harder for \nAmericans to get into educational institutions of higher learning. We \nare not arguing about the quality of that education.\n  My Republican friends--in my State, at least--like to argue what \nRonald Reagan argued: You know the best way to cure education is to \nspend less money on it. The one place nobody makes that argument is \nhigher education. That is what I mean when I talk about guaranteed \nstudent loan programs. As for our country's commitment to our parents' \ngeneration, Mr. President, this budget's Medicare cuts will make health \ncare more expensive than our proposal will. Its cuts in Medicare will \nmake nursing home and long-term care a greater burden for families of \nthose whose seniors depend on them.\n  Whenever we talk about Medicare, we always talk in terms of the \neffect on seniors. That is not how I talk about it. Where I come from, \nI talk about it based on the values I was raised with. Can you imagine, \nI say to anybody listening here, if your mom or dad comes to you and \nsays, ``You know, honey, under the changes taking place, I am no longer \nable to see Dr. Smith, and I have to do'' this, that or the other \nthing--can you imagine any decent child in a position to financially \ntake care of them not saying, ``Do not worry, mom, I will pay for it.''\n  Who do you think is going to pay for this? Middle-class parents. The \npeople who are 45 to 55, who have children coming up through school \ntrying to get into higher education and have moms and dads with \nincreasing medical bills or needs. I wonder how many Americans--men or \nwomen, husband or wife--are going to turn to their mother and father or \nmother-in-law and father-in-law and say, ``It is too bad that they \nchanged the system that way. You have less money for health care, and I \nam not chipping in.'' This is going to increase the burden on my \ngeneration, which is getting squeezed.\n  Now, again, I do not suggest that is why it is being done. I suggest \nthat we have different priorities, because one of the things my friend \nsaid is that if we spend more money on education, we have to cut \nsomething else here. If we spend more money on Medicare, we have to cut \nsomething else down here. This is not a zero sum game. This is not one \nof these things where I can say if you buy into my proposal, you get \neverything. I am not saying that. This is different priorities.\n\n  In my view, the place where we should be putting all of our energy is \nto deal with the shrinking middle class, which is getting their brains \nkicked in. We all acknowledge that.\n  Mr. President, most troubling for me is the failure of this budget \nresolution to fully fund the most basic function of Government--that is \nthe purpose of my being here today--which is to protect our citizens \nfrom violent crime.\n  Mr. President, let me first review the facts that underscore just how \nwe have come to face a budget resolution that cuts funding for the \nadministration of justice account--that is a fancy Senate term for the \nmoney we spend on law enforcement--below what the President requested, \nbelow what the U.S. Senate has passed, and below what the House of \nRepresentatives has passed. Let me review what has gone on so far. The \nPresident requested a total of $23.5 billion for 1997, $5 billion of \nwhich is for the crime law trust fund--which I am proud to say I was \nthe author of, along with several others--to fund the entire Justice \nDepartment, which includes the FBI, DEA, prisons, other Federal law \nenforcement, and the courts--they are all included. Then the House-\npassed\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nbudget resolution proposed by the Republican leadership of the House of \nRepresentatives, by a narrow partisan vote--that sounds pejorative; I \nmean a narrow vote that was based on party lines--226-195; 221 \nRepublicans voted for it, 4 against, and 190 Democrats voted against \nit, 5 for.\n  What did that House budget resolution do? It cut the President's \n$23.5 billion request for law enforcement, and all the functions \nrelated to that, to $22.1 billion, a cut of $1.4 billion. Included in \nthis was a $317 million cut for the crime law trust fund. That is the \nthing that funds all the cops--the State cops, local cops, the 100,000 \ncops--and that is the thing that funds prison money for States. That is \nthe thing that funds that whole crime law.\n  Then the Senate passed a budget resolution offered by Chairman \nDomenici. Unlike the House, to his credit, Chairman Domenici fully \nfunded the $5 billion requested by the President for the crime law \ntrust fund. But the Senate budget resolution cut the total from the \nadministration of justice account--that is everything else--to $21.7 \nbillion. That is a cut of $1.8 billion below what the President wants.\n  Again, we are talking priorities here. We acknowledge that if we \nspend $1.8 billion more on crime than the Republicans want, we have to \nfind $1.8 billion somewhere not to spend it. We acknowledge that. The \npoint I am making is the priorities here. We do not think we should cut \nit from there.\n  Finally, the House and the Senate Republicans offered the Senate a \nconference report. For those listening, that is when the House passes \ntheir bill and the Senate passes their bill on the same subject, but \nthey are different in detail. So we have a conference and literally \nmeet in a room in the middle of the Capitol somewhere and work out the \ndifferences. Then we send back a compromised version, called a \nconference report, to the House and Senate, which has to be voted on \nagain.\n  Now, the House and Senate Republicans offered the Senate a conference \nreport that makes even deeper cuts than were made by either the House \nor the Senate in the Senate-passed resolutions to the President's \nrequest for crime-fighting dollars.\n  The conference cuts the President's $23.5 billion to $20.9 billion, a \ncut of $2.6 billion. So it has gone from $1.2 to $1.8 to $2.6 billion \nless being spent on crime fighting. In fact, this cut would put the \nadministration of justice account, in 1997, below the 1996 level by $45 \nbillion. We will spend less next year than this past year if this \nbudget resolution were to become law, if we do what it proposes.\n\n  Mr. President, by the way, what happened to all the tough-on-crime \nrhetoric that we have been hearing from all sides--Democrats and \nRepublicans? Neither side is immune from being shameless in talking \nabout how tough on crime they are. It seems that the President held up \nhis end of the bargain. He requested the largest ever annual budget for \nthe FBI, DEA, U.S. attorneys, and help for the State and local prisons \nand police. But a majority of the Congress has been AWOL--absent \nwithout law enforcement leave here. If the proposed cut of $317 million \nfor the crime law trust fund is allowed to stand, there can only be one \nresult: Fewer Federal dollars will be able to combat crime.\n  As my colleagues know, the general numbers of the budget resolution \ndo not specify which programs will be cut. But it is clear that some \nprograms, when they get to the appropriators, will have to be cut below \nwhat the President and what I and others want. What specifically might \nthis mean? Let us just review the law enforcement efforts funded by the \ncrime law trust fund. We fund Federal prosecutors out of that fund in \nthe amount of $55 million; the FBI, $40 million; the DEA, $200 million; \nborder enforcement and deportation of aliens who break the law, $525 \nmillion. By the way, we spent weeks on the floor talking about why that \nis so important. The violence against women efforts including more \npolice and prosecutors and more shelters for battered women, $254 \nmillion. A billion dollars for the construction of prisons and \nreimbursing States from imprisoning criminal aliens. And an additional \n$2.6 billion is to aid State and local law enforcement.\n  We all know there is no free lunch. So if there is a cut in the total \nfor the trust fund, at least some of what I just read will have to be \ncut. It is going to be less border patrol, less efforts to combat \nviolence against women, fewer FBI agents, fewer DEA agents. There are \ngoing to be cuts.\n  Again, I am not questioning the motivation. I am just saying there is \nan honest disagreement. I think we should cut other things rather than \ncops, or the FBI, or prison construction. Just because I was the author \nof the law that this funds, I have to acknowledge that. So I lay it \nout. I do have a bit of an interest in it in the sense that I spent 6 \nyears trying to get it passed, but that is not the reason alone. I \nthink it is the single highest domestic priority we have.\n  To review the potential impact of the total cuts of $2.6 billion, let \nus look at how the President proposed to spend his $23.5 billion that \nhe proposes for the administration of justice accounts. Again, we \ncannot be sure specifically what will be cut, but it is clear that \nthere will have to be significant cuts of the President's request.\n  He wants $2.5 billion for the FBI, $818 million for the DEA, $2.2 \nbillion to build Federal prisons and maintain them, $949 million for \nFederal prosecutors, $372 million for interagency drug enforcement task \nforces which every State in the Nation is asking for help on, and $1.7 \nbillion for immigration enforcement.\n  None of us can say where the cuts will have to be made, but if this \nbudget passes, the appropriators are going to have to go out and find \nthat money--hundreds of millions of dollars to cut from each or all of \nthose accounts. There is no way to avoid it. None. Granted, everyone \ncan vote for this budget, and when the FBI says, ``You voted to cut our \nbudget,'' they say ``No, no, I didn't vote to cut your budget. The \nPresident said $2.5 billion, and I want to spend it at $2.5 billion.''\n  Tell me where you are going to cut the $2.7, or whatever the number \nis when we finish here? None of us can say where the cuts will be made, \nbut it is clear there will have to be some significant cuts in all of \nthese key law enforcement initiatives.\n  Is there anyone in this Senate, though, who thinks our Nation will be \nbetter served by a smaller FBI, by a smaller DEA or fewer Federal \nprosecutors? I would like for them to come forward and tell me that. \nAgain, that is a little unfair.\n  That implies, by the way, that I said that people really want to do \nthis. I am not even sure, if we had all the money in the world--\neconomic assumptions are different--that we would have little \ndisagreement about spending all of this money. Maybe a little, \nparticularly by some of our friends on the House side who may think \nthat all Federal agents are jack-booted thugs and who want to cut it \nout and who probably think the Freemen are doing the right thing, and \nso on. If they exist, they are overwhelmingly in the minority. I know \nof none in the Senate.\n  But what we are doing here is, we are saying this is the place we \nshould cut more than we should cut tax exemptions for individuals. This \nis the place we should cut for corporations. This is the place we \nshould cut rather than cut money for the Defense Department. That is \nwhat we are saying. That is what I have difficulty agreeing with.\n  If there are no additional resources, no more FBI agents, no more DEA \nagents, no more Border Patrol, no more prosecutors, no more State and \nlocal police added to our streets, no more drug testing of offenders, \nno more prisons built, all the new laws we can pass will not be worth \nthe paper we write them on. If you are going to pass tough laws and \nsay, ``Put them in prison,'' you have to have a prison to put them in. \nIt costs money. It even costs money to shoot them. It even costs money \nto hang them. It even costs money to inject them lethally. It costs \nmoney.\n\n  Mr. President, this budget resolution shortchanges, in my view, the \nnational effort against crime. I submit that this Congress could pass a \nnew terrorism bill, or any other criminal justice reform, every single \nweek from now until the end of the session, but if it does not require \nmore agents, nor more law enforcement officers, nor more Border Patrol, \nnor more prisons, nor more prosecutors, it ain't worth a darn. But this \nis not the only reason I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\n  America became a great economic power because we developed an \neducational system. Any hope we have to maintain our Nation as the \nworld's most productive economy depends on our willingness to commit \nresources to our workers for the skills which they need. Ours is a \ngreat country because we respect the contributions of those who have \ngone before us--our parents' generation who made us into a leader of \nthe free world.\n  We committed to support them. We committed to support what they have \ndone to guarantee them the health care they need and deserve. We made \nthat commitment. We made the commitment not only because they are \nparents but for what they did to build this country. Americans \neverywhere want and deserve clean air and clean water and not backing \noff.\n  All this stuff, by the way, about the environment, I just want to say \nagain what I said several times before. I have not had a single, \nsolitary Delawarian come to me and say, ``You know, Biden, you are \nspending too much money on determining whether or not my water is \nclean. I don't want you paying that much attention to it.'' I have not \nheard one single, solitary Delawarian come to me say, ``Biden, you are \nspending too much money on monitoring whether or not the water in my \nState is clean.'' It seems to say, to me, that is what the American \npeople, the Delaware people, want their money spent on: clean air and \nclean water. We do not spend enough in this budget on those things.\n  On each and every one of these fundamental priorities--fighting \ncrime, educating our children, particularly higher education, caring \nfor our elderly, and protecting the environment--I believe this well-\nintended resolution fails to take care of the most important priorities \nthat have been made by us in past generations, and continue to be the \npriorities we all say we care about, priorities that help us meet the \nchallenge of the future.\n  Mr. President, education, crime, caring for our elderly, and \nprotecting the environment are the priorities upon which we do not \ndisagree on whether we should do them. I want to make it clear again. I \nam not suggesting that there is any Republican who does not want to \nprotect the elderly, have clean air and water, have a good education \nsystem, and fight crime.\n  I am suggesting that the tools they have given us to do those things \nin this budget are not sufficient, and they give more than is needed \nfor other areas which should not be priorities. If, in fact, we had all \nthe money in the world, we will not have to make these hard choices. \nBut, ultimately, a budget is about deciding what you think is most \nimportant, and today we measure ``most important'' by what we do not \ncut as much as something else. I think their priorities are not the \nones that I would like to see.\n  And, therefore, I will urge my colleagues to vote against the budget \nresolution.\n  I see the distinguished manager on the Democratic side is here.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need.\n  I start out by thanking my friend from Delaware for the excellent \nremarks that he has made on the budget in general. Once again, I \nlistened with keen interest to the very solid presentation that he has \nmade.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the Director of the OMB, Dr. Alice Rivlin, \nsent a letter laying out the administration's objections to the budget \nresolution conference report that we are now discussing. Dr. Rivlin \nprovided a very good analysis of the budget and its many failings.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to transmit the \n     Administration's views on the conference report on H. Con. \n     Res. 178, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \n     years 1997-2002.\n       As you know, the President has proposed a plan the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) said would reach balance in \n     2002. It targets tax relief to middle-income Americans, makes \n     prudent savings in Medicare and Medicaid, and provides enough \n     in discretionary funds to finance the President's investments \n     in key priorities. Clearly, a balanced budget does not \n     necessitate extreme cuts in programs on which tens of \n     millions of Americans rely.\n       With H. Con. Res. 178, the Republican majority has crafted \n     a resolution designed to appear more moderate than the budget \n     policies it pursued last year; however, the resolution \n     continues the extreme policies first contained in the \n     reconciliation bill that the President vetoed last fall.\n       For instance, the plan calls for Medicare cuts of $168 \n     billion--more than $50 billion higher than the savings in the \n     President's budget, according to CBO. Since the Budget \n     Committees have claimed that their level of Medicare Part B \n     savings is identical to the President's, the full difference \n     must come from Medicare Part A. Cuts of this size could limit \n     beneficiary access to hospital health services and lead to \n     lower payments to hospitals even in nominal terms--not just \n     cuts in the rate of growth. This could place huge stress on \n     hospitals, leading to lower quality and threatening the \n     financial viability of hospitals--particularly rural and \n     urban hospitals. In addition, the structural changes proposed \n     in recent Republican plans would seriously threaten the long-\n     term health and viability of Medicare.\n       The conference agreement also includes $72 billion in \n     Medicaid savings, far more than in the last Republican \n     Medicaid restructuring proposal (if estimated under CBO's new \n     baseline). If the resolution assumes previous Republican \n     proposals that allow for lower State matching contributions, \n     the actual cuts in Medicaid services and coverage could reach \n     $250 billion. Along with these cuts, recent Republican \n     proposals have included damaging structural changes, \n     including the block granting of Medicaid, that would \n     undermine the guarantee of coverage. If these provisions are \n     retained, the resolution would mean, for example, an end to \n     the Federal guarantee of coverage for up to 2.5 million \n     children from ages 13 to 18. It would also mean an end to the \n     guarantee of meaningful benefits for over 36 million Medicaid \n     beneficiaries, including 18 million children and over 6 \n     million people with disabilities.\n       With regard to taxes, the resolution would raise income \n     taxes on working Americans by assuming cuts in the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit (EITC). In fact, the cuts of between $17-\n     $20 billion actually would make working Americans even worse \n     off than the latest Republican offer in the President's \n     negotiations with congressional leaders, which called for \n     cuts of $15 billion. We can balance the budget without \n     raising taxes on working Americans.\n       In addition, the tax cuts--which purport to be $122 \n     billion--are understated and misleading. For one thing, the \n     cost of the child tax credit inexplicably falls in the year \n     2002, meaning either the revenue estimate for the credit is \n     too low or part of the credit itself disappears. For another, \n     the level of permitted tax cuts is actually higher. In fact, \n     Republicans have talked about total tax cuts of $170-$185 \n     billion. The resolution appears to reserve billions of \n     dollars in revenues to pay for these excessive tax cuts--$36 \n     billion from extending expiring provisions (from last year's \n     vetoed reconciliation bill) and $26 billion from closing \n     corporate loopholes and other tax measures (from the last \n     Republican offer). Rather than finance excessive tax cuts, \n     these revenues could offset some of the unnecessarily deep \n     cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, and other priorities. By \n     contrast, the President proposes and pays for targeted tax \n     cuts to help middle-income Americans raise their young \n     children, pay for postsecondary education, and save for the \n     future.\n       On welfare, the President supports real bipartisan welfare \n     reform that would move people from welfare to work and \n     protect children. The President has consistently said he \n     wants to work with Congress to reach that goal. The \n     resolution, however, assumes cuts in low-income assistance \n     programs of $53 billion over six years--$2 billion more than \n     the recently introduced Republican welfare bill that does not \n     meet that objective. While the new bill has more child care \n     funding than the Republican welfare bill that the President \n     vetoed in January, the cuts outside Aid to Families with \n     Dependent Children and child care are actually deeper than in \n     the vetoed bill. Like the vetoed bill, the new bill couples \n     deep cuts with severe structural changes and bans on benefits \n     for legal immigrants--policies that would harm children.\n       Moreover, the resolution instructs congressional \n     committees, as part of the first reconciliation bill, to link \n     welfare reform with the proposed changes to Medicaid and with \n     tax cuts. The President wants real welfare reform, but he \n     will not accept any legislation that would block grant \n     Medicaid and undermine its guarantee of health coverage to \n     millions of vulnerable Americans. Congress should not link \n     welfare reform to Medicaid policies the President has \n     consistently said are unacceptable. In addition, it should \n     not pay for tax cuts by making excessive cuts in Medicaid and \n     welfare. Finally, this reconciliation package would make \n     virtually no progress on deficit reduction.\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\n       On student loans, the resolution assumes that \n     reconciliation legislation will impose a cap on the amount of \n     student loan volume in the Direct Loan program, which would \n     eliminate hundreds of colleges from the program and deprive \n     millions of students of the benefits of the flexible \n     repayment options under that program, including income-\n     contingent repayment. And the reconciliation instructions \n     appear to require the opening of the Alaska National Wildlife \n     Refuge, a national treasure, to oil and gas development--a \n     policy the President has said he would veto.\n       On discretionary spending, we recognize that the conferees \n     added non-defense discretionary spending for 1997 to the \n     House-passed level. These levels, however, are still \n     inadequate--more than $15 billion in budget authority below \n     the President's request. In fact, the President's budget \n     proposes higher total and non-defense discretionary levels \n     than the conference agreement in every year through 2002--\n     while still balancing the budget according to CBO. The non-\n     defense discretionary levels are inadequate to fund key \n     investments in education and training, the environment, \n     science and technology, and law enforcement. For example, the \n     resolution provides $57 billion less for education and \n     training from 1997 to 2002 compared to the President's \n     budget, jeopardizing adequate funding for such priorities as \n     Head Start, Education for the Disadvantaged, Goals 2000, \n     School-to-Work, education technology, Pell grants, summer \n     youth jobs, and dislocated worker training.\n       In the near term, the resolution shifts more resources into \n     defense programs than necessary, squeezing investments in \n     non-defense programs. The resolution provides over $11 \n     billion more in defense budget authority for 1997 than the \n     President's defense plan--which already commits historically \n     high levels of resources to readiness, as measured in funding \n     per troop. At the same time, the resolution does not provide \n     enough budget authority, compared to the President's defense \n     program, in the critical years of defense modernization at \n     the turn of the century--the years when new technologies come \n     on line.\n       In their negotiations last winter, the President and \n     congressional leaders found more than enough savings in \n     common to reach balance by 2002. The President wants to \n     finish the job, and he has repeatedly asked the Republican \n     leadership to return to the negotiating table.\n       As you can see, while the Administration and Congress share \n     the goal of a balanced budget, we have grave concerns about \n     the approach contained in this resolution. We also hope \n     Republicans learned from last year's experience, which \n     included two government shutdowns and 13 continuing \n     resolutions, that we need to work together. We want to work \n     with Congress, as the process moves forward, to give the \n     American people the balanced budget they deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, we have additional speakers that will be \nseeking recognition. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask that the time be equally charged to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now in debate on the budget \nconference report, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is there a time agreement at this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled under the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just yield myself 7 minutes from \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we find ourselves once again debating a \nbudget conference agreement that some have dressed in new clothes and \nwrapped with new ribbons and brought to the floor of the Senate to say, \n``Gee, we've made changes. This is a new budget. It's a different \napproach. And we seek support for it.''\n  The Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, I think said yesterday quite \nappropriately, there is nothing new about this. This is the same \napproach for 2 years that has been trotted out on the floor of the \nSenate by the majority party saying, ``Here's what we insist on in a \nbudget agreement.'' The dilemma I see in this budget agreement is this. \nThe conference report is designed to try to reduce spending and balance \nthe budget, but it also includes at the same time a substantial tax \nreduction.\n  Would the American people like a tax reduction? Of course. Would it \nbe popular to talk about cutting taxes rather than cutting spending and \nreducing the deficit? Yes, of course it is more popular to talk about \ncutting taxes. But our problem is, we have got deficits in this country \nthat need to be brought down. There are a couple ways of doing that, \nbut not proposing a very large tax cut is not on the list of ways to \nbring the deficit down. The majority party brings this conference \nagreement to the floor and downplays the tax cut.\n  I want to show my colleagues a quote from the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee on the other side of the Capitol Building, a Congressman for \nwhom I have great respect, Congressman Kasich, who is the chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee. He says in response to a question:\n\n       We will have a capital gains tax cut. We will have all the \n     . . . Contract With America items that we originally \n     proposed. . .. So what you ultimately get is . . . a gross \n     tax cut number that will approach $180 billion.\n\n  The paradox is, as we are trying to reduce the budget deficit, we \nhave folks here who want to serve dessert before they serve dinner. It \ndoes not make any sense.\n  The most responsible position, it seems to me, is for the majority \nparty to set aside tax cut questions at this point and let us deal with \nthe issue of cutting Federal spending in appropriate ways to reach a \nbalanced budget. When we have reached a balanced budget, then let us \nturn our attention to the question of how we can appropriately cut \ntaxes to reduce the burden on middle-income families.\n  But it is not appropriate in my judgment, to be bringing a budget to \nthe floor of the Senate that purports to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit but also includes in it a substantial tax cut, much of which \nwill go to the wealthiest Americans.\n  Let me quickly say I have nothing against those who have made a great \ndeal of money in our country. Many of them are wonderful Americans who \nhave been enormously successful. They are resourceful people who \ndeserve and have received the benefits of doing well in our system. But \nit is also true that the small group on the top of the economic ladder \nin our country has had substantial, substantial economic gains and \ntheir tax burden has not kept pace. They have been treated very, very \nwell.\n  It seems to me that when we are attempting to reduce the budget \ndeficit, it makes very little sense for us to decide at the same time \nwe should provide significant tax cuts to those who need them least.\n\n  Let me give you one little example. Some Americans will remember when \nwe would read in the paper reports about studies on the amount of taxes \npaid by some of the largest enterprises in America. We would discover \nwhile reading the morning paper that some of the largest corporations \nin America have made billions of dollars and pay zero in income taxes--\nnot a lot, not a little--zero in income taxes.\n  People were wondering, ``Well, if I make $20,000 a year, and work \nhard all day, and try to do the best I can, why do I have to pay taxes \nwhen a corporation that makes $3 billion in income pays zero?'' It is a \ngood question. So the Congress began to address that in the mid-1980's \nand said, ``Well, let us put together what is called an alternative \nminimum tax so if a big company were able to use tax loopholes to pay \nzero in income taxes, they at least must pay an alternative minimum \ntax, a minimum tax.''\n  Have you heard lately of a big corporation that makes a lot of money \nthat pays zero in income taxes? No. Why? Because there is what is \ncalled an AMT, an alternative minimum tax so they must pay some taxes.\n  Well, guess what is deep in the bowels of this budget? You got it. A \nchange in the alternative minimum tax that will say to some of those \ncorporations, ``Let's go back to the good old days. You can start \nzeroing out again.'' It just does not make sense for us, when we are \nhere to try to reduce the Federal budget deficit, to say, ``By the way, \nlet's bestow a little gift here on some of the biggest enterprises in \nAmerica and say to them, `You can go ahead and zero out, make lots of \nmoney and pay no taxes anymore.' ''\n  I just do not understand the mindset of people who refuse to keep \ntheir eye\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\non the ball. The ball is the budget deficit. The menu of changes needed \nto address the budget deficit does not include new tax breaks for some \nof the biggest corporations in the country. It does not include new tax \nbreaks for people who make $50 and $100 million a year. And, yes, there \nare some people in this country who make that and they do not need a \ntax break.\n  So I ask the majority party, and instead of advertising a tired old \nproduct as something new, let us go back to the drawing boards, set the \nissue of cutting taxes aside, especially cutting taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans, set it aside and let us deal with one specific \nelement in our responsibility. Let us use the budget in the 7-year \nbudget cycle to reach a balanced budget. When we have done that, then \nlet us turn to the proposition of changing the Tax Code so that it is \nless of a burden on middle-income families.\n  Let me make one important point that needs to be cleared up. I heard \nearlier today a discussion by, I believe, the Senator from New Mexico \nand the Senator from Missouri and some others. They were talking about \nthe President's budget, the majority budget, and a balanced budget here \nand there. None of these budgets balance the budget. None of them--not \nthe President's budget and not the budget that is brought to the floor \nof this Senate from this conference. They fall short, because in the \nyear 2002, they will use the Social Security trust funds as ordinary \nrevenue in order to claim they have balanced the budget. None of them \nbalance the budget. Yet, even though they still fall short in the year \n2002 of balancing the budget, the majority party says, ``We are \nproposing $180 billion in tax cuts during the 7-year period.''\n  I suppose I would probably not protest so much--I still would \nprotest, but not so much--if the tax cuts were going in the right \ndirection. They so fundamentally distort who ought to be paying what. \nThese tax cuts are wrapped gifts to the biggest economic interests in \nAmerica. It makes no sense to do this.\n  I just think, generally speaking, we ought not be talking about tax \ncuts until we have met our responsibility to balance the budget. This \nresolution on the floor demonstrably does not balance the budget, no \nmatter what has been said on the floor today by those who push this \nproposal here in the Senate.\n  If I had the time, I would speak at length about a range of \npriorities. Let he finish with one point about the issues inside the \nbudget. We must fix our Medicare Program. It is a good program. It has \nhelped a lot of Americans. It is a program that works well. It is a \nprogram whose costs are outrunning our ability to pay those costs. We \nmust make adjustments to it.\n  No one ought to come to the floor selling some snake oil that says, \n``Let us cut approximately the same amount from Medicare spending so we \ncan make room for the same amount of tax cuts. Let us take from those \nwho do not have much by reducing the Medicare Program, and give to \nthose who have plenty, with tax cuts for upper-income folks.'' I find \nthat to be a strange, twisted set of priorities.\n  Even as I say that, I recognize all of us must find a way to reduce \nthe kinds of budget claims the Medicare Program has in the Federal \nbudget. We can do that sensibly, thoughtfully. We cannot do that if we \nwant to use savings from the Medicare Program in order to make room for \na tax cut. That is an inappropriate subject in the first instance while \nwe are trying to balance the Federal budget. It will be interesting in \nthe next week or two to see the manifestation of this philosophy.\n  The majority party says they are the ones that want to balance the \nbudget. They also want to bring to the floor of the Senate a defense \nbill that will spend some $13 billion more than the Pentagon asks for, \na star wars program that will cost some $60 billion in money we do not \nhave to build something we do not need.\n  It seems to me the real test of what you stand for is not what you \nsay, but what you bring to the floor. What specific proposals do you \nhave? How will you require the American people to pay for them in the \nfuture? As soon as the American people understand exactly what are the \ndetails of this plan, I think they will understand the twisted set of \npriorities embraced by this budget conference report.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota is on the floor prepared to \nspeak about the budget. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from North \nDakota, who has spoken clearly and well on the basic point that none of \nthese plans is a truly balanced budget. One of the most frustrating \nthings I have felt during our discussions--about what is a balanced \nbudget and what is not a balanced budget--is that somehow when we get \ninside this Chamber, our financial common sense goes right out the \nwindow. I say that because I come from a financial background. My \ncolleague who just spoke from North Dakota has a financial background.\n\n  Frankly, Mr. President, if we were in any financial institution and \nsaid we were balancing the budget, when in part what we were doing was \ntaking the retirement funds of our employees and throwing those into \nthe pot, we would be laughed out of the room. Mr. President, that is \nnot a balanced budget. The Chair knows that. I think every Senator in \nthis room knows that. That is not a balanced budget.\n  In fact, this budget shows a $103 billion deficit in the year 2002 if \nwe are to exclude Social Security surpluses. Of course, we have to \nexclude them if we are going to be basing our determinations on honest \naccounting and on the law. That is not a balanced budget.\n  I would point out that last year I offered the only plan that did \nbalance the budget without counting Social Security surpluses. That was \nthe fair share plan, and it got 39 votes here in the U.S. Senate.\n  I think in the interest of honest disclosure, we have to acknowledge \nthe President's plan is not truly a balanced budget plan. The \nRepublican plan is not truly a balanced budget plan. In fact, the \ncentrist coalition, which I was a part of, did not produce a truly \nbalanced budget plan. All of them were significant deficit reduction \nplans, but none of them achieve a truly balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to talk about the budget \nbefore the Senate. I believe the most important work that any Congress \ndoes is its determinations on the budget, because that determines where \nthe nation's resources are going to go for the next year, and beyond.\n  Mr. President, yesterday was a remarkable moment in this Chamber. \nSenator Dole, who has been here in the U.S. Senate for 27 years, \nretired and left this Chamber to pursue his candidacy for the \nPresidency of the United States. Yesterday, when he stood in the well \nand at the majority leader's desk and gave his final farewell address \nto the Members, I was struck when he talked about the things that he \nwas most proud of, the things that he had done here that he will \nremember and be proud of.\n  What did he talk about? He talked about a series of legislative \naccomplishments that were all bipartisan in nature. He talked about \nworking across the gap between Republicans and Democrats, working \nacross the aisle to accomplish things that were important for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I think all of us know, in our heart of hearts, when \nthis institution works best, it works in a bipartisan way to achieve \nlegislative advances for the American people that we are all sent here \nto represent.\n  Mr. President, it was that sense of bipartisanship that was palpable \nin this Chamber yesterday, but that is so lacking in this budget \nproposal before the Senate today. This is the same song, second verse, \nof a Republican budget plan that was offered last year and was vetoed \nby the President. There is very little difference. It is rewrapped with \nnew packaging, but if you open up the package and look at what is \ninside, you find there is very little difference between what the \nRepublican majority offered last year and what they are offering to us \nthis year.\n  The press has reported, and reported widely, this is a kinder, \ngentler Republican budget. Frankly, they have been fooled, because this \nhas gone from being a 7-year budget plan to a 6-year plan. They are \ncomparing last year's 7-year plan to this year's 6-year plan, so all of \na sudden the numbers look better.\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\n  Mr. President, that is not a fair comparison. You have to compare \napples to apples and oranges to oranges, a 7-year plan to a 7-year \nplan, not a 6-year plan to a 7-year plan. If one does that, you find \nthere is almost no change. Yogi Berra said, ``Deja vu all over again.''\n  Mr. President, let's look at a real comparison, a 7-year comparison, \nto what the majority offered just last year and what they are offering \nus this year. On Medicare last year, they offered $226.8 billion in \ncuts over 7 years. This year, if you adjust their 6-year plan to a 7-\nyear plan, it is $228 billion of cuts in Medicare. Very little \ndifference.\n  On Medicaid, last year it was $132.6 billion in cuts; this year it is \n$106 billion. On welfare last year, the Republican plan was $65.6 \nbillion; this year, they have actually increased the cuts, if it is \nover a 7-year period, to $66.7 billion.\n  Last year, on the earned-income tax credit, a provision that will \nincrease the taxes for moderate-income Americans who work, they are \nactually going to increase those folks' taxes, $21.2 billion in last \nyear's plan; they have taken $1 billion off this year, and it is a $20 \nbillion increase. Tax breaks, last year, the plan was $246.7 billion \nover 7 years; this year, on a fair comparison, it is $220.4 billion. \nVery little change.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this budget resolution. I do not think it is \nbipartisan. I do not think it represents the kind of settlement between \nthe two sides that can be sustained. If we are serious about reducing \nthe budget deficit and getting our fiscal house in order, we know there \nis only one way to accomplish that goal. We must march together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, so we can actually enact into law what we \npropose here on the floor of this Chamber.\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to emphasize that it is critically \nimportant that we succeed in this endeavor. Make no mistake about it, \nwe are on a fiscal course that cannot be sustained. As I have said \nrepeatedly to my colleagues on the Budget Committee and on the floor of \nthis Chamber, it is true that we have seen a substantial reduction in \nthe budget deficit, and that is certainly good news.\n  Without question, this chart shows what happened to the unified \nFederal budget deficit as a percentage of the economy from 1980 to \n1996. Back in 1980, the deficit was about 3 percent of our economy, \nabout 3 percent of gross domestic product. It then shot up to 6.3 \npercent in the early 1980's, worked its way back down in 1990, when it \nwas back down to around 3 percent, and then it jumped up again to \nnearly 5 percent. During the tenure of Bill Clinton as President of the \nUnited States, the deficit has come down 4 years in a row. We are now \ndown to a deficit that is less than 2 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. That is the lowest deficit as measured against the size of the \neconomy of any industrialized country in the world. So we have made \ngreat progress.\n  But no one should be under any illusion. While we have made \nsignificant progress, if we do not keep working, if we do not keep \nputting on the pressure of deficit reduction, all of these gains are \ngoing to be lost as we start to move toward the time that the baby boom \ngeneration retires.\n  Mr. President, we face a demographic time bomb in this country. It is \nthe baby boom generation, because when they start to retire, the number \nof people who are eligible for programs like Medicare and Social \nSecurity is going to double. We are going to go from 24 million people \neligible for Social Security and Medicare to 48 million people \neligible. None of us can put our heads in the sand and say it is not \ngoing to happen. It is going to happen. And the consequences are going \nto be enormous, and they are going to be severe. We have been told by \nthe Entitlements Commission that if we fail to change course, by the \nyear 2012 every dime of Federal revenue will go for entitlements and \ninterest on the debt. There will be no money for any of the other \nfunctions of the Federal Government. There will be no money for roads. \nThere will be no money for parks. There will be no money for education. \nThere will be no money for research.\n  Mr. President, that is not an acceptable result. We were also told \nlast year that if we stay on the current course, future generations \nwill face either an 82-percent lifetime net tax rate or a one-third cut \nin all benefits. Let me repeat that because I think it is so jarring \nthat most people almost cannot hear it when you say it. We were told \nlast year that if we stay on the current course, future generations \nwill face either an 82-percent lifetime net tax rate or a one-third cut \nin all benefits. Does anyone believe we are going to have an 82-percent \ntax rate in this country? I do not believe it. That is never going to \nhappen. So the alternative is a one-third cut in all benefits. What a \ndisaster that would be for those who are anticipating and counting on \nthose programs to be present when they retire.\n  Mr. President, it is not only for those reasons that we must move to \nreduce the budget deficit further, it is also because balancing the \nbudget will provide an enormous boost to our economy. Economists have \ntold us repeatedly that if we reduce the deficit, that will expand the \npool of national savings that are available for investment. It is only \nthrough investment that we are able to improve future economic growth. \nWe have to have investment to grow.\n  Where do you get money to invest? You have to have savings in order \nfor there to be investment. Where do those savings come from? Well, \nthey come from the private sector. But they also come by eliminating \nthe budget deficit because the budget deficit eats into the pool of \nsavings that are available for investment--that investment that is \nnecessary to improve the economic performance of our economy.\n  Mr. President, all we have to do is look back and see what we \naccomplished by the 1993 budget plan that cut spending and, yes, raised \nincome taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this country. That plan \nsignificantly reduced the deficit. There were certainly other factors, \nas well, that contributed to that deficit reduction. But because we \nreduced the deficit, the pool of societal savings was increased, \ninterest rates came down, business investment went to a 30-year high, 9 \nmillion jobs have been created, and the American economy has been on a \npath of sustained growth.\n  Mr. President, we should not let this opportunity pass us by again \nthis year. We should seize this opportunity and, on a bipartisan basis, \nform an agreement to reach a budget accord that would get this job \ndone, that would move us toward fiscal responsibility, that would move \nus toward balancing this Federal budget. Let me just say that, very \noften, people talk about balancing the budget in moralistic terms. \nUnfortunately, I think that turns off a certain segment of the American \npeople who think, all that is in deficit reduction is pain, all that is \nin it is cutting programs we like, or raising our taxes, or some \ncombination of both. None of it is good news.\n  Mr. President, there is enormous good news in deficit reduction. The \ngood news comes when you lower interest rates and save the American \npeople money. A 1-percent drop in interest rates, as a result of \ndeficit reduction, means individual savings of almost $5,000 over 5 \nyears on a conventional mortgage. Just think of what that means to the \naverage American family. A 1-percent reduction in interest rates on \ntheir home mortgage means, to the average American family, nearly \n$1,000 a year, or $400 a year on a 5-year car loan. And to people in my \nState--my State is a farm State, North Dakota--it means nearly $1,000 a \nyear of savings to a North Dakota farmer.\n  So not only is balancing the budget better for the average American \nnow, it is also of the utmost importance for economic growth and our \nchildren's future. We were told last year by a GAO study that if we \nwould balance the unified budget by the year 2002, this economy, by the \nyear 2029, would be 25 percent larger than if we failed to change \ncourse. Think of what that means in terms of jobs and opportunity and \neconomic growth. Think of what that means in the quality of our \nchildren's lives.\n  Mr. President, I know the occupant of the chair is somebody who has \nbeen dedicated to deficit reduction. I must say of my colleagues here \nin this Chamber, I think few match the occupant of the chair for his \ndedication and seriousness and commitment to deficit reduction. I \napplaud him for it, because\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\nI think all of us can see that it is clearly in the interest of our \ncountry. Somehow we ought to find a way to work together to achieve \nthat result.\n  Let me say that the budget before us troubles me in many respects. \nFirst of all, the first reconciliation package that the budget \nresolution conference report provides for--that first reconciliation \nbill provides for $124 billion in mandatory savings for Medicaid and \nwelfare, but up to $122 billion in tax reductions. That is a fine way \nto begin a deficit reduction effort--to start by spending every penny \nthat we save.\n  Mr. President, that is not my idea of a path toward deficit \nreduction.\n  Let me say that the Republicans in this latest proposal have made \nsome improvements in their Medicaid package, but the proposal remains \nfatally flawed. It does not provide a guarantee of a meaningful \nbenefits package, and it gives away Federal dollars to the States \nthrough changes in the Federal matching formula and the repeal of a \nrestriction against State scams to tap into the Federal Treasury. Well, \nI can understand why some of the Governors of this country are lined up \nbehind this proposal. I can understand why those Governors support it. \nIt is great for them. They are able to tap into the Federal Treasury to \nreplace some of the money that they are currently spending.\n  Mr. President, we have seen the scams that have gone on in the past \nby way of provider taxes in which the States would engage in what is \nreally an accounting sham to shift their spending onto the Federal \nGovernment in order to relieve State budgets and make it a Federal \nbudget obligation and responsibility.\n  Mr. President, that is the last kind of high jinks we need if we are \nserious about reducing the Federal budget deficit. The Federal budget \nis out of balance. The last thing we need to do is shift responsibility \nand obligations from State governments to the Federal Government, when \nthe Federal Government cannot meet the obligations it currently has.\n  In sum, might I say that the assumptions contained in this budget \nresolution with regard to Medicaid are designed as a poison pill to \nensure that the President does not sign a welfare reform package. They \nhave linked Medicaid changes that are totally unacceptable to the \nPresident with welfare reform knowing that he cannot accept the \nMedicaid part of the package. So they know he cannot accept the package \nas a whole.\n  What we have here is a political game. It does not serve either side \nwell. It does not serve the American people well. And it does not lead \nus to resolution of anything.\n  With respect to welfare reform, let me say that I am a strong \nadvocate of welfare reform. I think it is intolerable that we have a \nsystem that abuses everyone in the system, abuses the taxpayers that \npay for it, abuses the recipients who receive it, and abuses all the \nrest of us who must witness the results of a system that clearly is \nfailing.\n  Last year Congress debated welfare reform, and one of the most \nimportant lessons we have learned is that in order to have successful \nwelfare reform, we must work together. We had a package that passed the \nSenate overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. I wish the same could be \nsaid of the budget proposal that is before us. But I cannot. It was not \ndone in a bipartisan way. As a result, we have a package that is not \ngoing to work.\n  Last year, I introduced my own sweeping welfare reform package that \nemphasized work, that protected children, that safeguarded taxpayers. \nThose are the principles that we ought to, on a bipartisan basis, apply \nto writing a budget resolution as well.\n  A few weeks ago, Republicans introduced their new welfare reform \npackage. I must say I have concern about many of the provisions \ncontained in this proposal, including decreasing the maintenance of \neffort to 75 percent. This proposal has the potential to allow States \nto supplant, rather than supplement, State spending on low-income \nfamilies with Federal dollars. That is not what we ought to do as we go \nabout the important task of reforming the welfare system.\n  The proposal also lacks provisions to promote Government \naccountability and to ensure the integrity of Federal funds.\n  Another major deficiency, in my judgment, in the Republican proposal \nis the State option to block grant the Food Stamp Program. The Food \nStamp Program is the anchor for the Nation's nutritional safety net. \nThe program has an impressive history of responding to economic \nfluctuations in our country and changes in child poverty levels.\n  Senator Dole stood at the majority leader's desk yesterday and said \none of his proudest accomplishments here in the Senate was the Food \nStamp Program. Mr. President, Senator Dole was right. That is a proud \naccomplishment. The program can be improved, and it must be.\n  But we should not take steps that might undermine and destroy that \nprogram that has made such a difference in the lives of millions of \nAmericans. No American ought to go to bed at night hungry. That is what \nthe Food Stamp Program has changed.\n  I remember very well coming here as a teenage boy and listening to \ntestimony before the Senate Agriculture Committee--Senator Dole was a \nmember--about hunger in America, and the very real circumstances that \nfamilies faced up and down the east coast of the United States, and in \nthe central part of America where hunger was prevalent before we had a \nFood Stamp Program.\n  Senator Dole spoke movingly yesterday about what he himself saw in a \nhearing that was held in South Carolina--hungry people that were helped \nby a program that was passed on a bipartisan basis.\n  The conference report of the budget resolution also provides for a \nreconciliation bill to consider Medicare reform in July and a tax cut \nbill coupled with other mandatory savings in September. I am \ndisappointed that a reconciliation bill to provide tax cuts, which may \nnot be fully offset, is provided for in this conference report.\n  When the Senate considered the budget resolution, much was made of \nthe fact that the first two reconciliation bills would have to be \nenacted first in order for the Senate to consider the third \nreconciliation bill which would have the tax cuts in it. Now, all of a \nsudden, that is all out the window. It shows, I believe, the real \npriority of some in this Congress to cut taxes regardless of whether \nthey are accompanied by tough budgetary decisions to make certain that \nthe deficit is not increased as a result.\n  This approach really makes me wonder if we have learned anything from \nthe disastrous fiscal policies of the 1980's. Are we really going to \nembark on that course once again of cutting taxes and not having the \nspending cuts to go with them and seeing the deficit mushroom and \nseeing the economic security of this country once again threatened? Is \nthat really the course we are going to embark on? I hope not.\n  Mr. President, I also want to comment briefly on the discretionary \nspending proposals that are contained in this budget resolution. This \nproposal contains huge and completely unrealistic cuts in discretionary \nspending. Behind the scenes it is kind of laughed at by everybody who \nhas really spent time on these budget proposals.\n  Whether it is the President's proposal or this Republican proposal, \nthese domestic cuts are totally unrealistic. Everyone knows they are \nnot going to happen. It is kind of the dirty little secret of these \nbudget plans. They are back-end loaded, both of them.\n  I have another chart that shows what we are faced with by both of \nthese budget plans--how truly unrealistic they are. This shows the \ndistribution of the total savings in the budget plans, both the \nPresident's plan and the Republican plan before us. It shows by 2002 \nwhat the savings are.\n  But look at what happens under both of these plans. The Republican \nplan has 64 percent of its savings in the last 2 years. The President's \nplan is no better. He has 66 percent of his savings in the last 2 \nyears. Over the last 3 years, they are identical. Both of them have 82 \npercent of their savings in the last 3 years.\n  A big chunk of this is domestic spending cuts in both the President's \nplan and the Republican plan. They are not going to happen. They are \nunrealistic. We would be much better off to be honest with each other \nand have a spending plan that might really be sustained by future \nCongresses so that we can be on a path that really gives the result all \nof us seek--getting the Federal budget deficit under control. That\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\nis in our common interest. It is in our country's interest. It is what \nwe ought to do.\n  I will just close by saying I will oppose the conference report on \nthe budget resolution. I think it sets in motion another partisan \npolitical war over budget priorities and contains misguided priorities. \nAs I indicated earlier, I think it is the same song, second verse, of \nwhat we saw last year--very little difference if you compare it on a 7-\nyear basis to what was offered by the majority last year and what is \nbeing offered this year.\n  I close by saying, there is another way. There is another way \ndifferent from what the President has proposed and different from what \nthe Republican majority has given us in this budget resolution; that \nis, the centrist plan that got 46 votes here on the floor of the Senate \njust a few weeks ago. Twenty-four Democrats voted for that plan and 22 \nRepublicans voted for it, even though the leadership on both sides were \nopposed to it. I think that sends a signal that we were on the right \npath.\n  I would be the first to assert that it is not a perfect plan. It was \nthe product of compromise. But it was the product of bipartisan work--\nthe only place where there has been a successful effort to reach across \nthe aisle to try to bring agreement and closure to a plan that would \nreally put us on the path to serious deficit reduction, and not just \ndeficit reduction until 2002, but deficit reduction beyond that time.\n  As I said earlier, that plan is not a balanced budget plan either \nbecause, as I have indicated, of the use of Social Security surpluses.\n  Mr. President, I hope that before this year is over we can go back to \na process of bipartisanship, of reaching out and working together to \nachieve a result that is important for our country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the budget \nresolution conference report. I oppose this conference agreement \nbecause it fails to meet the day-to-day needs of the American people. I \noppose it because it threatens the economic and retirement security of \nour most vulnerable citizens. And, I oppose the conference report \nbecause it fails to make the investments in education and training that \nare needed to prepare our work force to meet the challenges of the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Mr. President. Let me be absolutely clear. I believe we need a \nbalanced budget. I voted for just such a plan when the Senate \nconsidered the budget resolution. I joined with 44 of my colleagues in \nvoting for the President's budget plan, which would achieve balance by \nthe year 2002.\n  The President's plan cut spending by $528 billion over 6 years. But \nit made these cuts without jeopardizing the Medicare Program, without \njeopardizing Medicaid, without harming the environment, and without \nexcessive cuts in education and training.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report before us is the same old wolf \nin new sheep's clothing. Let me mention one area of particular concern \nto me. Under this conference report, once again, Medicare and Medicaid \nare under assault. This plan would cut Medicare spending by $168 \nbillion. These massive cuts, coupled with the structural changes \nproposed by the Republicans, will turn the Medicare Program into a \nsecond-class system for the sickest and poorest of our seniors.\n  The Medicaid Program would be cut by $72 billion, and under \nRepublican Medicaid proposals some 36 million people will lose the \nguarantee of access to health care, while others may be forced to \naccept a reduced level of benefits. Together these Medicaid and \nMedicare cuts make the promise of health security impossible to \nachieve.\n  What is particularly distressing is that these massive cuts, cuts \nwhich will be felt most seriously by our most vulnerable citizens, are \nbeing made to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. While the budget plan \nI supported eliminated special interest tax breaks, providing $40 \nbillion in additional revenues, the Republican plan contains absolutely \nno savings from this category. Instead it contains tax breaks in the \norder of $180 billion.\n  I think that is an outrage. And I believe it does not reflect the \nneeds and priorities of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I was elected by the people of Maryland to save lives, \nto save jobs, and to save communities. I work every day to meet \npeople's day-to-day needs, and I want a budget that reflects those \npriorities.\n  This budget plan sets us on the course for the same painful and \ndivisive budget battles that we fought all last year. It is a \nprescription for gridlock.\n  Yes, we must balance the budget. But the way to do that is to follow \na steady, responsible course toward deficit reduction. We have made \nmuch progress under the Clinton administration in moving toward a \nbalanced budget. In fact, the budget deficit has declined to $130 \nbillion, less than half of the $290.4 billion deficit President Clinton \ninherited from the previous administration.\n  We have tightened belts and made many tough decisions to achieve this \nsuccess. And we will continue to do more. But we have done that while \nprotecting people and priorities. That is what the citizens of Maryland \nsent me here to do.\n  That's why I believe we need to reject the extremism of this \nconference report, and reach for the sensible center in our budget \nnegotiations. And that is why I will vote against this conference \nreport.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my displeasure with \nHouse Concurrent Resolution 178, the Republican budget resolution, and \nmy disappointment that the budget was not improved during the House-\nSenate conference. Rather, the budget has grown even more troubling \nsince going into conference. And I want to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss some of the provisions that concern me.\n  Two weeks ago, I voted against the Senate Republican budget \nresolution because it failed to reflect the priorities and values held \nby most Americans--the belief that we need to ensure our quality of \nlife, educate our children, and care for our elderly and disabled.\n  The majority party could have improved the budget in the House-Senate \nconference meeting. They could have acknowledged the growing support \nfor the centrist budget and the strong desire to reach a true balanced \nbudget compromise. We should not forget the Chafee-Breaux balanced \nbudget proposal received 46 votes, and I was proud to be among them. It \nreceived strong bipartisan support, and it is proof that Congress can \nget the job done.\n  Mr. President, House Concurrent Resolution 178 took an extreme Senate \nRepublican budget and made it worse. Rather than moving toward the \ncentrist budget, the Republican leadership yielded to some disturbing \nHouse positions. Their actions lead me to believe some Republicans want \ngridlock--they do not want a balanced budget compromise.\n  For instance, House Concurrent Resolution 178 includes a section \nknown as the Government shutdown prevention allowance, or section 307. \nThis section quite simply confirms the Republican strategy not to \nreward the American people with a balanced budget agreement this year. \nThis section acknowledges the fact that the Republican budget is too \nextreme to be accepted by mainstream Americans.\n  Section 307 states the Budget Committee chairman can increase \nappropriation spending caps by $1.3 billion if the appropriators pass a \ncontinuing resolution. This language makes it very clear the \nRepublicans intend to pass a long-term CR rather than work toward a \ncomprehensive budget agreement. Mr. President, the American people \nexpect and deserve better. The American people do not want to see us \nthrow the towel in early.\n  The budget conference also reveals the fact that Republicans again \nwish to give tax breaks to the wealthy by cutting Medicaid coverage for \nthe poor. Mr. President, after last year's budget debate, I would have \nthought the Republicans learned Americans are not in favor of giving \ntax breaks to the wealthy by cutting health care coverage to our \nchildren, elderly, and disabled. As written, the Republican budget cuts \nMedicaid by $72 billion over 6 years. Along with welfare reform, the \nMedicaid cut will offset $122 billion worth of tax cuts.\n  A year ago, I was opposed to cutting back Medicaid because it \nprovides health care for our poorest children and it ensures quality \nnursing home standards for our parents. But, after\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\ntalking to health care experts in Washington State, I concluded my home \nState could still serve our most vulnerable populations while absorbing \na significant cut to Medicaid. I am willing to concede that point, and \nI know now that if we all give a little, we can reach compromise.\n  However, we should not be cutting Medicaid simply to hand out \npolitically-popular tax breaks. That does not make good sense--that \nwould not fall in line with our recent efforts to become more fiscally \nresponsible.\n  And, Mr. President, let us remember exactly where we are on this road \nto ending the deficit. Since 1993, we have made great progress toward \nreducing this Nation's deficit. CBO estimates the 1996 deficit will \nfall to $130 billion--the fourth straight year the deficit has \ndeclined. We have cut the budget deficit in half in less than 4 years, \nand today's annual deficit is the lowest percent of our gross domestic \nproduct since 1980. I'm proud of this fact. I am proud to have been \ninvolved in crafting the omnibus budget package of 1993. That deficit \nreduction package has us on the right track.\n  Our need to do more, however, spawned a bipartisan group of Senators \nto come together and formulate a well-reasoned, well-balanced budget \nproposal. I commend Senators Chafee and Breaux for their leadership and \nhard work on this matter. I voted for their budget alternative because \nit is exactly the kind of bipartisan teamwork congress needs. \nCertainly, I would like to see less savings come out of discretionary \naccounts that include education, job training, trade promotion, and the \nenvironment. And the tax cuts may be too generous.\n  The Chafee-Breaux plan may not be perfect, but I believe it is \nprobably the most realistic compromise one could craft. I am hopeful \nthis centrist plan will become the framework for future budget \nnegotiations.\n  Mr. President, this past year has taught us we can reach a balanced \nbudget. We learned we can formulate a balanced budget that uses common \nsense and reflects America's values and priorities. That is why Senator \nKerry and I offered an amendment to restore education and job training \nfunds in the Republican budget. As my colleagues know, this amendment \nfailed despite the fact that the Republican budget will cut education \nspending 20 percent from current levels.\n  Americans understand how important education and job training \ninvestments are for our children, and the future success of this \nNation. A recent USA Today poll found that education has become the \nmost important issue for Americans--ranking above crime, the economy, \nand the quality of one's job.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of work to do if we are going to reach a \nbalanced budget. But the truth of the matter is that both parties have \nagreed to enough savings that we could balance the budget today if we \nreally want to. When considering the entire budget, the difference \nbetween the two parties amounts to less than 1 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's spending. A balanced budget plan is possible. All we need \nis the courage to find compromise.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Appropriations \nand Budget Committees in order to make sure this Congress' spending \npriorities are balanced and in line with our constituents' wishes. \nUnfortunately, today's budget resolution fails to strike a balance. It \nis simply a replay of last year's failed Republican budget. And I will \nbe fighting to make sure this Congress does not lose sight of what is \ntruly important to our friends and families.\n  We have made tremendous progress in the past 3 years. The 1993 budget \nreconciliation enabled us to cut the deficit in half, and create over 9 \nmillion jobs in the process. This is great news; but that is not all--\nlast year we narrowed the differences in the competing budget plans to \njust a few, and a centrist plan to bridge the gap fell short by only \nfive votes. We are close. We are very close to finishing the job.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this partisan plan and rededicate \nthemselves to reaching a workable compromise.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning, the three-judge panel \nsitting in the U.S. district court in Philadelphia issued its decision \nin the case involving the Communications Decency Act, which was \nincluded in the telecommunications bill signed into law earlier this \nyear.\n  I opposed the Communications Decency Act when it was first proposed \nin the U.S. Senate, because I believe this measure would have a \nchilling effect upon communications transmitted over the Internet, and \nit would stifle the expansion of this important and exciting new \ncommunications vehicle.\n  My concern was that the Communications Decency Act injected \nGovernment censorship into communications over the Internet that would \nnot withstand a first amendment challenge and would be harmful to the \ndevelopment of technology to do what the proponents of the \nCommunications Decency Act said they wanted to do, and that is to \nprotect minors from exposure to pornographic material transmitted or \nmade available on the Internet.\n  I also joined the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] in introducing \nlegislation to repeal this patently unconstitutional infringement of \nfirst amendment rights. Let me take my hat off to the Senator from \nVermont who has been a great leader on this issue. It has been a bit of \na lonely fight out here, given the vote we had on the Communications \nDecency Act, but the Senator from Vermont has been very instrumental in \nraising this challenge.\n  I am delighted to report that the court this morning acted in a \ndecisive manner and issued a preliminary injunction blocking the \nFederal Government from enforcing the act. In a decision which I \nbelieve recognized the unique nature of the Internet, the court wrote:\n\n       As the most participatory form of mass speech yet \n     developed, the Internet deserves the highest level of \n     protection from Government intrusion.\n\n  Mr. President, let me repeat. The court has said ``the Internet \ndeserves the highest level of protection'' of any form of communication \nor mass speech.\n  This decision followed an extraordinary court proceeding in \nPhiladelphia where the three judges were actively involved in learning \nabout how people communicate across the Internet and the limitless \npotential the Internet now provides. They were also exposed to detailed \ninformation on how this same technology can and should be used to block \naccess to certain material by minors. What they found, as some of us \ntried to note in the congressional debate, was there were far less \nintrusive means of achieving the goal of protecting minors than the \napproach utilized in the Communications Decency Act, which would impose \ncontent-based restrictions on information transmitted by adults over \nthe Internet.\n  It is a longstanding constitutional doctrine that when the Government \nchooses to interfere with fundamental constitutional rights, even for a \nvery good cause, it can only do so in the least restrictive means \navailable. Clearly, the Communications Decency Act has failed to meet \nthat test.\n  I firmly believe that if Members of Congress had this kind of \ntutorial that the members of the court had on the workings of the \nInternet and the alternatives available to protect access by minors to \ncertain material, I think the Communications Decency Act would never \nhave become law in the first place. This measure was pushed through \nCongress with minimal understanding or debate over the far-reaching \nimplications of its provisions, and I think that was a mistake.\n  The issues relating to the Communications Decency Act are larger than \nthe so-called adult expression or communication. The core issue is \nwhether Government, and in particular the Federal Government in \nWashington, DC, should decide what we see, hear, and write. The \nConstitution protects every American from this kind of censorship, \nexcept for very narrow circumstances, which did not exist in this case.\n\n[[Page S6131]]\n\n  So today, the court in Philadelphia affirmed our basic fundamental \nright to freedom of expression in this new mode of communication. I \nthink it is a victory for those who support freedom of speech and for \nthose who want to see this new dynamic communications technology \ndevelop safe from the chilling threat of Government control and \ncensorship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6130-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6131-S6136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the explanation of the conferees has \ncome to my attention. It is a joint explanatory statement of the \ncommittee of conference on this particular conference report, and on \npages 32 and 33, starting at the bottom of page 32, it reads:\n\n       The first use of reconciliation was for legislation that \n     reduced revenues. In 1975, the applicable budget resolution, \n     House Concurrent Resolution 466, provided an instruction to \n     both Ways and Means and Finance to report legislation \n     decreasing revenues. Notwithstanding the fact that the \n     authors of this 1974 Budget Act were neutral as to the policy \n     objectives of reconciliation, since 1975, reconciliation and \n     reconciliation legislation has been used to reduce the \n     deficit. The cited conferees notes while this resolution \n     includes a reconciliation instruction to reduce revenues, the \n     sum of the instructions would not only reduce the deficit but \n     would result in a balanced budget by the year 2002.\n\n  On the last point, of course, Mr. President, we only have to turn, \nonce again to the facts. This is almost getting to be an exercise in \nfutility. Somehow this is the only place in America where the truth \ncannot be recognized, even when they print it for you in black and \nwhite.\n  I refer specifically to the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nthe fiscal year 1997. At the top of page 4, you will see where they \nhave listed deficits for the purpose of the enforcement of this \nresolution. ``The amounts of the deficits are as follows,'' and it \nlists fiscal years 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and for the fiscal \nyear 2002, where the distinguished conferees, and particularly the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, is using the expression ``balanced \nbudget,'' his own document, for fiscal year 2002, shows a deficit of \n$103,845,000,000.\n  Reading further down the page to section 102 on page 4, you will find \nthat in the fiscal year 2002, the amount of the increase in the public \ndebt, subject to limitations, are for that year $130 billion. So how do \nyou balance the budget by the year 2002, and yet you have to go out and \nborrow $130 billion?\n  My point here is to change this record with respect to \nreconciliation, because the truth, as stated by the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico at that particular time--is shown here on page \nS. 15351 of the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate dated December \n3, 1980--not 1975. And I read the words of the distinguished chairman, \nnow chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici of New Mexico:\n\n       I think it is fitting that that last event signifies the \n     possibility of a new beginning because, as a matter of fact, \n     this is the first time in the history of our country that we \n     will send a bill to the President that is called a \n     reconciliation bill, and that means that some of the laws of \n     this country have been reconciled with the budget. That means \n     that they have been changed so that they come more into sync \n     or more harmonious with a budget that is left unchanged. That \n     is what reconciliation means. With all the years that our \n     distinguished Republican leader, Senator Bellmon, has spent \n     patiently working with the institution to bring some real \n     support for this process into fiscal restraint reality, I \n     think it is at least reaching fruition when we have a \n     reconciliation law that will go to the President. I hope \n     after the Senate votes today I commend him for that. Also \n     obviously, it is an extremely fitting event for Senator \n     Hollings. He did not have the privilege of being chairman of \n     the committee for very long, but he worked on the committee \n     for years, and I think he must feel very good today knowing \n     that under his leadership, this first reconciliation act will \n     become a reality.\n\n  That is the record made by the now chairman of the Budget Committee \nin 1980 and not 5 years previous thereto in 1975.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, in 1975, and I read from page 40297, \ndated December 12, 1975:\n\n       Mr. Mansfield. Mr. President, for the information of the \n     Senate, I have a few announcements. At 12 o'clock today, we \n     will be proceed to the consideration of the conference \n     report, of the defense appropriations conference report. \n     After that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \n     Senate proceed to the consideration of the tax bill, H.R. \n     5559 that is to be laid before the Senate and be the pending \n     business.\n\n  The majority leader called it a tax bill. A wrangle ensued. My good \nand very clever friend Senator Long, the former distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee, was trying to limit debate and limit \namendments. He very liberally referred to it as a reconciliation bill, \nbut it was not a reconciliation. It was a tax bill.\n  At that particular time, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Muskie, was momentarily misled trying to back Senator Long. But \nif you will read the Record, they finally ended up, Mr. President, by \ncalling it a tax bill and entering into a unanimous-consent agreement \nrequiring that all amendments be germane except for one nongermane \namendment to be offered by Senator Hartke, the then-Senator from \nIndiana. The Record is clear that the bill was a tax bill despite the \nerroneous use of the word ``reconciliation.''\n  Having worked on that budget, having been a part of the process \nduring the 1970's, having helped Senator Muskie on budget conferences, \nwe know that the first reconciliation bill in the history of the United \nStates was in December 1980.\n  That is not only supported by the statements made by the Senator from \nNew Mexico, but also by the statements made by our House colleagues. I \ncould refer to what Congressman Dick Bolling called it, Congressman \nLatta, Congressman Panetta, and others as well.\n  So the precedent relied upon by the Parliamentarian which we had to \nappeal quite simply misrepresents what actually happened. I hope that \nit will not have any standing whatsoever in this body because when they \nlook at the facts, the truth will have out that reconciliation \nthroughout its history has always been used as a budgetary tool to \nreduce the deficit, not increase the deficit.\n  My point is, Mr. President, that under this reconciliation bill, the \nRepublicans have perverted the process in order to cut taxes somewhere \nbetween $122 and $180 billion. It is very difficult to estimate it at \nthis particular point.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what they have in mind is to split up \nthe reconciliation bill. To use the process for political purposes in \nsending the President a legislation that combines Medicaid and welfare \nreforms to pay for tax cuts. Even the casual observer should be able to \nsee what's going on. The Medicaid cuts will have to be vetoed by the \nPresident because they take away the fundamental protection that we \ngive children in the United States of America. Even the Governors do \nnot want to do that.\n  Then it comes down to September and last of three bills that they \nwill call a reconciliation bill. And in the heat of a national \npresidential campaign, they will come forward with the political gift \nof a tax cut.\n  But a tax cut for wealthy corporations, or for the poor, or for the \nrich, or for the middle class, or for anybody is sheer nonsense.\n  We are running deficits right now, according to this conference \nreport that we are going to vote on. I started to say, they know no \nshame. But I have to amend that comment for the simple reason that the \nHouse Members know some shame. I say that because somebody over there \nhas held the budget up that we were going to--bam, bam--put through the \nHouse, put through the Senate, and finish this afternoon. The reason we \ndo not have it this afternoon--it increases deficits.\n  Under this conference report, for the year 2002, the Government will \nrun, under a best case scenario, a deficit of $103.8 billion.\n  In sum, Mr. President, we do not have the luxury of revenues to cut. \nWe cannot go in two different directions at once, but that is exactly \nthe road that this conference report takes us down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more \nminute.\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We have to pay the bills. We have to stop playing games \nand telling the people that somehow you can get tax cuts, when the \nresolutions says that next year we will be running deficits in excess \nof $227 billion.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious this is just a sordid political game \nthat is totally shameless. They come in here with these political, long \npass plays. Let us get rid of the gasoline revenues--but just \ntemporarily until after the Presidential election.\n  Nobody ought to appear in the U.S. Congress where we are supposed to \nbe responsible with that kind of nonsense. But they come in here with \nthat. Now with deficits projected at $227 billion for fiscal year 1997, \nthey say, ``We can get a tax cut and balance the budget.'' I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the sole issue before the U.S. Senate that \nis being debated this afternoon and voted on at such time as the House \nhas completed action, is whether or not we accept a budget resolution \nagreed to by a majority of conferees on the budget.\n  Once again, we are engaged in debate in which the opponents of this \nresolution, without exception, give lip service to a balanced budget. \nBut as has been the case this year, last year, in 1994, in 1993, and \nevery year back through the 1970's, it is always a different balanced \nbudget, not this one, not the resolution we have before us right now.\n  More taxes, says the Senator from South Carolina; more cuts in \ndefense says another Senator; less in the way of a restriction on \nentitlement growth, says a third.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that it is that kind of ``I'm for a \nbalanced budget, but not this one, not now, not this year, not this \nway,'' that causes us to have a national debt that exceeds $5 trillion.\n  If I had my way, Mr. President, this would not be the balanced budget \nthat we would be adopting. If the Presiding Officer had his way, this \nwould not be the balanced budget we would be adopting. If my close and \ndistinguished friend, the Senator from New Mexico, who chairs the \nSenate Budget Committee, had his way, it would not be this balanced \nbudget that we would be adopting.\n  But I believe that each of us has said, even though he has not gotten \nhis own way as against 99 other Members of the Senate, it is more \nimportant to take this step and to move forward in a correct and \nresponsible direction than it is to say, ``Not now, not this year, not \nthis way. Do it my way or don't do it at all.''\n  I listened with great sympathy to my friend on the other side of the \naisle, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, and I listened to \nhim with great sympathy because of his obvious and evident dedication \nto reaching this goal. He and I and the Senator who is now presiding \nall were a part of the bipartisan group to which he referred.\n  We worked for months on a proposal which would balance the budget and \nwhich could join together Republicans and Democrats. In spite of the \nopposition of the leadership in both parties and the President of the \nUnited States, we got 46 votes for our proposal. But 46 is not a \nmajority of 100 Senators.\n  I believe that was superior to the resolution that is before us now, \nbut I do not believe it was perfect. As the Senator from North Dakota \npointed out, each of us who was involved in that set of negotiations \ngave up something for the greater good.\n  But we do not have that proposal before us right now. I must say that \nI am disappointed in my friend from North Dakota because the question \nis not whether or not there is a better way to do this--each of us can \nfind something that he or she would use to improve this proposition--\nthe question is whether or not we are going to do something that moves \nus decisively in the right direction or nothing at all.\n  I regret to say that, I guess, Mr. President, in the ultimate \nanalysis we may do nothing. Oh, yes, we are going to pass this \nresolution. This is a responsible resolution which allows American \nworking families to make at least a slightly greater judgment over how \nthey spend the money they earn than they can do at the present time by \nlowering taxes on those families. That moves modestly, though not \ndecisively enough, in the direction of reducing the growth of \nentitlement programs which are destroying the fiscal stability of this \ncountry and eating the heart out of the futures of our children and our \ngrandchildren, and a resolution that deals responsibly with our need to \nfund something else through this Government than just a handful of huge \nincome transfer programs and entitlements. We have that choice on one \nside, perhaps too modest on entitlements, too modest on tax relief for \nAmerican working families, I think perhaps too stringent on much of our \ndiscretionary spending.\n\n  Nonetheless, we have a choice of doing that or saying, ``Oh, no, this \nis not perfect. We will vote against it. We will do nothing. We will \nleave it until next year.'' Almost inevitably, a President of the \nUnited States running for reelection is going to end up vetoing all of \nthe formal major statutory changes that would move us in this \ndirection.\n  I can only be reminded in connection with his actions, most \nregrettably, Mr. President, by the supposed comment of Louis the XV of \nFrance on his deathbed: ``After me, the deluge.''\n  The President sees a Medicare trust fund report that says that the \nMedicare hospital trust fund will go bankrupt in the year 2001, and \neven if he is reelected President of the United States, that is after \nhis watch is over. So we do not need to do anything now. We can \ncontinue on the status quo road, at least until after this next \nelection. It is exactly that attitude, which certainly is not \nexclusively held by the President of the United States, ``Let's wait \nuntil after the next election,'' that has given us this $5 trillion in \ndebt.\n  I hope against hope, Mr. President, of course, that in addition to a \ndegree of responsibility of party discipline on this side of the aisle, \nwe will have Members of the other party who say, ``This is not exactly \nwhat I wanted, but it certainly moves us in the right direction as a \ncountry. It certainly provides a degree of relief for this Nation. It \nwill certainly help generations who are going to come after us who \ncannot vote in the elections of 1996. So I will swallow some of my \nreservations, and I make that move in the right direction.''\n  I hope against hope that the President will believe that is at least \nas advantageous as demagoging the issue. I will hope next year we come \ncloser to doing something like the bipartisan budget that failed by so \nnarrow a margin. I hope for all of those things, Mr. President, the \nonly actual duty that I have right now and that every other Senator has \nright now is to say yes to this proposal that moves in the right \ndirection, or, no, we can go another year without doing anything at \nall, letting the situation get worse and worse and worse.\n  Mr. President, the overwhelming argument is in favor of the passage \nof this budget resolution.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President I ask to be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from \nWashington, who I have the privilege of serving with not only on the \nBudget Committee but on the Commerce Committee, and for whom I have the \ngreatest respect, says that what we are hearing now is nothing but lip \nservice from people who do not want to do anything. People who say, \n``Not this way, not that way.''\n  The truth of the matter is, Mr. President, he knows otherwise. This \nparticular Senator, his colleague, voted for a balanced budget in 1968, \noffered a freeze that they still refer to as the ``Fritz freeze,'' and \ncoauthored Gramm-Rudman-Hollings with cuts across the board. We passed \nthat, got President Reagan to sign it. We followed that up in the \nBudget Committee with a bipartisan proposal to increase taxes because \nwe found out that you could not choose this way or that way, but rather \nneeded all of the above. We needed to freeze spending, we needed to \nmake cuts, we had to withhold new programs, and we had to increase \ntaxes in order to get a balanced budget.\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\n  That brings me to the point. Do not come here and blame the \nPresident, saying that he has put off the tough decisions until after \nthe next election. In December 1994 the leaders of the new Republican \nmajority appeared on ``Meet the Press'' and said the President was \nirrelevant, they didn't care what he said. But as this conference \nreport lays bare, the Republicans have their sights set on the White \nHouse in 1996. That is why almost two-thirds of the tough choices under \ntheir plan are deferred until the Presidential election in the year \n2000.\n\n  So the 7 year, ``do nothing in two Presidential elections'' approach \nwas what the contract crowd proposed. That was the arrogance of the \nwhole thing. This debate is not about President Clinton. In 1993, he \nproposed a budget that did something about deficits--the only President \nthat has reduced the deficit in the past 30 years. He cut the deficit \n$500 billion. He taxed Social Security and gasoline. He cut Medicare \n$57 billion. And he did it without a single Republican vote.\n  The unmitigated gall of those who will stand on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate and say the President is tricky or the President backloads or \nthe President does not care about deficits. There ought to be ashes in \ntheir mouths. They are the ones that caused this fiscal cancer. \nPresident Clinton has moved us in the right direction.\n  We are trying to get together and get something done. But to come and \ncall this a balanced budget, where their own document shows that they \nhave a deficit of $103.8 billion in the year 2002, is a pure sham. It \nis all politics.\n  It is sordid legislation they are bringing up here in the months \nbefore the election. They ought to be ashamed of themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, to be \nequally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I might say to Senators--I am sure \nSenator Exon would agree with this statement--the hour of 3:30 is going \nto arrive and the House will not have sent us the resolution, so we \ncannot vote. The unanimous consent said we would vote at another time \ntomorrow, to be established by the majority leader in consultation with \nthe minority leader.\n  I think, for Senators who might want to speak this afternoon, we are \ntrying to get off of the resolution at 3:30, which was when we were \ngoing to vote, and then have a reasonable amount of time left, by \nagreement, for when we bring it up tomorrow. So, if other things have \nto get done, they can today. Clearly, there is no reason to sit here \nwithout the resolution and using the Senate's time.\n  Mr. President, I think Senator Hollings, the distinguished former \nchairman of the Budget Committee and ranking member for some period of \ntime, has in his own way attempted to make a case against one of the \nreconciliation instructions in this budget resolution.\n  Frankly, I now have in my hands the second concurrent resolution on \nthe budget for fiscal year 1976, Mr. Muskie, chairman, conference \nreport. I just want to read it, and perhaps I might engage with the \ncurrent Parliamentarian in a few parliamentary inquiries about the \ncontent of this resolution and what some of the content has been \nconstrued to be by the Parliamentarian. I do not know that it is earth-\nshaking that we are doing three reconciliation bills. I do not believe \nwe are going to change our mind. And I do not believe we have done \nanything to dramatically alter reconciliation or to offend the Senate \nand its processes in some irrevocable way. So we are going to continue \ndown our path.\n  I am having a great deal of difficulty understanding how my good \nfriend, Senator Hollings, can say we have never heretofore reconciled a \ncommittee to reduce taxes when I read from a conference report that, \namong other things, says, ``The Congress determines and declares \npursuant to section 310(a) of the Budget Act of 1974 that for fiscal \nyear beginning July 1, 1975''--and then I will move down to paragraph 4 \nand read the following:\n\n       The recommended level of Federal revenues is $300.8 \n     billion, and the House Committee on Ways and Means and the \n     Senate Committee on Finance shall submit to their respective \n     Houses legislation to decrease Federal revenues by \n     approximately $6.4 billion.\n\n  Now, there are other provisions, but I am just going to read that \none. I think I am going to ask now, if I might, the Parliamentarian, if \nhe has that language before him and the precedence of the Senate. \nParliamentary inquiry. Was that provision not construed in that year to \nbe a reconciliation instruction?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You were not the Parliamentarian then, but is it \nrecorded in the precedence of the Senate as a decision regarding a \nreconciliation instruction, Mr. Parliamentarian?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What does the precedent say with reference to that \nparliamentary inquiry, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On December 15, 1975, the Senate began \nconsideration of H.R. 5559, which as passed by the House was not a \nreconciliation bill, and which contained only one substantive \nprovision: to exclude from income certain earnings derived from \npayments by common carriers for use of railroad rolling stock owned by \nforeign corporations. After the Senate began its consideration, and the \nchairman of the Finance Committee asserted that the bill as reported \nwith a substitute was intended to carry out the reconciliation \ninstructions contained in the most recently adopted concurrent \nresolution on the budget, the Chair stated that there would be 20 hours \ndebate on the bill, 2 hours on first-degree amendments, 1 hour on \nsecond-degree amendments and motions, and that amendments, except those \nspecified in an earlier unanimous consent agreement, would have to be \ngermane. These were the conditions specified in the Budget Act for the \nconsideration of reconciliation bills.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair and the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. President, I want to just take one more opportunity, while we \nwait for others who might want to speak and wait for clearance on the \nproposal that I have just stated to the Senate that we might try to \naccomplish--that is, try to get off of the resolution at 3:30 and save \na reasonable amount of time, hopefully 1 hour on a side, for the time \npreceding the actual vote, which would be determined for tomorrow by \nthe joint leadership.\n  I want to speak just about two issues one more time. Mr. President, \nin this budget resolution, there are discretionary appropriations for \nthe Defense Department and discretionary appropriations for all of the \nrest of Government, the domestic portion of our Government. When I say \ndiscretionary appropriations, what I am talking about is program \nauthority that must be passed upon and enacted every year. That is the \nway the current law is. So if you appropriate $286 billion for the \ndefense of our country, it is for 1 year. Come the next year, you have \nto appropriate again. Likewise, in the 10 predominantly domestic \ndiscretionary appropriations bills, whether it is the Treasury-Postal \nbill, the energy and water bill, the Labor, Health and Human Services \nbill, this is a 1-year appropriation of money. It lasts for 1 year. It \nmust be passed every year. Without it, there is no money to spend for \nany of those programs and activities.\n  Now, last year, we got into a very big debate with our President over \nthe domestic discretionary budgets, these various subcommittees that I \nhave described. There were two big problems. One was that in both \nHouses we had put riders on the appropriation bill, which is not an \nuncommon thing.\n  Second, in some instances, some programs were cut more than the \nPresident wanted, and we got ourselves into a political hiatus, and \nGovernment was closed down and reopened and closed down and reopened \nand closed down and reopened.\n  Now, what we have done in this budget resolution is we have asked the \nCongressional Budget Office how much money do we need to have a freeze \non\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nall of these domestic accounts--no cuts, a freeze. They gave us the \ndollar number that we needed in these bills to continue, without any \ncuts, a freeze on all of these domestic programs that require \nappropriations this year, for the fiscal year beginning October 1, \n1996, through the end of September 1997.\n  So this budget does not propose any significant cuts in domestic \nprograms. It proposes a freeze. What does the President propose? The \nPresident proposes in his 6- or 7-year budget that in 1997 those \nappropriated accounts go up $15 billion. So while on the one hand we \ntalk of balancing the budget, the President produced a budget that said \nlet us spend $15 billion more than we spent last year. Obviously, that \ngives the President for 1 year the latitude to say he is increasing \neducation, he is increasing this, he is increasing that. We say freeze \nthem, if you are serious about a budget. You can take a freeze, if you \nare serious about a balanced budget.\n  What is interesting about the budget differences--we do not have the \nPresident's budget before us because it was voted down in the Senate. \nNonetheless, what is interesting is that the President's increases \ncontinue only for an election year and then start down. Then he \nproduces two budgets, not one. He produces one using his own numbers, \nhis own economics, and he says, ``This is what I am going to do over \nthe next 7 years.'' And it comes tumbling down in the last 2 years, and \nthis is where you have the argument that Senator Bond is making that \nsince the President wants to spend even during that downturn more money \nfor certain areas like education and others, it is inevitable that the \nveterans' function gets cut dramatically. Many others programs get cut \ndramatically. The space program is disassembled for all intents and \npurposes. But the Cabinet members run around telling the constituency \n``We are not bound by that. The President has told us we will take it \none year at a time.'' That is one budget. The President has another \nbudget. That budget is the one, the second one, that permits him to \nsay, ``They told me to do it their way, and I have done it their way. I \nhave a balanced budget.'' It is the same kind of balance as Congress \nhas excepting that in that budget he has to really cut. He has to \nreally cut the veterans. He has to really cut the domestic accounts, \nexcept you wait until the last 2 years and then cut $67 billion out of \nthose accounts. But that is not the budget he is telling the people \nabout. He is telling them about the easier budget, the one where he \nuses his own economics and his own assumptions which is kind of the \nrosy scenario budget. Then in turn Cabinet people send out to our \nrespective States how much has to be cut under our budgets with silence \nabout how much has to be cut in theirs; in fact, disavowing that \nanything necessarily has to be cut because, if asked, they say, ``We \nwill take it one year at a time.''\n  I believe it is only fair that we set the record straight here. We \nare going to deliver appropriations bills--it is not my responsibility \nexcept for one subcommittee--but our distinguished chairman, Senator \nHatfield, I am certain with the cooperation of Democrats is going to \nproduce these bills that are very close to a freeze in every case. I am \nvery hopeful that the public understands that it is really kind of \nphony to say we ought to spend $15 billion more because this is an \nelection year only to find as soon as the election is over we will \nstart reducing them and actually 2 years after this President would \nleave office, even if he is reelected, is when we get serious about \nmaking some real cuts. So I think the freeze is fair.\n  My second point has to do, just for a minute one more time, about \nMedicare and the huge misrepresentation in the President's Medicare \nproposal. So let me tell Americans one more time how the President is \nhandling Medicare.\n  First of all, I repeat that Medicare is going broke. I do not say \nthis with any joy. I did not do the estimating. My committee staff did \nnot. Three Cabinet members and the head person of Social Security are \nfour out of the five people who review it annually and tell us the \ntruth. Three of them work for the President. One of them is appointed \nby the President. What did they say? They said things are getting worse \nsince last year when you did nothing and the fund is going to be \nbankrupt in 5 years. Let us throw out that word ``bankrupt'' and let us \nsay what it means.\n  Each year the trust fund is spending more for seniors who are \nentitled to the coverage than the taxes coming in. There was a surplus, \nMr. President. So we are still able to pay the bill. The surplus is \ndisappearing and the money coming in is not enough to pay the bills \ngoing out. So in the fifth year they now say--5 years--there will not \nbe any money to pay the bills. How else can we say it? Everybody's \npaycheck keeps having that money taken out of it for Medicare and it \nkeeps going in. Nobody is cheating in terms of putting it in there.\n  One of the most enforced laws around is that for withholding for \nSocial Security and Medicare. These trustees told us in the following \nlanguage, and I do not quote but I paraphrase: It is imperative that \nyou make the fund solvent by restraining and curtailing the costs of \nthe program. What did the President do? The President finds a magic \nasterisk of $55 billion, a master stroke of magic. He says let us take \n$55 billion of the expenditures for our seniors and let us just take it \nout of there. Let us not spend it for seniors, $55 billion. And the $55 \nbillion happens to be the fastest growing account in Medicare, home \nhealth care.\n\n  Now, watch, when this becomes an issue, and it is getting there, \nthere will be some kind of argument. The argument will be, ``Well, home \ncare should never have been in there to begin with.'' The point of it \nis, when the trustees write about this fund going bankrupt, they are \nwriting about the fund and the expenditures and programs of today. It \njust happens we are paying home health care and hospitalization out of \nthat trust fund; point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2, if that fund is going broke, the fastest contributor to \nit going broke is the home health care costs. So, is it not \ninteresting, magically take out those costs and put them someplace else \nand, of course, you can say Medicare just got $55 billion more solvent. \nWhat happens to home health care costs of $55 billion and growing? The \nPresident says let the average taxpayer pay for it. He did not just \nkind of slip it through and say whatever you have been paying, \ntaxpayers--struggling, working, both of you with a job, trying to make \nends meet--whatever you were paying taxes for, I just decided to add \n$55 billion more to that tax burden.\n  Frankly, I do not think that is right. I do not think the President \nought to be able to say he has fixed Medicare without having to change \nthe cost structure and save real money, just slip the payment over, \nchange it around, move it someplace else onto the already burdened \ntaxpayer and abracadabra, magic, the fund is now more solvent.\n  We had to do what the trustees told us to do. We had to restrain \nthose costs, so instead of growing at 10.5 percent, they are growing at \n7 percent. They are not getting cut, they are growing at 7 percent. We \nwill be spending $7,000 per capita under Medicare in 6 years, and it is \n$5,200 now. It is not less, it is $1,800 more. But we will reform the \nsystem, offer options, change the way we pay the various providers, and \ncreate a new, modern program where cost containment and restraints will \nbenefit the senior in that the fund will become solvent as will the \ntaxpayer, in that you will not switch $55 billion of the program to the \ntaxpayers of America.\n  I think it is imperative that everybody begin to understand the \nsituation. Second, the second part of Medicare is an insurance policy. \nBack yonder, perhaps under Lyndon Johnson or somewhere around there, we \nsaid we ought to give seniors more than hospital coverage, so we gave \nthem an optional insurance policy. When we started it we said we will \npay 50 percent, the senior will pay 50 percent. We got generous some \nyears ago and said let us make it 75 percent taxpayers, 25 percent \nseniors.\n  Six years ago we said let us let the senior pay a little bit more, 31 \npercent and the taxpayers pay the rest. It has now come back down to \n25, because that number of years that we made the change has now \nexpired. And we contend, in order to make that a reliable program, we \nmust save $44 billion over 6 years. Interestingly enough, the President \nsays we need to do 44 billion dollars' worth, too. He does it one way,\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\nwe do it another way, but there is no argument on how much has to be \ndone.\n  So, as we began to look at one of the major issues, and this is one, \ninstead of an issue of making this solvent and getting rid of this \ndisaster that is pending right around the corner, it has become the \npolitical issue that is who is doing best by the seniors, who is making \nthe fund more solvent for a longer period of time, and who is doing it \nmost fairly.\n  I submit it is pretty easy to fix the Medicare fund if you just want \nto take away its responsibilities and its liabilities and the costs \nimposed and just take them out, take them away and let somebody else \npay for them like the general tax coffers, general taxpayers. That is \nessentially a substantial portion of the way the President chooses to \nsolve it.\n  I believe a freestanding bill in this place, and in the U.S. House, \nand thoroughly aired across America, that said do you want the general \ntaxpayers to pay $55 billion of the health trust fund for seniors or do \nyou want to continue with the trust fund and the payroll situation we \nhave now--I do not believe very many people would vote to take general \ntax dollars and put them in that trust fund. We are doing it, kind of \nby just a slip of the pen here, just a turn of the page and write in \nsomething on a budget that says it is all changed.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Quickly, Mr. President, because the hour of 3:30 is \narriving, the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from South \nCarolina do not have a differing view with respect to the Finance \nCommittee bringing out a tax reduction bill. There is no question they \ncan do that, subject to the instructions, particularly back in 1975 \nwhere we had several budget resolutions. But not the reconciliation \nprocess, that is exactly what it was and that is what they stated.\n  Mr. Mansfield said, ``I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of the tax bill, H.R. 5559'' on December 12. Then, on \nDecember 15, as the distinguished Senator referred, the assistant \nlegislative clerk read as follows: ``A bill, H.R. 1559, to make changes \nin certain income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1954.''\n  However, it was clearly obvious from the full Record, and we can make \nthat Record here as a part of this Record if we wish, that Senator Long \nwas trying to limit debate and not have the Hartke amendments, which \nwere not germane. And in that discourse, even though Mr. Long had \ncalled it reconciliation, the chairman said, and I quote Mr. Hartke:\n\n       The chairman of the Finance Committee can make a statement \n     but that does not make it the situation. The Committee on \n     Finance has not acted upon this being a reconciliation bill. \n     There is no record of its being a reconciliation bill. There \n     is no mention of it in the report as being a reconciliation \n     bill. Therefore, I think the point of order would not be well \n     taken in regard to any amendment because it is not a \n     reconciliation bill. This is a tax reduction bill.\n\n  And finally, Senator Muskie, the chairman, and the rest of them, \nafter a long debate, including Senator Dole who was on Finance and \nsupporting the position taken by Senator Hartke, allowed the Hartke \namendments. And somewhat in defeat, when he finally was there, on \nDecember 15, Mr. Muskie said, ``I wonder if I might not yield the \nfloor. I think I have made whatever contribution I can with discussions \nof the problem.'' And he yielded to the whole thing whereby they \nbrought the amendment up.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would hope the Senator from New Mexico would \nagree with his own words. We know Mr. Ullman, I have here; Mr. Panetta, \nMr. Bellmon, Mr. Regula, Mr. Bolling and the numerous Senators on this \nside, but particularly Senator Domenici. I quote, on December 3, 1980, \nwhere 5 years hence, and I quote him:\n\n       And also obviously it is an extremely fitting event for \n     Senator Hollings. He did not have the privilege of being \n     chairman of this committee for very long, but he worked on \n     the committee for years and I think that he must feel very \n     good today, knowing that under his leadership this first \n     reconciliation act will become a reality.\n\n  It was the first. And all reconciliation, as Mr. Pickle from Texas \nand everyone else pointed out--reconciliation was the process to bring \nthe deficits down, bring the spending down into a particular budget \ntarget, not to increase deficits with tax cuts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Bill \nDauster, dated May 30, in Roll Call entitled ``The Day the Senate Died: \nBudget Measure Weakens Minority'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, May 30, 1996]\n\n        The Day the Senate Died: Budget Measure Weakens Minority\n\n                           (By Bill Dauster)\n\n       The Senate died last week. At the very least, it suffered a \n     blow that leaves it clinging to life.\n       You may be forgiven if you missed it. It happened while the \n     Senate considered the budget resolution, a budget whose \n     fiscal priorities pretty much repeat last year's endless \n     budget failure.\n       But while most observers of Congress yawned, the Republican \n     majority used the budget process to fundamentally alter the \n     way the Senate works. From now on, the Senate will conduct \n     much of its business at its hallmark deliberative pace only \n     if the majority wants it that way.\n       It is the Senate's deliberative pace that has distinguished \n     it from the House of Representatives and other parliaments. \n     Yes, the Senate does apportion its membership by state \n     instead of by population, but its true uniqueness flows from \n     the way its rules preserve the rights of determined \n     minorities.\n       Once the presiding officer has recognized a Senator, the \n     Senate's rules allow the Senator to speak as long as humanly \n     possible, unless 60 Senators vote to end the filibuster. The \n     mere threat of filibuster--called a ``hold'' can detain \n     legislation.\n       As well, when the Senate is considering one subject, \n     Senators have the perfect right to offer amendments on \n     entirely different subjects. These powers to debate and amend \n     make every single-United States Senator a force to be \n     reckoned with. They give dedicated groups of Senators \n     substantial power. And they give 41 Senators the absolute \n     right to kill a bill.\n       All that changed last week. Sen. Pete Domenici (R-NM), the \n     Budget Committee chairman, brought to the Senate floor a \n     budget resolution that markedly expanded the use of a \n     procedure called ``reconciliation.'' The reconciliation \n     process creates bills that the Senate considers with only \n     limited debate and limited opportunities to amend.\n       Because reconciliation bills limit debate, Senators cannot \n     filibuster them. A simple majority can pass them. Because \n     Senators may offer only germane amendments to reconciliation \n     bills, Senators must stick to only the subjects chosen by the \n     majority in the committee process. Because of the \n     reconciliation process's power, the Senate has limited it \n     solely to deficit reduction through the ``Byrd Rule,'' named \n     after the Senate's parliamentary conscience, Sen. Robert Byrd \n     (D-WVa).\n       This year's budget will generate an unprecedented three \n     reconciliation bills--on welfare, Medicare, and tax cuts--\n     designed to maximize partisan confrontation with the \n     President. And in a marked departure from past practice, the \n     Republican budget resolution devotes one of the three \n     reconciliation bills--the one to cut taxes--solely to \n     worsening the deficit.\n       On May 21, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), \n     backed by Sens. Jim Exon (D-Neb), Emest Hollings (D-SC), and \n     Byron Dorgan (D-ND), formally challenged the procedure. The \n     Republican-appointed Parliamentarian gave it his blessing.\n       In a series of exchanges with the presiding officer, \n     Daschle demonstrated that the new procedure has few limits. \n     Daschle appealed the ruling, but the Senate sustained the \n     procedure on a straight party-line vote.\n       From now on, the majority party can create as many \n     reconciliation bills as it wants. And the majority can use \n     them to increase spending or cut taxes, worsening the \n     deficit. From now on, the majority can use the reconciliation \n     process to move its entire legislative agenda through the \n     Senate with simple majority votes and few distractions.\n       The old Senate is dead. Some may say, ``Good riddance.'' \n     After all, as a Democratic Member of Congress once said, ``In \n     the Senate, you can't go to the bathroom without 60 votes.''\n       If a simple majority can now pass important legislation in \n     the Senate, perhaps a lot more will get done. Democrats will \n     recall their frustration with Republican filibusters. Indeed, \n     then-Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser (D-Tenn) once tried \n     to convince Byrd to allow the Senate to consider the Clinton \n     health care reform bill using the reconciliation process. \n     Byrd did not want that done.\n       Also, the Parliamentarian at that time advised that it \n     would not be in order for a budget resolution to instruct the \n     creation of a reconciliation bill that solely worsened the \n     deficit.\n       One can think about efficiency and Congress in two ways. \n     The current conventional wisdom thinks in terms of \n     legislative efficiency: How many bills become laws?\n       But as Nobel Prize-winning economist James Buchanan has \n     argued, societal efficiency may be better served by a \n     Congress\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\n     that has hard time enacting laws. Under those circumstances, \n     laws would change less often, less frequently disrupting \n     peoples' lives, less often intruding into them. If you agree \n     with Thoreau that the best government is that which governs \n     least, then the most societally efficient government is the \n     one with the most checks and balances.\n       The Republican majority may thus have served legislative \n     efficiency at the expense of societal efficiency. Good or \n     bad, the Senate has changed.\n       As Daschle warned on May 21, ``What goes around comes \n     around.'' Democrats will remember the lessons the Republicans \n     have taught them of how to use the power of the majority.\n       So say ``bye, bye'' to this slice of American pie. This'll \n     be the day that it dies. This'll be the way that it dies.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will speak in morning business in \nrelation to the rash of hate crimes that we have experienced in this \ncountry lately.\n  Mr. President, the perpetrators of the rash of hate crimes and church \nburnings in this country are no more than cowardly domestic terrorists. \nThey work under cover of darkness and anonymity to intimidate some and \nencourage others precisely because they have neither the will nor the \ncourage to be associated with the evil they seek to unleash on the \nland. It has been suggested that the objective of their actions is to \nstart a race war. However, there is every indication that the arsonists \nare confused about the country in which their crimes are taking place.\n  Most Americans, Mr. President, are appalled and outraged. Our Nation \nas a whole, without regard to color or religion, is shamed by this \nhorror. The outpouring of support and comfort for the victims of the \nterrorism has been consistent and has been multiracial. The religious \ncommunity has closed ranks with the targets of the arson in rejection \nand repudiation of the evil these crimes represent. From the President \nof the United States to the neighbors in areas which have witnessed \nthese crimes, the leadership taken by individual citizens to affirm a \nclimate of respect and community gives truth to the fact that our \nNation will not fall prey to the forces of fear.\n  Mr. President, I recently talked with the victim of a cross burning \nin my own State of Illinois, who lives in Glen Carbon, IL. I spoke with \nMr. Ellis who had been victimized by a cross being burned on the front \nlawn of his home. And the comment that I was most struck with is that \nhe said how nice his neighbors had been. This is an integrated \ncommunity. His neighbors, black and white alike, have come to the aid \nof this family that has suffered this heinous crime.\n  Mr. President, America will not go back. As we enter the 21st \ncentury, America is anxious to put the ugly legacy of racial divisions \nbehind us. Unlike a century ago, the masses of people who make up our \nnational community cannot be seduced by the messages of hate and \nconflict which consumed us in the past. Those messages lost their power \nwith the moral victory of the civil rights movement, and our country \nhas matured in ways which cannot be undone by racist terrorism. We are \nnot intimidated, but embarrassed, and challenged by these criminals and \ntheir destruction.\n  Make no mistake but that they are criminals. The act of arson is a \ncrime, when directed at a church it is a crime of unspeakable \ndimension. But that is precisely why we are called upon, each of us, to \nspeak and act in ways which will demonstrate our collective intolerance \nof such hate crimes. Our community, as a whole, must dedicate itself to \nthe rebuilding of the churches. We must engage our Government and law \nenforcement apparatus to investigate and uncover the perpetrators of \nthis terrorism. No stone should be left unturned in our search for the \ntruth. Federal, State, and local law enforcement must approach these \nhate crimes with the same vigor and sophistication as would be given \nthe most heinous foreign threat.\n  My late mother would often say, ``The Lord works in mysterious ways, \nHis wonders to perform.'' And she was right. The resurrection of the \nburnt places of worship may well provide the kind of redemption which \ncan only come of suffering. We will move our Nation forward to the \nelimination of racism if we dedicate ourselves to restore the symbols \nof love and unity, and in so doing put to rest forever the forces of \ndivision based on race which these acts of terror seek to unleash.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those historic moments for America, \nwhen the path of our future will be chosen. In our collective \nrepudiation of domestic terrorism, in our aggressive prosecution of its \nperpetrators, in our vigilance against hate and in the vitality of our \nresponse to it, we will build the New Jerusalem of a stronger, more \nmoral, and more inclusive country.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will send later to the desk a resolution \nwhich I hope will be cleared quickly for action by this body and which \nI hope and pray will receive the unanimous consent of my colleagues. \nThank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the Senator from California is a very \nvaluable member of the Budget Committee. We had saved some time for \nher.

Mr. President, thank you. I want to thank my leader on \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Exon, who will be sorely missed when he \nretires. This is a man who has stood for a real balance in our \nGovernment, a balanced budget, and a balance in our priorities. I hope \nas America listens to him, and some of us who do not believe this \nbudget is the right budget, I hope Americans will understand the fight \nover balancing the budget.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. EXON. I appreciate your kind remarks, and I yield 5 hours to the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you so much.\n  As I was saying about the Senator from Nebraska, he has stood for \nreal balance in the budget, both in terms of dollars in and dollars \nout, so that we do not add to a debt, but also a balance of needs. What \nis very interesting to me, in particular, Senator Exon, as the former \nchairman of the Budget Committee, and now as its ranking member, has \nalways been one who has stood for the strongest possible defense that \nAmerica must have. When I hear him stand up and talk about some of the \nexcesses in that area, it means a lot to me.\n\n  What is interesting to me, when we had an opportunity to vote on \nbudgets, we had three budgets. We had the Republican budget before the \nSenate today, coming back from the conference; we had the Democratic \nbudget, which, basically, was President Clinton's budget; and we had \nthe bipartisan\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nbudget, which was put together by Republicans and Democrats in this \nU.S. Senate.\n  I had the privilege of voting for two budgets, the Democrat budget \nand the bipartisan budget. I did not vote for the Republican budget. \nAlthough many people's eyes glaze over when you talk about the budget, \nit is really a very simple document when you think about it. It is a \nstatement of our priorities, and a statement, really, of what we think \nwe ought to be doing as a nation, just as we and our families will \ndetermine every year what our priorities are, where we will spend our \ndollars. We do that here.\n  One would think that the cold war had not ended if you look at this \nbudget. That is what is so terribly confusing to me, because we know we \nhave to be lean in this budget. We know we are not doing as much for \neducation as we would like. We are not doing as much to clean up the \nenvironment as we would like, at least most of us. We are certainly not \ndoing enough health research as we would like.\n  Every dollar that we can find to make these investments is a dollar, \nI think, that is well spent when we make them. Yet, we have this \nRepublican Senate and House throwing $12 billion more at the Pentagon \nthan they asked for in budget authority. That, to me, is nonsensical.\n  We need the strongest military in the world, and we have it, and we \nwill always have it. We do not need to throw dollars that the generals \nand the admirals do not want. What is the point of it? It is wasting \nmoney, money that we need elsewhere, money that could even reduce the \ndeficit further.\n  To me, it is not a close call as far as how I will vote. The \nRepublican budget left the Senate, and I think the priorities were out \nof whack. Too many cuts in Medicare, too many cuts in Medicaid, too \nmany cuts in education, too many cuts in the environment, and too much \nspending on the Pentagon--more than they asked for. It is something I \nhope that the American people will look at, because it is not pie-in-\nthe-sky and it is not rhetoric. It is not politics. It is budgeting. It \nis hard dollars that will go to pay for what the American people need \nto have.\n  Mr. President, we do have an election coming up in November. Frankly, \nI think a lot of these issues will be issues in that election. I can \nthink of no greater honor than to serve on the Budget Committee. When I \nwas in the House, I spent 6 years there, and here in the U.S. Senate I \nam finishing the fourth. To me, it is one of the most important things \nthat I do, because the hopes and dreams of American people, their \naspirations, are really contained in that budget.\n  All you have to do is look at education, and see how the Republicans \nare slashing it, to understand that will translate into fewer \nscholarships for our young people to go to college, fewer slots that \ncan be filled in Head Start so our kids can get off to a good start on \na level playing field, fewer ways to clean up Superfund sites. Frankly, \nin California, we have many that are languishing and are dangerous, \nwith toxins seeping into water supplies, because we do not have enough \nresources there.\n\n  This is the greatest Nation in the world. We can do better.\n  The Democratic budget, the Clinton budget, the bipartisan budget, I \nthink all of those are quite mainstream in their approach, compared to \nthis budget that is before the Senate today. We do not have to hurt our \nseniors the way they will be hurt with this. We do not have to hurt our \nchildren the way they will be hurt with this.\n  Now we have a whole new idea. We will go back to star wars. We will \nbuild a full star wars. I think we ought to prepare, in case we have \nto. We should do all the research. I have always taken that position. \nBut to get ready to deploy a star wars system--we will be facing that \nin the defense bill--it will cost us billions of dollars, billions of \ndollars, when we do not even know exactly what we need to do, and we \nare being told the threat is not defined yet. It just does not make \nsense.\n  I submit, Mr. President, if you went to a supermarket or shopping \ncenter in Tennessee, or I went to one in California, or my friend went \nto one in Nebraska, and you said to the person who was coming in to do \nhis shopping: Out of these few things, which do you feel most \nthreatened by, crime in the street and that you might get mugged or \nattacked, or somebody in your family getting breast cancer or prostate \ncancer, or a ballistic missile coming over and hitting you in your \nhouse? I honestly think that people would say we should have the \nstrongest military in the world, but the threats that are facing me are \nabsolutely that someone in my family would get such a dreadful disease \nor that, yes, someone could be a victim of a crime. Yet, you look at \nthis budget and it has the opposite kind of priorities.\n\n  So I thank my friend from Nebraska for his leadership, his very down-\nto-earth Nebraska leadership. I will sorely miss it next year. I think \nhe stands for mainstream America in his opposition to this budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget. It got worse when \nit went into conference. It has more of the Newt Gingrich approach to \nbudgeting, and I frankly think we ought to vote ``no.''\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I want to briefly thank my dear friend and \ncolleague from California. I said earlier that she is a valuable member \nof the Budget Committee, and her earlier training over on the House \nside has served her and us well. She is very consistent and tender, one \nwho becomes involved in the details of the budget process. It has been \na great pleasure for me to see this relatively new Senator come in and \ntake her place as a very influential member of the Budget Committee. I \nthank her for her kind remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6136-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, I welcome the news that negotiations on \nNorthern Ireland are back on course. Fractious though they might be, \nthe talks involving the British and Irish Governments, as well as \nrepresentatives of Northern Ireland's political parties, offer hope to \nall of us who long for a permanent peace in Northern Ireland.\n  The talks, which opened Monday, had hit a significant impasse over \nthe role of our former colleague George Mitchell, who was chosen by the \nBritish and Irish Governments to chair the negotiating sessions. Due to \nthe courage shown by all those involved, but particularly Prime \nMinister Major and Unionist leader David Trimble, the impasse has been \nresolved and a possible deadlock has been averted. The talks will \nproceed with Senator Mitchell at the helm.\n  I regret that there are still some Unionists, however, who object to \nSenator Mitchell's chairmanship, for the sole purpose, I suspect, of \nobstructing the peace process. Having served with George Mitchell for \nmany years in the Senate, I can personally attest to his even-handed \nand judicious approach to the issues. Here in the Senate, he was \nadmired by members of both parties for his ability to build bridges and \ncut across partisan lines. George Mitchell is quite frankly, one of the \nmost fair-minded individuals with whom I have had the pleasure of \nworking.\n  Senator Mitchell has already demonstrated great wisdom and balance \nwith regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland. In January, \nSenator Mitchell issued an excellent report examining the link between \nthe decommissioning of weapons and all-party talks. As head of the \ninternational body charged with studying this issue. Senator Mitchell \ndrew upon his background as a judge. He did an excellent\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\njob of reaching out to the various parties to hear their views on this \ndifficult matter, and of characterizing the opposing views on that \nissue. For this reason, the report was hailed across the board. It \nprovides a solid set of principles for the negotiations. I am confident \nthat Senator Mitchell will continue to demonstrate even-handedness and \ngreat insight as he takes up the gavel at Stormont Castle, the site of \nthe talks.\n  The talks on Northern Ireland will proceed without the participation \nof Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. Sinn \nFein is barred from the negotiating sessions because the IRA has failed \nto commit to a cease-fire. That is as it should be. The ground rules \nfor the talks make clear that all parties must offer their total \ncommitment to the principles of democracy and nonviolence.\n  But there is a place reserved at the table for Sinn Fein. The IRA \nneed only recommit itself to nonviolence to take its seat at that \ntable. Genuine all-party talks cannot take place without Sinn Fein or \nwithout the Unionist parties which have thus far eschewed the process.\n  A great deal of progress has been made toward achieving a lasting \npeace. Let us hope that the momentum can be continued.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6137-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Res. 400, I have requested \n     that S. 1718 be referred to the Committee upon its discharge \n     from the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, to which \n     the bill was referred on June 6, 1996.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Warner,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6138-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6138-S6139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n         AMERICA'S FAMILY FARMS: A WAY OF LIFE WORTH PRESERVING\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I recently visited the farm of Doug \nHenderson in Beresford, SD, and discussed with Doug and his neighbors \nissues facing southeastern South Dakota farmers. There was much give \nand take on the new farm bill, the state of cattle prices and, of \ncourse, the weather. The discussion put in bold relief the frustrations \nand challenges South Dakota farmers and ranchers face every day, and \nraised legitimate questions about current agricultural policy.\n  I also had the opportunity to meet privately with the Henderson \nfamily in their home prior to the broader public discussion. It was an \nexperience I will remember forever.\n  Keeping the family farm together for the past 4 decades has not been \neasy for the Hendersons. Their secret to survival has been an enduring \nappreciation of the land and hard work on the part of each and every \nmember of the family, including the children.\n  The rewards for the Hendersons' dedication to farming have been \nnumerous. They speak eloquently about raising their children in a \ntight-knit community steeped in strong values. They clearly love their \nchosen profession, which allows them to see the tangible results of a \ngood day's work.\n  Despite their love of farming, the Hendersons' story also has a sad \nside--the continuous struggle to make a decent financial return on \ntheir investment of time, money and plain old hard work.\n  The Hendersons' story is described in a letter presented to me at our \nmeeting. I would like to share that letter with my colleagues. It lays \nout in clear, honest terms the difficult dilemma facing hard-working, \ndedicated farm families all across rural America: how to survive \nfinancially on a modest-sized family farm in today's agricultural \nenvironment. The Hendersons' letter presents a picture that merits more \nattention and reflection in Washington policymaking circles.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that today financial survival on \nfamily farms is much tougher than it should be in a nation that enjoys \nthe most abundant and least expensive source of food on the globe. If \nwe are to preserve this durable source of farm commodities, our rural \ncommunities and their rock solid values, then farmers must enjoy a \nreasonable return on their investment. This problem must be addressed \nif family farms are to survive in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Doug Henderson's letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                       Fall, 1995.\n\n                  My Story: 40+Years of Family Farming\n\n       My name is Doug Henderson. My wife, Joan, and 4 sons, ages \n     10 to 17, live on a crop/dairy farm west of Beresford, South \n     Dakota. Our operation includes 100 mature holstein cows. 100 \n     replacements, 50-100 extra cattle. 100 acres owned and 400 \n     rented.\n       My grandfather bought this farm in the early 40's. My \n     father came back to rent and then later buy the farm after \n     serving nearly 5 years in the Pacific during WWII. I was the \n     oldest of four sons and one daughter. Each of us played an \n     important part in the daily operation of this family unit \n     during the 50's and 60's--and we knew that because we could \n     feel it. It felt good. I think that's why I was drawn to this \n     place.\n       My wife and I earned teaching degrees in `77 after having \n     served in the U.S. Army from `72 to `75. After teaching for \n     two years and farming ``on the side'' I had the opportunity \n     to ``take over the place'' and farm fulltime. We did some \n     work on the house and moved our family in here in the spring \n     of 1981. Financially, we have had some good years and some \n     not so good years. Personally, we have had only good years. \n     However, 1995 finds us at a crossroads.\n       Personally, I truly cannot think of a place I would have \n     rather been or anything I'd have rather been doing for the \n     last 14 years. My oldest son, a high school senior, is \n     qualified to do almost anything I do out here. My sons 12 and \n     15 are almost as competent. All four have a good sense of \n     self and a high regard for the traditional values that my \n     wife and I do our best to model for them. Our involvement in \n     community and church has provided growth and enrichment. Our \n     lives have truly been joyfilled during these early years. \n     This setting has made child rearing easy.\n       Financially, the future of this production unit is dim. Our \n     facilities now nearly 30 years old, do not produce the volume \n     of milk required per man hour to allow us to be as \n     competitive as we need to be. Our balance sheet has not \n     improved significantly during the last 4-5 years. While we \n     claim not to have made purchasing or marketing mistakes and \n     have always been moderate in our strategies, we acknowledge \n     the reduced will to pour out boundless energies to try to \n     make everything click. I know that the farm\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\n     would not break even without the input of the family. We have \n     estimated an annual family labor input of 6000 to 6500 hours/\n     year. In return my family draws $14,400/yr and housing, milk \n     and meat. Our gross revenues in each of the past two years \n     have approached 300,000 dollars. Milk is the primary product \n     produced and that production in 1994 was 1.6 million pounds \n     (160,000 cwt). That 1994 production represents almost three \n     times the production of this same facility in 1978-80 when my \n     father, brother and I worked as partners and each drew a \n     salary. Together my father and I have been making payments to \n     the FHA for over 40 years and I have 25 years and $110,000 to \n     go on my farm ownership loan. We would probably not have \n     maintained this operation without the security of the FHA \n     loan.\n       We have added some buildings and prepared for a less labor-\n     intensive livestock production enterprise and do of course \n     have the option to update and sign the dotted line for \n     another lifetime of debt if we want to take on a partner and \n     continue producing milk. The fact of the matter is however \n     that after nearly 20 years of working 3500-4000 hours per \n     year, my body is saying ``enough''! My brain is saying \n     ``there must be a better way''! And my heart is saying ``thou \n     shalt not offer a son''! I never thought I'd feel this way, \n     let alone admit it.\n       In a nutshell, I know agriculture. I know crops. I know \n     livestock. I can produce. I love to work. My family works for \n     free. I love this life. My family does too. We plan to quit \n     (as soon as we can figure a way to pull it off financially. . \n     . but maybe sooner). I hope I can find work that allows us to \n     maintain the high cost of country living.\n\n\n                           epilogue--May 1996\n\n       As it turns out, 1995 was a year of major marketing \n     mistakes--at least wrong choices. Instead of selling 55 \n     surplus steers at depressed prices in the fall to pay off \n     bills, we were duped into selling 10,000 bushels of corn. The \n     price seemed relatively good; and after all, how much worse \n     could the cattle market get? This single decision will \n     ultimately represent a turn around of nearly 30,000 dollars. \n     When combined with a poor crop year, severe weather stresses \n     to herd health and dairy production and additional budget \n     pressures that happen from time to time, we simply were not \n     in a strong enough financial position to handle this much \n     adversity.\n       As a result, we had to either seek a guaranteed loan or \n     sell out secured chattel which at depressed prices would have \n     left us very little on which to operate. Fortunately the \n     timing was right and the loan was approved. We honestly would \n     not be operating this year without the help of the FHA. These \n     people (Ron Walker and his loan officers) have always been \n     cordial, understanding and very helpful. I salute them and \n     the general mission of the Farmer's Home Administration.\n       SHOCK is the best way to describe what happened to us \n     financially. It occurs to me that I can distinctly recognize \n     the seven stages of grief in this process. There is for a man \n     who has known tremendous happiness and satisfaction in his \n     personal life as well as his business, no greater stress and \n     loss than financial failure. The MOURNING and BLAME part of \n     this process is very, very disturbing. Our Extension Service \n     here in South Dakota responded to the flooding in 1993 with \n     Project Rebound. I hope the cattle ranchers and feeders will \n     be offered at least the emotional support they need during \n     this cattle crisis. We have a plan and with decent crops \n     should HEAL. I have a hunch that milk prices are going to \n     respond fairly quickly to current market pressures. The \n     REBUILDING part of this process for me will likely include a \n     career change. I've always managed a higher level of energy \n     for new challenges. I'm hoping again to see one of my sons \n     have a life here--a clear sign we are rebuilding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6138-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Bob Dole's statement upon announcing he would give up his \nSenate seat to run for the Presidency--that he is ``just a man''--packs \na lot in a simple string of words, as is his habit. This phrase \ncaptures the modesty, the simplicity, and above all the \nstraightforwardness and honesty of the Senator from Kansas. Men like \nBob Dole achieve great things because they go at them directly, with no \nifs, ands, or buts asking a lot of themselves and taking responsibility \nfor the bottom line.\n  Senator Dole's more than 35 years of service to the Congress of the \nUnited States have been filled with great accomplishments because he \nnever let up, he brought people of different views together to hammer \nout legislation, and he was an honest broker trusted by everyone. My \nfather, Congressman John Kyl of Iowa, served with then-Congressman Dole \nin the House of Reprentatives in the 1960's and knew him to be a man of \nleadership and utter integrity. As Congressman Dole, and later Senator \nDole, learned his job as a legislator, he never lost that sense of \nbeing ``just a man'' from Russell, KS. He is not one to be dazzled by \nthe bright lights, the pomp, and the power of Washington. He came armed \nwith the simple virtues of his Kansas constituents, and those same \nvirtues are evident in him today. He remains the embodiment of the \nheartland of America--a place much maligned by sophisticates, perhaps, \nbut a place that still has the moral strengths that we Americans define \nourselves by: dedication to duty, plain but honest speech, and an \nawareness that limited government requires of office holders that they \nnever take their power for granted. When Bob Dole says that he is \ngrateful to have served his fellow citizens, those are not empty words. \nWe believe him.\n  In his parting statement today, he hold us that ``there are some \nissues that transcend politics * * * and result in legislation that \nmakes a real and lasting difference.'' Whether it is a matter of \nsupporting civil rights, doggedly backing our military troops in an \nunpopular conflict in Indochina during the 1960's and 1970's, or \nensuring access to public places for disabled Americans in the 1990's, \nhe has often put aside partisanship and laid it on the line for the \nthings he believes in. His statesmanship, his ability to come to \nclosure for the sake of the common good, is well known to those of us \nwho have worked with him inside this institution. But perhaps few \noutside of the Congress are aware of it. If everyone could know him as \nwe do, they would see a man with an extraordinary capacity to see \nbeyond the heated conflicts of the moment, to keep the big picture in \nmind, and to reach a consensus that yields practical results. If \neveryone knew him as well as his colleagues do, they would see that Bob \nDole has everything it takes to be President of this country.\n  Of the Senate he now says, on the day of his departure, ``It is a \nplace that I have loved.'' Again, no rhetorical flourishes, just simple \nwords of emotion, and all the more powerful for being unadorned. He \nreached the pinnacle of leadership among Senate Republicans, and for \nall too short a time has been leader of the Chamber itself. But he has \nwalked away, and in characteristic style. Bob Dole is at the peak of \nhis powers. But he moves on, ready to take on the biggest challenge in \na life full of challenges. He has demonstrated--and in a remarkably \ndramatic way--that he is not one to rest on his laurels; instead, he is \nthe kind of man who does honor to every contest he enters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6139-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6139-S6141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CHINESE NUCLEAR MISSILES IN PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, last year the Clinton administration \nasked Congress for the authority to allow United States military \nequipment to be delivered to Pakistan. Since 1990, such deliveries were \nnot allowed because of a 1985 law known as the Pressler amendment, \nwhich prohibited any United States Assistance to Pakistan if the \nPresident failed to certify Pakistan was not in possession of a nuclear \nexplosive device. My colleagues may recall that we debated this issue \nquite extensively. It was very controversial. In the end, despite \nstrong opposition from this Senator and many of my colleagues, the \nSenate approved the so-called Brown amendment, which authorized the \ntransfer of military equipment and repealed the Pressler amendment's \nprohibitions on nonmilitary aid to Pakistan. The Brown amendment became \nlaw earlier this year.\n  To bolster the Clinton administration's request, Under Secretary of \nState Peter Tarnoff sent a letter to Members of Congress on August 3, \n1995, when the Senate first debated the Brown amendment. Secretary \nTarnoff attempted to assure Senators that the administration's support \nof the Brown amendment would be conditional on ``no significant change \non nuclear and missile non-proliferation issues of concern to the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. President, that was then.\n  On February 22, 1996, Dr. John Deutch, the Director of Central \nIntelligence, testified before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. Director Deutch confirmed earlier reports that Pakistan \nhad taken delivery of sensitive nuclear technology used to develop \nweapons-grade uranium. He also confirmed that Pakistan had received M-\n11 ballistic missiles from China. My colleagues will recall that when \nwe debated the Brown amendment, there was some dispute over whether \nPakistan had in fact taken delivery of the M-11 missiles. Director\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nDeutch's testimony was the first time a Clinton administration official \npublicly confirmed the existence of the M-11s. In my view, this \ndevelopment should have halted the delivery of the military equipment \nto Pakistan. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration did not consider \nthe acquisition of this nuclear technology to be, in Secretary \nTarnoff's words, a ``significant change on nuclear and missile non-\nproliferation issues of concern to the United States.''\n  Mr. President, this morning's Washington Times reveals that Pakistan \nhas done more than just take possession of the M-11's. The Times \nreported that the M-11 missiles in Pakistan are operational and nuclear \ncapable. If this account is accurate, and I have no reason to doubt it, \nPakistan now has a complete, modern, nuclear weapons delivery system.\n  Mr. President, first of all, in spite of a string of pious promises \nand written agreements to the United States, China has demonstrated a \nsevere lack of international responsibility. By providing both nuclear \ntechnology and the means to deliver nuclear weapons, Chinese \nGovernment-owned companies have contributed to a vast escalation of \ntensions between Pakistan and India. Director Deutch has pointed to the \nIndian subcontinent as the most worrisome area in the world. He's \nright.\n  The more immediate question, Mr. President, is what is the United \nStates going to do? At the time the Senate approved the Brown \namendment, we were of the belief that Pakistan did not possess both the \ntechnology to produce weapons-grade uranium, and an operational nuclear \nweapons delivery system. That was then. This is now. I do not believe \nthe Senate would have approved the Brown amendment had we known then \nwhat we know now.\n\n  The Washington Times also reported that State Department officials \nattempted to water down or alter the intelligence reports regarding the \nM-11's, and also tried to prevent these reports from moving through \nnormal intelligence channels. Apparently this was done to prevent \nsanctions from being enforced. This is a very serious allegation. In \neffect, Federal officials are being accused of blocking the law from \nbeing enforced.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the Washington Times story is astounding. It \nis no secret that I am an outspoken critic of the Clinton \nadministration's nuclear nonproliferation policy, or lack thereof. \nBefore today, I never thought the administration's credibility \nregarding nonproliferation goals in South Asia could get worse. I was \nwrong.\n  I have written to President Clinton, asking that he enforce the \nnonproliferation laws he has sworn to uphold. I also have asked the \nPresident to withhold delivery of any military equipment authorized by \nthe Brown amendment. Clearly, the conditions the Clinton administration \nmade to Pakistan for its support of the Brown amendment have been \nviolated to a degree unimaginable. I also intend to contact the \nchairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator \nSpecter, to request that the committee conduct a full investigation on \nthe allegations raised involving the blocking or altering of \nintelligence reports by State Department officials. Finally, I intend \nto continue seeking the support of my colleagues to repeal the Brown \namendment, and may offer an amendment to do just that in the near \nfuture. I think we have more than enough evidence to demonstrate why \nthe Brown amendment should not have been passed. In my view, Congress \nwas badly misled last year relative to Pakistan's nuclear arms \ndevelopment and delivery capability. My bill, which already has several \ncosponsors, would restore the supremacy of our nuclear nonproliferation \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter of today to \nPresident Clinton and a Washington Times article by Bill Gertz be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 1996.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: A story in today's Washington Times \n     reported that the U.S. intelligence community has determined \n     that Pakistan obtained M-11 ballistic missiles from the \n     People's Republic of China (PRC) as part of an illegal \n     conspiracy to evade national international arms control \n     agreements. Even more disturbing, the Times reported that \n     these nuclear capable missiles have been deployed by \n     Pakistan.\n       If these reports are true, I strongly urge you to enforce \n     the law and impose sanctions on both countries to the fullest \n     extent of the law. Further, I urge you to withhold from \n     delivering to Pakistan any U.S. equipment as provided in the \n     so-called Brown amendment to the Fiscal Year 1996 Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Act.\n       As you know, the United States has sought for a number of \n     years to put an end to illegal missile transfers originating \n     in the PRC. As you well know, sanctions were imposed on China \n     just three years ago for transferring M-11 components in \n     violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). \n     Those sanctions were lifted in 1994, after the PRC pledged \n     not to make future deliveries of missiles or related \n     components listed under the MTCR.\n       Last year, the New York Times and Defense News reported \n     that Pakistan had received M-11 missiles from the PRC. This \n     was confirmed by Central Intelligence Agency Director John \n     Deutch in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee on February 22, 1996.\n       These are troubling developments. We face a situation in \n     which the PRC has violated both a multinational missile \n     control agreement as well as a written non-proliferation \n     agreement with the United States. As a result of these \n     violations, Pakistan now has for the first time a strategic \n     nuclear delivery capability.\n       Again, if the reports are true, I see no recourse but to \n     impose sanctions on both Pakistan and the PRC. Our own \n     credibility as a world leader in nuclear non-proliferation \n     requires no less.\n       Our credibility also requires that we take additional \n     action: the withholding of any U.S. military equipment \n     authorized for delivery under the so-called Brown amendment. \n     Last August, when the Brown amendment was first considered in \n     the Senate, Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff stated \n     that your Administration's support for the Brown amendment \n     would be conditional on ``no significant change on nuclear \n     and missile non-proliferation issues of concern to the \n     United States.''\n       At the time Secretary Tarnoff made this statement, Congress \n     and the Administration were of the belief that Pakistan did \n     not have both the nuclear technology capable of processing \n     enriched uranium, and an operational system of ballistic \n     missiles capable of delivering a nuclear payload. Clearly, \n     the conditions set by your Administration have been violated \n     by Pakistan to a degree unimaginable.\n       Finally, I believe Congress was misled badly last year \n     relative to Pakistan's arms development and delivery \n     capability. Earlier this year, I wrote to you expressing my \n     concern that members of your Administration knew that \n     Pakistan was obtaining illicit nuclear technology from the \n     PRC while the Brown amendment was pending. I am equally \n     concerned with allegations raised in the Washington Times \n     article that members of your Administration may have \n     attempted to alter the content or the processing of \n     intelligence reports in order to avoid sanctions. This is a \n     very serious allegation, and I have requested that the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee conduct a thorough review of this \n     matter.\n       Mr. President, you and I have not always agreed with the \n     best course of action on nuclear non-proliferation, \n     particularly in South Asia. I am sure you will agree with me \n     that if the Washington Times story is true, we have reached a \n     very dangerous stage in an already very unstable part of the \n     world. It has always been our policy to other nations that \n     nuclear proliferation should carry a heavy price. It is \n     imperative to the peace and security of all the peoples of \n     South Asia that this policy be enforced.\n       For these reasons, I strongly urge you to enforce fully our \n     nation's non-proliferations laws, and honor the conditions \n     set forth last year by withholding any future implementation \n     of the Brown amendment.\n       Thank you for your attention to this very critical \n     nonproliferation issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 12, 1996]\n\n                   Pakistan Deploys Chinese Missiles\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Pakistan has \n     deployed nuclear-capable Chinese M-11 missiles and that the \n     transfer was part of a conspiracy to skirt missile-control \n     agreements.\n       The declaration, contained in interagency intelligence \n     reports produced last month, confirms for the first time that \n     Pakistan now has a strategic nuclear delivery capability. The \n     finding is expected to trigger U.S. economic sanctions \n     against both Pakistan and China based on a 1990 law.\n       State Department officials, however, are trying to block \n     the intelligence judgment through bureaucratic maneuvering to \n     avoid imposing sanctions, according to intelligence sources \n     familiar with the effort.\n       The intelligence sources disclosed to The Washington Times \n     that a report that Pakistan has operational Chinese M-11 \n     missiles\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\n     was discussed last month by the Weapons and Space Systems \n     Intelligence Committee. The committee is an interagency panel \n     of intelligence experts who evaluate missile developments \n     worldwide. The report was based on sensitive CIA data.\n       A separate ``statement of fact'' also was drafted last \n     month declaring that China and Pakistan took part in a \n     ``conspiracy to transfer M-11s,'' according to an \n     intelligence document obtained by The Times.\n       U.S. officials said the statement is the first step in an \n     intelligence M-11 components were spotted in Pakistan three \n     years ago.\n       China's delivery of the weapons violates the 31-nation \n     Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), as well as a 1994 \n     U.S.-China agreement not to deploy M-11s in Pakistan.\n       CIA and State Department spokesmen would not comment on the \n     intelligence findings. A Chinese Embassy spokesman also \n     declined to comment.\n       A Pakistani Embassy spokesman denied that any M-11s are \n     operational in his country or that any were bought from \n     China.\n       The M-11 finding highlights China's active role in arms-\n     proliferation activities and comes after the recent \n     administration decision not to impose economic sanctions on \n     China for selling nuclear-weapons technology to Pakistan.\n       The administration announced last month it would not impose \n     sanctions because it claimed senior Chinese officials were \n     unaware of the sale last year of ring magnets--components \n     used to produce nuclear-weapons fuel--to Pakistan.\n       William C. Triplett, a specialist on China, said the M-11 \n     deployment, when coupled with the sale of nuclear-arms \n     technology, is a major boost in Pakistan's drive for a \n     strategic nuclear capability and will increase tensions in \n     the volatile region.\n       ``This is a major change in the geostrategic balance \n     between Pakistan and India, and a devastating blow to Clinton \n     administration efforts to reduce tensions on the \n     subcontinent,'' said Mr. Triplett, a former counsel to the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n       Mr. Triplett, a former U.S. intelligence official, also \n     said he is not surprised by efforts of the State Department \n     Bureau of Intelligence and Research to block the M-11 \n     deployment judgment. The bureau is notorious for politicizing \n     analyses and should be excluded from taking part in future \n     interagency estimates, he said.\n       Limited sanctions were imposed on China in 1993 for selling \n     M-11 components to Pakistan.\n       The sanctions, affecting an estimated $500 million in \n     American sales, were lifted in October 1994 after Chinese \n     Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher signed an agreement halting sales of the M-11 and \n     similar missiles.\n       Under a 1990 U.S. law, Pakistan's possession of operational \n     M-11s requires the president to impose two years' sanctions \n     on both countries that limit U.S. sales of high-technology \n     products.\n       The sanctions also would bar imports of any products made \n     by the government-owned China Precision Machinery Import-\n     Export Corp., which makes M-11s, and Pakistan's Defense \n     Ministry. Both companies were sanctioned in the 1993 M-11 \n     component transfer.\n       Sanctions would have their greatest impact on sales of \n     high-technology goods to China. Those goods were a major \n     portion of the $12 billion in U.S. trade with China last \n     year.\n       A State Department official said in 1994 when MTCR-related \n     sanctions were lifted that if complete missiles were deployed \n     in Pakistan ``we would have no choice but to impose MTCR \n     sanctions.''\n       Mr. Deutch said in Senate testimony Feb. 22 that China has \n     continued to sell inappropriate weapons and military \n     technology in recent months, including ``nuclear technology \n     to Pakistan, M-11 missiles to Pakistan, cruise missiles to \n     Iran.''\n       ``If this is true, there is no longer any excuse for not \n     imposing sanctions on both China and Pakistan,'' said Gary \n     Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms \n     Control.\n       China's disregard for the arms-control agreements despite \n     U.S. appeals has exposed the weakness of U.S. policy toward \n     Beijing, he said.\n       The MTCR, which limits sales of missiles with ranges \n     greater than 186 miles or with warheads weighing more than \n     1,100 pounds, has no enforcement mechanism. But an amendment \n     to the 1990 Defense Authorization Act requires the government \n     to impose sanctions against foreign firms for MTCR \n     violations.\n       U.S. officials have said the M-11 is a nuclear-capable \n     missile whose export is barred under the MTCR because its \n     warhead capacity exceeds MTCR limits.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies reported last year that the M-11 \n     deal moved ahead after Pakistan paid $15 million to China for \n     missiles, launchers and support equipment. The M-11s were \n     shipped to Pakistan in 1993, but their assembly was not \n     confirmed.\n       Spy-satellite photographs taken in April 1995 showed \n     missile canisters at a facility in Sargodha, Pakistan. Two \n     teams of Chinese missile technicians were sent to Pakistan \n     later to provide training and to unpack and assemble the M-\n     11s, intelligence sources said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6139-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT DOLE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nRobert J. Dole of Russell, KS for his 35 years of service in the U.S. \nCongress. Tuesday was a sad day for the U.S. Senate, for we lost one of \nour great leaders. It was also a sad day for me personally, for I lost \na trusted colleague and a valued friend in the Senate. As the \nRepublican leader in the Senate for 11 years, Senator Dole has left his \nfingerprints on every piece of legislation that has passed the \nCongress. His legacy will be remembered forever as one of vast \nlegislative achievement.\n  I got my first glimpse of Senator Dole's legislative abilities when I \ncame to Congress in 1975. In the wake of Watergate, and the massive \ncongressional turnover that ensued, I was secured the position of \nranking member of the House Agriculture Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover the dairy industry. As a member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, Senator Dole and I worked closely together on many issues. I \nremember well the bonds we formed as conferees together on farm bills \nand working together to pass legislation for food stamps and child \nnutrition.\n  Later, as I gained seniority on the House Education and Labor \nCommittee, we worked together again on disability policy. Senator \nDole's commitment and determination to the passage of legislation \nensuring that all Americans, regardless of physical disability, had \nequal opportunity was inspirational.\n  In 1989 when I became a member of the U.S. Senate, I had the \nprivilege of seeing Senator Dole's leadership abilities first-hand \neveryday. I have watched with amazement his ability to pull legislative \ninitiatives out of the fire, and prevail on issues from civil rights to \nSocial Security reform. In Vermont there's a saying, ``You can't get \nthere from here.'' Well, Senator Dole proved that adage wrong time and \ntime again as he has moved legislation through the Senate.\n  In an institution where you are only as good as your word, Senator \nDole prospered. His ability to build coalitions and form consensus on \nsome of this Nation's most pressing issues is a testament to his \nintegrity and character. In a world that has become ever more crude and \nimpertinent, Senator Dole has defined ``the word'' civility.\n  Tuesday was a bittersweet day, for although I'm sad Senator Dole has \nleft us in the Senate, I know he'll be close by as he seeks higher \naspirations. I only hope that he knows that this is one Senator who \nfeels that the U.S. Senate will never be the same without him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6141-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6141-S6142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT CONCERNING THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE \n     ARTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1995--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 153\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  It is my pleasure to transmit herewith the Annual Report of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts for the fiscal year 1995.\n  On September 29, 1995, at the close of the fiscal year, the Arts \nEndowment celebrated its 30th anniversary. A young man or woman born at \nthe same time as this Federal agency's establishment has enjoyed access \nto the arts and culture unparalleled in the history of the country. The \nNational Endowment for the Arts has helped bring tens of thousands of \nartists into schools, teaching tens of millions of students about the \npower of the creative imagination. This small Federal agency has helped \nlaunch a national cultural network that has grown in size and quality \nthese past 30 years.\n  This Annual Report is another chapter in a great success story. In \nthese pages, you will find projects that bring\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nthe arts to people in every State and in thousands of communities from \nPutney, Vermont, to Mammoth Lakes, California. The difference art makes \nin our lives is profound; we see more clearly, listen more intently, \nand respond to our fellow man with deeper understanding and empathy.\n  In these challenging times, when some question the value of public \nsupport for the arts, we should reflect upon our obligation to the \ncommon good. The arts are not a luxury, but a vital part of our \nnational character and our individual human spirit. The poet Langston \nHughes said, ``Bring me all of your dreams, you dreamers. Bring me all \nof your heart melodies . . .'' For 30 years, the Arts Endowment has \nhelped keep those dreams alive for our artists and our audiences. May \nit long continue to do so.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to issue regulations relating to recirculation of fresh \nair in commercial aircraft, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   The Aviation Clean Air Act of 1996\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation having \nto do with the quality of air in passenger cabins of commercial \naircraft.\n  I want to begin for a moment by telling you how I got into this. \nThree years ago, obviously coming to the Senate, I began a whole series \nof flights from San Francisco and from Los Angeles to Washington, and I \nnoticed something. I noticed when I rode a 747 I did not get a headache \nand the circulation in my hand did not cease. When I rode a 757 or a \n767, I began to get rather severe headaches. If I fell asleep, the \ncirculation in my hand ceased. This, then, promptly woke me up.\n  I began to look into it. What did I find? I looked at Federal clean \nair standards for enclosed spaces. I found that the Federal standard \nfor fresh air in prison cells is 20 cubic feet per person per minute. \nThe fresh air standard for an office building, for a theater lobby, for \na restaurant, is the same. Then I found there were no fresh air \nstandards for commercial aircraft.\n  So I asked, what are the existing levels? Let me tell you what I \nfound. The average amount of fresh air circulation in a 757 is 9 cubic \nfeet per person. The average amount of fresh air in a 767 is 9.1 cubic \nfeet per person per minute. The new 737's, provide an average of 9.6 \ncubic feet per person per minute. Now, what is the significance? The \nsignificance is that it is less than one-half the fresh air that is \nrequired in a prison cell, an office or a restaurant. And then I began \nto ask flight attendants about the problems. What I learned is that \nstories documented of sore throats and headaches, of difficulty of \nbreathing, of poor circulation in the body and swollen legs, of colds, \nflus, and airborne diseases, such as flu and tuberculosis are now \nbeginning to spiral throughout the 1.4 million passengers per day that \nride commercial airlines.\n  Well, today I want to introduce in the Senate an idea whose time has \ncome, and that is an aviation clean air act. This is also being \nintroduced in the House of Representatives at the same time. \nEssentially, what this bill would require is that commercial airlines \nprovide ventilation systems that provide 20 cubic feet of fresh air per \nperson per minute in the cabin. This is equal to what is provided today \nby older aircraft, namely, the 747. Many of the larger commercial \naircraft, such as the 737's, 757's, or 767's, as I said, provide less \nthan one-half of what is provided by a 747.\n  Second, the bill would ensure that air filters used in airplane cabin \nair recirculation systems are monitored and changed regularly.\n  Third, it would require that airlines monitor humidity and ozone \nlevels.\n  Fourth, it would require the FAA to create a ``1-800'' number to \nreceive reports of illnesses relating to air travel.\n  I also want to introduce into the Record directly following my \nstatement a statement of Patricia Friend, the international president \nof the Association of Flight Attendants; a statement of Andrew \nParramore, a flight attendant; a statement of Joe Johnson, a member of \nthe Association of Flight Attendants, and Janie Johnson, a member of \nthe Association of Flight Attendants.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n    Statement of Patricia Friend at an Aviation Clean Air Act Press \n                               Conference\n\n       On behalf of the 40,000 members of the Association of \n     Flight Attendants, I would like to thank Senator Dianne \n     Feinstein and Representative Jerrold Nadler for today \n     introducing legislation that will significantly air quality \n     in the airplane cabin.\n       This legislation seeks to establish a minimum ventilation \n     standard of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person \n     in the cabin. In addition to the ventilation standard, the \n     proposed legislation would also require the monitoring of air \n     filters, ozone and humidity. The Aviation Clean Air Act of \n     1996 seeks to establish a toll-free telephone number at the \n     FAA for individuals to report cabin air quality incidents. \n     These are critical elements to achieving a healthy workplace \n     for flight attendants.\n       While frequent fliers often complain of headaches, nausea, \n     dizziness, consistently coming down with upper respiratory \n     viral infections after flying, and in some cases, passing out \n     during flight and having oxygen administered by the flight \n     attendants, the flight attendants themselves are at even \n     greater risk from poor cabin air quality.\n       Flight attendants are inflight safety professionals. In the \n     daily performance of our duties, we inhale a greater amount \n     of air, increasing our exposure to viruses and bacteria, \n     fumes from chemical solvents, and carbon monoxide from \n     incomplete combustion of fuel. Flight attendants who \n     routinely work in cabins with poor air quality complain of \n     respiratory problems and other health difficulties such as \n     dizziness, severe headaches, loss of balance and numbness in \n     the hands.\n       Our position on increased fresh air in the cabin is \n     supported by the FAA's recently introduced final rule. The \n     FAA determined that health and safety considerations justify \n     these standards, stating that cabin crew members must be able \n     to perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue.\n       Regrettably, their rule did not address air quality in \n     aircraft currently being operated but applies only to future \n     generation aircraft. After 7 years of pending rule-making, \n     the FAA's final rule is still unsatisfactory offering too \n     little, too late.\n       Recall the USAir Flight 1016 accident on a DC9-31 (with \n     100% fresh air), in which the flight attendants helped \n     passengers to escape from the aircraft. One of them, Rich \n     DeMary, repeatedly risked his life to single-handedly save \n     four persons from the burning wreckage. Imagine what might \n     have happened had these flight attendants been suffering loss \n     of balance, headaches, or numbness in their hands. Whether it \n     is reacting to severe turbulence, safely evacuating \n     passengers during an emergency or responding to an onboard \n     fire, flight attendants must be ready to respond at a \n     moment's notice.\n       AFA strongly supports the legislation to establish a \n     minimum standard of 20 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per \n     person in the cabin. Both Senator Feinstein and \n     Representative Nadler deserve the thanks of all flight \n     attendants and passengers, whose health and safety will \n     benefit from this legislation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     Statement of Andrew Parramore\n\n       On April 25, 1994, on an aircraft with recirculated air, \n     scheduled to fly from Los Angeles to the East coast, with 103 \n     passengers and 7 flight attendants aboard, developed severe \n     air cabin quality problems. The result was an eventual \n     unscheduled landing in Chicago, where passengers and crew \n     were met by paramedics, and one flight attendant was \n     hospitalized with abnormally high carbon monoxide levels. \n     Four others went en route sick list, experiencing headache, \n     disorientation, motor skill impairment and respiratory \n     difficulties, symptoms, I was told by a physician, which are \n     consistent with prolonged exposure to carbon monoxide \n     poisoning and resultant oxygen deprivation.\n       Immediately upon takeoff the coach cabin filled with dense \n     white smoke, the flight attendants experienced eye \n     irritation, smells described as overheating metal and/or \n     electrical fire, and a bitter metallic taste. The cockpit was \n     notified, the cabin was searched for source of possible fire, \n     and the problem attributed to a deferred, inoperative air \n     pack which had been activated. Crewmembers noted an unusually \n     high percentage of coach passengers in a deep, heavy sleep; \n     the few conscious complained of dizziness, fatigue, headache, \n     nausea, and complained of the cabin air. Flight attendants \n     were unable to complete the beverage service without rotating \n     to the cockpit for supplementary oxygen.\n       At this point, one of the flight attendants described what \n     happened:\n       ``I tried to finish setting up two liquor carts. I had to \n     leave at least twice and go to the forward galley to warm up \n     and clear my head, but eventually I went to the cockpit for \n     oxygen as well. When I was in the cockpit, I again told the \n     pilots we were feeling ill and several passengers had \n     complained. [The pilots] hypothesized what the problem could \n     be but I definitely got the impression that they thought this \n     was a cosmetic problem (bad smell in the cabin) and our \n     illness was all in our heads. They asked why the first class \n     flight attendants were not feeling ill. I said the smoke and \n     fumes were primarily in the main cabin and not first class.''\n       I then came into the cockpit to take oxygen.\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\n       Our symptoms worsened, and individual oxygen bottles were \n     soon retrieved. The flight attendant crew experienced \n     increasing loss of motor skills and mental alertness, loss of \n     ability to judge time passage and elementary computations, \n     disorientation, headache, extreme fatigue. The lunch service \n     was canceled, passengers awakened with great difficulty and \n     relocated from coach to business class [which is designed to \n     provide a somewhat increased level of fresh air per person] \n     where effects seemed less severe. The flight attendants \n     responsible for the coach section of the aircraft spent the \n     last two hours of the flight seated, breathing from oxygen \n     bottles. Individual flight attendants intermittently lost \n     consciousness. Passengers were either completely ``out'', \n     often with flushed faces, or in an apathetic, non \n     communicative ``daze''. The airline safety official's ``best \n     guess'' is that the malfunctioning air pack combusted \n     superheated synthetic oil, flooding the coach cabin with \n     resulting fumes and particulate irritants and as a byproduct \n     created poisonous carbon monoxide.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                        Statement of Joe Johnson\n\n       I have been a flight attendant for about 16 years and \n     traveling by air for much longer than that. With the \n     relatively recent introduction of aircraft with recycled air \n     systems, I have experienced a reduction of air quality on \n     board. I have experienced fatigue, difficulty in breathing, \n     lightheadedness, and headaches on some flights. Passengers \n     often complain to me of the same. The first thought is that \n     this could be due to smoking on board flights. However, since \n     most flights have been nonsmoking for some time, I believe \n     this is just a contributing factor.\n       There is a marked difference in air quality when flying \n     older aircraft such as the 747-100 series, any 727 or 737-200 \n     series. I am told by experts in the field this is due to 100 \n     percent fresh air exchange on the older airplanes. On some \n     newer generation airplanes, we frequently ask the pilots to \n     turn off the recirculation fans, which I understand, allows \n     more fresh air into the cabin. This procedure, I am told by \n     our engineers, theoretically uses more fuel, however, it does \n     improve air quality. You can surmise in an era of cost \n     control that this practice is not popular among airline \n     management's.\n       Another area that contributes to poor air quality is the \n     lack of adequate maintenance of the filtration systems. I \n     have witnessed filters that are so black and clogged I don't \n     know how any air could have passed through. On a recent \n     flight from Los Angeles to Washington, a frequent flying \n     passenger repeatedly asked me to ask the pilots to improve \n     the air quality and air flow. He proclaimed to all who were \n     around that, ``I travel all the time and we are all going to \n     have black lungs from the air on board airplanes. These new \n     planes are terrible.'' I repeatedly relayed his requests to \n     the cockpit.\n       Due to design, it would appear, air quality continues to \n     deteriorate. This is a real problem for flights attendants as \n     well as the traveling public.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Statement of Janie Johnson\n\n       As a veteran flight attendant for 23 years, I believe the \n     air quality continues to deteriorate. A great number of \n     flight attendants experience headaches, have difficulty \n     breathing, suffer from upper respiratory problems and are \n     fatigued.\n       On August 24, 1994, I worked a flight from Washington, DC \n     to Anchorage International via Denver's Stapleton airport. It \n     was an aircraft with recirculating cabin air and was a non-\n     smoking flight. The air was stuffy. Many passengers requested \n     aspirin and I myself had a terrible headache, with sharp \n     pains between my eyes. I also had a difficult time breathing. \n     It was as if someone was standing on my chest.\n       We reported this to the pilots and they turned off a \n     recirculation fan to see if it would help and it did. Within \n     approximately 20 minutes I found it much easier to breath and \n     my headache was gone.\n       Upon our return flight from Anchorage to Dulles, via Denver \n     on a different aircraft of the same type, we experienced the \n     same symptoms and again the pilots turned off one of the \n     recirculation fans. The results were the same. We did notice \n     that the ceiling vents in both galleys were obstructed by \n     lint. We logged the problems with the air quality and upon \n     our arrival into Denver, mechanics removed the covers and \n     cleaned the filters. They were almost totally blanketed with \n     what appeared to be lint, and other debris.\n       I am not a doctor nor a mechanic but just a flight \n     attendant that makes a living of working on board airplanes. \n     Lack of good air quality is negatively impacting not only my \n     health but the health of my flying partners and passengers \n     who travel on board our airplanes every day. During a \n     conference call regarding air quality on one of the new \n     generation of aircraft with recirculated air, the maintenance \n     engineer commented, ``when I went to training for this \n     system, I was told it was a flying cold.''\n       Numerous incidents of poor air quality have been filed by \n     flight attendants, yet, over the years, conditions continue \n     to worsen. It would appear for the sake of some fuel savings, \n     air quality and our health and safety continue to suffer.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1866. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to clarify \nFederal jurisdiction over offenses relating to damage to religious \nproperty.\n\n\n                The Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill aimed \nat providing a mechanism for Federal law enforcement to combat the most \nrecent scourge to sweep across the Southeast. I am talking about the \nburnings of black churches that have been making such dramatic \nheadlines lately. The burning of houses of worship have been taking \nplace for the past 5 or 6 years, but this particular outbreak of fires \nhas all the characteristics of an epidemic. Not since the sixties have \nI been witness to such blatant intolerance and hatred, such utterly \ndespicable acts of American citizens against their fellow Americans as \nhas I have seen over these past few weeks. I turn on the news and see a \nburning church, a haunting image with horrific symbolic and practical \nimplications, and I say this must stop. Not just this specific rash of \ncrime, but the whole trend toward violence and intolerance in our \nsociety. We as Americans have fought too hard to let racial or \nreligious intolerance once again pollute our democracy.\n  This morning I accompanied President Clinton as he traveled to South \nCarolina. I welcome his strong presence in the midst of this unsettling \ntrend, and moreover I welcome the message he brought to my home State. \nThis country is stronger than the forces of hatred that would divide \nus. We will rebuild, and we will punish those responsible for these \nepisodes of destruction.\n  To fight against the forces of divisiveness, we must pull together as \na community. In the South, that means rebuilding, it means \ncongregations of churches all over America picking a Sunday and \ndedicating their collections to rebuild these burned churches. Here in \nthe Government, in means using every means within our power to make \nsure that this never happens again.\n  As of this moment, we don't have legislation that adequately \naddresses this brand of criminal behavior. The investigations by \nFederal authorities, and their ability to prosecute these cases have \nbeen limited by the current law. The bill I propose will remove the \nimpediments to bringing Federal cases, and give the Attorney General an \neffective, and necessary weapon with which to combat these crimes. \nSection 247 of title 18, United States Code, makes it a crime to damage \nreligious property or to obstruct persons in the free exercise of \nreligious beliefs. I propose to amend this by requiring only that the \noffense ``is in or affects interstate or foreign commerce.'' Congress \nwill be effectively granting jurisdiction over all conduct which may be \nreached under the interstate commerce clause of the constitution.\n  Additionally, the bill eliminates the $10,000 threshold for fire \ndamages to grant Federal jurisdiction in cases where there is only \nminimal damage. This way, desecration or defacement of houses of \nworship can be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. 247.\n  I urge the Senate to act quickly and adopt this provision. As I \nunderstand a similar measure is making its way through the House, the \nSenate should also act in an expeditious manner to ensure the Federal \nGovernment has the necessary authority to combat this tragic epidemic.\n  More importantly, this country must come together, leave racial \nintolerance behind, and insure that we end this type of bigotry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1866\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Church Arson Prevention Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DAMAGE TO RELIGIOUS PROPERTY.\n\n       Section 247 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) so that subsection (b) reads as follows:\n       ``(b) The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are \n     that the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign \n     commerce.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (a)(1), by inserting ``, racial, or \n     ethnic'' before ``character''.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\n  S. 1867. A bill to restore the American family, enhance support and \nwork opportunities for families with children, reduce out-of-wedlock \npregnancies, reduce welfare dependence, and control welfare spending; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the bipartisan welfare reform act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since 1987, when I first proposed an \noverhaul of the welfare system, I have argued that welfare recipients \nshould be required to work. Nine years later, America is still in need \nof fundamental welfare reform.\n  So, today, Mr. President, Senator Specter and I are introducing the \nBipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996--the Senate companion to \nlegislation introduced in April by Representatives Mike Castle and John \nTanner and 30 moderate House Members from both parties.\n  Let me briefly review how we got to this point and why we are taking \nthis action.\n  Last September, the Senate passed a bipartisan welfare reform bill by \nan overwhelming vote of 87-12. I voted for that bill, and President \nClinton said he could sign it.\n  Since then, however, polarizing partisanship and Presidential \npolitics have permeated this issue. And, the result has been paralysis. \nNothing has been accomplished.\n  In an attempt to break the gridlock, last February, the Nation's \nGovernors--led by my Governor, Tom Carper--proposed a bipartisan \nwelfare reform bill. In April, Representatives Castle and Tanner and a \ngroup of other moderates wrote what I believe is a first-rate \nbipartisan welfare reform plan.\n  No such bipartisan plan to date has been introduced in the Senate. \nAnd, as this issue will be back before us again soon, Senator Specter \nand I decided that now is the time--and the Castle-Tanner proposal is \nthe bill to move us forward.\n  What this bill proposes, in and of itself, is not new. What is new is \nthat it is being proposed all together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  For that, Representative Castle and Senator Specter deserve great \napplause. They are reaching across the aisle to do what the American \npeople sent us to Congress to do--work together to solve the problems \nfacing this country. And, again, I think the bill we are introducing \ntoday is a first-rate bill.\n  To highlight the basic principles: there would be a 5-year time limit \non receiving welfare benefits. After 2 years, welfare recipients would \nbe required to work--at least 25 hours per week. And, child care would \nbe available, so that children are not left home alone while their \nmothers are working.\n  The bill would make getting tough on the deadbeat dads who do not pay \nchild support as high a priority as getting tough on the welfare moms. \nAnd, the bill takes steps to crack down on welfare--particularly food \nstamp--fraud.\n  This will all sound familiar to those who have followed this debate. \nAnd, as I said a moment ago, it is. For the principles have never been \nin doubt--almost everyone agrees on them.\n  You see, what has been lost in the shuffle and shouting of the last \n10 months is that there is a great deal of common ground on welfare \nreform. So much so, that if you leave behind the politics and the \npartisanship, a tough, bipartisan welfare reform bill is easily within \nreach.\n  I think this is that bill. But, if not, it is awfully darn close. Let \nme just mention a couple of examples of bipartisan compromise.\n  For Republicans, the bill converts aid to families with dependent \nchildren--AFDC-- to a block grant to the States. For Democrats, it more \nadequately invests in child care.\n  For Republicans, the bill freezes funding for cash welfare payments. \nFor Democrats, it provides additional help to those States faced with \neconomic downturns.\n  For Republicans, the bill imposes a family cap. For Democrats, it \ngives States flexibility to opt out.\n  Is this bill exactly how I would have written a bill on my own in the \nsolitude of my office? The answer is no. But, if we are going to move \nforward, we must stop insisting that there be a perfect bill or no bill \nat all.\n  It is time to say that we do not care who gets credit for reforming \nwelfare. It is time to just do it--in a bipartisan fashion--for the \nsake of the American people and for the sake of the people on welfare.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Biden-Specter Bipartisan \nWelfare Reform Act, and I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nbill prepared by Representative Tanner be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Highlights of the Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996\n\n\n title i--block grant for temporary assistance to needy families (tanf)\n\n       Basic grant. Consolidates funding for AFDC, JOBS and \n     Emergency Assistance (EA) into a $16.35 annual billion block \n     grant to states beginning in FY 1997 called the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant.\n       Supplemental grant fund of $800 million for FY 1997-FY 2000 \n     for states with high population growth and/or low grant \n     amounts per poor person.\n       Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs. Establishes a \n     contingency fund for states of $2 billion in matching funds \n     over five years (FY 1997-2001) for states that experience \n     high unemployment or an increase in the food stamp caseload. \n     States must also meet a 100% maintenance of effort \n     requirement in the year they use the contingency fund. Funds \n     are provided at the end and cannot exceed 20% of a state's \n     annual TANF grant in a fiscal year.\n       State plan. States would be required to submit a state plan \n     for approval in order to receive federal funds. The Secretary \n     must approve any plan which meets the following basic \n     requirements:\n       Work Requirements. Require all able-bodied recipients to \n     engage in work activities within two years of receiving \n     assistance.\n       Fair and equitable treatment. Set forth objective criteria \n     for the delivery of benefits and the determination of \n     eligibility and fair and equitable treatment, treat families \n     with similar needs and circumstances similarly and provide \n     opportunities for recipients who have been adversely affected \n     to be heard in a state administrative or appeal process.\n       Out of wedlock pregnancies. Establish goals and take \n     actions to reduce the incidence of out of wedlock \n     pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenagers.\n       Other programs. Have in place a child support enforcement \n     and child protection programs.\n       Local Control. Certify that 1) local governments and \n     private sector organizations are included in all phases of \n     developing the plan; 2) local officials who are responsible \n     for administration of services are able to plan, design and \n     administer programs in their jurisdiction; and 3) there are \n     no unfunded mandates on local governments.\n       Non-displacement. Certify that the state program will not \n     result in the displacement of any current employees or \n     replacement of an employee who was terminated with \n     individuals receiving assistance under the state plan.\n       Maintenance of effort. 85% maintenance of effort \n     requirement through FY 2001 based on a state's FY 1994 \n     spending on AFDC, JOBS, and AFDC-related child care and EA. \n     State spending on programs that were not part of the state's \n     AFDC program would not be counted in meeting the maintenance \n     of effort. The Secretary may reduce the maintenance of effort \n     requirement by up to 5% (down to 80%) for states that have \n     high performance in placing individuals in private sector \n     employment and increase the states maintenance of effort by \n     up to 5% (up to 90%) if the state fails to meet the work \n     participation rates.\n       Transferability. States may transfer up to 20% of the \n     federal TANF grant to the Child care and Development Block \n     grant.\n       Time limits on benefits:\n       Five year federal limit. A state may not provide cash \n     assistance to a family that includes and adult who has \n     received any assistance under the TANF grant for 60 months.\n       State option for time limits. States have the option of \n     terminating benefits to a family that includes an adult who \n     has received assistance for 24 months.\n       Exemption to time limits. States may grant exemptions to up \n     to 20% of the caseload for either reason of hardship or if \n     the individual has been battered or subject to extreme \n     cruelty.\n       Vouchers. States have the option of providing assistance in \n     the form of vouchers for the needs of the child (diapers, \n     etc.) for families who lose benefits as a result of the \n     federal five year time limit. States must provide vouchers to \n     families who lose assistance as a result of a state time \n     limit of less than five years.\n       Work requirements. States must require a parent or \n     caretaker receiving assistance under the program to engage in \n     work after receiving assistance for 24 months:\n       Individual Responsibility Contract. Require welfare \n     recipients sign an individual responsibility contract \n     developed by the state upon becoming eligible for cash \n     assistance. The individual responsibility contract would \n     outline what actions the individual would take to move to \n     private sector employment. The contract will also outline \n     what services the state will provide to the individual.\n       Eligible work activities. Unsubsidized employment; \n     subsidized private and public sector employment; work \n     experience, on-the-job\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\n     training; job search and job readiness (limited to 12 weeks \n     in a year); community service; vocational educational \n     training (not to exceed 12 months for any individual). \n     Education and job skills training will not count toward \n     meeting the first 20 hours of participation (unless in the \n     case of education, the parent is a teen).

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the \nBiden-Specter Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996, a companion \nmeasure to H.R. 3266, the Castle-Tanner Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act \nof 1996. At the outset, I want to compliment my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and Congressmen Castle and Tanner for their \nefforts in drafting a strong, bipartisan bill that represents \ncommonsense welfare reform and should attract a broad consensus. Our \nbasic objective in reforming the welfare system is the reduction of \npoverty and the improvement of the standard of living of millions of \nAmericans. We should not let this goal become lost in partisan politics \nand we should not wait for the next election to achieve welfare reform \nand a balanced budget. This Congress can be known as the can do \nCongress if we work together on these vital issues.\n  I support many of the principles reflected in the Bipartisan Welfare \nReform Act, such as establishing new work requirements in conjunction \nwith improved job training, child care, and other support services for \nwelfare recipients trying to end their dependence on Government \nassistance. I also support its get-tough policy on collecting overdue \nchild support and on reducing fraud in various Government benefit \nprograms. Although I have concerns about some of the provisions in our \nlegislation, such as the calculation of the formula for the State block \ngrant, it is important to demonstrate that there is a bipartisan effort \nin the Senate on reforming welfare and I intend to address my \nreservations during the coming weeks as welfare reform proposals are \nconsidered in the Senate. While I have some reservations, I believe \nthis bill is a good starting point for bipartisan legislation.\n  Looking back to my youth, I began to learn about some of the problems \nof welfare while growing up in Russell, KS, a small agricultural-oil \ncommunity. Then, upon moving to Philadelphia for college I saw the \nproblems that can arise in a large city. I have observed problems of \nwelfare dependency for more than 30 years, going back to my earliest \ndays of public service. As an assistant district attorney in \nPhiladelphia, I saw the tremendous impact, the tremendous cost \noccasioned by a program which did not realistically move people from \nwelfare rolls to payrolls. I learned a great deal about the problems of \npoverty and the interrelation of jobs, housing, education, welfare, and \ncrime. Later, as district attorney, I brought prosecutions on welfare \nfraud which I believe were among the first to be brought in the \ncountry. So my concern about welfare reform goes back a long way.\n  Mr. President, in the mid-1980's I had the pleasure of introducing \nand cosponsoring several pieces of welfare reform legislation that \nincluded job training for economically disadvantaged individuals. In \nthe 99th Congress, I cosponsored Senate bills 2578 and 2579 with \nSenator Moynihan, which were directed toward improving the welfare \nsystem. In the 100th Congress, I introduced similar legislation with \nSenator Dodd and worked closely with Senator Moynihan on the \nlegislation that became the first comprehensive welfare reform bill, \nthe Family Welfare Reform Act of 1988, which was signed by President \nReagan.\n  It is against this background of my own involvement with the problem \nof welfare that I am seeking to work with my colleagues again this year \nin fashioning legislation that will constitute firm action to put many \nable-bodied people back to work while ensuring that a social safety net \ncontinues to exist, particularly where children are involved.\n  As we revisit this debate, it is painfully obvious to me that our \nwelfare system has not worked. When one weighs all the factors, it is \napparent that we must try a new approach at the Federal level. \nConsider, for example, the astonishing fact that the overall percentage \nof persons in poverty in 1994 was roughly equivalent to poverty rates \nin 1965--the year the Federal Government broadened its role in reducing \npoverty in our society. In my own State of Pennsylvania, I have been \ntroubled that as many as 5 percent of our more than 11 million \nresidents were receiving some form of welfare benefits as of the end of \n1994, more than double the 2.4 percent that were receiving benefits in \n1965. Further, since 1965, the number of Pennsylvanians receiving aid \nto families with dependent children has risen from 276,000 to 608,000.\n\n  There are ongoing efforts at real welfare reform at the State level, \nsuch as in Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson has made notable \nprogress. In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Ridge recently signed into law far-\nreaching welfare reform which will institute agreements between the \ngovernment and welfare recipients that spell out the steps they must \ntake to move from welfare to work. Pennsylvania's new law emphasizes \nwork, personal responsibility, job training, child care, and other \nsupport services, all of which are key elements of the Biden-Specter \nreform plan. While I do not agree with all provisions of the proposed \nPennsylvania legislation, I do concur that reform legislation is \nneeded.\n  Because a new approach is merited, Congress should pass welfare \nreform legislation that the President will sign into law. Last year, \nCongress passed H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility and Work \nOpportunity Act of 1995, and H.R. 2491, the Balanced Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1995, both of which were vetoed by President \nClinton. In order to bridge the differences between Congress and the \nPresident concerning how to balance the budget and reform welfare, I \nbegan working with the centrist coalition, a bipartisan group of 22 \nSenators led by Senators Chafee and Breaux, to craft a 7-year \ncomprehensive balanced budget proposal. This plan, which would achieve \n$45 to $53 billion savings by reforming the welfare system, was offered \nas a substitute to the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution, but failed \nby a vote of 46 to 53. Although the coalition budget failed to win a \nmajority, it showed once again that there is great potential in this \nbody for initiatives presented in a bipartisan manner. If the policies \nwork, there is ample credit to be shared. But, if we don't try to work \ntogether, we deserve to share the blame.\n  The bill which I am jointly introducing today, the Bipartisan Welfare \nReform Act of 1996, represents another attempt to generate a broad \nconsensus and achieve meaningful welfare reform this year. The Biden-\nSpecter bill builds on the conference report to H.R. 4 and the \nbipartisan Governors' proposal, but is more specific and requires \nstronger State accountability and maintenance of effort in important \nareas, such as child care and contingency funding. Like other proposals \nconsidered by this Congress, this legislation delivers a strong message \nthat many Americans who are currently on welfare need to get into the \nwork force and pursue job training. Significantly, we will be giving \nthe States greater latitude to analyze and deal with the problems \ncloser to home. I am hopeful that this will result in better tailored, \nmore cost-effective social programs. However, effective welfare reform \nis not simply a matter of increasing flexibility or shifting \nincentives. The movement toward block grants is a sound one, provided \nthat there are some limitations\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nand requirements that continue to be imposed by the Federal Government \nin Washington. We need to make sure that we simply do not give the \nStates a blank check where money may be spent for other purposes that \nfail to protect a national interest identified by Congress.\n  Among its key provisions, the legislation we are introducing today \ndoes the following: First, it limits benefits--no cash assistance \nbeyond 5 years except exemptions for up to 20 percent of a State's \ncaseload for reason of hardship or if individual was battered or \nsubject to extreme cruelty; second, it requires that 50 percent of \nwelfare recipients must be working by the year 2002--all able-bodied \nrecipients must engage in work activities within 2 years of receiving \nbenefits, generally 25 hours/week, but 20 hours/week for parents with \nchildren 6 and under; third, it requires States to meet 85 percent \nlevel of maintenance of effort, which is stronger State accountability \nthan last year's GOP plan, 75 percent, Chafee-Breaux, 80 percent or \nthis year's GOP plan, 75 to 80 percent; fourth, it requires welfare \nrecipients to sign an individual responsibility contract developed by \nthe State upon becoming eligible for cash assistance, which would \noutline steps the individual must take to get in private sector and \nwould outline the State's obligations; fifth, it allows eligible work \nactivities to include unsubsidized employment, subsidized private and \npublic sector employment, on-the-job training, vocational training, \ncommunity service; sixth, it provides an additional $3 billion for \nwork-related programs beginning in 1999 if States are meeting 100 \npercent of their fiscal year 1994 spending levels and need more funds \nfor work participation; seventh, it provides $20 billion in mandatory \nand discretionary child care funding over the next 6 years, an amount \nhigher than last year's Senate bill, similar to Chafee-Breaux, and \nrecommended by the National Governors Association--also maintains \ncurrent law's Federal health and safety protections for licensed child \ncare providers; eighth, during economic downturns, States can access a \n$2 billion contingency fund if they have high unemployment rates or \nhigh rates of increase in their food stamp population--also provides \n$800 million in additional funding for States with rapid population \nincreases and a $1.7 billion loan fund for States that need additional \nmoney; and ninth, it requires States to enforce and improve existing \nchild support laws, including the suspension of certain licenses for \noverdue child support--also increases the likelihood that a child's \npaternity will be established.\n\n  As my colleagues are aware, I had some real reservations about some \naspects of last year's welfare reform legislation. Although I supported \nthe conference report on H.R. 4 because it advanced the underlying goal \nof reforming a program that has discouraged poor families from working, \nI would have preferred that the original Senate-passed bill, agreed to \nby a virtual consensus of 87 to 12, become law. Some of my concerns are \nmet by the legislation we are introducing today. I am hopeful that my \nadditional concerns will be met as the Senate considers this and other \nwelfare reform legislation during the balance of the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, as we move forward with budget reconciliation, I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to craft legislation that will not \nonly save money and help families mired in poverty to move off of \nwelfare and become self-sufficient, but also protect children and \npreserve the rights, dignity, and well-being of those currently \ninvolved in our welfare system. I urge my colleagues to support the \nBiden-Specter Bipartisan Welfare Reform Act of 1996 as a commonsense \napproach to this difficult, complex issue which is so important to the \nfuture of our society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6144-3", "month": "06", "year":

Mr. President, on May 9, 1996, Dr. John \nBrademas, Chairman of the National Endowment for Democracy [NED], \ndelivered a very thoughtful address to a conference on ``The Greek-U.S. \nRelationship and the Future of Southeastern Europe,'' organized by the \nInstitute for Foreign Policy Analysis. I was fortunate to be able to \nattend a portion of that conference, at which some very important and \ndifficult issues were discussed relating to the future of democracy in \nthe Balkans. As my colleagues know, the National Endowment for \nDemocracy is our Nation's premier institution for assisting in the \ntransition from closed, authoritarian, and totalitarian systems to free \nand open systems of elected and accountable government around the \nworld.\n  Dr. Brademas, a longtime friend and former colleague, is one of the \nNation's most highly regarded experts on the promotion and expansion of \ndemocracy, as well as a longtime observer and analyst of development in \nSouthern Europe. His proposal for a Center for Democracy in the Balkans \nis therefore worthy of special note, and I commend his remarks to my \ncolleagues. I ask that his remarks be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                      Remarks of Dr. John Brademas\n\n       I am for several reasons pleased to have been invited to \n     Washington, D.C. to take part in this conference on U.S.-\n     Greek relations and the future of Southeastern Europe. And I \n     should like to salute the Institute for Foreign Policy \n     Analysis, the Constantinos Karamanlis Foundation, the \n     International Security Studies Program of the Fletcher School \n     of Law and Diplomacy and the Lilian Voudoris Foundation for \n     having brought together so many outstanding authorities on \n     the subject.\n       That the distinguished President of the Hellenic Republic, \n     His Excellency Constantinos Stephanopoulos, as well as \n     Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos and Education Minister \n     George Papandreou and other prominent leaders from both \n     Greece and the United States should be participating in these \n     discussions is a mark of their great importance.\n       And that both President Clinton's meeting with President \n     Stephanopoulos and this conference come only one month \n     following the visit here of Prime Minister Costas Simitis is \n     but further indication of the close ties between our two \n     countries.\n       Another reason I am glad to have been asked to join you is \n     that, as most of you know, I am a child of both Greece and \n     the United States. My father was born in Kalamata and my \n     mother in Indiana.\n       As the first native-born American of Greek origin elected \n     to the Congress of the United States, where I served for \n     twenty-two years, I naturally had a particular interest in \n     issues concerning Greece. But it was an interest deeply \n     rooted in my commitment to the principles of the \n     Constitution of the United States. For example, I was \n     openly and strongly critical of the military junta of 1967 \n     to 1974, and I opposed US military aid to Greece during \n     that period. And, 22 years ago this summer, in company \n     with my valued friend, now the distinguished senior \n     Senator from Maryland, Paul S. Sarbanes, and others, I was \n     deeply engaged in the struggle between Congress and the \n     White House following the unlawful use by Turkey of \n     American weapons to invade and occupy the independent \n     Republic of Cyprus. The failure of the executive branch of \n     the US government of respect the Constitution and the rule \n     of law contributed to the bitter legacy that, we all know, \n     is with us still.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n                  The National Endowment for Democracy\n\n       I must cite one more reason I'm pleased to be with you and \n     that is to speak in my capacity as Chairman of the National \n     Endowment for Democracy. For one of the most important bonds \n     between Greeks and Americans is that we have the good fortune \n     to be citizens of lively democracies.\n       Indeed, it is about our common commitment to the \n     institutions and practices of democracy, of self-government, \n     that I want to offer some brief comments this afternoon.\n       For I believe that we in the American and Greek \n     democracies--and the European democracies in general--have an \n     obligation--this is not only a moral question but it is in \n     our respective national interests--to promote free, open and \n     democratic societies.\n       Let me tell you a little about the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, or NED, because it relates directly to my talk.\n       Founded in 1983 by Act of Congress, the National Endowment \n     for Democracy is a nonpartisan, non-governmental organization \n     that champions, through grants to private entities in other \n     countries, the institutions of democracy. NED grants are made \n     to organizations dedicated to promoting the rule of law, free \n     and fair elections, a free press, human rights and the other \n     components of a genuinely democratic culture.\n       I must add that a time when the political atmosphere in \n     Washington is even more partisan than usual, NED is unique in \n     enjoying strong support across party and ideological lines.\n\n\n                   Promoting Democracy in the Balkans\n\n       As all of us here are profoundly concerned about \n     developments in the Balkans, let me report to you on efforts \n     of the National Endowment for Democracy to address some of \n     the obstacles to democratization in that region. Albeit with \n     modest funds, NED has supported programs to encourage the \n     resolution of inter-ethnic conflict, greater political \n     pluralism and economic reform as well as to strengthen the \n     independent organizations necessary to form the basis of \n     civil society in the area.\n       For example, in Albania, NED is assisting a project of the \n     American Federation of Teachers and the Albanian Teachers' \n     Union to conduct ``Introduction to Teaching Democracy'' \n     workshops.\n       In Bulgaria, NED sponsors the Bulgarian Association for \n     Fair Elections (BAFE), a network of community centers to \n     stimulate civic participation at the local level.\n       In Romania, NED has helped the League for Europe, which \n     presses for better relations between Romanians and Hungarians \n     in Transylvania.\n       The Endowment also supports several media outlets that \n     produce impartial news on developments in the former \n     Yugoslavia. Only a few weeks ago, our board approved grants \n     to five independent media operations in Serbia/Montenegro \n     (FRY).\n       Now who can deny that the challenges to building democracy \n     in this part of the world, especially in the areas ravaged by \n     war, are immense, indeed, daunting? But, in my view, the \n     enormity of the challenge is all the more reason for us to \n     act.\n       Certainly, it seems to me, the encouragement of free, open, \n     stable and democratic societies throughout the Balkans must \n     be of direct interest to the people of Greece. Not only would \n     such developments contribute to Greek national security but \n     to the Greek economy, too. I've already discussed with Greek \n     business leaders the opportunities they see for expanding \n     their markets in the region as well as enhancing the climate \n     for foreign investment in Greece. In fact, even today Greek \n     investments in banking and other private sector activities in \n     the Balkans and throughout Southeastern Europe generate \n     economic growth and ties that can, spur the democratic \n     process. Remember, too, a consideration important to American \n     policymakers, that Greece is the only country in the region \n     that is a member of the European Union, Council of Europe and \n     NATO.\n\n\n                 a center for democracy in the balkans\n\n       In my judgment, we should now take advantage of, on the one \n     hand, the recent accords between Athens and Skopje and, on \n     the other, the Dayton agreements on Bosnia, to consider \n     seriously the establishment of a center to encourage \n     democracy in the Balkans.\n       My own view is that an appropriate location for such a \n     center is Greece.\n       I note first that Greece is the birthplace of democracy and \n     a thriving democracy still.\n       Second, Thessaloniki, in northern Greece, at the crossroads \n     of the South Balkans, is a natural site for a forum devoted \n     to matters affecting the region. Thessaloniki is a multi-\n     cultural, cosmopolitan city, named, as we know, by the \n     European Union as the 1997 ``Cultural Capital of Europe.''\n       Indeed, only a few weeks ago, I took part in a conference \n     in Thessloniki sponsored by a recently established \n     Association for Democracy in the Balkans. Scholars from nine \n     Balkan countries made presentations on political \n     institutions, on civil society in general and nongovernmental \n     organizations in particular as well as on the role of the \n     media in each country. By all accounts, the conference was a \n     success.\n\n\n                   a genuinely multi-national center\n\n       I believe it particularly important to note there that \n     their participants in the Thessaloniki meeting made clear \n     that a center to promote democracy should not be a Creek \n     enterprise but one genuinely multi-national in nature.\n       If the seed for such a multi-national center has been \n     planted in Thessaloniki, I'm glad to tell you of some steps \n     to follow up those discussions.\n       In two weeks, there will be another conference on democracy \n     in the Balkans, to be held in New York City, under the \n     auspices of the National Endowment for Democracy and the \n     American Ditchley Foundation. We shall convene a group of \n     scholars, diplomats, journalists and others to discuss the \n     concept, the obstacles, the opportunities and the practical \n     steps needed to establish a center to encourage democracy in \n     the region. Former Assistant Secretary of State Richard \n     Holbrooke will address the conference, which I shall chair, \n     as will Congressman Benjamin Gilman, Chairman of the \n     International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, and Senator Paul Sarbanes, a senior member \n     of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n       Here let me express appreciation to both Congressman Gilman \n     and Senator Sarbanes for their continuing contributions to \n     strengthening relations between Greece and the United States \n     and pay tribute as well to another outstanding legislator who \n     shares that commitment, Congressman Lee Hamilton, senior \n     Democrat on the House committee, who addressed you earlier \n     today.\n       Among others to take part in the New York City conference \n     this month are President Clinton's Special Envoy on the \n     Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Matthew Nimetz, and \n     U.S. Ambassador-designate to FYROM, Christopher Hill.\n       Then in June, at Ditchley Park, outside Oxford, the \n     American and British Ditchley Foundations will sponsor \n     another conference, which I'll also chair, with essentially \n     the same purpose except that participants will be drawn \n     chiefly from Europe.\n       A few weeks ago, as you all know, the First Lady of the \n     United States, Hillary Rodham Clinton, on her first visit to \n     Greece, said of Athens that it was the city that had ``given \n     the world its greatest gift--the gift of democracy.''\n       Let me then voice the hope that the peoples of the United \n     States and Greece can work together--and with others--to \n     encourage in the too-long troubled region of the Balkans the \n     institutions and practices of self-government, ``the gift of \n     democracy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6152-3", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6153-S6155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ENCRYPTION REFORM NEEDED NOW\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have just become a cosponsor of \nS. 1726, the Commerce Promotion Act of 1996. This bill would remove \nexport controls on encryption technology, a coding system enabling \nindividuals and corporations to keep computer communications private.\n  Under current law, sophisticated encryption technology is sold \nwithout restriction in the United States. It is this technology that \nenables banks and other financial institutions to guarantee the \nconfidentiality of personal and financial information. Furthermore, \nmany analysts argue that concerns about security are restraining the \nInternet's growth as a commercial enterprise.\n  American-made software is the best in the world. Many foreign \ncompanies and individuals want to buy our products. However, because of \nconcerns relating to international criminal activity, the U.S. \nGovernment refuses to allow the export of software that includes \ncertain encryption technology.\n  The current policy is damaging American software companies. Foreign \ncorporations and individuals will not pay top dollar for computer \ntechnology that cannot guarantee that personal information will stay \nprivate. As a result, our major trading partners are forced to buy \nsoftware made outside the United States, costing American companies \nbillions.\n  These export controls place U.S. software companies at a competitive \ndisadvantage, giving foreign competitors the opportunity to encroach on \nour dominant position in the global marketplace. The United States \nenjoys a huge trade surplus in software. Our export policies should \nseek to strengthen U.S. companies, not give their competitors an unfair \nadvantage.\n  I am very sensitive to the concerns raised by the Clinton \nadministration about this issue. I strongly believe that U.S. \nintelligence agencies must retain the ability to intercept \ncommunications about terrorist attacks and other criminal acts. \nHowever, I am confident that this goal can be achieved without \nrestraining the ability of U.S. companies to sell their products abroad \nfor legitimate commercial uses.\n  Mr. President, we have a problem on our hands, but we can solve it. \nCongress and the administration must act together to pass an encryption \ntechnology reform bill this year.\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on Friday, May 3, I had the honor \nof joining with Secretary of State Christopher and the American Foreign \nService Association [AFSA] in paying tribute to Commerce Secretary Ron \nBrown and 32 other Americans who were tragically killed in Croatia \nwhile in service to our country. A plaque was also dedicated to three \ndiplomats who died seeking peace in Bosnia less than a year ago. On the \noccasion we were reminded not just of the individuals who lost their \nlives in these terrible tragedies, but of the risks and sacrifices that \nmembers of our Foreign Service undertake on a daily basis in an effort \nto support peace, democracy and freedom around the globe.\n  During the ceremony, held on the 31st annual Foreign Service Day, \nvery moving speeches were delivered by Harold Ickes on behalf of \nPresident Clinton, by Secretary of State Christopher, and by F. Allen \n``Tex'' Harris, president of AFSA. I believe their remarks bear \nrepeating to a broader audience and thus ask that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n Remarks by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Harold Ickes, and F. \n                              Allen Harris\n\n       Mr. Harris.

Secretary Christopher, Secretary Perry, \n     Secretary Kantor, members of Congress, men and women of the \n     Foreign Service, ladies and gentlemen.\n       President Clinton asked me to be with you today as we honor \n     an extraordinary group of Americans who gave their lives in \n     service of their country and in the service of humanity.\n       Before reading the President's dedication, let me say to \n     the families and loved ones of Bob Frasure, Joe Kruzel, \n     Nelson Drew, and to those of Ron Brown and his entire \n     delegation, I know that this is a day of very, very mixed \n     emotions.\n       You've lost a father, a mother, a husband or a wife, a son \n     or a daughter, a friend. The American people have lost some \n     of their finest.\n       On a very personal note, with the death of Secretary Ron \n     Brown, I lost one of my closest friends and wisest advisers. \n     Ron Brown was in his service and in his life a spring day. He \n     let himself and all of us to believe that making a difference \n     was a joy as well as a duty. He was an achiever of potential. \n     His grace, his intelligence, his self-confidence without a \n     trace of arrogance, and his abilities to motivate, to lead \n     and to bridge were a rare combination of qualities.\n       I am very proud and very fortunate to have had him as my \n     friend. To Alma, Michael, Tracy, we will all miss him \n     greatly. Let me now read the President's dedication.\n       Each year on Foreign Service Day, hundreds of active and \n     retired Foreign Service employees come together to discuss \n     foreign policy initiatives. It is also a day of remembrance \n     when the foreign affairs community honors its many colleagues \n     who have given their lives in service of our country.\n       ``As we pay tribute to the memory of those who we have \n     lost, let us rededicate ourselves to the goal for which they \n     lived: maintaining America's leadership in the fight for \n     peace and freedom throughout the world.\n       ``In today's increasingly interdependent world, our \n     nation's future is linked more than ever to events that take \n     place beyond our borders, to strengthen our security, promote \n     our prosperity and advance our interests. As we move towards \n     the 21st century, America must stay engaged.\n       ``Whether supporting peace, freedom and democracy and other \n     transnations threats, combating environmental degradation, \n     opening markets and expanding of trade, the American Foreign \n     Services has a critical role to play.\n       ``Our Foreign Affairs men and women serve on the front \n     lines, often in demanding and sometimes dangerous \n     surroundings. I'm committed to do all I can to insure that \n     Congress provides the funding we need to support your \n     essential work.\n       ``This year, our nation has lost some of its best and \n     brightest public servants, and I have lost a very dear \n     friend. The American people will not forget the contributions \n     made by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and the 34 members of \n     his delegation who died in a plane crash on a fog-shrouded \n     mountainside in Croatia.\n       ``They were on an important mission to bring development \n     and economic stability to a wartorn region far from home. \n     Unfortunately, theirs is not the only recent tragedy in that \n     part of the world. We finally and respectfully remember our \n     colleagues, Robert Frasure, Joseph Kruzel and Samuel Nelson \n     Drew who lost their lives in Bosnia.\n       ``These men, who represented the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense and the National Security Council and \n     the United States Air Force, embodied the spirit of service \n     that sets our nation apart. Their heroic efforts helped bring \n     an end to four years of bloodshed and gave the children of \n     Bosnia a chance to grow up in peace.\n       ``To all Foreign Service professionals, active and retired, \n     and their family members in the United States and abroad who \n     support America's values worldwide, I send my deepest thanks \n     and appreciation.'' Bill Clinton.\n       Mr. Harris. Thank you very much. We appreciate that. I now \n     have the great honor of introducing a distinguished American \n     with a long, long successful record of service to this nation \n     and to his community. Family members, distinguished guests, \n     ladies, gentlemen, colleagues, the Secretary of State, Warren \n     Christopher.\n       Secretary Christopher. Thank you, Tex, Harold, Senator \n     Kassenbaum. Senator Sarbanes, Secretary Perry, Secretary \n     Kanter, and other distinguished guests here today.\n       Let me extend a special welcome to the families of the men \n     and women we are honoring today. You will always be a close \n     part of the State Department family.\n       As the President has said, we come together every year on \n     this day to celebrate the dedication and the accomplishments \n     of the Foreign Service. But this is often a sad day as well \n     because it is the day we add names to the memorial plaques in \n     remembrance of our colleagues who gave their lives in service \n     to their country.\n       Thirty years ago there were 72 names on this wall, covering \n     all of American history since 1780. Now the list has grown to \n     188. And in the last year, two terrible tragedies have \n     reminded us again that in this dangerous world, duty and \n     sacrifice often go hand in hand.\n       We often say that we must take risks for peace. Today we \n     see that the risks are all too real. To our sorrow, we learn \n     that peace cannot be made through telephone or fax. It \n     usually can't be made in Washington or in Geneva. It can only \n     be made by people who are willing to fly where the bullets \n     fly, to go where roads are treacherous and where safety and \n     security are often missing in action.\n       Sadly, we can't take the danger out of diplomacy. But we \n     can and must honor the peacemakers and their deeds. And we \n     can make sure the American people know of the sacrifices the \n     peacemakers make for our sake.\n       Last August in Bosnia three American diplomats were on \n     their way to the besieged city of Sarajevo when they lost \n     their lives on a muddy mountain road. Bob Frasure, Joe \n     Kruzel, and Nelson Drew believed that peace was possible in \n     Bosnia. And they were certainly right. Indeed, they were the \n     path-finders who made peace possible.\n       Just a month ago, Ron Brown and a team of government \n     officials and business leaders were on a journey to Croatia. \n     They lost their lives trying to make sure that the peace our \n     diplomats had forged would endure. They were convinced that \n     American capital and American know-how could help rebuild \n     that shattered land, that it could give the people of that \n     country a reason to resist the temptations of war. And they, \n     too, were right.\n       As I have travelled the world in the weeks since these two \n     tragic events, I have received a chorus of condolences from \n     leaders all around the world who understand the sacrifices \n     made by the families of the men and women who died in those \n     tragic events.\n       A short time ago, when I was in Sarajevo and in the \n     compound of our Embassy, I\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\n     planted two dogwood trees in honor of Bob Frasure. But by far \n     the most eloquent tribute to his work, and to Joe's and to \n     Nelson's and to Ron's and all those we honor today, has been \n     the return of normal life that I could see all around me in \n     Sarajevo. Every school reopened, every family reunited, every \n     road and factory rebuilt is a monument to the service of \n     these brave Americans.\n       That monument, of course, is a work in progress. It is \n     being shaped by countless hands--by our diplomats, our \n     soldiers, by our civil servants, and by the people of the \n     region. The memory of our fallen colleagues impels us not to \n     rest--not to rest at all--until this work is completed.\n       The men and women we honor today, as the President said, \n     will always represent what is best about America. They were \n     generous enough to share their talent and spirits with \n     others. They were dedicated enough to make sacrifices in the \n     cause of public service. They were realistic enough to know \n     that America's fate is inseparable from the fate of the \n     world. And they were optimistic enough to believe that the \n     difficult problems can be solved but only solved when America \n     is determined to overcome them.\n       Thinking of them, I was reminded of something that one of \n     our visitors this week, Shimon Peres, once said: ``Nobody \n     will ever really understand the United States . . . You have \n     so much power, and [yet] you didn't dominate another people; \n     you have problems of your own, and [yet] you have never \n     turned your back on the problems of others.''\n       Anyone who knew these wonderful friends and colleagues \n     understands something very important about America. Anybody \n     who passes through this hall and who pauses to think about \n     the lives behind the names of the people on these plaques \n     will understand something about the American ideal. Here, in \n     the presence of these names, there is not an ounce of \n     cynicism about the country or about the people who represent \n     it.\n       So even as we mourn, let us keep alive the spirit that gave \n     these lives such meaning. And let these names be a reminder \n     to us all--a reminder of the risks and hardships that \n     dedicated Americans endure for their country, and let it be a \n     reminder of the constant need to carry on their work, our \n     work, until it is finally finished.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6153-1", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6155-S6163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Authorization of appropriations.''.\n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, over the past decades, a consensus has \nemerged that traditional litigation is an inefficient way to resolve \ndisputes. Not only is litigation costly, but due to its adversarial, \ncontentious nature, litigation often deteriorates working relationships \nand fails to produce long-term solutions to problems.\n  Private corporations recognized many years ago that certain types of \ndisputes could be resolved much less expensively and with less acrimony \nby relying on techniques such as mediation, arbitration, and \npartnering,\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nwhich collectively have become known as alternative dispute resolution \nor ADR.\n  In 1990, Congress recognized that the Government lagged well behind \nthe private sector in this field and in response enacted the \nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act to promote the use of ADR in \nGovernment agencies. Senators Grassley and Levin led the effort to pass \nthis legislation and bring the benefits of ADR to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The act authorizes agencies to apply ADR to almost any type of claim \ninvolving the Government, requires the appointment of ADR specialists \nin each agency, establishes procedures for hiring neutral third-parties \nto help resolve disputes, and provides confidentiality protection to \nparties participating in ADR.\n  S. 1224, the bill before the Senate, would permanently reauthorize \nthis important legislation. It would also improve the system for hiring \nmediators, provide additional confidentiality protections to ADR \nparticipants, promote the use of binding arbitration and make a number \nof other minor adjustments to the act.\n  The Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management held a hearing \non the bill on November 29. At the hearing, the Department of Justice, \nthe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the American Bar Association, and private \nindividuals representing the Heritage Foundation and a consortium of \nGovernment contractors all praised the ADR Act and strongly endorsed \nits reauthorization. On December 12, 1995, the bill was unanimously \nreported, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute, by the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n  The most significant change this bill makes to the original ADR Act \nis the repeal of a provision known as the arbitration escape clause. \nDuring consideration of the ADR Act in 1990, this provision was \nincluded to accommodate the Department of Justice's view that agencies \nlacked constitutional authority to refer disputes to binding \narbitration. Although many scholars and the sponsors of the bill \ndisagreed with this view, to satisfy the Department of Justice [DOJ], a \nprovision was added that enabled Federal agencies to opt-out of \narbitral awards. Unfortunately, this unilateral provision has deterred \nprivate parties from entering into arbitration with the Government. As \none witness testified at the hearing on this reauthorization \nlegislation, unless the escape clause is eliminated, ``arbitration \nlikely will never become a viable alternative for the Federal \nGovernment.''\n  This would be unfortunate. Throughout the private sector, companies \nare saving money and reducing litigation costs by using arbitration to \nresolve commercial disputes instead of resorting to litigation. If we \nwant the Government to enjoy the efficiencies of the private sector, it \nmust have the flexibility to operate as a private business, especially \nwhen the Government is acting as a commercial entity. Indeed, the \nGovernment achieves a double benefit when a case is resolved through \narbitration rather than litigation because not only are agency \nlitigation costs and attorneys fees reduced, but judicial resources are \nfreed to pursue criminal cases or other civil matters.\n  Last year, DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel issued a detailed opinion \nconcluding that Federal agencies could submit disputes to binding \narbitration without violating the Constitution. Since the \nconstitutional objection to binding arbitration has been removed, there \nis no longer any reason to reauthorize the agency escape clause.\n  There are two amendments to S. 1224 before the Senate for \nconsideration. The first amendment is designed to increase the \nefficiency of our procurement system by consolidating jurisdiction over \nbid protest claims in the Court of Federal Claims. The amendment would \nreverse the decision of the D.C. Circuit in Scanwell Lab., Inc. versus \nShaffer (1969), that permitted bid protests to be filed in any district \ncourt across the country. Providing district courts with jurisdiction \nto hear bid protest claims has led to forum shopping and the \nfragmentation of Government contract law. Consolidation of jurisdiction \nin the Court of Federal Claims is necessary to develop a uniform \nnational law on bid protest issues and end the wasteful practice of \nshopping for the most hospitable forum. Congress established the Claims \nCourt--now the Court of Federal Claims--for the specific purpose of \nimproving the administration of the law in the areas of patents, \ntrademarks, Government contracts, Government employment, and \ninternational trade. Scanwell jurisdiction frustrates this purpose and \ndeprives litigants of the substantial experience and expertise the \nCourt of Federal Claims has developed in the Government contracting \narea.\n  The Information Technology and Management Reform Act of 1996, which I \nauthored, eliminated the authority of the General Services Board of \nContract Appeals to entertain bid protests on information technology \ncontracts and left the General Accounting Office as the single extra-\nagency administrative forum for such actions. My amendment to S. 1224 \nfollows this path of reform by creating a single forum for all bid \nprotest litigation, which will lead to the development of more uniform, \nand thus more predictable, law.\n  Identical legislation passed the Senate as part of the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act, but was rejected in conference. The \nDepartment of Justice and Office of Management and Budget strongly \nsupport the addition of this legislation to the ADR Act.\n  I also want to express my support for the Levin-Grassley amendment to \nS. 1224, which would reauthorize the Negotiated Rulemaking Act. This \nlegislation establishes a framework for agencies to convene interested \nparties for the purpose of developing consensus-based regulation. When \nit is used, negotiated rulemaking can improve the quality, \nacceptability, and timeliness of regulations, reduce litigation, and \nenhance industry compliance, thereby reducing the costs of regulations \nto both private industry and the Government. Over the past 5 years \nnegotiated rulemaking has been an unqualified success; there is no \nreason not to reauthorize this legislation while we are dealing with \nthe closely related ADR Act.\n  In sum, reauthorization of the ADR and Negotiated Rulemaking Acts and \nthe elimination of Scanwell jurisdiction represent cost-saving, \ncommonsense improvements to the Federal regulatory and administrative \nprocesses. These reforms are good for the taxpayer, good for our \ncourts, and good for the parties that have disputes with the \nGovernment.\n  I congratulate Senators Grassley and Levin for the success of the \noriginal pieces of legislation and commend them for their work on this \nreauthorization bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and sincerely hope that it \nmay be enacted into law during this session of Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Department of \nJustice I referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 12, 1996.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management \n         and the District of Columbia, Committee on Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Administration supports your efforts \n     to enact legislation that would make one small but vital \n     improvement to the handling of bid protests arising from the \n     award of Federal contracts--the elimination of district court \n     jurisdiction over bid protests (the so-called Scanwell \n     cases).\\1\\ In disputes between an agency and a contractor \n     after the award of a contract, Congress has previously \n     recognized the need for a uniform national body of law to \n     guide both Federal procurement officials and Federal \n     contractors. The same need for nationwide uniformity exists \n     for bid protests. The current forum shopping between the \n     Federal district courts and the Court of Federal Claims only \n     encourages needless litigation in a search for the most \n     hospitable forum, and results in disparate bodies of law \n     between the circuits. There is simply no need to have \n     multiple judicial bodies to review bid protests of federal \n     contacts.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Scanwell Lab., Inc. v. Shaffer, 424 F.2d 859, 869, 137 \n     U.S. App. D.C. 371, 381 (1969) (held, a contractor making a \n     prima facie showing alleging arbitrary or capricious action, \n     or an abuse of discretion, by an agency or contracting \n     officer in making the award of a contract, has standing to \n     sue in district court under the Administrative Procedure \n     Act).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       In the past, Congress has recognized the need for \n     nationwide uniformity in several areas of the law, and \n     established the Claims\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\n     Court (now the Court of Federal Claims) and the Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit to achieve that result. \n     Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982 (FCIA) Pub. L. No. 97-\n     164. The purpose of the FCIA was to improve ``the \n     administration of the law in the areas of patents, government \n     contracts, merit system protection, trademarks and \n     international trade.'' H. Rep. No. 97-312, 97th Cong., 1st \n     Sess. 17 (1981). As a result of the enactment of the FCIA, \n     the Court of Federal Claims was made the sole judicial forum \n     for resolution of contract disputes between the contractor \n     and the agency. The very same need exists for nationwide \n     uniformity in the handling of bid protests.\n       By eliminating the authority of the General Services Board \n     of Contract Appeal to entertain bid protests of the award of \n     information technology contracts, the recently-enacted \n     defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1996 (Pub. L. No. \n     104-106) took a significant step forward in the handling of \n     bid protests by leaving the General Accounting Office as the \n     sole remaining extra-agency administrative forum. The process \n     of procurement reform should continue by eliminating Scanwell \n     jurisdiction, and by creating a single judicial forum to \n     govern all bid protest litigation, both prior to and after \n     award. While there is good reason to apply local state law, \n     as district courts are required to do when they adjudicate \n     torts under the Federal Tort Claims Act, it is simply \n     inappropriate to have different interpretations of Federal \n     contracts applied, depending upon where the contractor \n     resides or where the contract will be performed. This results \n     in inconsistent application of legal principles and an \n     unwieldy body of procurement law.\n       Our concerns about varying results in the district courts \n     is not hypothetical. For example, the district court in \n     Advanced Seal Tech., Inc. v. Perry, 873 F. Supp. 1144 (N.D. \n     Ill. 1995), disagreed with the district court's holding in \n     Abel Converting, Inc. v. United States, 679 F. Supp. 1133 \n     (D.D.C. 1988), regarding the burden of proof borne by the \n     protestor to establish grounds for injunctive relief. \n     Similarly, the district court in Washington Mechanical \n     Contractors, Inc. v. United States Dept. of the Navy, 612 F. \n     Supp. 1243 (N.D. Cal. 1984), disagreed with the district \n     court's decision in Robert E. Dereckto of Rhode Island, Inc. \n     v. Goldschmidt, 506 F. Supp. 1059 (D. R.I. 1980), regarding \n     the quantum of proof necessary to invalidate an award of a \n     contract. In addition, the district court in Metric Systems \n     Corp. v. United States Dept. of the Air Force, 673 F. Supp \n     439 (N.D. Fla. 1987), disagreed with the holding in Acme of \n     Precision Surgical Co., Inc. v. Weinberger, 580 F. Supp. 490 \n     (E.D. Pa. 1984), that Federal district courts have both pre- \n     and post-award bid protest jurisdiction. These cases show \n     that, since Federal district court judges rarely have the \n     opportunity to review bid protests, as might be suspected, \n     the results vary from court-to-court.\n       Legislation should seek to accomplish three important \n     goals. First, it should achieve a uniform and consistent body \n     of precedent governing bid protests, by providing interested \n     parties with a choice of only one administrative and one \n     judicial forum for the resolution of bid protests. Second, it \n     should discourage forum shopping between the remaining \n     tribunal and court by imposing a similar, if not identical, \n     standard and scope of review in both fora. Finally, it should \n     impose a standard and scope of review which both recognizes \n     the deference to the contracting agency in conducting \n     procurements and also limits expensive, time-consuming and \n     resource-intensive discovery.\n       As Mr. Steven Kelman, Administrator for Federal Procurement \n     Policy, testified before your subcommittee last July:\n       ``With its nationwide jurisdiction and contract expertise, \n     the Court of Federal Claims could effectively and efficiently \n     serve as a unified judicial forum operating in the national \n     interest. This would avoid the unfairness of forum shopping. \n     At the same time, it would not prevent small businesses from \n     having their day in court inasmuch as the Court of Federal \n     Claims is authorized to hold hearings throughout the country \n     to minimize inconvenience and expense to litigants.''\n       In summary, the problems associated with district court bid \n     protest activity can be effectively avoided by vesting \n     judicial bid protests authority, both pre- and post-award, \n     exclusively in the Court of Federal Claims and imposing a \n     deferential standard of review and limited scope of review \n     similar to that used by the General Accounting Office. With \n     national jurisdiction, this court would effectively serve as \n     a unified judicial forum with contract expertise, eliminating \n     forum shopping and promoting the application of consistent \n     legal principles.\n       We urge Congress to take immediate action to eliminate \n     Scanwell jurisdiction in the district courts. We would be \n     happy to work with you to ensure enactment of legislation \n     that would meet this important objective. The Office of \n     Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection \n     from the standpoint of the Administration's program to the \n     presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we all want a Government that works better \nand costs less, and I am pleased that the Senate is considering today \nlegislation authored by myself and Senator Chuck Grassley to encourage \nfaster, less costly ways to resolve disputes with the Federal \nGovernment.\n  It's a fact of life that many people have disputes with the Federal \nGovernment. In the late 1980's, of the 220,000 civil cases filed on \nFederal court, more than 55,000 involved the Federal Government in one \nway or another. Resolving these disputes costs taxpayers billions of \ndollars.\n  Resolving them before they become courtroom dramas is one way to make \na dent in this billion-dollar drain on taxpayer funds. Mediation, \narbitration, mini-trials, and other methods offer cheaper, faster \nalternatives to courtroom battles.\n  That's why, 6 years ago, Senator Grassley and I cosponsored the \nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990. It is why we have teamed \nup again this year on legislation to reauthorize that act and ensure \nthat alternative dispute resolution techniques, which those familiar \nwith it call ADR, remain a cost-effective tool that Federal agencies \ncan use to resolve disputes.\n  Since the passage of the ADR law in 1990, Federal agencies have \nincreasingly used alternatives to courtroom litigation to save time and \nmoney. The Army Corps of Engineers, for example, successfully resolved \n53 of 55 contract disputes with ADR over a 5-year period, including \nsettling a $55 million claim in 1994 for $17.3 million in 4 days. The \nResolution Trust Corporation saved legal costs of approximately $115 \nmillion from 1991 through 1994, by using ADR instead of litigation. The \nNavy shortened dispute resolution times in some cases from 4 years to 3 \nmonths by replacing formal litigation with informal, abbreviated \nproceedings. Not all Federal agencies have used ADR extensively, but \nthose agencies that have tried it report both savings and satisfaction \nwith the process.\n  In these times of tight Federal budgets and shrinking Government, we \nneed more of the savings that ADR offers, not less. That's why the ADR \nAct should become a permanent fixture in Federal law. The act's \nunfortunate lapse in October of last year due to the press of business \nbefore Congress shows why this step is necessary.\n\n  The bill that Senator Grassley and I have introduced, S. 1224, would \nfill the current statutory void by permanently reauthorizing the ADR \nlaw. It would also fine-tune the law in several ways.\n  First and most importantly, the bill would eliminate a 30-day escape \nhatch that allowed Federal agencies unilaterally to vacate an \narbitration award that disadvantaged the Government. In the 5 years \nthis one-way escape clause has been on the books, no one has ever \nagreed to an arbitration proceeding with the Government on this basis. \nEliminating this unilateral escape clause--which allows the Government \nbut not its opponent to nullify an arbitration decision--is expected to \nencourage parties to agree to use binding arbitration as a cost-saving \nalternative to civil litigation. Other bill provisions make it clear \nthat Federal agencies also retain the option to use nonbinding \narbitration, when they so choose.\n  Second, the bill would encourage use of ADR methods by clarifying the \nconfidentiality of ADR proceedings in several respects. The bill would \nmake it clear that confidential documents prepared for purposes of an \nADR proceeding are also exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of \nInformation Act. The bill would also strike overly broad language \nwhich, if taken literally, would prohibit ADR neutrals and parties from \ndisclosing any information concerning an ADR proceeding, even whether \nan ADR proceeding took place. The bill would also eliminate a provision \nthat ended confidentiality protections for any document given to all \nparties, since this provision discourages open communications among all \nthe parties to a dispute. Together, these changes clarify, focus and \nstrengthen the law's confidentiality protections for ADR negotiations.\n  Third, the bill would encourage ADR by making it easier to use and \nimproving coordination with other dispute resolution procedures. \nSpecifically, the bill would clarify agency authority to hire mediators \nand other ADR neutrals on an expedited basis; allow agencies to accept \ndonated services from State, local and tribal governments to support an \nADR proceeding; add an explicit authorization for such sums as may be \nnecessary to implement the ADR law; remove a provision which\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nbarred Federal employees from electing to use ADR methods to resolve \ncertain personnel disputes; and eliminate special paperwork burdens on \ncontractors willing to use ADR to resolve small claims against the \nGovernment under the Contract Disputes Act.\n  Finally, the bill would reassign the tasks of encouraging and \nfacilitating agency use of ADR methods from the Administrative \nConference of the United States, which no longer exists due to a lack \nof appropriations, to the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, \nwhich has experience in this area.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to urge my colleagues to support a \nLevin-Grassley amendment to the ADR bill which would also reauthorize \nthe Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act \nbecame law back in 1990, at the same time as the ADR Act--in fact, for \na time, the two laws shared the same United States Code cites--so it \nwould be fitting to reauthorize both laws in the same piece of \nlegislation.\n  Like the ADR law, the Negotiated Rulemaking Act is a reform effort \nthat seeks to interject common sense and cost savings into the way the \nFederal Government does business. In essence, it allows a regulated \ncommunity to form an advisory committee with all other interested \nparties to work with the Federal Government to draft regulations that \neveryone will then have to live by.\n  An its name implies, the point of the law is to get parties to \nnegotiate with each other and the Federal Government to devise \nsensible, cost effective rules. No one is required to participate in a \nnegotiation, and no one gives up their rights by agreeing to negotiate. \nIt is a voluntary, rather than a mandatory, process.\n  The pleasant surprise is that it works. Since the Negotiated \nRulemaking Act was enacted 6 years ago, agencies across the Government \nhave tried it and liked it.\n  Over the past 6 years, negotiated rulemaking has been used to issue \nregulations under the Clean Air Act to produce cleaner burning gasoline \nand to clear haze from the Grand Canyon. The Coast Guard has used it to \nimprove ships' oilspill fighting capabilities, while the Federal \nRailroad Administration has used it to improve railway worker safety. \nThe Farm Credit System has negotiated a rule to apportion its \nadministrative expenses among banks and other parties, while the FCC \nhas used it to apportion data messaging services on satellites.\n  President Clinton has embraced the concept with an Executive order \nthat encourages all agencies to try negotiated rulemaking at least once \nper year. Some agencies, like the Federal Aviation Administration, have \nfound it so rewarding that they have established standing negotiated \nrulemaking committees and routinely invoke negotiated rulemaking to \nresolve difficult regulatory problems.\n  These agencies and others have discovered that, in many rulemaking \nsituations, negotiation beats confrontation in terms of cost, time, \naggravation, and the ability to develop regulations that parties with \nvery different perspectives can accept. One industry participant in the \nclean air negotiations put it this way, ``It's a better situation when \npeople who are adversaries can sit down at the table and talk about it \nrather than throwing bricks at each other in courtrooms and the \npress.'' An environmental journal came to the same conclusion, summing \nup the Grand Canyon negotiation with the headline, ``See You Later, \nLitigator.'' The Washington Post has called negotiated rulemaking \nplainly a good idea, while the New York Times has called it an \nimmensely valuable procedure that ought to be used far more often.\n\n  The goal of the Levin-Grassley amendment is exactly that--to \nreauthorize the Negotiated Rulemaking Act to ensure continued agency \nuse of this rulemaking procedure.\n  The amendment itself is straightforward. Like the ADR bill, it \nreauthorizes the 1990 law and makes it a permanent part of the U.S. \nCode. Like the ADR bill, it facilitates agency hiring of neutrals, \ncalled convenors and facilitators; provides an authorization for \nappropriations; and reassigns the responsibility of facilitating and \nencouraging agency use of negotiated rulemaking from the Administrative \nConference of the United States, which has been terminated, to an \nagency or interagency committee to be designated by the President.\n  This amendment has been circulated extensively among negotiated \nrulemaking practitioners and is supported by the administration and the \nAmerican Bar Association. It has been cleared by both sides of the \naisle. It is being offered now to avoid a lapse in the law which is \nscheduled to expire in November.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Grassley for his \nleadership on both ADR and negotiated rulemaking; Senator Cohen, \nchairman of the Government Affairs Oversight Subcommittee, for his \ncontinuing support; and Senator Stevens, Governmental Affairs Committee \nchairman, for his cooperation in getting this legislation to the floor \ndespite a crowded calendar.\n  Alternative dispute resolution methods and negotiated rulemaking \nprovide new and better ways to conduct Government business. They cost \nless, they're quicker, they're less adversarial, they develop sensible \nsolutions to problems, and they free up courts for other business. They \nare two success stories in creating a government that works better and \ncosts less. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Grassley and myself in \nvoting for the reauthorization of both laws.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Administrative Dispute Resolution \nAct before us, sponsored by myself and Senator Levin, is an amendment \nto title 5 of the United States Code. This is a law which I originally \nsponsored back in 1989 with Senator Levin. That 1989 law, also titled \nthe ``Administrative Dispute Resolution Act,'' was crafted to encourage \nFederal agencies to streamline dispute resolution processes by use of \nalternative dispute resolution techniques rather than by litigation. \nThese techniques are often collectively referred to as ADR, and include \nmediation, arbitration, conciliation, fact-finding, and minitrials.\n  Since the enactment of that law, most Federal agencies have \nformulated ADR programs and consequently have saved significant amounts \nof time and money by avoiding litigation of claims. At the same time, \nagencies haven't sacrificed fairness or party satisfaction. Overall, \nagencies have recognized the benefits of ADR's efficiency. As an \nexample of the success of these programs, the Environmental Protection \nAgency utilizes mediation and arbitration to resolve Superfund, Clean \nWater Act, and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act disputes. The EPA \nhas expressed great satisfaction with the results of these techniques \nin their resolution of complex regulatory enforcement issues.\n  In addition, ADR techniques are far less costly than litigation. The \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated a savings of $13 \nmillion in legal costs in the last 3 years alone because of its ADR \nprogram. The Resolution Trust Corporation estimated it saved $114 \nmillion over the last 4 years using ADR techniques. These examples are \nproof of ADR's efficiency.\n  The judiciary has also benefited from adoption of ADR techniques. The \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California estimated \nsavings of almost $44,000 in administrative costs per case after it \nimplemented an early neutral evaluation program. Although the bill \nbefore us doesn't include the judiciary, we are in the process of \ndrafting a bill that would encourage the judiciary to adopt ADR \nprograms, which have been in existence on a limited basis. \nRepresentative Moorhead's subcommittee has already held hearings on the \nHouse side regarding this issue, and I expect to pursue this initiative \nin my Judiciary Subcommittee this year.\n  Despite the benefits that both the executive and judiciary branches \nhave derived from adopting ADR programs, improvements can still be made \nto promote ADR. Many ADR programs haven't been integrated into the \ndaily routines of their agencies. Agencies have had legitimate concerns \nabout confidentiality, fairness, and quality assurance. Further, the \noriginal law expired in October of last year, and by not extending this \nlaw, progress in agency adoption of ADR techniques has been stalled. \nThe new ADR bill seeks to address these concerns by modifying and \nclarifying the original act to make ADR more attractive to the agencies \nin the resolution of their disputes.\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management and the District of Columbia, held a hearing on \nthis bill on November 16, 1995. At the hearing, the bill enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support. A number of changes were made to further improve \nthe bill. I'd like to briefly summarize the bill as it presently is \nbeing proposed and how it will accomplish our goals of promoting the \nuse of ADR techniques.\n  First of all, the bill removes the term ``settlement negotiations'' \nfrom the group of ADR techniques listed in the 1989 act. This won't \ndecrease the effectiveness of the act as settlement negotiations are \nnot and have never been covered by the act as they do not use third \nparty neutrals in resolving conflicts. Abolition of the term merely \neliminates agency confusion as to whether settlement negotiation is a \nstatutorily supported ADR technique. It doesn't decrease the scope of \nthe original act. The bill also clarifies ADR techniques by \nsubstituting the term ``arbitration'' with ``Use of Ombuds, and Binding \nor Nonbinding Arbitration.''\n  The bill addresses agency confidentiality concerns by exempting all \ndispute resolution communications from Freedom of Information Act \ndisclosure. Although these communications have always been confidential \nby implication, the proposed bill makes this confidentiality express \nand clear.\n  The bill also deletes the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates from the promulgation of agency policy addressing the use of ADR \nand case management. This acknowledges the unfortunate demise of the \nAdministrative Conference and its consultation with agencies in \ndeveloping and promulgating agency ADR policies, and the maintenance of \nrosters of neutrals and arbitrators.\n  The bill makes it easier for agencies to acquire neutrals by \neliminating the requirement of full competitive procedures in obtaining \nexpert services and by allowing the acquisition of neutrals from \nnonprofit organizations. It also amends the Code to provide that \nagencies will consult with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation \nService on encouraging and facilitating agency use of ADR and \ndeveloping procedures on obtaining services of neutrals.\n  The bill expands agency use of services to include services and \nfacilities of State, local, and tribal governments. This will allow \nagencies to take advantage of all available support services in order \nto implement their ADR activities in the most effective and efficient \nmanner possible.\n  The bill eliminates the requirement that the validity of all contract \nclaims under $100,000 be certified by the contractor. This change \nbrings the 1989 ADR Act into conformance with the certification levels \nin the Contracts Disputes Act, thus encouraging the use of ADR \ntechniques in many small disputes where they may be particularly \nappropriate.\n  In addition, the bill deletes the so-called escape clause for binding \narbitration. Under the 1989 law, a Federal agency had the right to \noverride an ADR decision after it had been entered. These provisions \nwere inserted in the original act because the Department of Justice \nbelieved there was a constitutional problem regarding agency ability to \nultimately override ADR decisions. In essence, DOJ felt that it was \nnecessary to protect agency interests from the whim of non-judicial \ndecisionmakers. The Administrative Conference argued that parties were \nreluctant to go through ADR because they believed that an agency could \nopt out of a final decision and that effectively ADR rulings were \nnonbinding on the Government. Recently, DOJ has dropped these \nconstitutional concerns. Deletion of these provisions from the law will \nultimately further facilitate and promote the use of ADR, by making ADR \ntechniques more attractive to the private sector for solving agency \ndisputes.\n  Finally, the bill permanently authorizes the ADR Act by striking the \nsunset provision presently in the law and authorizing such sums as may \nbe necessary to carry out the act.\n  Mr. President, there has been much progress in the implementation and \nuse of ADR techniques in the Federal Government since I first \nintroduced the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act back in 1989. \nPassage of this amendment to the act will further this progress by \neliminating statutory barriers to ADR use and clarifying statutory \nlanguage. I hope my colleagues will support this initiative.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to add my support for this \nbill and in particular for a provision, in the amendment providing \npermanent reauthorization of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, \nthat addresses what I and others perceive to be the redundancy between \nthe requirements of this act and the Federal Advisory Committee Act \n[FACA].\n  The Negotiated Rulemaking Act, in section 3(a) (5 U.S.C. 564(a)) \nmandates a specific procedure for public notification of the \nestablishment of each negotiated rulemaking committee. This includes \npublication ``in the Federal Register and, as appropriate, in trade or \nother specialized publications'' of a notice of intent to form the \ncommittee, along with ``a description of the subject and scope of the \nrule to be developed, and the issues to be considered; a list of the \ninterests likely to be significantly affected by the rule; a list of \nthe persons proposed to represent such interests and the person or \npersons proposed to represent the agency; a proposed agenda and \nschedule for completing the work of the committee, including a target \ndate for publication by the agency of a proposed rule for notice and \ncomment; a description of the administrative support for the committee \nto be provided by the agency, including technical assistance; a \nsolicitation for comments on the proposal to establish the committee, \nand the proposed membership of the negotiated rulemaking committee; and \nan explanation of how a person may apply or nominate another person for \nmembership on the committee.'' After publication of this notice, there \nis a public comment period of at least 30 days.\n  In addition to these statutory requirements, negotiated rulemaking \ncommittees are subject to regulatory review requirements of \nPresidential Executive orders. Section 3(e) of President Clinton's \nExecutive Order No. 12866 defines ``regulatory action'' as ``any \nsubstantive action by an agency (normally published in the Federal \nRegister) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation \nof a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance \nnotices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking.'' \nThe notice of intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee, \nrequired by 5 U.S.C. 564(a)(1), would appear to be completely within \nthis definition, as it is analogous to an advanced notice of proposed \nrulemaking, and certainly a more ``substantive action by an agency * * \n* expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule'' than a mere \nnotice of inquiry. Thus, even a plan to publish such a notice, for a \n``significant regulatory action,'' must be disclosed to the Office of \nManagement and Budget [OMB] under section 6(a)(3)(A) of the Executive \nOrder. Given the very broad definition of ``significant regulatory \nactions'' in the Executive order, OMB is effectively capable of \ncapturing for review any negotiated rulemaking committee that it wants.\n  Quite apart from these requirements and reviews, negotiated \nrulemaking committees must meet a second, parallel set of disclosure \nand review requirements contained in section 9 of FACA, because \nnegotiated rulemaking committees are within the definition of an \n``advisory committee'' under FACA. Thus, the FACA requirements in \nsection 9 for ``consultation with the Administrator'' of the General \nServices Administration [GSA], ``timely notice in the Federal \nRegister,'' and filing of a charter containing a list of specific \ntopics that closely resembles the topics in section 3(a) of the \nNegotiated Rulemaking Act, quoted above, also apply to the negotiated \nrulemaking committees.\n  There is clearly duplication of effort here, without, in my opinion, \nmuch value added. First of all, if the President has put in place a \nmechanism, via Executive order, by which the Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs in OMB must be apprised of a mere plan to form a \nnegotiated rulemaking committee, what is the added value of a \nmandate for a separate consultation with the GSA under FACA? Surely the \nPresident's designee for Government-\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\nwide regulatory review and coordination, in OMB, is better situated to \nadvise agencies on the need for such committees than the GSA. Second, a \ncomparison of the typical advisory committee charter received in the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources with the typical Federal \nRegister notice for a negotiated rulemaking committee over the past \nyear shows that the latter is generally more detailed and informative \nthan the former. Finally, is it really necessary to have two separate \nlegal requirements for notice in the Federal Register of the same \nevent?\n\n  In addition to these overlapping requirements and processes, it is a \nfair question whether other specific requirements of FACA, for example, \nthe automatic 2-year sunset of advisory committees, make sense in the \ncontext of negotiated rulemaking. It is envisioned by the Negotiated \nRulemaking Act that negotiated rulemaking committees will routinely \nremain in existence until the publication of a final rule, which may \ntake several years. In this specific context, the one-size-fits-all \nrequirement of FACA for rechartering every 2 years, while sensible for \nadvisory committees that have nonspecific oversight-type \nresponsibilities, would seem somewhat arbitrary.\n  I am not alone in questioning this apparent duplication. I will ask \nunanimous consent to have printed at the end of this statement a \nstatement on the reauthorization of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act from \nthe American Bar Association [ABA] and the formal ABA position \nstatement on which it is based. The formal position of the ABA, jointly \nproposed by the ABA Standing Committee on Environmental Law, the \nSection of Administrative Law and Regulatory Practice, and the Section \nof Natural Resources, Energy, and Environmental Law, and passed by the \nABA House of Delegates, states that--\n\n       a federal agency should not be required to secure the \n     permission of the Office of Management and Budget or the \n     General Services Administration before it impanels a \n     committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act or the \n     Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, and that such agencies \n     must continue to comply with the substantive requirements of \n     the Federal Advisory Committee Act, including openness and \n     balance on committees.\n\n  These questions of duplication are important in the real world of how \nFederal agencies operate because there is already a considerable \ntransaction cost to the formation and running of advisory committees \nunder FACA. The formal chartering process under FACA, in practice, \ninvolves numerous levels of review within agencies and is often a time-\nconsuming bureaucratic step. It is perhaps justifiable to impose such \ntransaction costs to prevent the formation of generic advisory \ncommittees for which there is not a clear and compelling need. Perhaps, \nnotwithstanding the current interest in having more, rather than less, \nstakeholder input into Federal agency processes and decisions, it is \nthought appropriate to view advisory committees generally as a problem \nto be contained. But the whole point of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act \nis to promote the use of one specific type of advisory committee. The \nNegotiated Rulemaking Act creates no new authorities for agencies. If \nit were to expire on November 29, of this year, as it is currently \nscheduled to do under current law, agencies could still form such \ncommittees and use them in the promulgation of rules. Since, then, the \nwhole point of the act is to underscore Congress' intent that \nnegotiated rulemaking be more widely used, we should look carefully at \nthe question of administrative transaction costs in Federal agencies, \nto see if we have unwittingly put in place duplicative steps that make \nforming such committees seem to be more trouble than they are worth.\n  There is evidence that this is now the case. In the National Marine \nFisheries Service of the Department of Commerce, a proposal to form a \nnegotiated rulemaking committee to resolve issues between commercial \nand sport fishing interests regarding tuna fishing in the mid-Atlantic, \npublished in the Federal Register on February 1, has languished \nprecisely because the Department of Commerce, like other agencies such \nas the Department of Energy, has a process for reviewing proposals to \nform advisory committees under FACA that involves sending the proposal \nto numerous offices dispersed through the agency structure for \ncheckoffs on issues such as--in the case of Commerce--national security \nconcerns. Transiting this sort of administrative gauntlet is a daunting \ntask, even for hardened bureaucrats. Meanwhile, the underlying dispute \nthat prompted the proposal to form this committee has escalated, \nperhaps to the point where getting to a consensus result has been \nimperiled by the delay resulting from administrative inefficiency. If \nthe administrative duplication occasioned by the overlaps in these two \nlaws did not exist, the negotiated rulemaking committee could have \nstarted to meet in March of this year.\n  How representative is this case? It is hard to say. The permanent \nreauthorization of Negotiated Rulemaking Act was not covered in the \nhearings on this bill, so this problem was not explored on the record. \nGiven this, I appreciate the willingness of the sponsors of this bill \nto address my concerns that a far greater problem may exist. Subsection \n(e) of the amendment provides for study, in the Office of Management \nand Budget, of this question, so that a complete picture of the problem \ncan be obtained, and so that recommendations can be formulated. I would \nhope that the OMB review, in the spirit of reinventing Government, will \ntake a careful look at such barriers and proposed best practices to \nagencies to facilitate the expeditious formation of advisory committees \ngenerally.\n  I thank the sponsors of the bill, again, for their assistance and \nwillingness to address this issue. I hope that if, in the course of the \nOMB study, the administration identifies solutions to some of these \nissues that require legislative action by Congress, that the sponsors \nwill be willing to act on such suggestions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material I earlier referred to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 1996.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Governmental Affairs Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I write on behalf of the American Bar \n     Association to urge that the Administrative Dispute \n     Resolution Act and the Negotiated Rulemaking Act be \n     reauthorized on a permanent basis. We are concerned that the \n     decision regarding reassignment of negotiated rulemaking \n     responsibilities formerly carried out by the Administrative \n     Conference of the United States will prevent the \n     reauthorization of these two important laws.\n       These two laws form the framework for consensus building in \n     government decision-making. The Administrative Dispute \n     Resolution Act authorizes agencies to use a full array of \n     alternative dispute resolution processes, if the parties \n     agree to do so. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act provides a \n     framework for negotiating rules among representatives of the \n     affected interests. We have reviewed the draft amendment on \n     encouraging negotiated rulemaking and offer the following \n     comments.\n       (1) The ABA endorses the prompt, permanent reauthorization \n     of these two laws.\n       (2) The Association would be pleased to work with you to \n     determine an appropriate alternative placement of the \n     consultative function under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act.\n       (3) The ABA recommends an amendment to the draft to direct \n     that federal agencies not be required to secure the \n     permission of the Office of Management and Budget or the \n     General Service Administration before impanelling a committee \n     under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act or the Administrative \n     Dispute Resolution Act. The Association believes the \n     requirement that agencies secure permission to establish \n     committees has inhibited the wider use of these important, \n     consensus based process. However, Congress should continue to \n     require that such agencies must comply with the substantive \n     requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, including \n     openness and balance on committees.\n       The Negotiated Rulemaking Act and the Administrative \n     Dispute Resolution Act encourage federal agencies to explore \n     the use of mediation and consensus building to reduce costs \n     and increase responsiveness to public concerns. We look \n     forward to working with you to ensure that these laws are \n     reauthorized.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert D. Evans.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  American Bar Association, Standing Committee on Environmental Law; \nSection of Administrative Law & Regulatory Practice; Section of Natural \n                 Resources, Energy & Environmental Law\n\n\n                             recommendation\n\n       Be it Resolved, That the public participation provisions of \n     local, state and federal environmental laws and international \n     environmental agreements and treaties should recognize and \n     express the principle that the\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n     public and all affected interests should be provided \n     meaningful and effective involvement and should be expected \n     to participate in consensus building efforts to ensure that \n     government decision-making regarding the administration, \n     regulation, and enforcement of environmental laws is open, \n     fair, efficient and credible; Be it further\n       Resolved, That the public participation provisions of \n     local, state and federal environmental laws should include \n     express authority allowing government agencies to choose \n     innovative public participation, stakeholder-involvement and \n     shared decision-making models, including site-specific, \n     negotiated consensus-building processes and negotiated \n     rulemaking, which involve all affected stakeholders, such as \n     citizens, potentially responsible parties, and affected \n     federal, tribal, state, territorial and local governments; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That federal agencies should use more fully the \n     Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and the Negotiated \n     Rulemaking Act for making environmental decisions, and state \n     agencies should follow similar procedures permitted under \n     generally applicable provisions of administrative law; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That Congress should reauthorize the \n     Administrative Dispute Resolution Act and the Negotiated \n     Rulemaking Act on a permanent basis, and, in doing so, \n     Congress should revise provisions that inhibit their wider \n     use to resolve environmental matters by clarifying:\n       (1) that the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act \n     authorizes the use of the full range of dispute resolution \n     processes for making administrative decisions, including \n     general consensus building and the resolution of issues \n     between private parties that otherwise would be decided by \n     the environmental agency;\n       (2) that the decision of an arbitrator, where applicable, \n     should be final when issued, without the authority of an \n     agency to unilaterally override such decision;\n       (3) that communications between a party and the neutral \n     should be protected from disclosure except for the \n     circumstances defined in the Administrative Dispute \n     Resolution Act; to that extent the Administrative Dispute \n     Resolution Act should be regarded as a Section (b)(3) \n     exemption under the Freedom of Information Act; and\n       (4) that a federal agency should not be required to secure \n     the permission of the Office of Management and Budget or the \n     General Services Administration before it impanels a \n     committee under the Negotiated Rulemaking Act or the \n     Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, and that such agencies \n     must continue to comply with the substantive requirements of \n     the Federal Advisory Committee Act, including openness and \n     balance on committees; be it further\n       Resolved, That the procedures described in the Negotiated \n     Rulemaking Act should be used for making policy decisions \n     under environmental statutes; be it finally\n       Resolved, That the framework established under the \n     Negotiated Rulemaking Act and the Administrative Dispute \n     Resolution Act provide the means by which the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA''), community and \n     business interests, state, tribal and local governments, and \n     environmental and other non-governmental organizations can \n     reach agreement on the appropriate issues. For example, in \n     addition to existing alternative dispute resolution \n     provisions in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), potentially \n     responsible parties are encouraged to use the Administrative \n     Dispute Resolution Act to make allocation decisions, while \n     environmental agencies are encouraged to use the Negotiated \n     Rulemaking Act for making policy decisions. In doing so, EPA \n     should appoint a single, relatively senior official to \n     represent the agency and various components of its staff in \n     such negotiations, and policy negotiations and allocation \n     decisions should be coordinated to the extent appropriate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4045\n\n(Purpose: To reauthorize the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand that there is an amendment at \nthe desk in behalf of Senators Levin and Grassley. I ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott], for Mr. Levin, for \n     himself and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4045.\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 11. REAUTHORIZATION OF NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING ACT OF \n                   1990.\n\n       (a) Permanent Reauthorization.--Section 5 of the Negotiated \n     Rulemaking Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-648; 5 U.S.C. 561 \n     note) is repealed.\n       (b) Closure of Administrative Conference.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 569 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (A) by amending the section heading to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 569. Encouraging negotiated rulemaking'';\n\n     and\n\n       (B) by striking out subsections (a) through (g) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(a) The President shall designate an agency or designate \n     or establish an interagency committee to facilitate and \n     encourage agency use of negotiated rulemaking.

Mr. President, what has just cleared the Senate is a \nvery important sense of the Senate that has unanimously passed that \nwill help the areas of our country that have been devastated by this \ndrought. In fact, this is the Gramm-Hutchison-Domenici-Bingaman \nresolution.\n  It says we encourage the Secretary of Agriculture to allow some of \nthe counties--because of a regulatory snafu, a technicality--that are \nnot now able to apply for livestock feed assistance under its old \nprogram to do so. The bulk of the counties in New Mexico, Texas, \nOklahoma, and Kansas that are affected by this will have that \nopportunity. But because of the technicality, they have not been able \nto clear all of the counties. So we are asking the Secretary of \nAgriculture to do this for us. It is very important to the farmers and \nranchers of these States.\n  Mr. President, this drought is hurting not only the farmers and \nranchers of these States, but the consumers are going to see higher \nprices as well. We are in a situation now where farmers are not able to \nmake loans because the drought has caused them either to be unable to \nplant or to be unable to have anything if they have planted. It also \ncauses a great hardship on people who are raising cattle. There is no \nfeed for the cattle because we have not been able to raise the hay.\n  It is a terrible situation, and I just appreciate very much all of my \ncolleagues helping us with this sense of the Senate. I hope this will \nencourage the Secretary of Agriculture to help us through this \ntechnicality and help these farmers and ranchers make it this year so \nthey can continue to provide the food and be the breadbasket of America \nnext year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6163-2", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO EMERGENCY LIVESTOCK FEED ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to be asked to \nconsider a repackaged version of last year's misguided Republican \nbudget. It has not improved with age. This budget plan, like last \nyear's, undermines basic protections for children and the elderly, \nraises taxes on the working poor, and denies educational opportunity to \nmillions of Americans, all to pay for the lavish tax breaks for the \nwealthy. If this budget plan becomes law, Medicare would be cut by $167 \nbillion over 6 years, Medicaid would be cut by $72 billion at the \nFederal level and some $250 billion in the States by the year 2002, \nwith the change in the formulas which have been developed in this \nproposal.\n  Education will be cut $25 billion. Yesterday, I addressed the Senate \non this issue, pointing out what a mistake this really is, when we find \nout that the number of children who are going to be going to the high \nschools in this country is going to increase by 8 percent. We are going \nto go up to about 53 or 54 million children in the next 2 years. The \nnumber of traditional college-age students will increase by 12 percent. \nAs a result, even a current services budget is failing to adjust to \nthose particular\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nnew realities and the funding that is included in this budget fails by \nabout $20 billion to even come close to it. This is in contrast to the \nPresident's program that continues our ongoing commitment in the field \nof education.\n  Under this Republican budget, the earned-income tax credit will be \ncut $18 billion. That is the tax credit which is available to working \nfamilies, phased out at approximately $28,000 to $30,000, and \nprincipally available to working families with children. All of these \ncuts would be made in order to bestow a lavish windfall of $122 billion \nto $180 billion, as Mr. Kasich has pointed out in the House of \nRepresentatives, for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in the \nNation.\n\n  Mr. President, 42 percent of the mandatory cuts in this misguided \nbudget come from programs that help the neediest families and \nindividuals in the Nation; 47 percent of the tax breaks will go to \nthose making over $100,000 a year. Meanwhile, corporate special \ninterests are not asked to ante up a single nickel. The corporate \nwelfare part of our budget, which is expenditures which otherwise could \nbe used for deficit reduction, will be over $4 trillion over the period \nof the next 7 years--$4 trillion. Yet there is not $1 of savings from \ntax expenditures in the Republican budget. There is not one expenditure \nthat is out there in the Federal Tax Code that is being eliminated by \nthe Republican budget program.\n  We hear so often about how we have too many programs, programs that \ndo not work, and many of us have been trying to address that issue. We \nhad a good program to try to deal with the proliferation of job \ntraining programs under an excellent bipartisan bill that Senator \nKassebaum and I worked on. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly in this \nCongress. We still have hopes about that program. We have been \nconsolidating health programs and consolidating education programs in \nthe period of recent years. But we cannot find, in the Republican \nbudget, 1 nickel to save from some inefficient tax expenditures that \nmay be enticing American corporations to go overseas and take American \njobs with them--not one.\n  The President's program has $40 billion in savings. It seems to me we \nought to be able to go up even significantly above that proposal. But \nthere is not one--not one--in the Republican program.\n\n  Medicare cuts are a prime example of the Republican priorities. They \nare no less devastating simply because they sound familiar. The \nMedicare cuts have not improved with age. Last year the Republican plan \nwas a thinly veiled attack on the entire concept of Medicare. It was \ndesigned to cause Medicare to ``wither on the vine,'' in the words of \nSpeaker Gingrich, by forcing senior citizens to give up their family \ndoctor and join the private insurance programs.\n  When Republicans took up the issues of Medicare cuts last year, they \nproposed to cut the program by $270 billion--three times more than the \namount the Medicare trustees said was needed to protect the solvency of \nthe trust fund.\n  You cannot listen to a speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate without \nour good Republican friends saying we have to pass this in order to \ndeal with the potential bankruptcy of the trust fund. The fact is, they \nare cutting the Medicare Program three times the amount that the \ntrustees say is necessary in order to protect the solvency of the trust \nfunds.\n  This year, the Republicans are proposing to cut $167 billion from \nMedicare. By contrast, the President's plan cuts it $116 billion, 44 \npercent less. Yet it guarantees the Medicare solvency for a decade and \nfunds Medicare at the level necessary to assure that quality care will \nbe available for senior citizens when they need it.\n  Even worse, Republicans support an inflexible ceiling on Medicare \nspending. Consequently, if inflation is higher or medical needs are \ngreater than anticipated, Medicare spending will not go up as it \nshould, and many senior citizens will be out of luck and out of care.\n  The President's plan has the right savings and right priorities. It \nprovides ample time for Congress and the administration to work \ntogether to find the longer run solutions we need to deal honestly with \nMedicare's problems and preserve the quality of health care for the \nelderly.\n  In fact, we can take many steps to reduce Medicare costs without \ncutting the quality of benefits, without raising premiums, but these \nsteps are not what the Republicans are proposing.\n  Another false Republican argument in defense of their Medicare cuts \nis that the reductions are not really cuts, because the total amount of \nMedicare spending will continue to grow. That argument was addressed, I \nthought, very effectively by the ranking minority member of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Exon, last evening.\n  But every household in America knows that if the cost of your rent \nand the cost of your utilities and the cost of food go up and your \nincome stays the same or goes up less rapidly, you have taken a real \ncut in your living standard, and that is what is at issue.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, the number of frail elderly, those \nwho are 85 years old, is going to double in the period of the next 5 \nyears, let alone the total number of elderly that is going to grow. \nThis is a real national phenomenon, a demographic phenomenon. We are \nblessed to have our parents with longer and extended lives, and to try \nand play shell games, in terms of the quality of care for our seniors, \nI think, is particularly unacceptable when we are balancing that with \ntax breaks for wealthy individuals.\n  Republicans speak of a cut in defense, when defense spending does not \nincrease by enough to offset rising costs. Apparently, the same \nRepublican logic does not apply to spending on Medicare that applies to \nspending on guns, tanks and other weapons. A cut is a cut is a cut, \nwhether it is in Medicare, Social Security, or national defense.\n  Even more damaging than the loss of billions of dollars that \nRepublicans would slash from Medicare is their attempt to turn it over \nto the private insurance industry. The Republican budget contains a \nnumber of changes to force senior citizens to give up their own doctors \nand join private insurance plans.\n  Once they are forced into these plans, senior citizens will be \nstripped of many of the protections they enjoy today--protections \nagainst overcharges by doctors and other health providers, what we call \ndouble billing. The doctors, rather than taking what is allocated to \nthem under the Medicare Program, say, ``Pay in full.''\n  Under current law, the seniors are protected from paying additional \nkinds of costs, but there is no such requirement if they go into \nprivate health insurance. They could be billed once and then be charged \nagain. That is a problem that is readily understood. We thought we \naddressed that in amendments that I and others had offered earlier on \nthe budget resolution, but those protections were discarded in the \nconference.\n  There were protections against premium gouging and profiteering by \ninsurance companies, protection of their right to keep their own family \ndoctor and go to the specialist of their choice.\n  Republicans claim they want to offer senior citizens a choice, but \nthis is a choice no senior citizen should be forced to make.\n  I offered a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that was adopted by the \nfull Senate stating that reconciliation should not include proposals to \neliminate these protections. It specifically reaffirmed that private \ninsurance plans should be prohibited from leveling premium surcharges \nfor basic Medicare services, and the doctors should not be allowed to \nstrap on extra charges to seniors participating in such plans. That \nproposal was dropped by the Republicans in the House-Senate conference. \nThe Republican assault on Medicare is painfully clear, and the American \npeople will never support this anti-elderly special interest agenda.\n\n  Republicans deny that their Medicare cuts will fund tax breaks for \nthe wealthy. This time the leopard claims that it really has changed \nits spots, but the Republican budget clearly anticipates $60 billion in \nrevenue increases from tax extenders and closing of selected corporate \nloopholes in order to fund $60 billion in new taxes for the undeserving \nrich. Without those lavish tax breaks, they would not need to cut \nMedicare by $167 billion. The Medicare trust fund should not be a slush \nfund for tax breaks for the rich.\n  There are appropriate ways to reduce Medicare spending and improve \nthe\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nquality at the same time. Mr. President, we have had extensive hearings \nin this body, chaired by our friend and colleague Senator Harkin, that \nhas reviewed in very careful detail the billions of dollars that can be \nsaved under Medicare by dealing more effectively with fraud and abuse. \nWe can save tens of billions of dollars from unnecessary \nhospitalization--20 to 30 percent of hospitalizations are unnecessary--\nby trying to provide preventive services to keep the seniors at home or \nin a setting so they can be treated with good quality care in less \ncostly settings.\n  We are talking about tens of billions of dollars that can be saved \nfrom avoiding adverse drug reaction. When our seniors are taking \nprescription drugs which are in conflict with each other and cause new \nillness and sickness, there are ways of dealing with this issue that \ncan save the seniors enormous distress and pain and sickness and \nillness and plus save our system billions of dollars. But we have not \neven attempted to consider any of these items in this program.\n  The harsh cuts in Medicare contained in the Republican budget are a \nrepudiation of our historic commitment to Social Security, because the \ndistinction between Medicare and Social Security is a false one.\n  Medicare is part of the same compact between the Government and the \npeople as Social Security. The compact says, ``Contribute during your \nworking years, and we will guarantee basic income and health security \nin your retirement years.''\n  No budget plan that purports to be part of a Contract With America \nshould break America's contract with the elderly. It is bad enough to \npropose these deep cuts in Medicare at all. It is even worse to make \nthese cuts in order to pay for an undeserved, unneeded tax break for \nthe wealthiest Americans.\n  We do not have to destroy Medicare in order to save it. Congress will \nnever allow the Medicare trust fund to become bankrupt. I know that. \nThe American people know it. It is time for Republicans to stop raiding \nMedicare, and join in sensible steps to improve and strengthen it for \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to address the Senate. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/06/12/senate-section/article/S6164-7", "month": "06", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
