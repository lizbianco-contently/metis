We long for our \nhearts to be free of the admixtures of pride, selfishness, \nmanipulation, lust for power, jealousy, envy, negative criticism, and \nresentment. We reaffirm our desire to be single minded for You, God--to \nput You first in our life and and make an unreserved commitment that \nenables us to rivet our attention upon You.\n  Today, we accept the gifts of Your Holy spirit and live \nsupernaturally. We will gratefully be a channel for the flow of the \nfruit of Your spirit--love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, \nfaithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. We pray that we will see \nmore clearly Your presence in the world, in circumstances, in people, \nand in the new person You are creating in us. We want to start this day \nwith pure hearts so that we may behold more of the wonder of Your grace \nand goodness. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

There will now be 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided, on the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, what is the status of matters in order? \nIs the first amendment the Simpson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Is that 2 minutes or 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment is to go \nback to the 1980 Refugee Act. The 1980 Refugee Act provided for case-\nby-case determination of all refugees.\n  In 1989, we had the Lautenberg amendment, which was very appropriate \nat that time. It simply said we would presume that people who were \nJewish or Angelical Christians or Pentacostals would be refugees. That \nwas appropriate when the Soviet Union was our enemy.\n  In this bill, we give them $640 million. They are a G-7 partner. They \nare our ally.\n  Now we are still using 48,000 precious numbers out of an entire \nnumber of 78,000 to give to people who are presumed to be refugees--we \ngive them the status. Some of them wait a year before they even come. \nThen we find it being misused by fraud and abuse with the Russian mafia \ncoming through the system with regard to this presumption of refugee \nstatus.\n  We ought to go back to case by case, and no one will be left out.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I hope that my colleagues will vote \nagainst the amendment by Senator Simpson. He wants to strike out \nextension of current law, which frankly I think is essential. When we \nlook at the new Russia, the former Soviet Union, we see, though they \napparently are democratized in many areas, the fact of the matter is \nthat an integral part of the political platform in the last election \nwas to rail against Jews and other religions not satisfactory to them.\n  Zhirinovsky, the head of the Nationalist Party, said that the way the \ncountry has to resolve its problems is to get rid of its Jews.\n  Lebed, the now National Security Adviser to President Yeltsin, made \nderogatory remarks about Jews and about Mormons, calling them a \n``scum'' religion.\n  So, if that tells you where we are going, I hope that my colleagues \nwill vote against this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Wyoming.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5078, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The question occurs on \namendment No. 5078, as amended. There are 2 minutes evenly divided on \nthe amendment.\n  The Senate will come to order. Please remove all conversations to the \nCloakroom.\n  Will the Senators please remove audible conversations to the \nCloakroom? The Chair requests that audible conversations be removed to \nthe Cloakroom.\n  The Senate will come to order. Please remove audible conversations to \nthe Cloakroom.\n  The Chair requests that audible conversations be removed to the \nCloakroom so the Senate may come to order.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is amazing to me that the \nPresiding Officer of the U.S. Senate requests silence of the Senate and \nis ignored by so many people who blatantly continue to talk while the \nPresiding Officer has now for 3 minutes requested silence.\n  I hope the Presiding Officer takes whatever measures are necessary to \nget quiet in this body. It is unbelievable we would not pay attention \nto the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair appreciates the cooperation of the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The Chair is asking that audible conversations be removed to the \nCloakroom so the Senate can proceed with its business.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Lieberman amendment, upon which we \nare about to vote, doubles aid to North Korea from last year's level \nfrom $13 million to $25 million. I expect a lot of Senators did not \neven know we were providing aid to North Korea. To provide this aid, \nPresident Clinton will have to say the fact that North Korea is a \nterrorist state doesn't matter.\n\n  In addition, we know under the current agreement that the North has \ndiverted oil, and nothing in this amendment will prevent that from \ncontinuing to happen.\n  Finally, let me say, Mr. President, the House is strongly opposed to \nan increase from $13 to $25 million, which is encompassed in this \namendment, and this is going to be an extraordinarily difficult \nposition to sustain in conference, even if this amendment is approved.\n  I hope that my colleagues will not approve this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this amendment, now amended in the \nsecond degree by Senators Murkowski and McCain, would enable the \nPresident to fulfill the promise made as part of the agreed framework \nsigned in October 1994 to avoid the escalating probability of the North \nKoreans attaining nuclear capability and perhaps entering into a \nconflict with South Korea.\n  A conflict, a major regional conflict on the Korean Peninsula, as \nSecretary Perry would say, would put countless lives in jeopardy and \nwould cost billions of dollars.\n  For $25 million, we have the opportunity to continue an agreement \nwhich, thus far, the North Koreans, at least as to the nuclear \ncomponent, have kept.\n  I yield 15 seconds to Senator Murkowski, and then the remainder of \nthe time to Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I assure my \ncolleagues, if we don't have adequate funding, there is no point in \npursuing this. That is the problem with the proposal that has been \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky. This requires full compliance \nwith all provisions of the agreed framework, no significant diversion \nof U.S. assistance of food or oil, and full cooperation on storage of \nspent fuel.\n  If we are going to do this right, we have to give them the tools to \ndo it. We can't cut it in half and expect it to be done right. That is \nwhat we are up against here.\n  It is a significant foreign policy question. I am very pleased \nSenator McCain, Senator Lieberman and others feel there is a job to be \ndone over there and we can't take it lightly and we can't just cut \nfunding in half.\n  I might add, there is a full accounting of MIA's in this thing. There \nare more MIA's in North Korea, about 8,400, in fact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are trying very hard to put the nuclear \ngenie back into the bottle in North Korea. General Shalikashvili and \nthe uniformed military strongly support the framework agreement that \nwill allow us to do that. If we cut the funds to implement that \nagreement, instead of putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle, we \nwill be breaking that bottle.\n  I hope the Lieberman amendment is adopted with an overwhelming vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 5078, as amended. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 73, nays 27, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 247 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grams\n     Harkin\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--27\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Faircloth\n     Frahm\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Nickles\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n  So the amendment (No. 5078) as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n    international military education and training [imet]--indonesia\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, Senator McConnell, and the ranking \nDemocrat, Senator Leahy, for the fine job they've done putting together \nthe fiscal year 1997 foreign operations appropriations bill. This \nlegislation is very important in helping the United States to influence \nevents and protect American interests around the world, and I know that \nthe bill takes a great deal of hard work on the part of Senators \nMcConnell and Leahy, and their staffs, to move it to the floor.\n  One of the important functions funded by this legislation is the \nInternational Military Education and Training, or IMET, Program. Title \nIII of this bill provides $40 million for IMET for fiscal year 1997. \nAccording to the Defense Department, IMET has three principal \nobjectives:\n  First, to encourage mutually beneficial relations and increased \nunderstanding between the United States and foreign countries in \nfurtherance of the goals of international peace and security.\n  Second, to improve the ability of participating foreign countries to \nutilize their resources, including defense articles and services \nobtained from the United States, with maximum effectiveness, thereby \ncontributing to greater self-reliance by such countries; and,\n  Third, to increase the awareness of nationals of foreign countries \nparticipating in such activities of basic issues involving \ninternationally recognized human rights.\n  In fiscal year 1995, 109 countries participated in IMET.\n  The pending legislation includes a few restrictions on use of IMET \nfunds: None of the funds appropriated are available for either Zaire or \nGuatemala, and Indonesia is eligible for what is described as an \nexpanded IMET Program. With regard to Indonesia specifically, on page \n129 the bill says,\n\n       *-*-* funds appropriated under this heading for grant \n     financed military education and training for Indonesia may \n     only be available for expanded military education and \n     training.\n\n  I'm not quite sure why the phrase ``expanded'' is used, though, \nbecause the expanded IMET Program is in fact highly restrictive, \nallowing IMET funds for Indonesia only to be used for human rights-\nrelated training.\n\n  I am opposed to this provision of the bill. I know that those who \nsupport restrictions on IMET for Indonesia do so out of concern for the \nhuman rights situation in Indonesia. And there is reason for concern, \nthough we should take note of the fact that the Indonesians have \nundertaken to improve their policies and actions with regard to human \nrights. Is their room for continued improvement? Of course there is, \nbut excluding Indonesia from the benefits of full IMET participation is \nnot the best way to help Indonesians make progress on human rights. I \nalso wonder, though, why it is that of all the countries participating \nin IMET, only Indonesia is singled out for restrictions. Think about \nthe other 108 fiscal year 1995 unrestricted IMET participants, Burundi, \nEthiopia, Cambodia, Russia, and Algeria. Are we saying they don't have \nany human rights problems?\n  IMET is of vital importance in helping military officers from other \ncountries to learn from the example of the United States, to help \nsensitize these officers to the proper role of the military and the \nrule of law in a civil society. Bringing military officers from \nIndonesia for human rights training, under the expanded IMET, can be \nhelpful. But it would be more helpful to bring Indonesian officers to \nthe United States for full IMET training, thereby exposing these \nofficers to daily exchanges with their American counterparts. If we \nwant to help correct human rights abuse, it makes more sense to take \nofficers, both junior and field grade officers, and involve them in our \nmilitary training, side by side, with our own officers.\n  As an example, every year we send hundreds of our own lieutenants \nthrough the infantry officers basic course at Fort Benning, GA. \nIncluded in these classes, as full members, are officers sent from \nother countries as part of the IMET Program. These foreign officers get \nhuman rights training along with the American officers in the infantry \nofficers basic course, and they're also taught respect for the rule of \nlaw and the proper relations between military and civil authorities in \na free society. The most important part of this experience for foreign \nmilitary officers is not what they're taught in a classroom, though \nthat is valuable. More important is the involvement in our military \nculture, being treated as equals of the American lieutenants in the \ncourse and learning by the example their American friends. They learn \nthe role of the military in a free society, and also the \nresponsibilities of each and every officer to that society.\n  Indonesia is important to the United States. We shouldn't ignore the \nfact that it is the world's fourth most populous country, and we can't \nignore the fact that our Navy must transit its sea lanes in seeking to \nmove rapidly between the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. But this is \nmore than simply a question of what is strictly in the national \ninterest of the United States, though that alone should be sufficient. \nIndonesia is also becoming an important force for peace and stability \nin Asia, something that is also very important to the United States. \nThe growing friendship between the United States and Indonesia is not \nsomething that should be taken lightly or for granted.\n  During my recent visit to Indonesia our Ambassador, Stapleton Roy, \nwas clear in expressing his desire for full access to IMET for \nIndonesia. I learned from my visit that when human rights problems \noccur, invariably it is not American-trained officers involved, but the \nofficers not trained in the United States.\n  If we are serious about helping our friends in Indonesia preaching to \nthem about human rights is not the most productive use of our resources \nor their time. By including Indonesia in the normal IMET program, they \nlearn about human rights by word and deed; we create lasting friendship \nthat aren't based upon lecturing, and build support for and orientation \ntoward United States policies; and, in so doing, we advance United \nStates bilateral and regional interests.\n  Let's be consistent. Either all nations with human rights problems \nshould be excluded from full IMET participation, or none should. \nSingling out Indonesia for this treatment is not only wrong; it creates \nsuspicion and misunderstanding of our reliability as a leader.\n  I understand that this has been a contentious conference issue for \nthis bill in the past and will not offer an amendment this year to \nstrike the restrictive bill language on Indonesian IMET participation. \nI hope, though, that during the year the issue of how nations are \npermitted to participate in IMET will receive close scrutiny, and that \nconsideration be given to supporting a bill that eliminates this unfair \nand ill-conceived restriction.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nfiscal year 1997 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act.\n  I am very pleased that this bill continues to fund United States \ncommitments to our Camp David Accord partners, Israel and Egypt. \nForeign assistance to our Middle East allies is a critical tool needed \nto keep the peace process moving ahead. Even as our overall foreign \nassistance budget declines, I believe it is imperative to maintain our \naid programs to our Camp David partners at current levels.\n  I strongly supported the Dorgan-Hatfield code of conduct amendment \nand was very disappointed that the Senate voted to table it. The United \nStates is now the world's leading arms exporter. Too often, arms \nexported by the United States have been used for internal repression by \ndictators. On many occasions, arms exports have been resold to hostile \nthird parties and used directly against U.S. interests. The Dorgan-\nHatfield proposal would have imposed reasonable restrictions on \nexports. I will continue to work with the amendment's sponsors to move \nthe code of conduct forward.\n  I also supported the McConnell-Leahy sanctions on Burma that were \nincluded in the committee reported version of the bill. Unfortunately, \nthese sanctions were eliminated by the\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\nCohen amendment. It is universally agreed that the current regime in \nBurma is illegitimate, undemocratic, and abusive of even the most basic \nhuman rights standards. It is a virtual certainty that every dollar \nfinding its way to the ruling party in Burma will be used to oppress \nthe legitimately elected government. The United States must not \nparticipate in this kind of unconscionable oppression in any way.\n  I also wish to explain my vote against the Helms amendment on U.N. \ntaxation. Of course, I do not believe that the United Nations has the \nauthority to tax U.S. citizens, nor should it. I opposed the amendment \nbecause I view it as totally unnecessary and as a gratuitous attack on \nvaluable U.N. programs, such as development assistance and UNICEF.\n  I would like to call attention to committee report language urging \nthe U.S. Agency for International Development to fund microenterprise \nprograms at their current levels. I supported earmarking funds for this \npurpose, but understand the managers reluctance to earmark. \nMicroenterprise has been a remarkable success in the developing world. \nThe small local banks created through microenterprise programs truly \nhave the ability to wipe out poverty in their regions. I want to add my \nvoice to that of the committee and urge AID, in the strongest possible \nterms, to allocate the maximum possible level of funding to \nmicroenterprise programs.\n  Finally, I wish to note my opposition to the Coverdell amendment, \nwhich would increase funding for counterdrug programs at the expense of \ndevelopment assistance and U.N.-sponsored international organizations, \nsuch as UNICEF and UNFPA. I support the counterdrug program, but would \nnote that its budget had been increased dramatically in the committee \nreported bill. Development assistance, on the other hand, has been \nslashed. The Coverdell amendment would exacerbate the existing \nshortfall in development assistance, and thus reduce our influence and \nleadership position in the world.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield back my 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back my 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the committee substitute, \nas amended, is agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Kentucky \nthat the yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient is second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Congress finds that progress on the peace \n     process in the Middle East is vitally important to United \n     States security interests in the region. The Congress \n     recognizes that, in fulfilling its obligations under the \n     Treaty of Peace Between the Arab Republic of Egypt and the \n     State of Israel, done at Washington on March 26, 1979, Israel \n     incurred severe economic burdens. Furthermore, the Congress \n     recognizes that an economically and militarily secure Israel \n     serves the security interests of the United States, for a \n     secure Israel is an Israel which has the incentive and \n     confidence to continue pursuing the peace process. Therefore, \n     the Congress declares that, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, it is the policy and the intention of the \n     United States that the funds provided in annual \n     appropriations for the Economic Support Fund which are \n     allocated to Israel shall not be less than the annual debt \n     repayment (interest and principal) from Israel to the United \n     States Government in recognition that such a principle serves \n     United States interests in the region.\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\n   PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR ABORTIONS AND INVOLUNTARY STERILIZATION\n\n       Sec. 518.

(a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n       (1) The United States and Japan share a long and important \n     bilateral relationship which serves as an anchor of peace and \n     stability in the Asia Pacific region, an alliance which was \n     reaffirmed at the recent summit meeting between President \n     Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto in Tokyo.\n       (2) The Japanese economy has experienced difficulty over \n     the past few years, demonstrating that it is no longer \n     possible for Japan, the world's second largest economy, to \n     use exports as the sole engine of economic growth, but that \n     the Government of Japan must promote deregulation of its \n     domestic economy in order to increase economic growth.\n       (3) Japan is the second largest insurance market in the \n     world and the largest life insurance market in the world.\n       (4) The share of foreign insurance in Japan is less than 3 \n     percent, and large Japanese life and non-life insurers \n     dominate the market.\n       (5) The Government of Japan has had as its stated policy \n     for several years the deregulation and liberalization of the \n     Japan insurance market, and has developed and adopted a new \n     insurance business law as a means of achieving this publicly \n     stated objective of liberalization and deregulation.\n       (6) The Governments of Japan and the United States \n     concluded in October of 1994 the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement, following more than one and one-half \n     years of negotiations, in which Agreement the Government of \n     Japan reiterated its intent to deregulate and liberalize its \n     market.\n       (7) The Government of Japan in June of 1995 undertook \n     additional obligations to provide greater foreign access and \n     liberalization to its market through its schedule of \n     insurance obligations during the financial services \n     negotiations of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n       (8) The United States insurance industry is the most \n     competitive in the world, operates successfully throughout \n     the world, and thus could be expected to achieve higher \n     levels of market access and profitability under a more open, \n     deregulated and liberalized Japanese market.\n       (9) Despite more than one and one-half years since the \n     conclusion of the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement, \n     despite more than one year since Japan undertook new \n     commitments under the WTO, despite the entry into force on \n     April 1, 1996, of the new Insurance Business Law, the \n     Japanese market remains closed and highly regulated and thus \n     continues to deny fair and open treatment for foreign \n     insurers, including competitive United States insurers.\n       (10) The non-implementation of the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement is a matter of grave importance to the \n     United States Government.\n       (11) Dozens of meetings between the United States Trade \n     Representative and the Ministry of Finance have taken place \n     during the past year.\n       (12) President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Secretary \n     Rubin, Secretary Christopher, Secretary Kantor, Ambassador \n     Barshefsky have all indicated to their counterparts in the \n     Government of Japan the importance of this matter to the \n     United States.\n       (13) The United States Senate has written repeatedly to the \n     Minister of Finance and the Ambassador of Japan.\n       (14) Despite all of these efforts and indications of \n     importance, the Ministry of Finance has failed to implement \n     the United States-Japan Insurance Agreement.\n       (15) Several deadlines have already passed for resolution \n     of this issue with the latest deadline set for July 31, 1996.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Japan \n     should immediately and without further delay completely and \n     fully comply with all provisions of the United States-Japan \n     Insurance Agreement, including most especially those which \n     require the Ministry of Finance to deregulate and liberalize \n     the primary sectors of the Japanese market, and those which \n     insure that the current position of foreign insurers in Japan \n     will not be jeopardized until primary sector deregulation has \n     been achieved, and a three-year period has elapsed; and\n       (2) failing satisfactory resolution of this matter on or \n     before July 31, 1996, the United States Government should use \n     any and all resources at its disposal to bring about full and \n     complete compliance with the Agreement.\n\n\n          sense of congress regarding the conflict in chechnya\n\n       Sec. 583. (a) Congressional Declaration.--The Congress \n     declares that the continuation of the conflict in Chechnya, \n     the continued killing of innocent civilians, and the ongoing \n     violation of human rights in that region are unacceptable.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress hereby--\n       (1) condemns Russia's infringement of the cease-fire \n     agreements in Chechnya;\n       (2) calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     bring an immediate halt to offensive military actions in \n     Chechnya and requests President Yeltsin to honor his decree \n     of June 25, 1996 concerning the withdrawal of Russian armed \n     forces from Chechnya;\n       (3) encourages the two warring parties to resume \n     negotiations without delay so as to find a peaceful political \n     solution to the Chechen problem; and\n       (4) supports the Organization for Security and Cooperation \n     in Europe and its representatives in Chechnya in its efforts \n     to mediate in Chechnya.\n\n  requirement for disclosure of foreign aid in report of secretary of \n                                 state\n\n       Sec. 584.

(a) The Senate finds that:\n       (1) The political situation in the African nation of \n     Burundi has deteriorated and there are reports of a military \n     coup against the elected Government of Burundi.\n       (2) The continuing ethnic conflict in Burundi has caused \n     untold suffering among the people of Burundi and has resulted \n     in the deaths of over 150,000 people in the past two years.\n       (3) The attempt to overthrow the Government of Burundi \n     makes the possibility of an increase in the tension and the \n     continued slaughter of innocent civilians more likely.\n       (4) The United States and the International Community have \n     an interest in ending the crisis in Burundi before it reaches \n     the level of violence that occurred in Rwanda in 1994 when \n     over 800,000 people died in the war between the Hutu and the \n     Tutsi tribes.\n       (b) Now, therefore it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) The United States Senate condemns any violent action \n     intended to overthrow the Government of Burundi.\n       (2) Calls on all parties to the conflict in Burundi to \n     exercise restraint in an effort to restore peace.\n       (3) Urges the Administration to continue diplomatic efforts \n     at the highest level to find a peaceful resolution to the \n     crisis in Burundi.\n\n     sense of the senate regarding environmental impact assessments\n\n       Sec. 599A. (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Environmental Impact Assessments as a national \n     instrument are undertaken for proposed activities that are \n     likely to have a significant adverse impact on the \n     environment and are subject to a decision of a competent \n     national authority;\n       (2) in 1978 the Senate adopted Senate Resolution 49, \n     calling on the United States Government to seek the agreement \n     of other governments to a proposed global treaty requiring \n     the preparation of Environmental Impact Assessments for any \n     major project, action, or continuing activity that may be \n     reasonably expected to have a significant adverse effect on \n     the physical environment or environmental interests of \n     another nation or a global commons area;\n       (3) subsequent to the adoption of Senate Resolution 49 in \n     1978, the United Nations Environment Programme Governing \n     Council adopted Goals and Principles on Environmental Impact \n     Assessment calling on governments to undertake comprehensive \n     Environmental Impact Assessments in cases in which the \n     extent, nature, or location of a proposed activity is such \n     that the activity is likely to significantly affect the \n     environment; and\n       (4) on October 7, 1992, the Senate gave its advice and \n     consent to the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the \n     Antarctic Treaty, which obligates parties to the Antarctic \n     Treaty to require Environmental Impact Assessment procedures \n     for proposed activities in Antarctica.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States Government should encourage the \n     governments of other nations to engage in additional regional \n     treaties regarding specific transboundary activities that \n     have adverse impacts on the environment of other nations or a \n     global commons area; and\n       (2) such additional regional treaties should ensure that \n     specific transboundary activities are undertaken in \n     environmentally sound ways and under careful controls \n     designed to avoid or minimize any adverse environmental \n     effects, through requirements for Environmental Impact \n     Assessments where appropriate.\n\n\n                    INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL\n\n       Sec. 599B. Findings.--\n       (1) The United Nations, recognizing the need for justice in \n     the former Yugoslavia, established the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``International Criminal \n     Tribunal'');\n       (2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 827 of May \n     25, 1993, requires states to cooperate fully with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal;\n       (3) The parties to the General Framework Agreement for \n     Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and associated Annexes (in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``Peace Agreement'') \n     negotiated in Dayton, Ohio and signed in Paris, France, on \n     December 14, 1995, accepted, in Article IX, the obligation \n     ``to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war \n     crimes and other violations of international humanitarian \n     law'';\n       (4) The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, agreed to \n     as Annex 4 of the Peace Agreement, provides, in Article IX, \n     that ``No person who is serving a sentence imposed by the \n     International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and no \n     person who is under indictment by the Tribunal and who has \n     failed to comply with an order to appear before the Tribunal, \n     may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or \n     other public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina'';\n       (5) The International Criminal Tribunal has issued 57 \n     indictments against individuals from\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\n     all parties to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia;\n       (6) The International Criminal Tribunal continues to \n     investigate gross violations of international law in the \n     former Yugoslavia with a view to further indictments against \n     the perpetrators;\n       (7) On July 25, 1995, the International Criminal Tribunal \n     issued an indictment for Radovan Karadzic, president of the \n     Bosnian Serb administration of Pale, and Ratko Mladic, \n     commander of the Bosnian Serb administration and charged them \n     with genocide and crimes against humanity, violations of the \n     law or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva \n     Conventions of 1949, arising from atrocities perpetrated \n     against the civilian population throughout Bosnia-\n     Herzegovina, for the sniping campaign against civilians in \n     Sarajevo, and for the taking of United Nations peacekeepers \n     as hostages and for their use as human shields;\n       (8) On November 16, 1995, Karadzic and Mladic were indicted \n     a second time by the International Criminal Tribunal, charged \n     with genocide for the killing of up to 6,000 Muslims in \n     Srebrenica, Bosnia, in July 1995;\n       (9) The United Nations Security Council, in adopting \n     Resolution 1022 on November 22, 1995, decided that economic \n     sanctions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n     Montenegro) and the so-called Republika Srpska would be \n     reimposed if, at any time, the High Representative or the \n     IFOR commander informs the Security Council that the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or the Bosnian Serb authorities are \n     failing significantly to meet their obligations under the \n     Peace Agreement;\n       (10) The so-called Republika Srpska and the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have failed to \n     arrest and turn over for prosecution indicted war criminals, \n     including Karadzic and Mladic;\n       (11) Efforts to politically isolate Karadzic and Mladic \n     have failed thus far and would in any case be insufficient to \n     comply with the Peace Agreement and bring peace with justice \n     to Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (12) The International Criminal Tribunal issued \n     international warrants for the arrest of Karadzic and Mladic \n     on July 11, 1996.\n       (13) In the so-called Republika Srpska freedom of the press \n     and freedom of assembly are severely limited and violence \n     against ethnic and religious minorities and opposition \n     figures is on the rise;\n       (14) It will be difficult for national elections in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina to take place meaningfully so long as key war \n     criminals, including Karadzic and Mladic, remain at large and \n     able to influence political and military developments;\n       (15) On June 6, 1996, the President of the International \n     Criminal Tribunal, declaring that the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia's failure to extradite indicted war criminals is a \n     blatant violation of the Peace Agreement and of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions, called on the High \n     Representative to reimpose economic sanctions on the so-\n     called Republika Srpska and on the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro); and\n       (16) The apprehension and prosecution of indicted war \n     criminals is essential for peace and reconciliation to be \n     achieved and democracy to be established throughout Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Senate finds that the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia merits continued and \n     increased United States support for its efforts to \n     investigate and bring to justice the perpetrators of gross \n     violations of international law in the former Yugoslavia;\n       (2) the President of the United States should support the \n     request of the President of the International Criminal \n     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia for the High \n     Representative to reimpose full economic sanctions on the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and \n     the so-called Republika Srpska, in accordance with United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1022 (1995), until the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and \n     Bosnian Serb authorities have complied with their obligations \n     under the Peace Agreement and United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions to cooperate fully with the International \n     Criminal Tribunal;\n       (3) the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), in carrying \n     out its mandate, should make it an urgent priority to detain \n     and bring to justice persons indicted by the International \n     Criminal Tribunal; and\n       (4) states in the former Yugoslavia should not be admitted \n     to international organizations and fora until and unless they \n     have complied with their obligations under the Peace \n     Agreement and United Nations Security Council Resolutions to \n     cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal.\n\n          TITLE VI--NATO ENLARGEMENT FACILITATION ACT OF 1996\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``NATO Enlargement \n     Facilitation Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the \n     security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and \n     its partners in the Alliance.\n       (2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, \n     purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any \n     nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as \n     full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security \n     in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures \n     which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. \n     Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. \n     America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to \n     the security of the countries of Europe.\n       (3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of \n     NATO to a mutual defense has made possible the democratic \n     transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the \n     Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing \n     the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in \n     creating the stable environment needed for those emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully \n     complete political and economic transformation.\n       (4) The United States continues to regard the political \n     independence and territorial integrity of all emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to \n     European peace and security.\n       (5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and \n     Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an \n     important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those \n     countries seeking NATO membership.\n       (6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different \n     occasions since 1949.\n       (7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new \n     members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and \n     has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new \n     members into NATO.\n       (8) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of \n     Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in \n     Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the \n     enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and \n     the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political \n     will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as \n     the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making \n     available the resources necessary to supplement efforts \n     prospective new members are themselves undertaking.\n       (9) New members will be full members of the Alliance, \n     enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under \n     the Washington Treaty.\n       (10) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives \n     involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe \n     that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the \n     Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint \n     Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping \n     Force, can make an important contribution to European peace \n     and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can \n     assist those countries preparing to assume the \n     responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly \n     should receive appropriate support from the United States.\n       (11) NATO remains the only multilateral security \n     organization capable of conducting effective military \n     operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-\n     Atlantic region.\n       (12) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a \n     positive role in defusing tensions between members of the \n     Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred \n     between two Alliance member states since the inception of \n     NATO in 1949.\n       (13) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance \n     the security of the region. Countries which have become \n     democracies and established market economies, which practice \n     good neighborly relations, and which have established \n     effective democratic civilian control over their defense \n     establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with \n     NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the \n     principles of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n       (14) A number of Central and Eastern European countries \n     have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken \n     concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including \n     their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.\n       (15) The Caucasus region remains important geographically \n     and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As \n     NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United \n     States and NATO should continue to examine means to \n     strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United \n     Nations recognized countries in that region.\n       (16) In recognition that not all countries which have \n     requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the \n     same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.\n       (17) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance \n     should include those emerging democracies most ready for \n     closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other \n     countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move \n     forward toward eventual NATO membership.\n       (18) The Congress of the United States finds in particular \n     that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia have \n     made significant progress toward achieving the stated \n     criteria and should be eligible for the additional assistance \n     described in this Act.\n       (19) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for \n     emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be \n     based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria \n     for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's \n     security and the approval of all NATO members.\n       (20) The process of NATO enlargement entails the agreement \n     of the governments of all NATO members in accordance with \n     Article 10 of the Washington Treaty.\n       (21) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not \n     allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory \n     although they are accorded the full collective security \n     guarantees provided by article V of the Washington treaty. \n     There is no prior requirement for the stationing of nuclear \n     weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in \n     the current security climate, however NATO retains the right \n     to alter its security posture at any time as circumstances \n     warrant.\n\n[[Page S8963]]\n\n     SEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States--\n       (1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to \n     adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War \n     world;\n       (2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central \n     and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries \n     may eventually qualify for NATO membership; and\n       (3) to work to define a constructive and cooperative \n     political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO \n     and the Russian Federation.\n\n     SEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGEMENT \n                   OF NATO.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote \n     economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine--\n       (1) the United States should continue and expand its \n     support for the full and active participation of these \n     countries in activities appropriate for qualifying for NATO \n     membership;\n       (2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic \n     means available to press the European Union to admit as soon \n     as possible any country which qualifies for membership;\n       (3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support \n     for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between \n     and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, and Russia; and\n       (4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging \n     democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be \n     limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the \n     Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members to the NATO \n     Alliance.\n\n     SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA, \n                   AND LITHUANIA.\n\n       In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-\n     Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and \n     other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 \n     years, it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical \n     security concerns that must be taken into account by the \n     United States; and\n       (2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be \n     disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their \n     forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.\n\n     SEC. 606. DESIGNATION OF COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE FOR NATO \n                   ENLARGEMENT ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The following countries are designated as \n     eligible to receive assistance under the program established \n     under section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 \n     and shall be deemed to have been so designated pursuant to \n     section 203(d) of such Act: Poland, Hungary, the Czech \n     Republic, and Slovenia.\n       (b) Designation of Other Countries.--The President shall \n     designate other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern \n     Europe as eligible to receive assistance under the program \n     established under section 203(a) of such Act if such \n     countries--\n       (1) have expressed a clear desire to join NATO;\n       (2) have begun an individualized dialogue with NATO in \n     preparation for accession;\n       (3) are strategically significant to an effective NATO \n     defense; and\n       (4) meet the other criteria outlined in section 203(d) of \n     the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of Public Law \n     103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note).\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--Subsection (a) does not preclude \n     the designation by the President of Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, \n     Ukraine, or any other emerging democracy in Central and \n     Eastern Europe pursuant to section 203(d) of the NATO \n     Participation Act of 1994 as eligible to receive assistance \n     under the program established under section 203(a) of such \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 607.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill, as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer (Mr. Coverdell) \nappointed Mr. McConnell, Mr. Specter, Mr. Mack, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \nGregg, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Byrd \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me take a couple of minutes. I will \ntake my 2 minutes now.\n  Mr. President, I think the bill we just passed by an overwhelming \nvote serves U.S. vital interests. The Camp David Accord commitments are \nin the bill. There is full funding for the NIS. The New Independent \nStates of the former Soviet Union are earmarked for Ukraine, Armenia, \nand Georgia, and there is a significant commitment to nuclear safety \nimprovements in Ukraine. As a result of the amendment of the occupant \nof the Chair, there is full funding for our narcotics effort. NATO \nexpansion--we are taking further steps down the road to NATO expansion \nnot only with the provisions in the underlying bill but also with the \namendment of Senator Brown last night which designated Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic eligible for $50 million, the transition fund \nwhich is part of the underlying original bill. So I think it is an \nimportant step in the right direction.\n  I thank in particular my long-time assistant Robin Cleveland for her \noutstanding work on this piece of legislation, and Jim Bond from the \nAppropriations Committee who always does an excellent job, and also Tim \nRieser of the minority staff, who we always enjoy working with, and \ncertainly my friend and colleague Pat Leahy who it is a pleasure to \nwork with. I have enjoyed our association on this kind of legislation \nover the last few years, and I look forward to working with him in the \nfuture on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate the distinguished chairman \nin getting the foreign operations bill through in record-setting time. \nFor the last few years, even though we have had to work without an \nauthorizing bill, we have moved this bill through each year in record \ntime. I appreciate the fact that he has had a strong commitment to our \nresponsibilities worldwide.\n  I worry that at a time--as I said earlier, when it is so easy to get \nthe quick applause lines back home for Members of Congress--when they \nsay, ``Well, by gosh. I will never send money to foreign countries,'' \nor, ``We are only going to spend it here at home,'' that really what \nthey are saying is that we are not going to develop our export markets \nworldwide; we are not going to help establish democracy so we do not \nhave to send our men and women into harm's way to protect American \ninterests when democracy fails; and that we as the most wealthy nation \nhistory has never known we are not going to carry out our moral \nresponsibility to help those who are less fortunate.\n  I think next year the President, whoever that may be, and the leaders \nof this committee and the House committee, the leaders of the Senate \nand the House, whoever they may be, ought to sit down and honestly face \nthe whole question of what our foreign assistance programs should \nconsist of as we enter the next century.\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\n  Senator McConnell has taken a very progressive attitude as he always \nhas on this. Many others want to make it a political kickball. I hope \nafter the elections that enough people in both parties would sit down \nto form a bipartisan consensus, which is always the best way to develop \nforeign policy, and determine how we should spend our money.\n  It should not escape the notice of Members that over a dozen \ncountries spend a larger percentage of their budget on foreign aid and \nforeign policy than we do. Many of these countries face difficult \nbudgetary problems as we do. Some actually spend more dollars; Japan, \nfor example. Some of these countries do it out of altruism but most do \nnot. Most of them do it out of hard-eyed realism. They know that the \nmoney they spend is helping to create jobs and, frankly, Mr. President, \nI would expect that there are those in a country like Japan which \nrelies heavily on exports who are delighted to see the United States \nwithdrawing from the world stage because they know what is going to \nhappen. But the reality is that it is in everyone's interest, both ours \nand our allies, for the United States, the world's oldest democracy, \nthe world's strongest military power, and the world's largest economy, \nto remain actively engaged.\n  It is the American workers who will be laid off because exports \ndecline. It will be Americans who will be a greater burden on their \nGovernment because the jobs leave our shores. Our competitors will \nincrease their foreign markets because they have taken an interest in \nforeign aid and they have created jobs in the developing countries--in \nAsia, Latin America, and we are seeing the beginnings of a potentially \nhuge market in Africa. Our markets in Europe and the First World are \nvery saturated. If we are going to expand out exports, it is going to \nbe in the Third World, where 95 percent of new births are occurring.\n  So that is the nonaltruistic argument. If we want to look at just \ndollars and cents, I hope that those who go home and make the great \nspeeches and get the applause for cutting foreign aid will also at the \nsame time say, oh, and by the way, that plant that once exported \ntractors that just closed and those 500 workers who are without jobs, I \nhelped that, too. I helped close that plant. I helped shut off our \naccess to markets worldwide, because that is really what they do.\n  Then ultimately we should ask ourselves the moral question. We in \nthis country spend a few pennies per capita in some of the poorest \nparts of the world such as sub-Saharan Africa, a few pennies per capita \neven though we are the wealthiest nation on Earth. We are less than 5 \npercent of the world's population, but we use a quarter of the world's \nresources. We have a moral responsibility. In this bill, when we cut \neverything from UNICEF to assistance for refugees, we should ask \nourselves: what do we stand for? Are we really living up to our \nresponsibility to help ease the suffering of the billion or more people \nwho go hungry every day?\n  As appropriators we have done the very best we could with the \nresources and the allocation we had. We have really tried to be \nresponsible in all of these areas. But sooner or later, we are going to \nhave to sit down and ask, can we year after year continue to cut these \nprograms? Not if we expect to preserve or influence in the world as a \nprotector of democracy and human rights, not if we expect to see our \neconomy grow, not if we expect to alleviate some of the misery in the \nworld.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield, but I do thank not only my \ndistinguished colleague from Kentucky but also Robin Cleveland, who he \nmentioned and whose willingness to work in a bipartisan way with my \nstaff was very appreciated, and Jim Bond, the clerk of the Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee, who I have worked with now for 22 years in the \nSenate and for whom I have great respect and appreciation. I also want \nto mention Juanita Rilling of the Committee staff, who has been an \nespecially strong voice for protecting programs that benefit needy \nwomen and children; Anne Bordonaro, a Vermont intern from South \nBurlington who has been assisting the Foreign Operations Subcommittee \nthis summer, and Emelie East, who is a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee staff and manages the affairs of four different \nsubcommittees; and the man who does the work of 20, Tim Rieser, who has \nworked on everything from the landmine ban to trying to make sure that \nwe are responsible in what we do. Tim, who does the work on our side of \nthe authorizing and appropriating committees, and does it on 20-hour \ndays, deserves credit and our thanks. He is typical of many on our \nSenate staffs on both sides who are the unsung heroes who make this \nplace work. I also want to thank several other staff members on our \nside who helped along the way, including Dick D'Amato of the \nAppropriations Committee staff whose expertise in trade issues was very \nhelpful, and who worked hard to ensure that humanitarian assistance can \nget to needly people in Azerbaijan. Diana Olbaum of the Foreign \nRelations Committee staff was as always a great help, as was Janice \nO'Connell, and Sheila Murphy of the majority leader's office.\n  I see the distinguished majority leader on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation to the \ndistinguished Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell], for the \noutstanding work he did in managing this bill, and also to the Senator \nfrom Vermont, who is always ready to go to work and do the job. They \nindicated they could do it in a reasonable period of time, and while I \nlike for the subcommittee chairmen to get their bills through in 3 \nhours or less on the appropriations committees, I think they did an \nexcellent job. They did take 16 hours and 15 minutes, which is pretty \ngood considering the long history on foreign operations appropriations \nbills. There were 11 rollcall votes.\n  So the Senate is certainly working and producing results, and I thank \nthese two Senators and all Senators for their cooperation and their \nwork in completing the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  I might say the Senate now, I believe, has completed action on five \nappropriations bills. We are ready to begin on the sixth one. I see the \nSenator from New Mexico is ready to go. I understand that the order of \nlast night provided that the Senate is now to begin consideration of \nthe energy and water appropriations bill. The managers have indicated \nthat they would anticipate amendments to be offered to that bill today. \nTherefore, I will announce that additional rollcall votes can be \nexpected today unless an agreement can be reached to limit the \namendments to the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  Also, it is my intent and hope that a similar agreement can be \nreached with respect to the legislative appropriations bill for Monday, \nthereby allowing all votes to be set at 10 a.m. on Tuesday. So all \nSenators are urged to cooperate in formulating that agreement. If we \ncan do that, we could work today on energy and water, Monday on the \nlegislative appropriations bill, and then have them both completed with \nthe votes at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.\n  I hope all Senators who intend to offer amendments to the energy and \nwater appropriations bill will do so as early as possible today so that \nwe can complete action, advise the Members what they can expect on the \nbill, and then move on to the remaining appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the chairman of the energy and \nwater appropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8943-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8965-S8972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I first wish to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for scheduling our bill this morning. It is obvious \nthat we are trying on our side to get as many appropriations bills \nthrough as possible. This will be another of those bills, and it is \nimportant that we get this one done.\n  As I understand it, for those Senators or staffers informing Senators \nwho are listening, it is the intention of the leader that we proceed \nand that there be votes today. However, there is an alternative being \ncirculated, and that is if you would give us the amendments, at least \nby name, we could agree on what all the amendments are shortly. Then we \nwould urge consent that there not be votes today and that the \namendments will be offered the remainder of the day and part of Monday, \nwhich I think is a very good approach. But we would like to know what \nthe amendments are today, and that is what we are circulating in the \nCloakrooms and on the hot lines.\n\n  Mr. President, first, I note the presence of Senator Bennett \nJohnston, who for 22 years either chaired or served on this \nsubcommittee, and, frankly, I take over the chairmanship with full \nunderstanding that I have a great deal to learn about the intricacies \nof the Department of Energy, its accounts and all of its various \nfunctions, and certainly the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of \nReclamation, which are two very major institutions out there in America \nthat do a lot of good and are frequently criticized, but I believe both \nare doing a very excellent job in terms of projects and programs they \nare undertaking. But, essentially, Senator Johnston has taken the lead \nin many important aspects of building science and research through the \nDepartment of Energy, and he has been an advocate of keeping our \nnuclear arsenal safe, sound and responsive, and much of that occurs by \nvirtue of the policies in this bill and the money appropriated. Since \nthis is his last undertaking on the floor for this bill, I would like \nto yield to him for his opening remarks, and then I will follow with \nsome.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the very warm and \ngenerous remarks of my colleague from New Mexico. While he is new in \nthe chairmanship on this committee, he is not new to the committee. We \nhave worked side by side for all of these 22 years, because New Mexico, \nof course, has a very vital interest in the work of this committee.\n  The State of New Mexico can thank Senator Pete Domenici for the \npresence and the health and viability of much of that State's Federal \npresence. The Federal presence in the State of New Mexico is rather \noverwhelming and would not have been such an overwhelming presence but \nfor Senator Pete Domenici. We have worked together to make that so, and \nit is in the Nation's interest. The national labs, particularly, are an \nAmerican resource that needs to be nurtured and used and developed and \ncontinued for the benefit of this country. So we are very pleased for \nthat.\n  Also, since this is my last time to manage this bill for the \nminority, I would like to mention the longstanding relationship I have \nwith the chairman of the full committee, Senator Hatfield, who was the \nchairman of this subcommittee and the ranking member. We would trade \noff on those roles every time the Congress would change. That was a \nvery productive and most pleasant relationship as well. So this \ncommittee and its staff and its work are some of the most pleasant and \nmost productive times I have had in this Congress. I thank all for \ngiving me that chance.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the senior Senator from New \nMexico [Mr. Domenici] in presenting to the Senate the Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriation bill for the fiscal year 1997 beginning \nOctober 1, 1996. This bill, S. 1959, an original bill reported by the \ncommittee on July 16, 1996, was approved by a unanimous vote. \nYesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3816. The markups \nin the House and Senate subcommittees and committees occurred \nsimultaneously, rather than our normal process or House acting first \nand our waiting receipt of the House bill.\n  At the outset, I want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Domenici. He has done an excellent job in putting this bill \ntogether, under very difficult budgetary constraints and circumstances. \nHe is an outstanding Member of the Senate and I am pleased to work with \nhim in connection with this bill and on other matters.\n  I also want to thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon, Senator \nHatfield, the chairman of the full Committee on Appropriations. Senator \nHatfield and I had probably one of the longest running twosomes in the \nAppropriation Committee on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, I having \nchaired on and off for a number of years, and Senator Hatfield having \nchaired on and off for a number of years, and having rotated as ranking \nminority member. We. always shared a productive, pleasant, bipartisan, \nand always, I think, the kind of relationship that Senators seek and \nglory in when it is present. I treasure his friendship and appreciate \nthe cooperation and assistance given to me.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico has presented the \ncommittee recommendations and explained the major appropriations items, \nas well as the amounts recommended, so I will not undertake to repeat \nand elaborate on the numerous recommendations. Instead I will just have \na few brief remarks summarizing the bill.\n\n\n                          purpose of the bill\n\n  The bill supplies funds for water resources development programs and \nrelated activities, of the Department of the Army, civil functions--\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Civil Works Program in title I; for the \nDepartment of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation in title II; for the \nDepartment of Energy's energy research activties--except for fossil \nfuel programs and certain conservation and regulatory functions--\nincluding atomic energy defense activities in title III; and for \nrelated independent agencies and commissions, including the Appalachian \nRegional Commission and Appalachian regional development programs, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority in \ntitle V.\n\n\n                     602(b) allocation for the bill\n\n  The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee allocation under \nsection 602(b)(1) of the budget act total $20,308,000,000 in budget \nauthority and $20,202,000,000 in outlays for fiscal year 1997. Of these \namounts the Defense discretionary allocation is $11,600,000,000 in \nbudget authority and $11,233,000,000 in outlays. For domestic \ndiscretionary the budget authority allocation is $8,708,000,000 and the \nallocation for outlays is $8,969,000,000. The committee recommendation \nuses all of the budget authority allocation in both categories, so \nthere is no room for add-ons to the bill. Therefore, any amendments to \nadd will have to be offset by reductions from within the bill.\n\n\n                       summary of recommendations\n\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1997 budget estimates for the bill \ntotal $20,648,952,000 in new budget obligational authority. The \nrecommendation of the committee provides $20,735,645,000. This amount \nis $86,693,000 over the President's budget estimates and about $800 \nmillion over the appropriations amounts for the current fiscal year \n1996. The large increases in the bill over last year are principally \nassociated with the Defense activities and related Defense programs--\nwhat we refer to at 050 national defense accounts. Domestic \ndiscretionary spending continues to decline especially in the \nDepartment of Energy domestic discretionary functions.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly summarize the major recommendations \nprovided in the bill. All the details and figures are, of course, \nincluded in the Committee Report No. 104-320, accompanying the bill, \nwhich has been available since July 17.\n\n\n                    TITLE I, ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n  First, under title I of the bill which provides appropriations for \nthe Department of the Army Civil Works Program, U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers, the recommendation is for a total of\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nnew budget authority of $3,455,623,000, which is $89 million over \nfiscal year 1996 and $163 million more than the budget estimate.\n  The committee received a large number of requests for various water \ndevelopment projects including many requests for new construction \nstarts. However, as the chairman has stated, due to the limited \nbudgetary resources, the committee could not provide funding for each \nand every project requested. The committee recommendation does include \na small number of new studies and planning starts but no new \nconstruction starts. The committee has deferred without prejudice new \nconstruction starts and hopes to fashion a small package of new \nprojects before this bill is completed. Because of the importance of \nsome of these projects to the economic well-being of the Nation, the \ncommittee will continued to monitor each projects progress to ensure \nthat it is ready to proceed to construction when resources become \navailable. As the committee report points out, the committee \nrecommendation does not agree with the policies proposed by the \nadministration in its budget.\n\n\n                  TITLE II, DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n  For title II, Department of the Interior Bureau of Reclamation, the \nrecommendation provides new budget authority of $852,788,000, which is \n$9 million more than the budget estimate and about the same amount as \nfor fiscal year 1996.\n\n\n                    TITLE III, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY\n\n  Under title III, Department of Energy, the committee provides a total \nof $16.1 billion. This amount includes $2.750 billion for energy \nsupply, research and development activities, an appropriation of $42.2 \nmillion for uranium supply and enrichment activities, offset fully by \ngross revenues; $220.2 million for the uranium enrichment \ndecontamination and decommissioning fund, $1 billion for general \nscience and research activities, $200 million from the nuclear waste \ndisposal fund for a total of $400 million for civilian nuclear waste \nactivities when the $200 million appropriated under the defense \nactivities is included, and $6.4 billion for environmental restoration \nand waste management--defense and nondefense.\n  For the atomic energy defense activities, there is a total of $11.583 \nbillion comprised of $3.979 billion for weapons activities; almost $6.0 \nbillion for defense environmental restoration and waste management; \n$1.607 billion for other defense programs and $200 million for defense \nnuclear waste disposal.\n  For departmental administration $218 million is recommended offset \nwith anticipated miscellaneous revenues of $125 million for a net \nappropriation of $93 million. A total of $245.6 million is recommended \nin the bill for the Power Marketing Administrations and $146.3 million \nis for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] offset 100 \npercent by revenues.\n  A net appropriation of $159.8 million is provided for solar programs, \nincluding photovoltaics, wind, and biomass and for all solar and \nrenewable energy, $246.6 million, a decrease of about $20 million less \nthan fiscal year 1996.\n  For nuclear energy programs, $229.7 million is recommended, of which \nabout $100 million is for termination costs and activities associated \nwith previous decisions ending support for several activities and \nprojects. The recommendation includes $22 million in funds to continue \nthe advanced light water reactor cost-shared program and the committee \nhas provided funds under termination costs to wind up the first-of-a-\nkind engineering program.\n  For the magnetic fusion program, the committee is recommending $240 \nmillion, which is $15 million less than the budget. An amount of $389 \nmillion is included for biological and environmental research and \n$649.6 million for basic energy sciences.\n\n\n          TITLE IV, REGULATORY AND OTHER INDEPENDENT AGENCIES\n\n  A total of $313 million for various regulatory and independent \nagencies of the Federal Government is included in the bill. Major \nprograms include the Appalachian Regional Commission, $165 million; \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, $471.8 million offset by revenues of \n$457.3 million; and for the Tennessee Valley Authority, $113 million.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I wish there were additional \namounts for domestic discretionary programs in our allocation but that \nis not the case. A large number of good programs, projects and \nactivities have been either eliminated or reduced severely, because of \nthe allocation, but such action is required under the budget \nconstraints we are facing. I hope the Senate will act favorably and \nexpeditiously in passing this bill so we can get to conference with the \nHouse and thereafter send the bill to the White House as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, the big disappointment with this bill, as with other \nbills, is the paucity of resources given to these most important \nfunctions of Government. I think it is a real mistake to starve these \nfunctions, which are infrastructure, water projects, ports, harbors, \nflood protection, and water resources, which are the basis of the \neconomy in much of our country. They have been deferred and deferred \nand deferred, as well as the national labs and science endeavors, which \nare funded at, I believe, much too low a level. I hope in the next \nCongress we will find additional funds to do this.\n  In the meantime, I think we have done a good job under the leadership \nof Senator Domenici in allocating these scarce resources well.\n  With thanks to my chairman, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to repeat--Senator Johnston has \ncompleted his opening statement; mine will not take but a few moments--\nthe distinguished majority leader has indicated we will have votes. We \nknow of a couple of amendments. We can call Senator Jeffords, and there \nare a couple of others around. What we are trying to do now, and it is \nbeing worked through the offices and I urge Senators' offices to help \nus, if we want to get a unanimous consent that we are not going to have \nany votes today, then we need to know what amendments are going to be \nproposed to this bill. That is what we are waiting for. I once again \nurge that, and we will be here and will be ready to vote on an \namendment that might be offered here shortly.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the floor S. 1959, the energy \nand water development appropriation bill for fiscal year 1996 for \nconsideration by the full Senate. The Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act is normally one of the first appropriations bills \nconsidered by the Senate. However, this year the House experienced some \nearly delays because the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee was \nprovided with an allocation that would appear on its face to be \ninsufficient to take care of the mandates of this bill. As a result, \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee took the unusual step of reporting \nan original bill in order to speed consideration of this act.\n  I am pleased to report the House completed consideration of its \nEnergy and Water Development Act earlier yesterday and, indeed, \nadditional resources were given to the committee from the first \nallocation that caused the delay. The Energy and Water Subcommittee \nmarked up the bill on July 11, and the full committee reported it by \nunanimous vote last Tuesday, July 16. The bill and report have been \navailable to Senators and their staffs since last Wednesday.\n\n  I, first, thank the former chairman of the committee, as I already \nhave, Senator Johnston. I thank Senator Hatfield for his extraordinary \nwork with reference to this subcommittee and its activities over all \nthe years.\n  I feel confident we have done a good job this year with the resources \nthat were made available. Indeed, with reference to the Department of \nEnergy and, in particular, the Department of Energy's efforts to \ncontinue the cleanup in this country from the atomic years and nuclear \nbomb development era, that has significant increases to continue that \ncleanup, but under a regime that is causing more work to be done and \nthe work to be done more efficiently.\n  In addition, some new projects and some additional money have been \nprovided for the whole new concept that is now being used by the \nDepartment to maintain the safety of our nuclear weapons. That new \nstewardship, the science-based stockpile stewardship program, was a few \nyears in development. It is now about 2\\1/2\\ years old, but\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\nit is receiving the full attention of the three major laboratories that \ndealt with nuclear weapons and the nuclear deterrent threat.\n  It is also having its impact on other facilities that we have in this \ncountry to maintain our nuclear bombs in a safe and trustworthy manner.\n  Some do not recognize, and perhaps they choose not even to think \nabout it, but the Department of Energy, whether one likes the \nDepartment or not, is, in a sense, doing very major defense work for \nAmerica. They are the custodians of the nuclear weapons. We all know we \nare building down from a very high number to a much smaller number of \nnuclear warheads. Since we have decided as a matter of national policy \nthat there will be no more underground testing, we have decided that \nthis new science-based stockpile stewardship program will be the \nscientific source of evaluation of our residual nuclear weapons, the \nones we are going to keep, to make sure that they are safe and \ntrustworthy.\n  You know, the American military men from the Navy all the way \nthrough--it is those people out there that we are worried about. It is \nfor them that we want to make sure we keep weapons in the highest \nquality of maintenance. For they are the front line and we want the \nweapons in their hands to be the very best, in terms of safety and \ntrustworthiness and reliability. That is a big mission.\n  So, in this bill, as in the defense authorization bill, a significant \nnew asset was added this year, a resource so that the three major \nlaboratories can continue to develop the technologies and techniques \nand equipment that will be necessary to maintain these weapons without \nthe benefit of the science and technology that would come from \nunderground testing, which is a very big undertaking.\n\n  Will it work? We hope so. The greatest scientists in America working \nat the laboratories are bound and determined to make it work. In fact, \nthey have committed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that it will work. The \nJoint Chiefs of Staff have, thus, approved this approach, but they have \nmade it very, very clear that they do not want to abandon the test site \nin Nevada.\n  It must be maintained in a readied posture, because if this new \napproach fails, we will have to verify and secure our weapons \nperformance and trustworthiness through other means.\n  So at the same time we are moving ahead in a new approach, we have to \nmaintain some of the old. That costs a little bit of extra money, but \nnot an amount that this Senator believes our taxpayers would not \nwillingly pay if the issue is, since we must maintain a nuclear \narsenal, let's make sure we maintain it in the best possible way in \nterms of reliability, trustworthiness, safety, and security. I am sure \nthat as the Department of Energy moves through the next few years with \nthis new approach, there will be plenty of opportunity for this \nsubcommittee, the Armed Services Committee, the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand other groups within the executive branch, to make sure that it is \nbeing done right.\n  The Energy and Water Development Subcommittee funds are used not only \nfor the Department of Energy's defense activities, but, obviously, \nthere are three other major activities. The Department of Energy does \nsome nondefense work, and we have to pay for that in this bill. Then we \nhave the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers.\n  Let me suggest that we are operating on the nondefense side. We are \noperating at a freeze level for the corps and the Bureau. The Corps of \nEngineers, nonetheless, in an overall macrosense, will increase $89 \nmillion. Energy supply and research, $22 million and high-energy \nphysics, $20 million. These are programs and activities that are \nnondefense oriented.\n  Also, uranium supply enrichment, a minus $29 million; uranium \nenrichment decontamination and dismantling, a minus $59 million; \ndepartmental administration, we have reduced that by $149 million, $37 \nmillion more than the Department proposed when they suggested $122 \nmillion should be saved at the administrative level of the Department.\n  We have made some difficult decisions in the nondefense activities. \nWhile we have reduced popular programs such as solar and renewables, we \nhave held the line on fusion, high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and \nbiological and environmental research, all very, very important \nfunctions for our Nation's future.\n  There are many who are not even aware that these are taking place \nwithin the Department of Energy, but they are, and they are programs \nthat contribute mightily to America's basic science and to the future \nof our Nation. I am very hopeful that we can fund them adequately as we \ncome out of conference with the House, although I must say that the \nallocation of resources to the House subcommittee, both for nondefense \nand for defense activities, is substantially lower than the Senate's. \nIn fact the sum total by which it is lower than ours is almost $1 \nbillion--$900 million. A little over $200 million of that is nondefense \nwork and about $700 million is DOE defense work.\n  Since we have a firewall, we cannot move the money back and forth in \nthis bill between the defense allocation and the nondefense allocation. \nSo some might want to offer an amendment to take something out of \ndefense and put it in domestic. They should know that is subject to a \npoint of order and will require 60 votes because it violates what the \nU.S. Senate has agreed for this year as a firewall between defense \nspending and domestic.\n\n  I could go on with a few more discussions of what we are doing here, \nbut let me just talk a minute further about the water resources \nprojects.\n  Frankly, the U.S. Senate should know that for all that is being said \nby some in America that we should not be engaged in so many projects of \nflood protection and Bureau of Reclamation-type activities, the \nSenators and the States they represent seem to indicate with a very \nloud voice that they need these projects. We received hundreds of \nrequests either to start projects or to put more money in projects that \nwe have for these two online agencies of the U.S. Government.\n  The Corps of Engineers, in its civil works program, has a budget \nauthority in this bill of $3,455,623,000, as I indicated, an increase \nof $89 million.\n  Title II of the bill funds activities associated with the Department \nof the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and the central Utah completion \nproject. Total funding recommended for these activities is \n$852,788,000. This is a reduction of a little over a half a million \ndollars from the enacted level and about $8,900,000 above the budget \nrequest.\n  We still have a number of requests in both title I and title 2 with \nwhich we have been unable to comply. I must say to Senators, consistent \nwith a starting rule, that we will have no new starts. We have done our \nvery best to be fair and equitable and I believe satisfied many of the \nrequests.\n  I do not say that Senators request and we grant them their requests. \nThese are projects that go through the professionals in the Department \nand actually are confirmed to us by them as being worthwhile and the \nkind of things we ought to be doing.\n  Obviously, there is much more I could speak about of an exciting \nnature that is going on in the science and research part of the \nDepartment of Energy. I have just touched the surface of it, but if \nthere are amendments that address any of these projects or programs, we \nwill spend additional time with the Senate explaining why we think the \nlevels of funding in this bill are appropriate and the activities that \nwe have recommended be funded are in the best interest of the United \nStates.\n  As my ranking member and former chairman said, a lot of this bill is \ninvestment, either investment in the water ports of this Nation or the \ninfrastructure of water projects, reclamation projects, flood \nprotection projects and a lot of it is an investment in the Department \nof Energy, for when you invest in nuclear physics, when you invest in \nthe highest science around to determine what the atom is all about and \nwhat the physics of that is, you are investing in the future of mankind \nand certainly in America's future.\n  These kinds of funds do not stay in the Department, nor do they go \nexclusively to laboratories. Much of it goes to the great universities \nand science activities going on in this country.\n  So I am very proud of the bill. Let me repeat, many Senators have \nstopped me on the floor and wanted to know if we are going to vote \ntoday.\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\n The answer is, there is a way that we will not have any votes, and \nthat is if Senators will cooperate, as they have been, and tell us \nwhether they have amendments. If they have amendments, we want to list \nthem, and then we will be here part of today to accept any of them that \nSenators want to offer. Then we will ask in a consent request that on \nMonday, there also be an opportunity for further offering of those \namendments that we have agreed to, with votes on Tuesday, is what I \nunderstand on this bill. There may be other votes on Monday, but on \nthis bill, I assume that is going to be the scenario.\n  I yield the floor at this point, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I came to the Senate in January 1989. I was \nnot here very long before I realized our State was facing a very \ndifficult problem with the sudden surge of the importation of out-of-\nState waste. Our capacity to dispose of our own waste was quickly being \nfilled to overflowing, and action needed to be taken.\n  The State of Indiana Legislature has taken a number of steps to \nattempt to limit this flow of unwanted waste coming from other States. \nYet, each one of their attempts was met by a court challenge, and a \nchallenge that was successful in that it said we were violative of the \ninterstate commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  In reviewing the court opinions on that subject, we discovered the \ncourt said if the Congress specifically and affirmatively grants States \nthe authority to regulate its flow of out-of-State waste, then it would \nmeet constitutional muster. So, I then proceeded to offer legislation \non that subject to find a solution to not only our problem but a number \nof importing States' problems throughout the country.\n  That was a contentious issue at the time, and it was tied up in \nfilibuster and a whole number of procedural delays. We persisted, and \nin September of 1990, a modified version of my original amendment \npassed the Senate by a vote of 67 to 31, as an amendment to the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill. It was not a partisan issue. \nIt was a bipartisan issue--Democrats and Republicans joined together to \npass this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, in the conference on the appropriations bill in 1990 \nin October, just before we adjourned for the elections, that provision \nwas stripped. That was the 101st Congress.\n  In the 102d Congress, early on in that Congress, March of 1992, I \nintroduced new legislation which, after some considerable debate and \nmaneuvering, we managed to pass by an even more overwhelming vote. I \nwas joined by the Senator from Montana in that effort. He was very \nhelpful in allowing us to move forward on that legislation. It passed \nthe Senate in July of 1992 by a vote of 89 to 2. We had addressed a \nnumber of the objections that were raised in the original legislation, \nStates that had particular and peculiar problems, and we even worked \nwith the exporting States that were putting the waste into play on an \ninternational basis, and satisfied a number of their demands.\n  In other words, we achieved a balance, a balance between the \nlegitimate needs of those States that found State waste overwhelming \ntheir own environmental plans to adequately dispose of their own waste \nto protect their environment, and we addressed the needs of the \nexporting States who needed some time to ratchet down their exports, \nout-of-State exports, and deal with their waste on an intrastate basis. \nThat accommodation resulted, as I said, in that vote in 1992. The \nsupport from the Senator from Montana was critical to that success.\n  Unfortunately, the House failed to act on that legislation, which \nbrought us to the 103d Congress. In February 1993, I again introduced \nthe interstate waste bill, and after considerable negotiations and \nwork, we passed that bill in the Senate, the Coats-Baucus bill, in \nSeptember 1994. In October, it passed the House and came to the waning \ndays of the 103d Congress, and because of procedural reasons we needed \nunanimous consent to proceed with that. We moved the legislation \nthrough the House, through some very difficult negotiations, got 435 \nMembers of the House to agree to that, and we got 99 Members of the \nU.S. Senate to agree. Unfortunately, we could not get that last vote. \nBecause we needed all 100 and needed unanimous consent to proceed to \nthe legislation, it failed.\n\n  Then the 104th Congress came, and in March 1995 I reintroduced the \nlegislation. In May, on May 16, 1995, on my birthday--I do not think it \nwas a birthday present from the Senate to me, but it happened to fall \non that particular date--the Senate passed that new legislation by a \nvote of 94 to 6. The House subsequently has done nothing.\n  Now, I am hoping that Members will detect there is a pattern here, \nthat there is a pattern that this issue is not going to go away, and \nthat I will keep introducing that as long as I have voice to speak and \nthe good people of Indiana choose to send me back to the U.S. Senate. \nThis is an issue that is not only important to my State, the people who \nI represent, but it is important to the Nation.\n  Given the votes that we have had here in the Senate, a lot of people \nare wondering, why can't we finalize this? We cannot finalize it now \nbecause the House refused to act on it for a number of reasons.\n  We are not going to give up. The pattern is we will just keep coming \nback and back and back and back and back until this issue is resolved \nand we strike the necessary legislation and put it into law, giving \nStates control over their own borders.\n  The legislation before the Senate is a bipartisan effort. I am being \njoined this morning by Senator Levin from Michigan, another importing \nState. I know a number of other Senators here have a vested interest in \nthis issue, and whether they need to come to the floor to discuss this \nor not, I am not sure. I am confident we can move forward. But, again, \nwe want to make the point that this legislation is not going to go \naway. My effort is not going to go away. We are going to persist with \nthis until we finalize this.\n  This is an amendment, with due respect to the chairman and the \nranking member of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, \nthis is an effort to try to attach it to somewhat relevant legislation \nso that we can get it into conference and hopefully convince the \nconferees that this strongly bipartisan, strongly supported effort, \nafter literally years of intense negotiations--with importing States, \nexporting States, all involved; waste haulers, all involved--we have \nreached a reasonable agreement that ought to be enacted into law.\n  I am offering it this morning along with my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Levin. We do strike an appropriate balance. What we are \noffering today is exactly the same legislation that the Senate has \nvoted on in this Congress and passed by a vote of 94 to 6. In the \ninterests of time and in the interests of Senators who I know are \ntrying to make plans to travel back to their States for this weekend, \nand to move this appropriations bill forward, I am going to limit my \nremarks to this, unless I need to respond to questions or opposition \nraised on this particular legislation.\n  I thank the chairman for his tolerance and willingness and his \nsupport in this effort to, once again, move this legislation. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know Senator Levin wants to speak to \nthis very important legislation.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5092\n\n   (Purpose: To provide authority for States to limit the interstate \n                transportation of municipal solid waste)\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself and Mr. \n     Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 5092.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I think we are willing to accept it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe we are willing to accept it. That is what I \ntold the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will withhold that request at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will have to talk about it. We are working on the \npremise that if we get all the Senators to agree to the amendments on a \nlist, there would be no votes today. We would like very much to see if \nwe can get that worked out.\n  That would not preclude the Senator from having a yea and nay vote on \nTuesday, although I recommend that he not do that. We are not taking \nanything away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withdraw the request for the \nyeas and nays?\n  Mr. COATS. I temporarily withdraw that request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, once again, I want to say publicly what \nI told the distinguished Senator from Indiana. We are willing to accept \nthis amendment and take it to conference. It is obvious that, at one \ntime or another, legislation like this has received almost the \nunanimous support of Congress. Because of that, we will take it.\n  I want to say to Senators one more time--not those here, but Senators \nand staff in their offices--who are concerned about what is going to \nhappen for the rest of today, Monday, and Tuesday. We are asking each \noffice to tell us if they have amendments to this bill. We are making \nsome real headway. There are a few offices we have not been able to \nwork this out with. But it is important to get that done. That will \ndefine the schedule for the remainder of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment of \nthe Senator from Indiana. He has worked on it so long and hard, and so \nmany other Members of this body, particularly Senator Baucus of \nMontana, the Senators from Louisiana, and so many others, to finally \ngive States and local government some control over the flow of waste \nboth into their jurisdictions and out of their jurisdictions.\n  The Senate has expressed its will on this issue over and over again--\nmost recently, in May of last year by an overwhelming vote of 94 to 6. \nThe Senator from Indiana has gone through the number of times that the \nSenate has expressed its will. He has gone through the number of ways \nin which the vast majority of House Members have expressed their will \non this matter in support of this legislation, made necessary by a \nSupreme Court decision which said it is up to Congress to decide \nwhether or not it wants to give these powers to the State and local \ngovernments.\n  Now, Michigan, my State, my counties, and my townships have plans for \nwaste disposal. They have invested in it. They spent a lot of time with \nthese investments and a lot of money on these investments to dispose of \ntheir waste locally. Those plans and those investments are totally \ndisrupted when contracts are entered into without consideration by \nState, county, or local government of the impact of those contracts for \nimporting waste into those areas, because when you import waste in that \nway, without consideration of plans, and without consideration of \nthe efforts that local governments have made to dispose of their own \nwaste, it totally disrupts those efforts and those expenditures. It is \nnot right.\n\n  States and local governments have a right to do that planning and to \nmake those investments in order to dispose of their own waste and not \nsee their own plans displaced by the import of waste from other places, \nbased on contracts between haulers and those other places.\n  Our local people should not be dumped on any longer. They should have \nsome control over their own jurisdictions, and over their own land. \nThat is what this issue is really all about. And so I want to commend \nall the Senators who have been involved in this effort for so many \nyears. It has been truly a bipartisan effort all along. It will \ncontinue to be that. It will continue to be made until we finally not \njust get a bill passed in the Senate, which we have done over and over \nagain, but get the same bill passed by the Senate and the House. And \nthis effort to adopt this amendment on this particular appropriations \nbill is another statement to the House that we expect action this year.\n  Here we are with, perhaps, 30 legislative days left in this session. \nLast year the Senate expressed itself. I, on at least one occasion, \nhave stood up saying I was going to offer this kind of amendment, and \nhave been dissuaded from doing so based on the assurance that there \nwould be efforts made to get the House to act. The House has not acted. \nThere are a few people there who oppose it, who have been able to \ndisplace the will of what appears to be a clear majority of House \nMembers.\n  It is simply time that we again express ourselves as a Senate on this \nissue, not just speaking into the ether, but speaking directly to the \nHouse and saying we are very serious that we want this bill--at least \nwe want consideration of both parts of this bill by the House this \nyear, on both the questions of interstate waste coming into a State and \nthe question of flow control of waste from a State. Both of those \nsubjects are covered in this bill in a balanced way, as the Senator \nfrom Indiana has said, in consideration of both importing and exporting \nStates.\n  Before I yield the floor, I simply again want to thank my good friend \nfrom Indiana, and particularly single out the Senator from Montana, \nwho, for so many years, has fought this battle. It will be essential \nnot just to his State, my State, Indiana, Louisiana, and other States, \nbut to all of our States that we finally have some control over our own \nland, over our own plans, over our own investment for waste disposal. \nThe Senators from Indiana and Montana have been leaders in that effort.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator will yield. Mr. President, I cosponsored \na bill on this subject matter filed by my colleague, Senator Breaux, a \nfew years ago. Does this differ in any way from that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if I could ask my friend from Indiana, I \nunderstand this bill is precisely the same as S. 534, which passed in \nMay 1995 by a vote of 94 to 6, and that that bill is this amendment. \nThat is my understanding.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The amendment we \nare offering today is identical, word-for-word, to the legislation that \npassed this body earlier in this session of Congress.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That was this session?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes, it was. I can give you the exact date.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is it the same as we had a few years ago?\n  Mr. COATS. It has been modified from the original legislation. We \nhave addressed some of the concerns of the exporting States and struck \na balance between the timetables, in terms of their ratcheting down the \nexports, and we made some adjustments on the importing State side. We \nallow, for instance, local jurisdictions to enter into what are called \nhost agreements. We do not upset those agreements. We don't want to \nbreach any contractual obligations already entered into. We have added \nflow control language to address that particular issue, also. This is \nidentical to what we passed in 1995 in this Congress.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Well, Mr. President, I commend the Senators for \nproposing this legislation. Being one of these recipient States of this \nwaste, who has never been able to control this situation, I commend \nthem for coming up with a solution that I believe will work. Of course, \nthe minority will enthusiastically accept the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't want the sponsors to have any \nconcern about whether the Senator from New Mexico favors this when we \ngo to conference. I favor it 100 percent.\n  We were a State that was at least threatened with all kinds of \nexternal dumping of garbage in our State. We talk about solid waste, \nbut this is not nuclear waste. This is essentially garbage with maybe a \nlittle frill on the edges.\n  So I will take the bill. I want the Senator to know I will take it. I \nwill take it and try to keep it. I think we ought to pass it. Whether \nour bill gets to the President and gets signed, we\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\nmay have that confronting us. We are going to do our share of trying to \nkeep it in conference.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator will yield, I am fully aware of the perils \nand pitfalls of moving appropriations bills to the executive branch and \nhaving the President sign them. I know that is not directly related, \nalthough I think it is indirectly related to energy and water.\n  I appreciate the commitment from the Senator from New Mexico in doing \nhis very best to see if we can add this in an appropriations bill and \nget it accepted in conference.\n  As I said, this is not a partisan issue. The President has already \nindicated that he would sign this particular provision. So this will \nnot be a deal breaker.\n  If I can get the commitment from the Senator from New Mexico and the \nSenator from Louisiana that they will fight for this effort in \nconference and do their best to reflect the Senate position on this, in \ndeference to my colleagues, who I know are seeking to catch planes and \nwrap up the session, if there are no other votes ordered on this \nlegislation, I will not be the one to scuttle the picnic here. So I \nwill make that commitment to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to make one additional point. I have just \nreceived word that Senator Chafee wants to come down and speak on the \nmeasure. I think it is quite appropriate. He is chairman of the \nsubcommittee of original jurisdiction. We did not intend to vote or \naccept this in the next few minutes anyway. So if Senator Chafee wants \nto speak, we urge that he come down as soon as he can.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am happy the Senator from Indiana \noffered this amendment. He has been committed, including the Presiding \nOfficer, for many years to trying to get this passed.\n  There has been a development which makes this legislation more \nimminent. Recently, the city of New York announced that it is going to \nclose its Fresh Kills landfill. Fresh Kills landfill is probably the \nbiggest landfill in this country. They receive 13,000 tons of garbage a \nday at Fresh Kills landfill in New York. That amounts to 1,200 trucks a \nday of garbage dumped at the Fresh Kills landfill. That is going to be \nclosed. It will be closed in 2 years. I think it will be phased out \nultimately by the year 2001.\n  That is a problem. It is a problem for a lot of so-called importing \nStates, States that receive other States' garbage. It is a problem \nbecause States are having a very difficult time enacting laws providing \nfor incinerators. People do not want incinerators to burn garbage.\n  This is a major proposal in the State of New York for the State of \nNew York to build a major incinerator in Brooklyn. It has been turned \ndown. It is the old not-in-my-backyard syndrome. Nobody wants an \nincinerator in their backyard.\n  So incinerators are not getting anywhere, which means that New York \nhas a problem. New York City has a big problem with Fresh Kills closed. \nWhere is all that garbage going to be, 13,000 tons, 1,200 trucks a day?\n\n  That is just an example of the problem that we face.\n  I might say that my State is typical; that is, Montana has wide open \nspaces. A lot of folks from the East think that is a good place to dump \ngarbage. ``Let's dump it out in the West. They have wide open space out \nthere.''\n  Regrettably, a major entrepreneur in an Eastern State decided that he \nwanted to open up a big landfill in Miles City, MT. We in Montana do \nnot want this big landfill in Miles City. He was able to cut a deal \nwith a couple of folks in Miles City to build this landfill, whereas \nthe vast majority do not want this landfill in Montana. The State of \nMontana could not pass legislation prohibiting this, could not pass \nlegislation limiting the dumping of out-of-State garbage in our own \nState. Why? Because the Supreme Court says the States cannot do that. \nIt is in violation of the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n  Very simply, this is a very basic proposal. Basically, we are saying \nthat by the passage of this legislation, with some modifications, the \nStates have the right to say no. They have a right to say no to the \nshipment of out-of-State garbage being dumped in their State.\n  We talk a lot around here about local control. We talk a lot around \nhere, ``Gee, let States decide their own destiny, and let local \ncommunities decide their own destiny.'' This legislation will allow \nStates to do that. They will be able to say no to the dumping of out-\nof-State garbage in their own States.\n  I hope that the House conferees take this provision. It is going to \nbe difficult.\n  I very much appreciate the statement of the manager of the bill, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, as well as its \nranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Johnston, that they will \npush for this amendment in conference. The trouble is that the House \nhas not looked very favorably on this legislation recently. It is \nbasically because of who is on what committee over in the House and \nwhat States are exporting States. It is a problem.\n  But I urge our Senate conferees to be very vigorous in pushing this \namendment in conference, because then, finally, we are going to get \nthis thing enacted.\n  I can tell you that there are a lot of people in our country who very \nmuch want to control their own destiny in a lot of ways, and one way is \nto be able to say no to the shipment of out-of-State garbage. I have \nbeen working with Senator Coats on this for years.\n  When the Democrats were in the majority, I had the subcommittee that \ngot this legislation passed a couple of years ago. This is very similar \nto that legislation, this proposal before us.\n  I very strongly commend the Senator from Indiana for his very, very \ndeep dedication to this issue. I hope we can finally get it passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to add as original cosponsors \nto the bill Senator Specter, Senator Baucus, and Senator McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of this amendment that will get a grip on the serious problem \nof interstate waste. I am also pleased to be working again with Senator \nCoats on an issue that affects both our States--the unchecked flow of \ninterstate waste.\n  As you and many of my colleagues are aware, out-of-State waste \ncreates problems for States that are unable to control the amount of \ntrash that is sent across the border for disposal. This imported waste \ntakes up landfill space, which complicates State and local waste \nplanning and requires States to devote valuable resources to the \nproblem other States have neglected. Scarce landfill space in Kentucky \nshould be allocated for Kentuckians, not trash from hundreds of miles \naway.\n  During my tenure in this Senate, I have committed myself to resolving \nthis issue and ensuring that Kentucky doesn't become a dumping ground \nto out-of-State waste. In 1990, and every year since, I have introduced \nlegislation or worked with Senator Coats in crafting language that has \nultimately led to the compromise legislation that came so close to \npassing last year.\n  In 1990, I introduced S. 2691, a bill to give States the ability to \nfight long-haul dumping by charging higher fees for disposal of waste \ncoming from other States. This bill passed the Senate with 68 votes.\n  During the 102d Congress, I introduced S. 197 to once again provide \nStates the authority to impose a fee differential for out-of-State \nwaste. In 1992, Senator Coats and I joined forces and produced \ncomprehensive legislation to provide States the authority to regulate \nwaste. That same year, the Senate passed an interstate waste bill by an \noverwhelming vote of 88 to 2. Unfortunately, the bill died in the \nHouse.\n  During the 103d Congress, I joined with Senators Coats and Boren in \nintroducing S. 439. Although the Senate didn't act until late in the \nsession, Congress came extremely close to passing an interstate waste \nbill. Again, the House stalled long enough to effectively kill the bill \non the last day of the session.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a waste bill, S. 543 which passed 94 to \n6. This legislation is a fair proposal that gives communities control \nof not only their own waste streams, but the flow of trash from other \nStates, it will protect\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\nimporting States like Kentucky and Indiana from becoming garbage \ncolonies for States who aren't willing to deal with their own waste \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, this issue has recently come to the forefront of \nnational news with the announcement of the closure of Fresh Kills \nlandfill in New York. This 3,000-acre monstrosity located on Staten \nIsland receives 26 million pounds of garbage daily. The 48-year-old \nlandfill, known as the world's largest garbage dump, is so enormous \nthat it can actually be seen by orbiting astronauts.\n  Closure of this facility will necessitate an astounding outflow of \ngarbage from New York City that will be absorbed by States as far away \nas Kentucky. I, for one, refuse to stand by and allow Kentucky to \nbecome a garbage colony.\n  Unfortunately, the House has absolutely stalled on this issue. \nHopefully, with the inclusion of the Coats amendment, interstate waste \nproblems will finally be addressed during a conference with the House \nof Representatives.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the interstate \nwaste amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana.\n  Last Congress, I introduced legislation to give localities the \nopportunity to restrict the flow of interstate waste into landfills in \ntheir communities. In my view, it is essential that local governments \nbe given the authority they need to determine for themselves whether to \naccept out-of-State waste. I am pleased that S. 534, the legislation \nwhich passed the Senate overwhelmingly last year, contained provisions \nthat will help protect communities from being inundated with unwanted \ngarbage generated out-of-State and provide localities with some \nleverage to deal with landfill developers who seek to dispose of out-\nof-State trash.\n  The pending amendment--identical to the one we passed last year--\ndeserves the support of all Members. In my view, it strikes the \nappropriate balance between importing States and exporting States, and \nsolves a problem which has persisted for too many years. Because this \nissue deals with interstate commerce, only Congress has the authority \nto resolve the problem of unwanted out-of-State garbage, as the \nSenators from Indiana, Michigan, and Montana have discussed. Therefore, \nI urge my colleagues to reaffirm our support for this legislation, and \nmake passage of this bill a priority during the remainder of this \nsession.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the floor, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see the chairman of the committee and \nthe ranking member on the floor. I mentioned earlier that I very much \nappreciate the statements by them, if they will urge the House to adopt \nthis amendment.\n  Might I ask the chairman of the committee, along with the ranking \nMember, if they will, in pushing this, consult with the chairman of our \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, as well as the ranking member as you work \nwith the House in attempting to persuade them to adopt the amendment. \nAs we all know, there might be give and take and some modifications. I \nvery much hope that the managers would consult the managers of the \nauthorizing committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me respond. This is not just a Republican bill. So \nI would say for the Record that we will consult not only with the \nchairman, but we will consult with the ranking member of the committee \nof jurisdiction as it moves its way through.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8965-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8972-S8974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend the managers of the bill we passed this morning, the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. In that measure, one of the amendments \naccepted by the managers deals with a subject that I have spent many \nmonths of my legislative career on. It is an issue that has become \neasier to talk about, by this Senator, but not easy to talk about. I \nhave spoken a number of times about the issue of female genital \nmutilation.\n  I was of course struck last week, Mr. President, when again I read in \nthe Washington Post, and the same article appeared in newspapers around \nthe country, that another young girl died as a result of this barbaric \npractice. This death occurred in Egypt, an 11-year-old girl.\n  Mr. President, these brutal, vicious practices take place all over \nthe world. These practices leading to death are not reported often, \neven though deaths occur frequently. In this instance, the one in the \nWashington Post last week, the Associated Press:\n\n       An 11-year-old girl bled to death after a botched \n     circumcision performed by a village barber, police officials \n     said today.\n       The officials said the child, whose name was given only as \n     Sara, died Friday in a Cairo hospital after doctors were \n     unable to stem bleeding.\n       The girl's clitoris was removed, in line with custom, by a \n     barber in a village in the Nile Delta the day before, when \n     several girls were circumcised during a village celebration. \n     . . .\n       The government has sought to end female circumcision . . . \n     a ritual aimed at keeping women clean and chaste. It has \n     banned the practice from state medical facilities.\n\n  Mr. President, what is this practice that is sweeping the country? It \nis something that has been in existence for a long time. FGM is the \ncutting away of female genitals and then sewing up the opening, \nleaving, many times, only a small hole for urine and menstrual flow. It \nis performed on children, but it is also performed on girls, and it is \nalso performed on young women, up to age 22 or 23 years old. The \ninitial operation, as indicated in this news article, leads to many \nhealth complications, complications that plague these young women most \nof their lives, if they are fortunate enough to survive the initial \ncut.\n  The immediate health risks are not over after a couple of months or \neven a couple of years after the operation. During childbirth, \nadditional cutting and stitching takes place with each birth, and all \nthis recutting and stitching creates scar tissue and emotional scars \nthat are not seen.\n  There is no medical reason for this procedure. It is used as a method \nto keep girls chaste and to ensure their virginity until marriage, and \nto ensure that after marriage they do not engage in extramarital sex.\n  In September 1994, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ncondemning this cruel practice and committed at that time to inform my \ncolleagues and the country about this practice. This sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution was passed. A month later, I introduced a bill to \nmake this procedure illegal in the United States, and called upon the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to identify and compile data on \nimmigrant communities that have brought this practice to the United \nStates. I have been joined in this effort by the junior Senator from \nIllinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, and the senior Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone. I am happy to report my legislation directing the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services was passed this year in the \nomnibus appropriations bill. Another amendment which criminalized FGM \nin the United States is still pending in the immigration bill.\n\n  Mr. President, this barbaric practice is now being conducted in the \nUnited States because of the inflow of people from around the world. We \nhave had a report in one California community where there were seven of \nthese practices committed on young women. I hope the conferees working \non the immigration bill are allowed to proceed and get this very \nimportant bill ironed out, and this provision I direct the Senate's \nattention to.\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\n  FGM is a practice that has been around for thousands of years. In \nfact, some say it was there during the time of Cleopatra. We need to \ncontinue to talk about it, insist upon aggressive education of \ncommunities, especially African communities that practice it, as well \nas implementation of laws prohibiting it.\n  Mr. President, 6,000 young women and baby girls are mutilated each \nday--6,000. Two million girls are mutilated a year, at least.\n  I have three little granddaughters and a daughter. To even think \nabout a procedure like this, on these people that I love--it is hard to \nconsider. Six thousand people, just like my little granddaughters and \nmy daughter, are having this done to them each day. It is estimated we \nhave had about 130 million girls and women genitally mutilated. The \npractice is predominantly practiced in Africa; 75 percent of all cases \noccur in Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia, and the Sudan. In \nSomalia, 98 percent of the girls are mutilated; 2 percent escape.\n  Today many African countries are sifting through their cultures and \nrevising some traditions while holding on to others. The time is right \nfor the international community to take a stand against this practice, \nwithout destroying the cultural integrity of the Africa countries where \nit is entrenched.\n  Mr. President, if the international community and some organizations \nare so concerned about human rights violations, why they do not talk \nabout this--some do--and why there is not an outrage in the \ninternational community to stop this, is beyond my comprehension. There \nare certain practices that take place in some countries. We do not like \nthe way they conduct their prisons. We do not like the way they handle \ntheir arrests, their interrogations. For Heaven's sake, why do we not \ncare what they are doing to 6,000 girls each day?\n  Mutilation is not required by any religion. It is an ancient \ntradition designed to protect virginity. That is what it is for. In \ncommunities where education initiatives have taken place, we are \nstarting to see the death rates are down and the health risks certainly \noutweigh the dated notion that this procedure will keep girls chaste. \nIn the past, FGM was mishandled on the international level. It was \nsensationalized and spoken about in a condescending manner. This \napproach created a defensive reaction, forcing the practice to go \nunderground.\n  As African immigrants move throughout world, taking this barbaric \npractice with them, many women are working to halt the practice in \ntheir new communities. Few are willing to speak up in their traditional \ncommunities. But this is occurring in countries where they immigrate. \nThey are immigrating to the United States, Canada Australia, France, \nand the United Kingdom, to name only a few.\n  The United States, I believe, is a world leader and needs to realize \nits influence in the world. I do not believe it is our place to go into \nother countries and dictate their traditions. But, at the same time, we \nneed to show African governments that we take this issue seriously. We \nneed help from others in the international community. We expect those \ncountries to work not only to pass laws stopping this, but to work to \neducate people about the harms of this ritual and, in the process, take \nsteps to eradicate the practice.\n\n  Most often we refer to FGM and women, but we need to look at this, \nMr. President, from the eyes of those who talk about child abuse. This \nis not spanking, this is not correcting children; this is mutilating \nchildren, and we certainly have to speak out against this.\n  Children do not deserve having this done to them. Young ladies do not \ndeserve having this done to them.\n  We know a lot about the psychological effects of child abuse. We know \nthat because we have had significant studies recently in the United \nStates. Imagine the psychological effect this must have on children \nfrom the initial operation throughout adulthood.\n  Mr. President, I first learned about this from a friend of mine. A \nmother of six children sent to me a videotape of a program that was on \none of the TV stations about this happening in Egypt.\n  A beautiful little 6-year-old girl comes to a party. She has on a \nwhite dress. She is dressed for a celebration--cake, drinks, party. \nSuddenly, they grab this little girl, spread her legs and cut her \ngenitals out. The little girl, when it is finished, screams, ``Daddy, \nwhy did you do this to me?''\n  Mr. President, 6,000 young children each day are screaming, ``Why did \nyou do this to me?'' The health complications are a constant reminder \nof the mutilation they underwent.\n  I had the opportunity and the pleasure to meet a courageous young \nwoman by the name of Stephanie Welsh. Stephanie is a young lady who \ngraduated from Syracuse University and wanted to see the world. She \nwent to work for an international news organization in Kenya.\n  While there, she became interested in this barbaric practice of \nfemale genital mutilation. She tried for a long time to get someone \nwithin the community to allow her to view one of these procedures. They \ndo 6,000 of them a day in the world, so they go on all the time in \nKenya. She could not get anybody in the city to allow her. They did not \ntrust this non-African from the United States.\n  So Stephanie went out into the country. She befriended some people, \nand they allowed her to take photographs of this ritual. A courageous \nwoman. In fact, the day she completed this, they had no water in the \nvillage. She couldn't drink the water because of typhoid, and she \nwalked 15 miles without water in the very hot desert Sun in Africa \ncarrying her film.\n  She had to go to a small community in the bush because communities \ncloser to the cities know the Western view of FGM is torture rather \nthan ceremony and would not allow her to observe.\n  This is the young girl. Her name is Seita. This beautiful child of 16 \nwas told that if she was going to continue her education, she had to \nhave her genitals cut out, in effect. So she came home and went through \nthis process. This is the girl.\n  This picture, which I hope you can see, shows five people over Seita. \nIt took five people to hold this strong 16-year-old down while they \nproceeded to circumcise her, is the gentle word.\n  This, Mr. President, is the picture that Stephanie Welsh--who, by the \nway, won a Pulitzer Prize for her courageous photography--this is Seita \nin the bush looking at herself to see what they have done to her.\n\n  Of course, Stephanie describes the scream of this 16-year-old girl. \nShe is checking herself here to see what has been cut away, if enough \nhas been cut away so they do not have to do it again.\n  The next one is the picture of the instrument of torture: a double-\nedged razor which you buy in a drugstore. I do not know how many times \nit has been used or what it has been used for. This is what they used \nto cut out Seita's genitals. You see the white on her hand. That is \nwhat they use to stop the bleeding. It is the fat from a sheep, sheep \nfat, goat fat, that they use. This is the hand that did the torture, \ndid the brutality.\n  Here, Mr. President, is something--I am used to the picture now, but \nI was not in the beginning--this is Seita's foot. This is the blood \nthat is flowing from her body after this torture. The red here is not \nsomething on the ground, it is not a blanket, it is not a scarf, it is \nSeita's blood, the blood on her foot, going up between her toes, on her \nother foot from her.\n  The final picture of the Pulitzer Prize-winning series is this girl \nbeing comforted by one of the village elders.\n  The pain will last for a lifetime and complications will last for a \nlifetime. So I very much appreciate the committee accepting this \namendment last night. This amendment will give the U.S. executive \ndirector of each international financial institution the power to \noppose loans for the government of any country that does not enact laws \nthat make it illegal and enact policies to educate and eliminate this \nbrutality.\n  I know the custom is deeply embedded in African culture, but that \ndoes not mean we should stand by and pretend it is not happening. \nSimply making it illegal will not be effective. Many of these \ncommunities are located in remote areas, and there would be no logical \nmeans to enforce the law. Therefore, more than making it illegal, we \nneed to insist upon governments educating people to the health risks \nand dispelling the myth that FGM keeps women chaste.\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\n  Mr. President, I very much appreciate the managers of this bill \nallowing me to speak on this issue which I feel very strongly about, \nand I hope the international community will join with us in educating \nand stopping this brutality of 6,000 girls each day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I want to speak about something that is \nin conference now between the House and Senate on the fiscal year 1997 \ndefense authorization bill, something I spoke about several times on \nthe floor of this body before. I think I have some new information. In \nfact, I do have some new information that I was not able to use in the \nlast debate.\n  This information has a direct bearing on the Marine Corps request for \n12 more generals that is a bone of contention in the conference between \nthe House and the Senate--the Senate supporting it, the House, thus \nfar, in their deliberations on the other side being opposed to \nincreasing the number of Marine Corps generals.\n  I did not have this particular piece of information when I addressed \nthis matter on the floor on June 26 and again on July 17. I spoke on \nthe extra Marine Corps generals during consideration of both the fiscal \nyear 1997 defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations \nbill. In fact, I offered an amendment to block the Marine Corps request \nfor more generals, but I failed.\n\n  These missing documents would have greatly strengthened my case. I \nwant to thank Washington Post writer Mr. Walter Pincus for his alerting \nme to the fact that these documents existed. I am not talking about \nsome purloined Pentagon documents either.\n  I am referring to the legislative history behind the current ceiling \non general officer strength levels. First, there is section 811 of \nPublic Law 95-79 enacted in July 1977. That established a ceiling of \n1,073 general officers after October 1, 1980.\n  Second, there is section 526 of title X of the United States Code, \nand this happens to be current law. Section 526 placed a ceiling on the \nnumber of general and flag officers serving on active duty at 865 after \nOctober 1, 1995.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these two sections of \nthe law printed in the Record, along with other relevant materials.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Public Law 95-79 [H.R. 5970]; July 30, 1977--Department of Defense \nAppropriation Authorization Act, 1978\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n       Sec. 811.

Of the number of officers \n     that may serve in the grades of admiral and vice admiral, as \n     determined under this subsection, not more than 25 percent \n     may serve in the grade of admiral.''.\n       (2) Such section 5231 is further amended--\n       (A) by striking out subsection (c):\n       (B) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as \n     subsections (c), (d), and (e), respectively; and\n       (C) by striking out ``numbers authorized under subsections \n     (b) and (c)'' in subsections (c) and (d) (as redesignated by \n     subparagraph (B) and inserting in lieu thereof ``number \n     authorized for that grade under subsection (b)''.\n       (3) Subsection (b) of section 5232 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) The number of officers serving in the grades of \n     general and lieutenant general may not be more than 15 \n     percent of the number of officers on the active list of the \n     Marine Corps above the grade of colonel.''.\n       (4) The second sentence of subsection (c) of such section \n     is amended by striking out the period and inserting in lieu \n     thereof a comma and the following: ``and while in that grade \n     he is in addition to the number authorized for that grade \n     under subsection (b) of this section.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nDepartment of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1978--Conference \nReport\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Reductions in Certain Military and Civilian Positions in the \n         Department of Defense\n       The Senate amendment to the House bill (sec. 302) provided \n     for a reduction in the number of general officers and \n     admirals by 23 below planned levels in fiscal year 1978 and \n     an additional reduction of 47 in fiscal year 1979 to an \n     authorized level of 1,071 and also provided for an alteration \n     of the statutory provisions governing admirals in the Navy \n     and generals in the Marine Corps to place them in a similar \n     position to the Army and the Air Force when the national \n     emergency provisions lapse. The Senate amendment (sec. 502) \n     also provided for a reduction in the number of civilians in \n     General Schedule grades GS-12 through 18, or equivalent, by 2 \n     percent in fiscal year 1978 and by the same proportionate \n     reduction as applied to generals and admirals for fiscal year \n     1979.\n       The House bill contained no such provisions.\n       The conferees agreed to reduce the authorized levels of \n     generals and admirals to 1,073 over a 3-year period beginning \n     with fiscal year 1978 and to apply a reduction to Defense \n     civilian employees in General Schedule grades GS-13 through \n     18, or equivalent, by the same proportionate amount over the \n     same period. The conferees feel strongly that the reductions \n     in the numbers of top-ranking military personnel should be \n     coupled with a concurrent reduction in the numbers in the top \n     six Defense civilian grade levels. For this reason, Sections \n     302 and 502 of the Senate amendment have been combined and \n     set out as a separate provision (sec. 811) in the general \n     provisions of the conference report. The conferees also agree \n     that all civilian reductions shall be accomplished through \n     attrition. The conferees concluded that a technical \n     correction of the Senate provision was required to achieve \n     consistency between statutory provisions affecting admirals \n     and Marine Corps generals and the general officers of the \n     other services.\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\n       The conferees agree on the need for a process to enable \n     Congress and the Department of Defense to develop criteria \n     for an ongoing review of the number of general officers and \n     directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report with the \n     fiscal year 1979 military authorization request on the \n     required numbers of general officers as well as any \n     justification for deferring the proposed military and \n     civilian reductions in whole or part.\n       The House recedes with an amendment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     Authorizing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1978 for Military \n Procurement, Research and Development, Active Duty, Selected Reserve, \n    and Civilian Personnel Strengths, Civil Defense, and for Other \nPurposes--Senate Report 95-129\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 302: Committee Amendment Reducing the Number of Generals \n         and Admirals\n       For fiscal year 1977, the Department of Defense plans to \n     have 1,165 generals or admirals--one flag officer for every \n     1,800 active military members. This number is in sharp \n     contrast to 1968 when during the Vietnam war, there was one \n     general officer for every 2,600 military members and to the \n     peacetime 1964 level when there was one general for every \n     2,100 military members. The Department of Defense proposed to \n     reduce the number of flag officers by 24 in fiscal year 1978. \n     The committee adopted an amendment to reduce this number by \n     an additional 23 in fiscal year 1978 and by 47 in fiscal year \n     1979. Since the services have undertaken different levels of \n     effort to reduce flag officers, the amendment gives the \n     President the authority to apportion the total number of flag \n     officers rather than applying a uniform reduction for each \n     service.\n       The purpose of this amendment is to begin a process to \n     enable Congress and the Department of Defense to develop \n     criteria for an ongoing review of the number of officers at \n     this level. The committee requests the Secretary of Defense \n     to submit a report with the fiscal year 1979 military \n     authorization request on the required numbers of general \n     officers including any justification for deferring the \n     proposed reductions in whole or part.\n       Within the total number of general officers authorized, the \n     Army and Air Force are restricted to having no more than 15 \n     percent of the total number of generals at the grades of \n     lieutenant general and general and no more than 25 percent of \n     the general officers at these two grades can be at the grade \n     of general. However, except in time of war or emergency, \n     certain specific numbers are included in law for the Navy and \n     Marine Corps: 26 vice admirals and four admirals for the \n     Navy, and two generals for the Marine Corps. In addition, the \n     Marines are restricted to a number of lieutenant generals and \n     generals total number of officers at the grades of lieutenant \n     general and no more than 10 percent of the number of general \n     officers. These provisions for the Navy and Marine Corps have \n     been suspended by the President under national emergency \n     authority which is expiring. The committee feels the \n     distribution of general officer authorizations by grade \n     should be consistent and has included provisions in the \n     amendment to make the restrictions for the Navy and Marine \n     Corps consistent with those for the Army and Air Force.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nUnited States Code, Title X\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n     Sec. 526.

In 1990, the Armed Services Committee decided there \nwere too many generals. The number needed to be reduced. The committee \ncut the number of generals from 1,073 in 1990 down to 858 by 1995. That \nis a reduction of 20 percent or, more specifically, 215 generals in \ntotal over a 5-year period of time.\n  Mr. President, how did this come about? What is the reasoning behind \nthe reduction? By answering these questions, I hope to help my \ncolleagues understand why the Armed Services Committee reduced the \nnumber of generals 6 years ago. If we understand why they did what they \ndid 6 years ago, perhaps we can understand why they are ready to move \nin the opposite direction today.\n  The legislative history does contain important clues. It should help \nus solve this riddle. Back in 1990, the Armed Services Committee could \nsee the\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\nhandwriting on the wall. They saw the cold war coming to an end. The \nSoviet military threat was evaporating, and the Defense Department was \ndownsizing and doing it in earnest. In 1990, the committee predicted \nthat there would be an overall force reduction of at least 25 percent \nbetween the years 1990 and 1995. Well, the committee's prediction was \nright on the money.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na table that shows how military end strengths have gradually declined \nsince February 1987.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                 Air            \n                         Fiscal year                             Total      Army      Navy      Force    Marine \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1987........................................................   2,174,217   780,815   586,842   607,035   199,525\n1988........................................................   2,138,213   771,847   592,570   576,446   197,350\n1989........................................................   2,130,229   769,741   592,652   570,880   196,956\n1990........................................................   2,043,705   732,403   579,417   535,233   196,652\n1991........................................................   1,985,555   710,821   570,262   510,432   194,040\n1992........................................................   1,807,177   610,450   541,883   470,315   184,529\n1993........................................................   1,705,103   572,423   509,950   444,351   178,379\n1994........................................................   1,610,490   541,343   468,662   426,327   174,158\n1995........................................................   1,518,224   508,559   434,617   400,409   174,639\n1996........................................................   1,493,391   499,145   428,412   393,400   172,434\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what the committee said would happen in \nfact did happen, and it is continuing to happen this very day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to also have printed in the \nRecord a table from page 254 of Secretary Perry's March 1996 annual \nreport to the Congress.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follos:\n\n               TABLE V-4--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERSONNEL               \n               [End of fiscal year strength in thousands]               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Fiscal year--               Percent\n                               ------------------------          change \n                                                         Goal   FY 1987-\n                                 1987    1996    1997              97   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nActive Military...............   2,174   1,482   1,457   1,418       -33\n  Army........................     781     495     495     475       -37\n  Navy........................     587     424     407     394       -31\n  Marine Corps................     199     174     174     174       -13\n  Air Force...................     607     388     381     375       -37\nSelected Reserves.............   1,151     931     901     893       -19\nDoD Civilians.................   1,133     841     807     728       -27\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This table shows the process of downsizing, that this \nprocess is ongoing and not over yet. It is expected to continue in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the committee concluded that the number of generals \nand admirals should be reduced consistent with the predicted reductions \nin the force structure. I want to repeat, the reduction in the number \nof general officers should be consistent with the reduction in force \nstructure. That was the logic. As the force structure shrinks, the \nnumbers of generals and admirals should come down at a comparable rate. \nThat was the Armed Services Committee's thinking as expressed in its \nreport in the fiscal year 1991 defense authorization bill. That \nthinking is outlined on page 159 of that Report 101-384.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that section of the \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n         GENERAL AND FLAG OFFICER ACTIVE DUTY STRENGTH CEILINGS\n\n       The committee recommends (sec. 403) a provision that would \n     establish ceilings on the number of general and flag officers \n     authorized to be on active duty for each of the military \n     Services as shown below:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Fiscal year, committee \n                                       Current       recommendation     \n                                       ceiling -------------------------\n                                                    1991         1995   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArmy................................       407          386          302\nNavy................................       258          250          216\nMarine Corps........................        70           68           61\nAir Force...........................       338          326          279\n                                     -----------------------------------\n  Total.............................     1,073        1,030          858\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The ceilings established for fiscal year 1995 are \n     consistent with the committee's expectation that force \n     structure and organizational realignments over the next 5 \n     years should result in an overall force reduction of at least \n     25 percent. The fiscal year 1995 ceilings reflect this \n     expectation, and the fiscal year 1991 ceilings set the \n     military Services on a responsible course to achieve the \n     fiscal year 1995 ceilings.\n       The committee also believes that these ceilings should \n     assist the military Services in making critical decisions \n     regarding the reduction, consolidation, and elimination of \n     duplicative headquarters. The ceilings should also assist the \n     military Services in eliminating unnecessary layering in the \n     staff patterns of general and flag officer positions.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Based on the shrinking force structure, the committee \nreduced the number of generals and admirals by that 20 percent as \nfollows: the Army, from 407 down to 302, a reduction of 105; the Navy, \na reduction of 42, down from 258 to 216; the Marine Corps, from 70 down \nto 61, a reduction of 9; the Air Force, from 338 down to 279, a \nreduction of 59.\n  Mr. President, with one exception, those figures remain the law \ntoday. The Marine Corps got special relief legislation 2 years ago that \nraised its ceiling from 61 to 68, or by 7. But back in late 1990, there \nwas no disagreement about what had to be done, reducing the number of \ngenerals as force structure gets smaller.\n  The House Armed Services Committee report contained almost identical \nlanguage. I quote from page 268 of House Report 101-665.\n\n       The committee believes that the general and flag officers \n     authorized strength should be reduced to a level consistent \n     with the extra force structure reductions expected by fiscal \n     year 1995.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that section of the House \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 section 441--flag and general officers\n\n       Section 526 of title 10, United States Code provides that \n     the total number of general and flag officers authorized to \n     be on active duty may not exceed 1,073. The committee \n     believes that the general and flag officer authorized \n     strengths should be reduced to a level consistent with the \n     active force structure reductions expected by fiscal year \n     1995. Section 441 would amend section 526 of title 10, United \n     States Code to limit to 845 the total number of general and \n     flag officers authorized within the military services on \n     September 30, 1995.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as the force structure shrinks, the \nnumber of generals and admirals should be reduced. That was the logic \nused by the House in 1990. That was the logic used by the Senate in \n1990. That logic is embodied in current law. That has always been the \nlogic since time began.\n  Let us apply that logic to the Marine Corps' request for 12 more \ngenerals. If the Marine Corps needs more generals, then it must mean \nthat the Marine Corps is getting bigger, that it is expanding. But all \nthe data point in the opposite direction. All the data indicate that \nthe military services, including the Marine Corps, are continuing to \ndownsize.\n  Why doesn't the 1990 logic apply anymore? Have Marine generals been \ninoculated to be immune from cuts? Why is the Marine Corps trying to \ntop size while it is downsizing? As the force structure shrinks, we \nneed fewer generals. That was the guiding principle used by the Armed \nServices Committee in 1990 when they put general officers on the down \nramp.\n  They put the generals on the down ramp even when the dark storm \nclouds were rising over the Persian Gulf. There was no talk about \nvacant war-fighting positions at that time. There was no talk, as we \nwere given an excuse for this increase, about the joint bill \nrequirements mandated in Goldwater-Nichols. There was just one driver. \nThe force structure was shrinking so we needed fewer generals. In other \nwords, it seems to me that they were expressing at that decisionmaking \ntime in 1990 common sense.\n  That logic was valid then. It is just as valid today. Nothing has \nchanged. There is no reasonable explanation for what is going down. It \nis bad public policy.\n  The Navy, for example, is already on record as saying it needs 25 to \n30 more admirals. We know that the Marine Corps request is just a \nspearhead. It is a test case. The Army and Air Force are getting their \nwish list ready. If the Marine Corps request goes through, then these \nother services will follow, meaning their request for more generals and \nadmirals. Pretty soon we have a national disgrace on our hands.\n  This is a bad move that will prove to be an embarrassment to the \nSenate sometime down the road.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for the consideration of \nthis point of view. I have expressed this in a letter to the conferees \nas well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5093.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 36, line 4, strike all of section 504, and insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. 504. Following section 4(g)(3) of the Northwest Power \n     Planning and Conservation Act, insert the following new \n     section:\n       (4)(g)(4) Independent scientific review panel.--(i) The \n     Northwest Power Planning Council (Council) shall appoint an \n     Independent Scientific Review Panel (Panel), which shall be \n     comprised of eleven members, to review projects proposed to \n     be funded through that portion of the Bonneville Power \n     Administration's (BPA) annual fish and wildlife budget that \n     implements the Council's annual fish and wildlife program. \n     Members shall be appointed from a list submitted by the \n     National Academy of Sciences, provided that Pacific Northwest \n     scientists with expertise in Columbia River anadromous and \n     non-anadromous fish and wildlife and ocean experts shall be \n     among those represented on the Panel.\n       (ii) Scientific peer review groups.--The Council shall \n     establish Scientific Peer Review Groups (Peer Review Groups), \n     which shall be comprised of the appropriate number of \n     scientists, from a list submitted by the National Academy of \n     Sciences to assist the Panel in making its recommendations to \n     the Council for projects to be funded through BPA's annual \n     fish and wildlife budget, provided that Pacific Northwest \n     scientists with expertise in Columbia River anadromous and \n     non-anadromous fish and wildlife and ocean experts shall be \n     among those represented on the Peer Review Groups.\n       (iii) Conflict of interest and compensation.--Panel and \n     Peer Review Group members may be compensated and shall be \n     considered as special government employees subject to 45 CFR \n     684.10 through 684.22.\n       (iv) Project criteria and review.--The Peer Review Groups, \n     in conjunction with the Panel, shall review projects proposed \n     to be funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget \n     and make recommendations on matters related to such projects, \n     to the Council. Project recommendations shall be based on a \n     determination that projects: are based on sound science \n     principles; benefit fish and wildlife; and have a clearly \n     defined objective and outcome with provisions for monitoring \n     and evaluation of results. The Panel, with assistance from \n     the Peer Review Groups, shall review, on an annual basis, the \n     results of prior year expenditures based upon these criteria \n     and submit ifs finding to the Council for its review.\n       (v) Public review.--Upon completion of the review of \n     projects to be funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife \n     budget, the Peer Review Groups shall submit their findings to \n     the Panel. The Panel shall analyze the information submitted \n     by the Peer Review Groups and submit recommendations on \n     project priorities to the Council. The Council shall make the \n     Panel's findings available to the public and subject to \n     public comment.\n       (vi) Responsibilities of the council.--The Council shall \n     fully consider the recommendations of the Panel when making \n     its final recommendations of projects to be funded through \n     BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget, and if the Council \n     does not incorporate a recommendation of the Panel, the \n     Council shall explain in writing its reasons for not \n     accepting Panel recommendations. In making its \n     recommendations to BPA, the Council shall: consider the \n     impact of ocean conditions on fish and wildlife populations; \n     and shall determine whether the projects employ cost \n     effective measures to achieve project objectives. The \n     Council, after consideration of the recommendations of the \n     Panel and other appropriate entities shall be responsible for \n     making the final recommendations of projects to be funded \n     through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget.\n       (vii) Cost limitation.--The cost of this provision shall \n     not exceed $2 million in 1997 dollars.\n       (viii) Expiration.--This paragraph shall expire on \n     September 30, 2000.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank both the chairman and the ranking \nmember of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for their understanding in \naccepting this modification to a provision already included at my \nrequest in this fiscal year 1997 energy and water bill.\n  Section 504 of that bill, and this modification, amend the Northwest \nPower Act to address a conflict-of-interest issue that was recently \nbrought to my attention by people in Washington and Oregon concerned \nand knowledgeable about salmon conservation.\n  The Bonneville Power Administration's annual fish and wildlife \nbudget, in real dollars spent on projects, totals well over $100 \nmillion. This $100 million comes out of the pockets of Northwest \nratepayers each year to protect and enhance fish and wildlife in the \nColumbia and Snake River basins. The Northwest Power Planning Council \nprepares and adopts a regional plan to protect fish and wildlife and \neach year allocates this $100 million to support that plan.\n  At the present time, the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority \nis responsible for making recommendations to the council on projects \nbeing funded through BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget.\n  The membership of the authority includes representatives of affected \nIndian tribes from the region, the Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and \nMontana State fish and wildlife directors, and representatives of the \nFish and Wildlife Service in the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  I am convinced that the authority plays an important and necessary \nrole in providing recommendations to the council on what fish and \nwildlife projects should be funded each year. I was disturbed to \ndiscover recently, however, that authority members were recommending to \nthe council that about $75 million of the $100 million spent in project \nmoney go to projects to be performed by the members of the authority \nitself. Mr. President, it is like the Department of Defense asking one \nof my other constituents, the Boeing Co., to decide what brand of \naircraft the military will use.\n\n  My amendment and this modification to the Northwest Power Act would \nensure that the authority and its members retain a voice in the \nprocess, but that sound objective and disinterested science also is \nheard. Each year, about 400 proposals are submitted for review by the \nauthority all applying to receive funding from the Bonneville funding \nadministration's annual budget. I am sure independent scientific review \nwould remove any suggestion of conflict of interest in connection with \nthese grants and add an important element of review to the council's \ndecisionmaking process. I am convinced it would also assure that the \nmoneys spent will result in the greatest possible salmon enhancement.\n  My amendment directs the council to establish an 11-member \nindependent scientific review panel from a list of names provided by \nthe National Academy of Sciences. The panel would be responsible for \nreviewing projects to be funded under BPA's annual fish and wildlife \nprogram. I understand the council, together with the National Marine \nFisheries Service, has already established an independent scientific \nadvisory board in order to provide scientific advice to the council and \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service.\n  I want to note in the Record at this time that nothing in this \namendment precludes the National Academy of Sciences from recommending \nthat some or all of the scientists who serve on the ISAB serve on the \nnewly created independent scientific review panel, provided that those \nmembers meet the conflict-of-interest standards spelled out in the \namendment. If ISAB scientists are selected to serve on the newly \ncreated panel of ours, they should not be compensated twice for the \nsame services.\n  After careful consultation with the National Academy of Sciences, I \nhave included a provision in my amendment that requires the council to \nestablish, from a list submitted by the National Academy, scientific \npeer review groups to assist the panel in making its recommendations to \nthe council. It is these peer review groups that will be doing the \nactual review of the 400-plus project applications submitted to the \ncouncil each year for consideration.\n  The panel will coordinate the work of the peer review groups and \nensure that each project is reviewed based upon the following \ncommonsense criteria: Does the project benefit fish and wildlife in the \nregion? Does the project have a clearly defined objective and outcome? \nAnd is the project based on sound scientific principles?\n  The amendment directs the panel to prioritize recommendations for the \ncouncil from the analysis provided by\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\nthe peer review groups and that the council make panel recommendations \navailable for public review. The amendment places a cost limitation on \nthe scientific review process of $2 million.\n  My amendment directs the council to review recommendations of the \npanel, the Columbia Basin Fish and Wildlife Authority and others, in \nmaking its final recommendations to BPA for projects to be funded \nthrough BPA's annual fish and wildlife budget. If the council does not \nfollow the advice of the panel, it is to explain in writing the basis \nfor the decision. The council is directed to consider ocean conditions, \namong others, in its decisionmaking process, and to determine whether \nproject recommendations employ cost-effective measures to achieve \nproject objectives.\n\n  Lastly, my amendment expressly states that the council, after review \nof panel and other recommendations, has the authority to make final \nrecommendations to BPA on projects to be funded through BPA's annual \nfish and wildlife budget.\n  This amendment is intended to be effective on the date of enactment \nand to be first implemented during the planning process for the \nexpenditure of BPA's fiscal year 1998 fish and wildlife budget. The \namendment will expire on September 30, in the year 2000, in order that \nits success can be measured by the people of the Pacific Northwest and \nthis Congress.\n  Mr. President, my amendment seeks to do just one thing: to make sure \nthat Northwest ratepayer dollars are being spent in a cost-effective \nand objective manner. I have consulted extensively with interested \ngroups in the region on this amendment and have listened to the \nconstructive suggestions of my colleague, Senator Murray, and that is \nwhy I am proposing that these changes to the amendment be included in \nthe committee bill.\n  My amendment will ensure that sound science principles are considered \nby the council before spending ratepayer dollars to protect and enhance \nfish and wildlife on the Columbia and Snake River System.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, will the senior Senator from Washington \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield to the junior Senator from Washington for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator. As you know, the Northwest Power \nAct requires the Power Planning Council and Bonneville Power \nAdministration to mitigate the effects of the hydro-electric system on \nfish and wildlife generally, and anadromous fisheries specifically. The \namendment proposed by the senior Senator would require the council to \nconsider ocean conditions prior to making its science-based \nrecommendations for mitigation priorities to Bonneville. Does the \nSenator agree that his amendment does not expand the scope of Northwest \nPower Act with respect to hydro system mitigation, nor does it make \nhydro system mitigation efforts contingent on known ocean conditions?\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the junior Senator for raising this important \nquestion, and agree with her characterization of the amendment. My \namendment does not expand the scope of either the council's or \nBonneville's mitigation requirements under the Northwest Power Act. It \nsimply suggests that it is valid for the council to consider known \nocean conditions when making its recommendations for hydro system \nmitigation to Bonneville.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nsession of the Senate on Friday and Monday, July 29, the Senate \nconsider Calendar No. 496, S. 1959, the energy and water appropriations \nbill, and the following amendments be the only first-degree amendments \nin order, and must be offered during the session on Friday or Monday.\n  The amendments are as follows: Domenici, relevant; Lott, relevant; \nJeffords-Roth, renewable energy; Kyl, central Arizona project; Grams, \nAppalachian Regional Commission; managers' package; McCain, regarding \nthe light-water reactor; McCain, relevant; McCain, relevant; Specter, \nSawmill Run; Pressler, relevant; Pressler, relevant; McConnell, USEC; \nLott, regarding environmental management; D'Amato, FUSRAP; Burns, one \non environmental management; Kempthorne-Craig, environmental \nmanagement; Gorton, independent scientific review; and Hutchison, DOE.\n  From the Democratic side: Senator Biden, relevant; Senator Boxer, \nthree relevant; Senator Bumpers, DOE weapons, a water project, and a \nseparate water project; Senator Byrd, relevant in two instances; \nSenator Conrad, water quality and bank stabilization; Senator Daschle, \ntwo relevant amendments; Senator Dorgan, two relevant amendments; \nSenator Feingold, one relevant; Ford, one relevant; Mikulski, one \nrelevant, along with Senator Sarbanes; Senator Johnston, relevant; \nSenator Kerry, electrometallugical treatment research; Senator Reid, \ntwo relevant; Senator Simon, two relevant; Senator Wellstone, regarding \nalfalfa; and Senator Rockefeller, regarding Japan semiconductors.\n  Now, it will be my intent to have these votes stacked at 10 o'clock \non Tuesday on a case-by-case basis.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I shall not object, this \nhas been cleared with the minority side?\n  Mr. LOTT. It has been cleared on the minority side.\n  I must say I am totally unimpressed with either side. A list of \namendments like this is totally ridiculous. I know a number of these \nwill be worked out, and the managers and the chairman will solve a \nnumber of these problems in the managers' amendment, but we ought to \nhave maybe two amendments total on this bill.\n\n  Maybe next week will be like this week--a miraculous cooperation will \nevolve and we will get it done quickly. I do not know why we have to go \nthrough this exercise of listing this stuff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest of the majority leader?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that with respect to any amendment on the \nColorado water project there be up to 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Campbell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask that all amendments be subject to second-\ndegree relevant amendments and may be offered on or after Monday, and \nfollowing the votes with respect to the amendments, the bill be read \nfor a third time and there be 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nMcCain, and the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. \n3816, all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of 1959 be \ninserted, the bill be advanced to third reading, and final passage all \noccur without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, about 2 years ago, Frontier Airlines began \njet airplane service in North Dakota. It was actually a carrier that \nhad previously quit service, and some years later a new group of people \nusing the same name, Frontier, reorganized and started a new airline.\n  Two years ago, when Frontier started service to parts of North \nDakota, we were fairly excited about that, because in a small, \nsparsely-populated State like North Dakota, we need more competition in \nairline services. North Dakota is served by one major carrier. The fact \nis that when you have one-carrier service--although I admire that \ncarrier--you generally pay higher prices, and you have the kind of \nservice they decide they want to give to you. So we were fairly excited \nthat we would get that jet airline service to North Dakota.\n  This morning, Frontier Airlines announced that it will withdraw its \nservice to North Dakota. I spoke with the president of the company this \nmorning. I also spoke with the Secretary of Transportation this morning \nabout this issue, and I want to comment for a moment about this matter \nbecause it deals with the larger issue of airline deregulation.\n  We have people in this Chamber, in the other Chamber, and out in the \ncountry who do handstands and all kinds of gymnastic feats when they \ndescribe the wonders of airline deregulation for America. They say the \nderegulation of the airlines has been remarkable. You get lower prices, \nand you get more service. Well, that certainly is true if you happen to \nlive in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, or perhaps a dozen other \ncities. If you are traveling from Chicago to Los Angeles, guess what? \nLook at an airline guide and you have all kinds of carriers to choose \nfrom, and they are vigorously competing with price and so on and so \nforth. Those are the benefits and virtues of airline deregulation. But \nthe fact is, if you do not live in one of the large cities, airline \nderegulation has not been a success for you. It means less service and \nhigher prices.\n  Now, what happened when we had airline deregulation was--and we have \nseen merger after merger in the combination of smaller airlines bought \nup or merged into the larger airlines and a subsequent concentration of \neconomic power--the airlines sliced up parts of the country into hubs, \nand they control the hubs and decide how they want to serve the public \nwith price and service. Then a new carrier starts up. How does a new \ncarrier compete when you have an airline industry that is now highly \nconcentrated with a few giant economic powers? The fact is, it does not \ncompete, and it cannot compete very well.\n  Two years ago, when this airline started, I went to the Secretary of \nTransportation and had a meeting with him in his office. I said, the \nfact is, a new jet carrier cannot start up and be successful under the \ncurrent circumstances unless the discriminatory practices that exist \nwith the big carriers against these new carriers are ended. The \nDepartment of Transportation has a responsibility to end it. That was 2 \nyears ago. Now, a jet carrier trying to serve a State like North Dakota \nand going into a hub like Denver, in order to be successful, is going \nto have the other major carriers provide code-sharing arrangements. \nBut, guess what? A very large airline carrier, one of the largest in \nthe country, would say to a carrier like this, I am sorry, we do not \nintend to cooperate with you under any circumstances--on ticketing, on \nbaggage--and we use our own computer reservation system, and you will \nnot even show up on the first couple of screens that travel agents pull \nup.\n\n  So what happens? The fact is that the new carriers that start up do \nnot make it because there are fundamentally discriminatory practices, \nand we have a Department of Transportation that drags its feet and does \nnothing about it. In the last couple of months, the Department of \nTransportation has started to do some things, but not nearly enough. \nFor 1\\1/2\\ years they did nothing. That result is evident not only in \nNorth Dakota, but also around the country where we see regional \nstartups trying to promote more competition in the airline industry. \nThe regional startups are squashed like bugs by the big carriers \nbecause of what, I think, are fundamentally anticompetitive practices.\n  Now, you can make a case, I suppose, that a big carrier does not have \nto cooperate with anybody under any conditions. I think it is a silly \ncase to make, but I know people will make that case. What that will \nlead to is the circumstance that now exists, only more concentrated, \nand with fewer carriers. We have only five or six major carriers in \nthis country. They have gotten bigger, with more economic power. They \nhave the capability of deciding anyplace, at any time, that a startup \ncarrier is not going to make it because they are not going to allow it.\n  I have a fistful of information here from travel agents and others, \nwho describe what they consider to be anticompetitive practices by \nother carriers against this startup carrier in North Dakota. I do not \nhave stock in this company. I do not know much about this company. I do \nnot care about one company versus another. All I care about is that we \nhave a circumstance where we have competitive airline service and an \nopportunity to get more and better service in a State like North \nDakota.\n  The current system, under deregulation, is an abysmal failure. Those \nwho twirl around like cheerleaders, believing this represents something \ngood for this country, ought to understand that it represents something \ngood for only part of the country; for those people lucky enough to \nlive in the major cities who are going to get more service at lower \nprices. For the people in the parts of the country where there is less \nopportunity and where we have a need for the startup of new regional \njet carrier services, the cheerleaders for deregulation ought to \nunderstand that these startups are squashed like bugs by the major \ncarriers of this country, and the major carriers do this under the \nwatchful eye of the people who are supposed to be concerned about \ncompetition.\n  I hope the Secretary of Transportation and the Department of \nTransportation are able, at some point, to take the kind of action that \nwe expect them to take to deal with these issues.\n  We have a DOT bill coming to the floor next week. I intend to be \nhere, if necessary, with a whole range of amendments talking about the \nairline issues and what DOT has or has not been doing on these issues. \nI might not get more than one vote for them. It would not matter much \nto me.\n  I am not going to sit by and see this happen. This notice today of \nthe withdrawal of service of another carrier in North Dakota means \nNorth Dakotans will have less service and pay higher prices once again. \nThe fact is, this is not brain surgery, and this is not a problem for \nwhich we do not know a\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\ncure or a solution. We understand the problem and we know the solution. \nThe solution is not to preach about deregulation and then decide you \ncould care less about whether there is anticompetitive behavior. If \nthis Government, this Congress, this Department of Transportation, or \nthis Secretary of Transportation, do not do something about the \nanticompetitive practices and anticompetitive behavior, we will never \nsee this problem resolved.\n  If I sound a little upset this morning, I am. I hope that perhaps \nsome discussions in the coming days might convince some of these \ncarriers, that are out there trying to make it in an anticompetitive \nenvironment, that somebody is going to do something to make it \ncompetitive and fair once again.\n  Mr. President, as I said, from what I hear about the Senate schedule \nnext week we will have the Department of Transportation appropriations \nbill on the floor. I intend to be over here actively and aggressively \nworking on some of these issues then. It may be the only appropriate \nand opportunistic way for me to make the point that I think needs to be \nmade.\n  So I appreciate the indulgence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8979-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8980-S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill, if I \nmay, for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I want to commend the managers of this \nbill and the staff for the energy and water development appropriations \nbill which I have in my hand which has a provision for the Mid-Dakota \nRural Water System for $7.5 million.\n  I hope in conference, or possibly in future developments, that the \nfunding level for mid-Dakota can be raised to $11.5 million, which is \nthe House level. I was disappointed with the administration only \nrecommended $2.5 million. While we need to change that, we can actually \nsave money on a contractual basis by accelerating this project and \ngoing to the $11.5 million level.\n  Let me say a word or two about the mid-Dakota project. It will bring \nwater into eastern South Dakota to 24 communities, and it will run from \nPierre to Huron, SD, along Highway 14 and surrounding areas.\n  In the State of South Dakota in eastern South Dakota we have a \nproblem with water. On my farm we have a rural water system hooked up \nwhere water is brought from a central source as opposed to farms in \nthis area that depend on wells. In this case, it takes the mid-Dakota \nproject. This project will bring water from the Missouri River \neastward. We have the great resource of the Missouri River in our \nState. It is almost unused. But this is using Missouri River water for \nour people.\n  I have had a number of meetings on this project over the past several \nyears. I met with Kurt Pfeifle yesterday, the general manager of mid-\nDakota project to discuss ways to get a higher funding level. I have \nmet with him and other South Dakotans who traveled here to propose this \nimportant project for 30,000 people in eastern South Dakota--Tom Edgar \nfrom Orient, Susan Hargens from Miller, Johnny Gross from Onida, Eugene \nWarner from Blundt, Mory Simon from Gettysburg, to name a few.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say in conclusion that I thank the managers \nof the bill for the $7.5 million that has been included for mid-Dakota. \nIt is a very important water project in our State. I hope that the \nlevel can be increased to $11.5 million.\n  I note that the administration included only $2.5 million in their \nrecommendations. So it has been a struggle. But it is very, very \nimportant to the people of South Dakota. To have clean drinking water \nfor livestock and people is very, very important to the farmers and the \npeople of eastern South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5093\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending business is the Gorton \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the Gorton amendment, and the \nother side has no objection to the Gorton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  The amendment (No. 5093) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5094\n\n (Purpose: To clarify that report language does not have the force of \n                                  law)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have two amendments. The first one is at \nthe desk. I ask for the immediate consideration of the first of the two \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5094. On page 36, line 1, strike all after the word \n     ``this'' through line 3 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following: ``Act.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I and my staff spend some time perusing \nthe appropriations bills as they come up. I will have comments on some \naspects of the bill before the bill is voted on.\n  But I was quite disturbed to see on page 36 of the bill beginning on \npage 35 where it says:\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of 31 U.S.C. funds made \n     available by this act to the Department of Energy shall be \n     available only for the purposes for which they have been made \n     available by this act, and only in accordance with the \n     recommendations contained in this report.\n\n  My understanding of that language in the bill is that it means that \nthe report language has the force of law.\n  Mr. President, that is just not something that is correct. It is not \nappropriate. It is not in keeping with the proper procedures used by \nthe Congress.\n  I hope that my colleague from New Mexico will accept the amendment to \nstrike that language. If not, obviously, I would want to ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I have no more discussion of that amendment. I am \nready to move on to the other amendment at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not prepared to accept the \namendment at this time. My counterpart is not here at this time. \nObviously, we both want to look at it in light of our reasons for \nputting it in. Our reasons for putting it in are different than the \nSenator's reasons for taking it out. We would like to discuss that. So \nwe will debate that at another time.\n  If the Senator is agreeable to proceed to another amendment, if he \nwould like, if he would set his aside, it will be properly sequenced.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would be glad to do that. Prior to doing \nso, I guess I would ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again I would be more than happy to engage \nin a discussion with both distinguished managers on this amendment. I \nhave only been here 10 years, but I have not seen such language in an \nappropriations bill. I would be very disturbed to see that became \ncustom here in the Senate although, if the Senator from New Mexico \nStates has other reasons for it being in there, I would be more than \nhappy to discuss that. And perhaps we could change that language so \nthat the effect of the language is not as I see it.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds to carry out the advanced light \n                         water reactor program)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have another amendment which I send to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5095.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ADVANCED LIGHT WATER REACTOR PROGRAM.\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used to carry out the advanced light water \n     reactor program established under subtitle C of title XXI of \n     the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13491 et seq.) or to \n     pay any costs incurred in terminating the program.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment terminates funding for the \nAdvanced Light Water Reactor Program, which provides taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies for corporations for the design, engineering, testing, and \ncommercialization of nuclear reactor designs.\n  I am pleased that Senators Feingold, Gregg, and Kerry of \nMassachusetts have joined me as cosponsors on this important amendment. \nI urge my colleagues to support us in ending this wasteful Government \nspending and corporate welfare.\n  Organizations such as Public Citizen, Citizens Against Government \nWaste, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Taxpayers for Common Cause, \nand the Heritage Foundation have lent their strong support to \neliminating the funding for the advanced light water reactor, and last \nyear a bipartisan Senate coalition, with the help of the Progressive \nPolicy Institute and the Cato Institute, included the Advanced Light \nWater Reactor Program as one of a dozen high-priority corporate pork \nitems to be eliminated.\n  Many Americans would be surprised to know that this program has \nalready received more than $230 million in Federal support over the \nlast 5 years. The Department of Energy has requested an additional $40 \nmillion for the program for fiscal year 1997. This program was created \nunder the Energy Policy Act of 1992. That act makes clear that design \ncertification support should only be provided for advanced light water \nreactor designs that can be certified by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission by no later than the end of fiscal year 1996.\n  The Department of Energy has acknowledged that no advanced light \nwater reactor designs that would be funded under this bill will be \ncertified by the end of fiscal year 1996. Thus, under the legislation \nno funds should be appropriated to support this program's designs.\n  Mr. President, this act specifies that ``no entity shall receive \nassistance for commercialization of an advanced light water reactor for \nmore than 4 years.'' The Department of Energy's 1997 funding request \nwould allow for a fifth year of Federal financial assistance to the \nprogram's chief beneficiaries, which are well-to-do corporations which \ncan afford to bear commercialization costs on their own.\n  General Electric, Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion \nEngineering have already received 4 years' of assistance under this \nprogram since 1993, and, significantly, these three companies had \ncombined 1994 revenues of over $70 billion, and last year their \ncombined revenues exceeded $100 billion. I believe these corporations \ncan afford to bring new products to the market without taxpayers' \nsubsidies.\n  One of the primary recipients of this program funding, General \nElectric, recently announced that it is canceling its simplified \nboiling water reactor after receiving $50 million from the Department \nof Energy because extensive evaluations of the market competitiveness \nof a 600 megawatt-sized advanced light water reactor have not \nestablished the commercial viability of these designs.\n  The program exemplifies the problems of unfairness, in my view, that \ncorporate welfare engenders. If this program's designs are commercially \nfeasible, large wealthy corporations like Westinghouse do not need \ntaxpayers to subsidize them because the market will reward them for \ntheir efforts and investment in this research. If they are not \ncommercially viable, then the American taxpayer is being forced to pay \nfor a product in complete defiance of market forces that a company \nwould not pay to produce itself.\n\n  As a practical matter, such unnecessary and wasteful Government \nspending must be eliminated if we are to restore fiscal sanity. More \nimportantly, though, as a matter of fundamental fairness, we cannot ask \nAmericans to tighten their belts across the board in order that we \nmight balance the budget while we provide taxpayer-funded subsidies to \nlarge corporations. Corporate welfare of this kind is unfair to the \nAmerican taxpayer. It increases the deficit, and we cannot allow it to \ncontinue.\n  Finally, there are no termination costs to worry about because the \nDepartment of Energy contract with Westinghouse specifically provides \nthat ``reimbursements shall be subject to availability of appropriated \nfunds.''\n  Enough is enough. After 5 years and $230 million, it is time we bring \nthe program to an end.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of letters from Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, Public Citizen, and the Competitive Enterprise \nInstitute be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Citizens Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I \n     am writing to urge you to introduce legislation to eliminate \n     the Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR) program. This program \n     has already surpassed its authorized funding level, and \n     extending its funding will exceed the goals of the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT).\n       In 1992, EPACT authorized $100 million for first-of-a-kind \n     engineering of new reactors. In addition, EPACT specified \n     that the Department of Energy should only support advanced \n     light water reactor designs that could be certified by the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission no later than the end of FY \n     1996.\n       In a surprise announcement on February 28, 1996, General \n     Electric (GE) terminated one of its taxpayer-subsidized R \n     light water reactor programs (the simplified boiling water \n     reactor), stating that the company's recent internal \n     marketing analyses showed that the technology lacked \n     ``commercial viability.'' Westinghouse, which is slated to \n     receive ALWR support between FYs 1997-99 for its similar AP-\n     600 program, is not expected to receive design certification \n     until FY 1998 or FY 1999. Taxpayers should not be expected to \n     throw money at projects with little or no domestic commercial \n     value.\n       EPACT also stipulates that recipients of any ALWR money \n     must certify to the Secretary of Energy that they intend to \n     construct and operate a reactor in the United States. In \n     1995, the Nuclear Energy Institute's newsletter, Nuclear \n     Energy Insight, reported that, ``all three [ALWR] designers \n     see their most immediate opportunities for selling their \n     designs in Pacific Rim countries.'' In Fact, GE has sold two \n     reactors developed under this program to Japan, and still the \n     government has not recovered any money.\n       As you may recall, CCAGW endorsed your corporate welfare \n     amendment, including the elimination of the ALWR program, to \n     the FY 1996 budget Reconciliation bill. We are again looking \n     to your leadership to introduce legislation to now eliminate \n     this program. I also testified before the House Energy and \n     Environment Subcommittee on Science on May 1, 1996 calling \n     for the elimination of the ALWR. The mission has been \n     fulfilled, now the program should end.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas A.

The ALWR program, having received five years of \n     support and more than $230 million of taxpayer money, is a \n     prime candidate for elimination in the coming budget cycle. \n     It represents a textbook example of corporate welfare, \n     provides little value to taxpayers and fails to account for \n     the fact that domestic interest in new nuclear technologies \n     is at an all-time low.\n       As of today, not one utility or company participating in \n     the ALWR program has committed to building a new reactor in \n     this country nor are there any signs that domestic orders \n     will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. Instead of \n     providing reactors for American utilities, the ALWR program \n     has become an export promotion subsidy for General Electric, \n     Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri in direct violation of the \n     intent of the Energy Policy Act. These companies, with \n     combined annual revenues of over $70 billion, are hardly in \n     need of such generous financial support.\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\n       Continuing to fund the ALWR program would send a strong \n     message that subsidies to large, profitable corporations are \n     exempt from scrutiny while other programs in the federal \n     budget are cut to reach overall spending targets. The \n     industry receiving this support is mature, developed and \n     profitable and should be fully able to invest its own money \n     in bringing new products to market.\n       This legislation is consistent with your long-standing \n     campaign to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending in \n     the federal budget. We salute your effort and offer our help \n     in pruning this subsidy from the fiscal year 1997 budget.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Bill Magavern,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Critical Mass Energy Project.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             Competitive Enterprise Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman McCain: I wish to commend you for your \n     efforts to eliminate funding for Advanced Light Water Reactor \n     (ALWR) research. As a longtime opponent of federal subsidies \n     for energy research of this kind, I am glad to see members of \n     Congress representing the interests of the taxpayer on this \n     issue.\n       Since 1992, the Department of Energy has spent over $200 \n     million on ALWR research, with little to show for it. If such \n     reactors are commercially viable, as supporters claim, then \n     there is no need to waste taxpayer dollars on what amounts to \n     corporate welfare. If the ALWR is not commercially viable, \n     then throwing taxpayer dollars at it is even more wasteful. \n     The fact that no utility plans to build such a reactor in \n     this country any time soon suggests that the latter is more \n     likely. Either way, federal funding for this program should \n     end.\n       I fully support your efforts to eliminate the ALWR research \n     subsidy and hope that this effort is the first step in the \n     eventual elimination of the Department of Energy as a whole.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Fred L. Smith, Jr.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last May, at the end May, there was an \ninteresting article in the Washington Post by Mr. Guy Gugliotta. I \nwould like to quote parts of his article.\n\n       Five or six years ago, depending on whom you asked, \n     Congress voted to fund research on a new kind of nuclear \n     energy plant called the Advanced Light Water Reactor. You \n     remember nuclear energy, right?\n       The money--more than $200 million so far--has gone to three \n     struggling firms--General Electric, Westinghouse, and Asea \n     Brown Boveri Inc./Combustion Engineering. The idea is to \n     develop a new generation of nuclear powered generators.\n       Except nobody in the United States wants one. No utility \n     has bought a nuclear plant since 1973, and 89 percent of \n     utility executives polled this year by the Washington \n     International Energy Group said they never would.\n       Even General Electric decided in February to abandon \n     research on one of its two reactor projects concluding that \n     ``extensive evaluations . . . have not established the \n     commercial viability of these designs.''\n\n  Mr. President, I would point out that I am a supporter of nuclear \npower. I believe that it is a viable option and someday will be a \nviable option, but I do not believe that justifies this kind of \nexpenditure.\n  Mr. President, the San Francisco Chronicle said, ``If there's a \nlucrative export market, let them finance their own development \nprograms.''\n  The Oregonian says, ``Asking taxpayers to subsidize nuclear power \nresearch is like asking them to build barns to store up horsepower.''\n  The Richmond Times Dispatch editorial lead says, ``Zap It.''\n  The Louisville Courier-Journal calls it ``A needless subsidy.''\n  The Kennebec Journal says, ``Reactor research funding deserves to be \nterminated.''\n  The Charleston Gazette says, ``Nuclear subsidy Corporate welfare?''\n  The Morning Sentinel of Maine says, ``Congress should switch off \nEnergy's nuke-pork project.''\n  The Bangor Daily News says: ``Members of the House and Senate have \nyet to justify the need for what amounts to a large corporate subsidy. \nIt is likely they cannot. Instead, they should end the program before \nit costs taxpayers any more money.''\n  The Houston Chronicle says, ``Time to stop federal subsidies for \nnuclear generators.''\n  And the Des Moines Register calls it ``Nuclear Nonsense.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these editorials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 28, 1996]\n\n                   Research for Reactor Nobody Wants\n\n                           (By Guy Gugliotta)\n\n       Five or six years ago, depending on whom you ask, Congress \n     voted to fund research on a new kind of nuclear energy plant \n     called the Advanced Light Water Reactor. You remember nuclear \n     energy, right?\n       The money--more than $200 million so far--has gone to three \n     struggling firms--General Electric, Westinghouse and Asea \n     Brown Boveri Inc./Combustion Engineering. The idea is to \n     develop a new generation of nuclear power generators.\n       Except nobody in the United States wants one. No utility \n     has bought a nuclear plant since 1937, and 89 percent of \n     utility executives polled this year by the Washington \n     International Energy Group said they never would.\n       Even GE decided in February to abandon research on one of \n     its two reactor projects, concluding that ``extensive \n     evaluations . . . have not established the commercial \n     viability of these designs.''\n       In the next couple of months Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), a \n     young conservative, will try to kill the Advanced Light Water \n     Reactor. It is a waste of money, he said, and, even if it \n     weren't, ``large corporations don't need the help of the \n     federal government.''\n       He has 65 signatures on an amendment to erase the reactor \n     from the 1997 Energy Department appropriations bill, and is \n     brimming with confidence since he successfully defunded a \n     gas-cooled reactor last year.\n       ``I understand the nuances of appropriations better,'' \n     Foley said, which is fortunate for him, because, as everyone \n     knows, starting federal programs is hard, but getting rid of \n     them is much harder.\n       And the nuclear industry is not going to roll over. ``In \n     the next decade, the balance of power demand will shift . . . \n     because of aging and environmental concerns,'' said Nuclear \n     Energy Institute spokesman Steve Unglesbee. ``We think \n     nuclear will be a contender.''\n       That would be a change. Nuclear power, once deemed the \n     magic bullet for energy consumption, has fallen on hard times \n     in the past two decades. Catastrophes like Three Mile Island \n     and Chernobyl haven't helped, but the main reason for the \n     current lack of interest is probably more mundane.\n       According to the Safe Energy Communication Council, which \n     doesn't like the reactor, nuclear energy today costs 5 to 10 \n     cents per kilowatt hour while coal-generated energy costs 1.5 \n     to 3.5 cents, natural gas, 3 to 4 cents, and windmills, 5 \n     cents. Utility executives can add.\n       The United States has 110 nuclear plants, supplying 20 \n     percent of the nation's electrical power needs. All use a \n     controlled fission reaction to generate heat, which in turn \n     makes the steam that drives turbine generators.\n       The Advanced Light Water Reactor seeks dramatic \n     improvements in the old design through new computer \n     technology and simplified safety features that rely more on \n     gravity and other natural forces and less on complex valve \n     systems.\n       Almost everything else about the reactor is in dispute. The \n     Energy Policy Act, signed into law in November 1992, \n     authorized five years of development funding. Because the \n     fiscal year had already begun the reactor's proponents say \n     the clock started in 1993, and this year's request--$30.3 \n     million--simply fulfills the five-year authorization.\n       Foley argues that because the act was signed in 1992, the \n     fifth year was 1996 and the current request is extra. \n     Besides, Westinghouse wants funding through 1998, he adds, \n     which is icing on the icing.\n       Unglesbee counters that the 1998 funding involves no extra \n     money. Instead, Westinghouse simply wants to pick up $17 \n     million owed from past years, and has signed a deal with the \n     Energy Department to get it.\n       Further, Unglesbee contends, the corporations will repay \n     the investment once the orders start rolling in--when old \n     reactors wear out or oil prices go up, or both, sometime in \n     the not-too-distant future.\n       The technology is good, Unglesbee adds, noting that GE is \n     using it in a joint venture in Japan. The Safe Energy \n     Council, however, says this is a violation of the law, \n     because the projects are supposed to be built in the United \n     States, which doesn't want then.\n       GE hasn't paid back a dime on the Japanese reactors, but \n     Unglesbee says that's because the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission hasn't yet certified the design. Once that \n     happens, the corporations have to kick back to the feds no \n     matter where reactors are built.\n       Until then, one supposes, taxpayers should simply regard \n     their investment as an export subsidy.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n        [From the Courier-Journal, Louisville, KY, June 4, 1996]\n\n                           A Needless Subsidy\n\n       Congressman John Myers, a moderate Hoosier Republican in \n     the last of his 30 years in the House, has an unbeatable \n     opportunity to make sure he's remembered for opposing \n     flagrant government waste.\n       Rep. Myers, a banker and farmer from the 7th District in \n     west central Indiana, chairs the Energy and Water \n     Appropriations Subcommittee. His panel is expected to decide \n     this week whether to approve more taxpayer money for private \n     development of advanced, and purportedly safer, nuclear \n     reactors.\n       This is an easy one and shouldn't require more than a few \n     moments of thought by Rep. Myers and his colleagues.\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\n       The committee should join forces on this issue with \n     environmentalists and taxpayer protection groups, consumer \n     advocates and conservative think tanks. All agree that what \n     amounts to subsidies for several multi-billion-dollar \n     companies is a poor investment and money down the drain.\n       Since World War II, Washington has lavished tens of \n     billions of dollars on civilian atomic research. The dream, \n     never realized, was that electricity generated by nuclear \n     plants would be abundant, safe and cheap. Although those \n     expenditures have been scaled back, the public has continued \n     to support programs at companies like General Electric and \n     Westinghouse.\n       It could happen that a new generation of safer, more \n     efficient reactors will prove handy many years hence. If that \n     time comes, rich corporations can surely be counted on to \n     invest their own resources to complete work on a commercially \n     successful design. Taxpayers have done more than their share.\n       But there'll be no market for nukes of any kind in this \n     country so long as such basic problems as safe long-term \n     disposal of radioactive waste remain unsolved.\n       Given the new competitive pressures in the utility \n     industry, no manager with any concern for his company's \n     financial stability would even think of going nuclear. Demand \n     is as dead as the villages and fields near the burned-out \n     reactor in Chernobyl.\n       The only potential customers for the fruits of America's \n     tax-supported research are Asian countries, but exports would \n     give rise to new concerns about proliferation of nuclear \n     materials.\n       That should clinch the case for Rep. Myers and others on \n     the committee to do the taxpayers a very large favor. Just \n     vote no.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Kennebec Journal, June 3, 1996]\n\n           Reactor Research Funding Deserves to Be Terminated\n\n       While it is always hard to start up a federal program, it's \n     even harder to stop one. Such is the case with many pork-\n     barrel schemes Congress creates and then keeps on funding for \n     no apparent reason that it lacks the will to turn off the \n     flow of money.\n       Congress is currently considering continuation of funding \n     for something called the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced \n     Light Water Reactor, which over its five-year life span has \n     cost taxpayers $230 million.\n       This despite the fact that no utility has built a new \n     nuclear plant in the past 23 years and that according to a \n     poll conducted by the Washington International Energy Group, \n     89 percent of utility executives claim they will never order \n     another nuclear plant.\n       Yet the research and development lives on. The Advanced \n     Light Water Reactor program was created under the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 and was supposed to be funded for only \n     five years. When the fifth year actually ends is in some \n     dispute since fiscal years and calendar years overlap, but \n     the 1997 DOE appropriations bill includes a $30.3 million \n     request to fulfill the original obligation.\n       The money--which critics such as the Safe Energy \n     Communication Council contends is little more than corporate \n     welfare--goes to multi-national corporations, including \n     General Electric and Westinghouse to develop the advanced \n     nuclear reactors.\n       Such governmental largesse has caught the eyes of \n     government-watch-dog groups as diverse as Citizens against \n     Governmental Waste, Friends of the Earth and the U.S. Public \n     Interest Research Group, which have petitioned Energy \n     Secretary Hazel O'Leary to eliminate the program.\n       Already 65 members of Congress have signed onto a request \n     to scrap what they term wasteful spending that amounts to \n     little more than an export promotion subsidy since the \n     reactors would be sold overseas.\n       Maine's two congressmen, James B. Longley in the 1st \n     District and John E. Baldacci in the 2nd, may soon get a \n     crack at this issue.

In fact, U.S. utilities have canceled \n     every nuclear reactor they've ordered since 1973.\n       Let's face it, nuclear power in the United States, no \n     matter how you might feel about it, is a dead issue. It's \n     simply too expensive to compete with alternative energy \n     sources.\n       So why then are the Clinton administration and Congress \n     continuing to provide taxpayer dollars to subsidize research \n     and development of the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced \n     Light Water Reactor?\n       The House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee \n     should be prepared to answer that question next week when it \n     considers the Energy Department's proposal to give additional \n     funding to the light-water reactor research program.\n       The facts clearly do not support further public subsidies \n     for conventional nuclear fission development.\n       Consider this:\n       A recent poll conducted by the Washington International \n     Energy Group shows that 89 percent of utility executives \n     surveyed say their companies would never consider ordering a \n     nuclear power plant.\n       Only 8 percent of those surveyed believe that there will be \n     a nuclear power resurgence in the next century.\n       A 1996 survey of registered voters, conducted by Republican \n     pollster Vince Breglio, found that more than 71 percent of \n     the voters opposed government funding for developing a new \n     generation of nuclear reactors.\n       The advanced light water reactor research program was \n     created in 1992 to assist major multinational corporations--\n     General Electric, Westinghouse and Asea Brown Boveri/\n     Combustion Engineering--in developing advanced reactors. \n     Never mind that there was no U.S. market for a finished \n     product. This is a pork-barrel of the worst kind. It defines \n     what is meant by the phrase ``corporate welfare.''\n       Besides all of that, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which \n     created this corporate welfare, expires in September, so why \n     is the Energy Department requesting additional funding \n     through fiscal 1997 and perhaps beyond?\n       It's not as if the three major nuclear vendors are going \n     broke and need extra bucks to finish the job. They showed \n     combined revenues of $73 billion last year.\n       Moreover, General Electric announced in February it was \n     abandoning development of its boiling-water reactor, which to \n     date has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies \n     under this program.\n       The Energy Policy Act of 1992 clearly stipulates that \n     recipients of the Advanced Light Water Reactor money must \n     certify that they intend to construct and operate a reactor \n     in the United States. Yet these nuclear reactor manufacturers \n     are selling their U.S. taxpayer-supported reactor designs to \n     Japan, South Korea and other countries--a clear violation of \n     the intent of the law.\n       Not only has the $275 million the government has paid out \n     since 1992 been spent under false pretenses, but some of the \n     taxpayer dollars for this program also have been wrongly used \n     to reimburse General Electric, Westinghouse and Combustion \n     Engineering for fees charged them by the U.S. Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission.\n       This means taxpayers, not the corporations, are paying fees \n     meant to cover the costs of government services.\n       The conservative Citizens Against Government Waste, Cato \n     Institute and Taxpayers for Common $ense organizations, as \n     well as a variety of environmental groups, are united in \n     their opposition to continued funding for this boondoggle.\n       Even leaving the valid taxpayer-subsidy arguments aside, \n     continuing this program clearly is in conflict with \n     congressional efforts to cut the federal budget deficit, \n     reduce federal spending and kill corporate welfare programs.\n       Rep. Jim Bunn, R-Ore., who has used these themes in his \n     campaign for re-election, serves on the House Appropriations \n     subcommittee that will decide the fate of advanced light \n     water reactor funding next week.\n       Oregonians should be relying on him to be fiscally \n     responsible and take these reactor vendors off welfare.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n           [From the Richmond Times-Dispatch, June 23, 1996]\n\n                                 Zap It\n\n       Wouldn't it be nice if Congress could eliminate all \n     examples of dubious federal spending with a single stroke of \n     a mighty pen or Bowie knife? Government doesn't work that \n     way, of course, which is one reason the feds spend more of \n     the taxpayers' money than they should. Cuts generally occur \n     the slow way: one at a time. And that brings us to the \n     Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\n       Fermat's Last Theorem is easier to prove than--for liberal \n     arts majors, at least--the ALWR is to explain. Let's just say \n     the ALWR is a nuclear reactor, and leave it at that. Despite \n     generous (profligate?) government subsidies, research into \n     the ALWR has produced few dividends. In a letter opposing \n     continued funding for the reactor, the Heritage Foundation \n     argues:\n       As a recipient of this research funding has indicated, \n     these reactors have not established their commercial \n     viability. There have been no nuclear reactors ordered or \n     built in America since 1973, and there is no domestic market \n     for nuclear power in the foreseeable future. . .If the \n     reactors truly would be profitable, then corporations would \n     willingly invest their own capital to receive the expected \n     returns. This is the nature of the free market. If an \n     investment has a low probability of being profitable, \n     however, the federal government should not force taxpayers to \n     fund corporate ventures which unnecessarily drain our \n     nation's wealth.\n       Nuclear power remains a prudent way to generate juice, \n     probably the most prudent way ever devised. Many of the \n     obstacles placed in its path are lamentable. Nevertheless, \n     R relating to nukes is not an obligation of government but \n     of industry. Government's role in power is to avoid impeding \n     progress. Except perhaps in times of national crisis, the \n     responsibility for producing energy rests with the private \n     sector. The last time we checked, the U.S. was not fighting a \n     world war. Morever, the companies involved in nuclear \n     research are hardly poor.\n       Welfare reform ranks among the year's hot issues. \n     Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, \n     gadflys and cranks are debating how best to promote self-\n     sufficiency. Corporate welfare also deserves some shaking up. \n     The subsidies for the ALWR stand as one example of what \n     government ought not to be doing. Congress should give the \n     ALWR--and similar projects--the zap.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, May 20, 1996]\n\n               End Corporate Welfare for Nuclear Reactors\n\n       No American electric utility has successfully ordered a \n     nuclear power reactor for the last 23 years. And a recent \n     survey of utility executives concluded that there is ``little \n     hope that new nuclear generation'' will remain an option ``in \n     a time frame that has any practical significance.''\n       So why are U.S. taxpayers still being asked to fork over \n     hundreds of millions of dollars to mature, highly profitable \n     private companies to develop new nuclear power reactors?\n       The House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee is \n     scheduled to take up that question later this week as it \n     looks for fiscal 1997 budget savings among existing energy \n     programs. A prime candidate should be the Department of \n     Energy's five-year-old Advanced Light Water Reactor program, \n     a shining example of corporate welfare that has never \n     delivered--and probably never will--a single kilowatt of \n     electricity to American consumers.\n       The idea of subsidizing industry research on a generic, \n     pre-licensed and safer type of reactor for the American \n     market may have made sense five years ago. But except for the \n     reactor's export potential, it's hard to see how a \n     continuation of the program, which is scheduled to expire \n     this year, can be justified.\n       Just four months ago, General Electric, which has received \n     $50 million from the program to develop a prototype, \n     announced that it was abandoning the effort because its own \n     market research had ``not established the commercial \n     viability of these designs.''\n       Indeed, the only markets where new U.S. designed nuclear \n     plants are viable are in Southeast Asia. Westinghouse, one of \n     the program's major benefactors, has identified China and \n     Indonesia as the most likely markets for its reactor--despite \n     a U.S. ban on exports of nuclear technology to China.\n       But the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which created the \n     subsidy, specifically stipulated that the funds were for \n     development of reactors to be constructed and operated in the \n     United States--not reactors for export. And if, in fact, \n     there is a lucrative export market, there's no reason why \n     companies like Westinghouse and General Electric, with \n     combined revenues of close to $70 billion a year, can't \n     finance their own development programs without help from \n     taxpayers.\n       This piece of nuclear pork was nearly killed last year by \n     an unlikely coalition of environmental liberals and budget-\n     slashing fiscal conservatives. With electric utility \n     deregulation now adding to an already large surplus of \n     electric generating capacity in the United States, the \n     reasons for letting the subsidy fade into the sunset in \n     September, as scheduled, are better than ever.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, May 23, 1996]\n\n                            Nuclear Nonsense\n\n       A trio of events has brought the lurid legacy of nuclear \n     energy to the fore in recent days. The first was the \n     anniversary of a nuclear disaster, the second, the need to \n     divert some hot fuel from the weapons market; the third, the \n     need to shut of the federal money spigot feeding a dying \n     industry.\n       The 10th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster late last \n     month was a reminder of how wrong things can go, and how one \n     country's energy source can be another's poison. The reactor \n     explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the former Soviet Union \n     spread a cloud of radiation over Europe, releasing 200 times \n     as much radiation as Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Thirty-\n     two died, but thousands more may have radiation-related \n     illnesses.\n       Nothing even close to Chernobyl has happened in the 111 \n     nuclear-power plants in the United States. Civilian reactors \n     have admirably clean records. But there have been some \n     harrowing near-misses.\n       Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Energy has announced \n     plans to import some 20 tons of nuclear waste from 41 nations \n     to keep it out of the hands of potential terrorists. Most of \n     it will come from Europe, and some from Asia, South America \n     and Australia. The United States sent the stuff overseas as \n     fuel over a 40-year period. Some of it is weapons-grade \n     uranium.\n       Finally, Congress will soon vote on whether to continue the \n     taxpayer subsidy of the Advanced Light Water Reactor, a \n     project that has gobbled up $275 million.\n       The 1992 ALWR project was intended to improve the design of \n     nuclear-power plants in the United States, where no new nukes \n     have been built in a generation. Nobody was enticed by ALWR, \n     either, so the tax money went for reactor designs destined \n     for overseas markets, enriching Westinghouse and General \n     Electric (which hardly need federal subsidies).\n       Everybody from the conservative CATO Institute to the \n     liberal U.S. Public Interest Research Group wants the program \n     junked. Said Jerry Taylor, CATO's natural resources director, \n     ``If ALWR is such a promising technology let the nuclear \n     industry fund it themselves.''\n       The project expires this year. But the U.S. Department of \n     Energy wants another $40 million to keep it going.\n       Since 1948, when atomic power was being hyped as the energy \n     source of the future, ``too cheap to meter,'' nuclear fission \n     has received $47 billion in federal money for research and \n     development. A bunch of that was spent after utilities gave \n     up on it in the early 1970s.\n       Today the nation is faced with the apparently impossible \n     task of finding a way to safely dispose of nuclear waste that \n     will remain dangerous for thousands of years. Reactor after \n     reactor was built on the assumption that ``someday'' science \n     would learn how to handle the waste.\n       Science hasn't. ``Temporary'' storage pools are close to \n     overflowing. Nevada is fighting plans to bury it there; \n     everyone else is fighting plans to ship it through their \n     states to Nevada.\n       Exhibit A: Chernobyl, the ultimate accident. Exhibit B: \n     weapons-grade uranium, the ultimate terrorist tool. Exhibit \n     C: hot waste, the ultimate white elephant.\n       Despite that sorry scenario, the U.S. Department of Energy \n     wants more money to make the program even worse.\n       Baloney.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Morning Sentinel, June 3, 1996]\n\n         Congress Should Switch Off Energy's Nuke-Pork Project\n\n       While it is always hard to start up a federal program, it's \n     even harder to stop one.

The Advanced \n     Light Water Reactor program was created under the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 and was supposed to be funded for only \n     five years. When the fifth year actually ends is in some \n     dispute since fiscal years and calendar years overlap, but \n     the 1997 DOE appropriations bill includes a $30.3 million \n     request to fulfill the original obligation.\n       The money which critics such as the Safe Energy \n     Communication Council contends is little more than corporate \n     welfare goes to multi-national corporations, including \n     General Electric and Westinghouse to develop the advanced \n     nuclear reactors.\n       Such government largesse has caught the eyes of government-\n     watchdog groups as diverse as Citizens against Governmental \n     Waste, Friends of the Earth and the U.S. Public Interest \n     Research Group, which have petitioned Energy Secretary Hazel \n     O'Leary to eliminate the program.\n       Already 65 members of Congress have signed onto a request \n     to scrap what they term wasteful spending that amounts to \n     little more than an export promotion subsidy since the \n     reactors would be sold overseas.\n       Maine's two congressmen, James B.

This, \n     unfortunately, has not stopped the federal government from \n     spending $235 million in the last five years on nuclear \n     research for a new style of nuclear power plant, nor has it \n     slowed members of Congress from asking for more money--$30 \n     million this year--for the project.\n       This is not a knock on government-sponsored research but a \n     questioning of priorities. The tax money used for developing \n     the Advanced Light Water Reactor has gone largely to three \n     firms: Westinghouse, General Electric and Asea Brown Boveri \n     Inc./Combustion Engineering. All of them are well able to \n     support their own work and would, if it ever had a chance of \n     turning a profit.

Mr. President, every day, the working families of \nMassachusetts have to make tough choices about what they can afford, \nhow to pay the rent, or whether they can send their kids to college.\n  The Federal budget deficit, while reduced considerably due to \nPresident Clinton s leadership and the courage of the Democratic-\ncontrolled Congress in 1993, is still over $100 billion a year. We \nabsolutely must get a grip and bring the Federal Government's \nexpenditures within its means.\n  Like families in Massachusetts, I have been working in the U.S. \nSenate to make the tough choices concerning our Federal budget.\n  In 1994, I successfully led the fight to eliminate funding for the \ndangerous advanced liquid metal reactor.\n  Last year, I stood with Senators McCain, Feingold, and Thompson in an \neffort to cut $60 billion in corporate welfare programs to get rid of \nwasteful Federal spending and reduce the deficit.\n  Today, I am proud to continue that fight as a cosponsor of Senator \nMcCain's legislation to cut one of the biggest examples of corporate \npork, the Advanced Light Water Reactor Program.\n  This program has already spent over $200 million of taxpayer money to \nimprove the designs of nuclear power plants that nobody in this country \nwants. There is no demand for more nuclear power plants in the United \nStates. No utility has bought a nuclear power plant since Richard Nixon \nwas President.\n  This program is the definition of corporate pork. The three companies \nwhich received the majority of funding for this program had a combined \nprofit of $80 billion last year. It is unconscionable for the Federal \nGovernment to subsidize the research and development budgets of these \ncompanies when we cannot sufficiently fund our schools or put enough \ncops on the beat to make our communities safe.\n  In 1992, the Congress funded research for this project for 5 years \nending in 1996. Now proponents of the advanced light water reactor say \nthat they need 3 more years of funding to finish the designs that no \none wants. This is just corporate pork and it has to be stopped now.\n  Proponents of this program cite China as a prime market for the \ndesign despite the fact that it is illegal to sell China this \ntechnology.\n  Proponents also argue that corporations are going to repay the \nFederal Government for its investment in the Advanced Light Water \nReactor Program once they receive orders for these new plants. However, \nGeneral Electric has already canceled part of this project because it \nis not commercially viable.\n  For all these reasons the advanced light water reactor must be \nstopped.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He has made \nin a very few moments as good an argument as there is going to be \nagainst this program, and he did not fill the air with all kinds of \ntechnical things but went right to the heart of it. Surely this has \nbeen before us before, but obviously it will be taken up briefly in \nopposition, and then it will take its place among the votes to occur on \nTuesday.\n  I understand the Senator may have a bit of difficulty being here on \nMonday. I understand that. He can rest assured we will try to get the \nyeas and nays at the earliest moment, so he can be assured of that.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Turney,\n                                                        Secretary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                               Attorney General of\n\n\n                                                   New Mexico,\n\n                                      Santa Fe, NM, July 17, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: I write to you concerning language \n     in draft Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittee reports \n     addressing the proposed Animas-La Plata Project. Because some \n     of the statements in the reports are false and because other \n     statements appear to encourage bypassing of federal laws, I \n     urge you to contact members of the Appropriations Committees \n     to urge that the problematic language be stricken from those \n     reports. Alternatively, I ask that you seek clarification \n     from Committee members on the intent underlying the reports. \n     Although this report language does not carry the force of \n     law, it has great potential to mislead agencies, courts, and \n     the public at large, to the detriment of all.\n\n\n                       New Mexico ``Commitments''\n\n       The Subcommittee reports state the following: ``For \n     purposes of initiating construction of Stage A, the existing \n     repayment obligations of the parties contracting for water, \n     along with the commitments of the States of Colorado and New \n     Mexico, provide adequate assurances that the United States \n     will be repaid in connection with construction of those \n     facilities.'' (Emphasis added.) This language indicates \n     erroneously that the State of New Mexico has made a financial \n     commitment toward the construction of the Animas-La Plata \n     (ALP) Project. I know of no such financial commitment. \n     Although the State Legislature in 1991 authorized $2 million \n     in severance tax bonds to assist San Juan County with ALP \n     start-up costs, in 1993 the Legislature took the money back \n     and authorized it for other purposes. Because the State of \n     New Mexico has no outstanding financial commitment toward \n     repayment of ALP construction costs, this report statement is \n     erroneous and should be stricken.\n\n\n            Evasion Of Federal and State Environmental Laws\n\n       Addressing environmental impacts of the ALP Project, the \n     reports state:\n       ``The present documentation is fully informative of these \n     issues and construction of the first stage of the project may \n     proceed without adversely affecting any of the other water \n     users on the San Juan system.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``The Committee is aware that the San Juan River and its \n     tributaries do not consistently meet New Mexico's newly \n     adopted water quality standards for selenium and that there \n     is concern over the potential effect of the operation of the \n     Animas-La Plata facilities in Colorado on this existing \n     problem. The Secretary of the Interior should take reasonable \n     steps to assist Colorado and New Mexico in improving the \n     quality of surface flows by addressing the problems caused by \n     non-point sources.''\n       This language is problematic because it implies a \n     congressional finding of the adequacy of the environmental \n     documentation for the project and a concomitant exemption \n     from full compliance with the National Environmental Policy \n     Act. Yet the adequacy of the ALP EIS and its supplement is in \n     gave doubt. Just recently, EPA stated that it ``ha[d] \n     identified significant shortcomings in the level and scope of \n     [environmental] analysis,'' and that ``this EIS process [for \n     ALP] has not adequately considered the impacts to Navajo \n     water rights and existing water projects, water quality, \n     mitigation, and the impacts associated with municipal and \n     industrial use.''\n       Neither the New Mexico Environment Department nor this \n     office has completed a review of the new documentation, but \n     preliminary analyses indicate that it is sorely lacking, \n     particularly in relation to the Project's water quality \n     impacts in New Mexico and the absence of analysis of \n     alternatives that would meet the terms of the 1988 Colorado \n     Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act. There is simply no \n     basis for a congressional pronouncement that the \n     environmental documentation for the Project ``is fully \n     informative of these issues.''\n       Moreover, the reports' implications that New Mexico's only \n     water quality concern relates to its recent adoption of a new \n     selenium standard are false. The ALP Project threatens to \n     violate or exacerbate existing violations of multiple state \n     water quality standards, including selenium, mercury, and \n     possibly others. The 1994 state selenium standard was adopted \n     unanimously by the state Water Quality Control Commission on \n     the basis of extensive and convincing scientific evidence \n     that a higher standard would not be protective of aquatic \n     life.\n       In addition, a direction to the Secretary of Interior to \n     take steps to address nonpoint source pollution in New Mexico \n     issued simultaneously with a mandate to proceed with \n     construction of a project that, if its agricultural \n     irrigation components are included (Stage B of Phase I and \n     Phase II), will lead to large new nonpoint source pollution \n     problems in the State is both ironic and nonsensical. If the \n     reports' intent is to require the Secretary to mitigate the \n     adverse water quality impacts of the Project, then such \n     mitigation should be identified, described, and committed to \n     in the environmental documentation for the Project, rather \n     than being relegated to a vague allusion in a congressional \n     report.\n       Contrary to the reports' implications, Stage A cannot be \n     viewed in isolation from the remainder of the Project, \n     especially the remainder of Phase I. Construction of Stage A \n     would not satisfy the requirements of the 1988 Colorado Ute \n     Indian Water Rights Settlement Act. Stage B, which involves a \n     great deal of irrigation and related impacts on New Mexico \n     water quality, must also be constructed in order to meet the \n     terms of the Settlement Act. Since, as the Reports note, New \n     Mexico already had a severe water quality problem in the \n     river stretches affected by the Project, any further \n     deterioration of water quality in that area is not \n     acceptable. Thus, this language, which implicitly endorses \n     evasion of the Clean Water Act and State water quality \n     standards, should be excised.\n       Please urge the Committees to strike the erroneous language \n     concerning ALP from their reports and to remove from the \n     reports all implications that compliance with federal and \n     state laws may be short-circuited in order to commence \n     Project construction as hastily as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Udall,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n\n                       Garrison Diversion Project\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the appropriations process provides once \nagain a payment for something called the Garrison Diversion Project, \nwhich is a very important project, fulfilling a promise made by the \nFederal Government to the State of North Dakota 40 years ago.\n  I appreciate very much the help of the Senator from New Mexico, the \nSenator from Louisiana, and others on those issues.\n  I wanted to thank them today for that assistance. It is part of a \npromise--keeping a promise to a State for water delivery from a series \nof dams that were built in North Dakota that flooded a half a million \nacres. That flood came and stayed. We were told that, if you will \naccept the permanent flood, we will give you some benefits over the \nnext 50 or 60 years.\n  That is what this process has been about--benefits that will in the \nlong run allow jobs and opportunity and economic growth in a rural \nState that needs it, but also benefits that are the second portion of a \npromise that was made if we kept our portion.\n  We now have a permanent flood of a half a million acres. This payment \nonce again is another installment in the Federal Government keeping its \npromise to the people of North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\n                      Hanford Nuclear Reservation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this afternoon I want to discuss the \nHanford Nuclear Reservation, a place important to me, to the people of \nthe State of Washington, and to the Nation.\n  Hanford, as my colleagues on both sides of this aisle continually \npoint out, has had its share of problems and challenges for the Nation. \nThat goes without saying when you are the caretaker to 80 percent of \nthe Nation's spent plutonium and 177 tanks filled with millions of \ngallons of nuclear byproducts. Nuclear weapons production and its \nassociated hangover--cleanup--are tasks that no one wants any more, not \nOregon, California, New York, or Alaska. You name it, people in other \nStates of this Nation have gladly accepted the benefits of the efforts \nconducted at Hanford, freedom provided by a strong nuclear deterrent, \nbut they are relatively uninterested in the mess that is left behind.\n  Instead, Hanford's critics collectively plug their noses, complain \nabout the lack of results they have received from the money invested in \ncleanup so far. Not only is that disdainful of Hanford's contribution \nto this Nation's security and freedom, but it is also plain wrong. Over \nthe past 2 years, the Department of Energy, the Hanford community, and \nthis Congress have made real progress toward getting on with real clean \nup.\n  Mr. President, I would focus this afternoon on three things. I will \ntell you what has been achieved and actually cleaned up over the last 2 \nyears; I will tell you what more can be expected; and I will make the \ncase for why we need a continued investment in the site.\n  Cleanup successes at Hanford are beginning to pay off in a big way. \nThe management strategy developed by the Department of Energy is \nincreasing productivity for less money; its making the site a safer \nplace to work; and it has tackled, albeit clumsily, the disturbing but \nnecessary task of trimming the workforce.\n  With a focused management strategy, DOE allowed Hanford to perform \nthe full projected $225 million environmental restoration work over the \npast 2 years with only $175 million. This is a $50 million dollar \nsavings. More importantly, DOE canceled its cost-plus contracting, and \nentered into one of the most aggressive performance-based contracts in \nits entire complex. The work force has been cut by 4,774 jobs, and \ncosts associated with equipment, inventory, training, and travel have \nall been slashed. Despite these cuts, important cleanup milestones are \nconsistently met.\n  Workers at Hanford are in the field, pushing dirt rather than paper. \nTwo years ago, 72 percent of Hanford's employees did paperwork, while \nonly 28 percent actually did cleanup. Today, that field versus non-\nfield ratio has flipped completely.\n  Here are some other accomplishments worth nothing:\n  2,300 metric tons of corroding spent nuclear fuel will be stabilized \nand moved away from the Columbia River three years ahead of schedule \nand $350 million under budget;\n  The cost of solid waste disposal has been reduced by 75 percent over \nthe last 5 years, making the price of cleanup lower than commercial \nequivalents;\n  Decontamination of PUREX, the Plutonium Uranium Extraction Plant, is \n16 months ahead of schedule, $47 million under budget and upon \ncompletion in 1997 will cut its annual mortgage cost from $34 million \nto less than $2 million;\n  450 unnecessary DOE regulations and orders have been eliminated;\n  The 50-year practice of discharging contaminated water to the ground \nsoil has been terminated;\n  7.5 million gallons of water have been evaporated from the tank \nfarms, slowing the leaks and avoiding $385 million in costs for new \ntanks;\n  Hanford workers have reduced the generation of new mixed radioactive \nwaste by almost 200,000 gallons a year;\n  Safety performance at the site has jumped from the bottom 25 percent \namong DOE sites to the top 25 percent in the fiscal year 1994-95 \ntimeframe;\n  Worker compensation costs have fallen as safety performance \nincreased: $700,000 was saved on Hanford 6-month insurance and workers \ncompensation bill alone;\n  17.1 million gallons of ground water were treated;\n  Over 20,000 cubic yards of contaminated soil were excavated, while \n141,000 pounds of tetrachloride were removed from the ground water;\n  44,000 highly radioactive fuel spacers were removed from the Columbia \nRiver; and\n  The baseline costs for DOE's Remedial Action Project were reduced by \n$800 million and its scheduled improved by 9 years.\n  I could go on, but I am afraid I would lose the point of this \ndiscussion within the nuances of technical achievements. That is just a \npart of what has been accomplished in the past 24 months. You can \nexpect more.\n\n\n                     where we are going at hanford\n\n  This year, the House and Senate passed comprehensive legislation in \nthe 1997 Defense Authorization Act to help lock in greater efficiencies \nat DOE sites. The legislation, sponsored by myself and Doc Hastings in \nthe House, grants expanded authority to site managers to take quick \naction on cleanup projects; it places strict limits on costly paperwork \nstudies; lays down a 60-day time limit on DOE headquarters review of \nbudget transfers; and it establishes systems to demonstrate and deploy \nnew technologies. Again, many thanks to my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee for their help in seeing this legislation passed.\n  Within the next few weeks, a new 5-year performance based contract, \nwhich will include incentives to ensure tax dollars are spent \nefficiently, will be awarded at the site. A new management and \nintegrator system will be implemented where the lead contractor--much \nlike on the space station project--will hire subcontractors at the most \neconomical price to complete work at Hanford.\n  Finally, DOE is expected to award two private contracts to dispose of \nthe 54 million gallons of radioactive waste upon completion of its \nremoval from the 177 underground tanks situated at the site. And \nalthough I have generic questions over the scope and nature of DOE's \ntank waste remediation system project, I think privatization is the \nonly way it will be able to meet its requirements to clean that portion \nof the site. The Department's pursuit of a two step cleanup process \nallows for new technologies and developments to be incorporated into \nthe second phase of the project. It has been projected that by using \nprivate expertise, DOE is likely to reduce the costs of tank cleanup by \nas much as $13 billion. That is billion with a B.\n  We are going to take these three events and push the Hanford \nmanagement system even harder. Greater productivity can be squeezed out \nof Hanford, and these initial first steps are a good start.\n\n\n it's our state, our river, these are our people--we are not going to \n                                retreat\n\n  Last year in the conference on the energy and water appropriations \nbill, the House and Senate were locked in an intense struggle regarding \nincreased funding for defense environmental restoration and waste \nmanagement within the DOE complex. I told my entrenched colleagues from \nthe House that this DOE is doing a better job than its predecessor. For \nSenator Murray, Senator Hatfield, and myself, this is life or death. \nIt's our State, our river, these are our people. We are not going to \nretreat. I have not changed my position from that conference one bit.\n  The people of the Tri-Cities and the Columbia River are critical to \nWashington's economic health. Granted, Hanford has been a nagging cough \nfor some time. But we are beating the systemic problems at the site; we \nare driving costs down in terms of management, overhead, and \nsuperfluous expenses; we are getting on with cleanup.\n  President Clinton came to Congress with a budget proposal for nuclear \nwaste cleanup which was woefully inadequate. The Senate rightly \nrestored over $200 million to the defense environmental restoration and \nwaste management account. It did not abandon Hanford, as this \nadministration clearly did. We will not let up pressure to get this \nsite clean, because to do so would be a tragic waste of the investment \nwe have already made. An investment, which most of my colleagues know, \ntotals in the billions.\n  So, Mr. President, I have outlined the progress we have made at \nHanford, and I have pointed out where we intend to\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\ngo. I hope my colleagues will acknowledge that Hanford cleanup is \nworking. My colleagues need to recognize that, and push aside the \nstereotypes that for too long have been associated with Hanford. We \ncan't forget what Hanford has contributed to the defense of this \nNation, and we certainly should not back away from the commitment we \nhave to get this site clean.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask if there are any other Senators \nwho would like to present their amendments? We can be here for a while \nif there are. Soon we are going to get wrap-up from the leader, a \nunanimous-consent here. I will try to get that quickly so we do not \nkeep the Presiding Officer here.\n  We will have a quorum call so I will see if we can get that done \nexpeditiously.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8980-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 75th \nanniversary of the Rehoboth Beach Patrol [RBP] and the patrol's 75-year \nperfect safety record. Every summer, Rehoboth Beach, DE, is inundated \nwith tens of thousands of vacationers from Delaware, Maryland, D.C., \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania. And every summer, the lifeguards of RBP \nreunite over 400 lost children with their parents, treat hundreds of \ninjuries, and save scores of swimmers.\n  All too often, with people too busy at work, or in this case, too \nbusy at play, years of work, dedication, and perfection go overlooked. \nIt is only fitting and proper that RBP be recognized after so many \nperfect years of service.\n  With the leadership of Capt. Paul ``Doc'' Burnham in the 1940's, \nthrough the firm discipline of Capt. Frank ``Coach'' Coveleski in the \n1950's through the 1970's, to current Capt. Jate Walsh, the swimmers of \nRehoboth beach have been, and continue to be, guarded by the best \nDelaware has to offer. As for the future, Lieutenants Tom Coveleski and \nDerek Shockro strive to continue our great Delaware tradition into the \nnext century.\n  On behalf of my fellow Delawareans, and the literally hundreds of \nthousands of vacationers that have enjoyed the safe beaches of Rehoboth \nfor so many years, I say thank you. And best of luck to Rehoboth Beach \nPatrol, as it works on another 75 years of perfect service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8988-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to require certain expenditures by the Federal \nReserve System to be made subject to congressional appropriations, to \nprohibit the maintenance of surplus accounts by Federal Reserve banks, \nto provide for annual independent audits of Federal Reserve banks, to \napply Federal procurement regulations to the Federal Reserve System, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n         The Federal Reserve Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Reid and I are introducing \nlegislation to eliminate the kinds of budgetary excesses and \naccountability lapses at the Federal Reserve Board that were recently \nuncovered by the General Accounting Office [GAO]. At a time when many \nFederal agencies are downsizing and making tough choices about their \nspending priorities, the Federal Reserve ought to be tightening its \nbelt too. Regrettably, however, the opposite appears to be the case at \nthe Federal Reserve.\n  During the past several years, Congress has embarked on a historic \nand painful path toward deficit reduction. Since 1993, the Federal \ndeficit has been slashed by more than one half.\n  The Federal Reserve Board's Chairman, Alan Greenspan, has been one of \nthe loudest cheerleaders for deficit reduction. But a one-of-a-kind GAO \nreport about Federal Reserve expenditures between 1988 and 1994 shows \nus that Chairman Greenspan apparently hasn't been practicing what he \npreaches.\n  A few weeks ago, the GAO released the final version of its \ncomprehensive report about the management of the Federal Reserve \nSystem. This report, which took the GAO over 2 years to assemble, \nuncovers disturbing financial practices and management failures within \nthe Federal Reserve System. The report is packed with examples where \nthe Fed could substantially trim costs, and makes specific \nrecommendations for changes in Fed operations. Unfortunately, the \nFederal Reserve has already dismissed most of the GAO's recommendations \nas irrelevant or unnecessary.\n  The GAO report shows that during the late 1980's and early 1990's \nthat Federal Reserve expenditures jumped by twice the rate of \ninflation. While Fed employee benefits and travel costs are out-pacing \ninflation, the rest of the Federal Government has been downsizing. For \nexample, between 1988 and 1994, Federal Reserve employee benefit costs \nskyrocketed by nearly 100 percent--as compared to about 60 percent for \nthe Federal Government--according to the GAO report.\n  The report also reveals that over 120 Federal Reserve employees \nactually make more than Chairman Greenspan. In fact, overall personnel \ncost increases at the Federal Reserve represented over 70 percent of \nthe total growth in the Fed's operating expenses during the years \nexamined by the GAO. This runaway spending is remarkable given Chairman \nGreenspan's rhetoric about the need for belt-tightening in the rest of \nthe government.\n\n  Inexplicably the Federal Reserve also keeps a $3.7 billion cash \nsurplus account of taxpayer's money to protect against losses, despite \nthe fact that the Fed hasn't suffered a loss for 79 consecutive years.\n  Senator Reid and I are introducing legislation today to address these \nproblems. Our bill, the Federal Reserve Fiscal Responsibility Act of \n1996, includes many of the changes recommended by the GAO. It would do \nthe following:\n  First, the GAO, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, will \nidentify and report to Congress a list of the Federal Reserve System \nactivities that are not related to the making of monetary policy. After \nthe report is completed, all nonmonetary policy expenditures, as \nidentified by the GAO, would be subject\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nto the congressional appropriation process. We do not intend to inject \npolitics into monetary policy with this provision. However, over 90 \npercent of the Fed's operations have nothing to do with interest rate \npolicy according to the GAO. And there is simply no good reason why the \nFed's nonmonetary expenditures are immune from the same kind of \noversight and review required of other Federal agencies.\n  Second, the Federal Reserve is required to immediately return more \nthan $3.7 billion of taxpayer's money that has unnecessarily \naccumulated in its surplus account to the Treasury. In addition, the \nbill asks the GAO to determine the extent to which any of the Fed's \nfuture net earnings should be transferred to the general fund of the \nTreasury each year.\n  Third, the regional Federal Reserve banks will be subjected to annual \nindependent audits. This provision merely codifies what the Federal \nReserve has been doing for the most part in recent practice.\n  Finally, the Federal Reserve will be required to follow the same \nprocurement and contracting rules that apply to other Federal agencies. \nThese rules should help to prevent the kinds of favoritism highlighted \nin the GAO report and increase competition among contract bidders with \nthe Fed. This requirement ought to substantially reduce procurement \ncosts on a system-wide basis.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us as cosponsors of this much-needed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from North \nDakota to introduce legislation which we believe will improve fiscal \nmanagement within the Federal Reserve System.\n  In September 1993, Senator Byron Dorgan and I requested a General \nAccounting Office [GAO] investigation of the operations and management \nof the Federal Reserve System [Fed]. We were concerned because no close \nexamination of the Fed's operations had ever been conducted before. As \nCongress scrutinizes each Federal expenditure in an attempt to balance \nthe budget, it is imperative that we be well informed on all activities \nthat affect the Government's finances. Surprisingly, this GAO study was \nthe very first look into the internal operations of the Fed and, to \ndate, there has never been an annual, independent audit of the Nation's \ncentral banking system. Further, because of its self-financing nature, \nthe Fed's operating costs have largely escaped public investigation. It \nwas high-time we opened the door and examined the workings of this \nlarge and influential public entity.\n  The landmark GAO report, issued in June 1996, raises serious \nquestions about management within the Fed. One of the most astonishing \nfindings of this comprehensive, 2-year study was that the Fed had \nsquirreled-away $3.7 billion in taxpayer money in a surplus fund, which \nit claims is needed to cover system losses. In its entire 79 year \nhistory, however, the Fed has never operated at a loss. The GAO report \nindicates that this fund could be safely reduced or eliminated and \nreturned to the Treasury Department, as is standard practice with \nsurplus revenues. It is nonsensical for this cash to be sitting idle at \nthe Fed instead of being used to reduce the deficit.\n  While the rest of the Federal Government has tightened its belt and \ndown-sized, the GAO report revealed that the Fed has enjoyed enormous \ngrowth in its operating costs and highly questionable growth in its \nstaffing. The GAO study found that operating costs at the Fed have \ngrown 50 percent between 1988 and 1994, a rate twice that of inflation \nand much greater than overall Federal discretionary spending. The study \nalso uncovered salary growth at a rate of 44 percent between 1988 and \n1994. During the same time period, personnel benefits skyrocketed \nnearly 90 percent. Further, the GAO report revealed nonuniform travel \npolicies and an excessive 66 percent increase in travel expenses.\n  The picture the GAO report paints of the internal management of the \nFed is one of conflicting policies, questionable spending, erratic \npersonnel treatment, and favoritism in their procurement and \ncontracting policies. The report makes it clear that the Fed could do \nmuch more to increase its fiscal responsibility, particularly as it \nurges parsimonious practices by all other Federal agencies.\n  The compelling evidence offered by the GAO report indicates that many \nof the practices of our Nation's central bank should change, especially \nwhen their budgetary excesses represent a direct cost to taxpayers. The \nsurplus fund, along with increasing bloat, perks, and benefits begs \ngreater accountability. For these reasons, I rise today with my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, to introduce the Federal \nReserve Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1996. This measure follows some of \nthe recommendations of the GAO report and seeks to improve the Fed's \nfiscal management.\n  The Federal Reserve Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1996, requires the \nComptroller General of United States, in cooperation with the Fed \nBoard, to identify the functions and activities of the Board and of \neach Fed bank which relate to U.S. monetary policy. After September 30, \n1997, all nonmonetary policy expenses of the Federal Reserve System \nwill be subject to the congressional appropriations process. \nSurprisingly, the monetary policy expenses represent less than 7 \npercent of the Fed's annual expenses. Our bill would subject the Fed to \nthe cost reduction pressures that affect other public agencies, and \nensure congressional oversight over the Fed's questionable spending of \ntaxpayer money.\n  Further, the Federal Reserve Fiscal Responsibility Act addresses the \ndisturbing matter of the surplus fund. It requires the transfer of all \nFed surplus funds to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit in the \ngeneral fund of the Treasury. This would occur 30 days after enactment \nof the legislation. Annually thereafter, the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States will determine what percentage of the net earnings of the \nFederal Reserve banks should be deposited back in the Treasury. This \nprovision would free-up this money for use in deficit reduction.\n  Our bill also will apply regular Federal procurement procedures to \nthe Fed Board and to each Federal Reserve bank. This will eliminate the \npossibility of favoritism and conflict of interest in procurement and \ncontracting policies.\n  Finally, and perhaps most significantly, our measure would require an \nannual, independent audit of the Fed. An annual audit is fiscally sound \npolicy which would instill greater public confidence in our banking \nsystem.\n  I want to make it very clear that I am not attempting to interfere \nwith, or impugn, the monetary policy of the Fed. I am merely seeking \ngreater accountability in the operating expenses and internal \nmanagement of one of our most influential institutions.\n  I look forward to greater discussion of this issue by Congress, and \nencourage the committee to give favorable consideration to our \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Ford, Mr. Robb, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \n        Simpson, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Glenn):\n  S. 1995. A bill to authorize construction of the Smithsonian \nInstitution National Air and Space Museum Dulles Center at Washington \nDulles International Airport, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Rules and Administration.\n\n\nthe smithsonian institution national air and space museum dulles center \n  at washington dulles international airport authorization act of 1996\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself, and Senators Ford, Robb, Moynihan, Simpson, Cochran, \nand Glenn. This legislation would authorize the Board of Regents of the \nSmithsonian Institution to construct the Smithsonian Institution \nNational Air and Space Museum Dulles Center at Washington Dulles \nInternational Airport. The legislation clearly states that no \nappropriated funds may be used to pay any expense of the construction \nof the center. Funds for the construction will be privately raised and \nin fact this legislation permits the Smithsonian to move forward with a \nfundraising drive.\n  In 1983, the Smithsonian Board of Regents first approved the National \nAir and Space Museum plan to expand at Washington Dulles International \nAirport. In 1993, after 10 years of hard work by the Smithsonian \nInstitution, the Virginia congressional delegation, five Virginia \nGovernors, and many\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\nlocal officials, Congress passed and the President signed legislation \nauthorizing the Smithsonian Institution to plan and design the National \nAir and Space Museum Extension at Washington Dulles International \nAirport.\n  This legislation would serve to further the objectives of the \nNational Museum Amendments Act of 1965 which directs the National Air \nand Space Museum to ``collect, preserve, and display aeronautical and \nspace flight equipment of historical interest and significance.''\n  I believe that it is accurate to state that the National Air and \nSpace Museum now holds the most impressive and significant collection \nof air and spacecraft in the world. However, due to the limited \nexhibition space in The Mall building coupled with the size and weight \nof many of the artifacts, only 20 percent of the museum's collection is \non display. Therefore, such significant air and spacecraft as the \nBoeing 367-80, the Saturn V launch vehicle, the Boeing Flying Fortress, \nthe B-29 Enola Gay and the space orbiter Enterprise cannot be displayed \nand enjoyed by the nearly 10 million visitors the museum receives each \nyear. In addition, the museum's space limitations inhibit the \ninterpretation of aerospace technology's significant contribution to \nAmerica and the possibilities which it holds for the future.\n  The Air and Space Museum Dulles Center will allow approximately 65 \npercent of the Smithsonian's air and spacecraft collection to be on \ndisplay. The center will also allow visitors to view the restoration \noperations and see first-hand how historic air and spacecraft are \npreserved.\n  Mr. President, I call on every Member of the Senate to support this \nlegislation which will make the expansion of the National Air and Space \nMuseum at Washington Dulles International Airport a reality. Air and \nspace technology has and will continue to greatly impact every facet of \nour lives. The creation of this extension will enable visitors from all \nover the world to experience first-hand the magnitude and significance \nof America's technological achievements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 1996. A bill to amend the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994 to allow certain grant funds to be used to \nprovide parent education; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    The Healthy Families Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer a bill that I believe \nrepresents an important step forward in the fight against child abuse \nand crime.\n  This legislation will make healthy families programs eligible for \nfunding under the local crime prevention block grant, in the 1994 crime \nlaw. Essentially, this bill would add the healthy families program to \nthe list of prevention programs eligible for funding under the block \ngrant.\n  The link between child abuse and later involvement in violence and \ncrime is becoming ever more clear. According to a 1992 Justice \nDepartment report, 68 percent of youths arrested had a prior history of \nabuse and neglect, and abused girls were 77 percent more likely than \nnonabused girls to be arrested as juveniles.\n  The healthy families initiative has proven to be very successful in \ncombating this cycle of violence. The program was pioneered in Hawaii \nin the 1980's. According to the Hawaii Department of Health, 2,254 at-\nrisk families received healthy families services over a 5-year period. \nOut of that total, abuse was reported in only 16 families. This success \nshows that the program was able to prevent abuse in 99.3 percent of at-\nrisk families in Hawaii.\n  The success of this program is based on the voluntary, comprehensive, \nand culturally appropriate home visitor systems. These systems provide \nparenting education that focuses on parenting skills, child \ndevelopment, child health, and support services for new parents, in \norder to prevent or decrease the risk of child abuse.\n  As a result of this success, the program has now spread to other \ncommunities throughout the United States. The money which would be \nprovided under the block grant, would help other communities create \nthese greatly needed healthy families programs.\n  Spending money on child-abuse prevention is a sound investment. Not \nonly will it create future savings in the judiciary system and other \nsocial services, but even more importantly it's an investment in the \nlives of our children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation I am introducing today appear in the Record.\n  The being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARENT EDUCATION SYSTEM.\n\n       Section 30201(a)(2) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(O) Voluntary, comprehensive, and culturally-appropriate \n     home visitor systems that provide parenting education that \n     focuses on parenting skills, child development, child health, \n     and support services for new parents to prevent or decrease \n     the risk of child abuse. To avoid duplication of services, a \n     system developed pursuant to this paragraph shall be \n     coordinated with other organizations that provide services to \n     children, particularly infants.''.\n      By Mr. SIMON:\n\n  S. 1997. A bill to clarify certain matters relating to Presidential \nsuccession; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n             the Presidential Succession Clarification Act\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, today I introduce the Presidential \nSuccession Clarification Act.\n  Much has been said and written about the laws of succession following \nthe death of a sitting President. In general, these laws clearly and \nprecisely provide for the transfer of Presidential power.\n  The laws of succession, however, do not adequately address the \npossibility that a Presidential candidate might die during the voting \nperiod itself--by that I mean during the period beginning roughly with \nthe popular election in mid-November and ending with the formal naming \nof the President-elect in early January.\n  A candidate's death during this 2-month period could seriously \ndisrupt the voting process and raise doubts about the election results. \nThe seriousness of these problems would depend on the precise point in \ntime at which the death occurred. A hearing that was held in the 103d \nCongress on this subject highlighted the various scenarios in which \nlegal ambiguities could lead to electoral crises.\n  Broadly speaking, the act, which I introduced in the last Congress, \naddresses three distinct situations:\n  First, let us suppose that a Presidential candidate dies after the \nelectoral delegates have cast their votes but before those votes are \ncounted. If the deceased would have won the election, who is now \nPresident elect? Scholars disagree on the answer.\n  Second, suppose that a major party candidate dies immediately before \nthe popular election, or immediately prior to the time that the \nelectoral college delegates vote. Would it not make sense to give the \nvoters a couple of weeks to adjust to this unsettled situation?\n  Third, suppose that no candidate wins a majority of the electoral \nvotes, and that the election is thrown into the House of \nRepresentatives as a result. If one of the candidates should die at \nthis point, is the House permitted to consider an alternative \ncandidate?\n  The act provides answers for each of these, admittedly complex, \nquestions. None of these scenarios, of course, is likely to occur \nduring any election cycle. But any one of them could lead to confusion \nand uncertainty at a time when clarity and stability would be vital. \nPrudence dictates that we should act now, while we have the time for \ncalm reflection, rather than wait for a possible crisis to catch us \nunprepared.\n       By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n\n  S.J. Res. 57. A joint resolution requiring the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the Joint Committee on Taxation to use dynamic economic \nmodeling in addition to static economic modeling in the preparation of \nbudgetary estimates of proposed changes in Federal revenue law.\n\n\n                Growth Economic Agenda Joint Resolution\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the joint resolution I am introducing \nlays the groundwork for the progrowth economic agenda of the next \nmillennium. Senator Abraham, Senator Craig, Senator Grams, and Senator \nKyl have joined with me in offering this proposal.\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\n  The method of analysis we now use to determine how much a tax cut \ncosts the Government, or a tax hike costs the taxpayers, is hopelessly \ninaccurate. For example, the 1990 luxury tax increase took in $14 \nmillion less than the $31 million the Joint Tax Committee [JCT] \npredicted it would in fiscal year 1991. The 1986 Tax Reform Act lowered \nincome tax rates while hiking capital gains taxes. The Congressional \nBudget Office at the time underestimated income tax revenues over the \nfollowing 3 years by $56 billion and overestimated the 5-year take from \ncapital gains tax revenues by $115 billion. It has also been \nestablished that the CBO grossly overestimated capital gains tax \nrevenues by over 100 percent in most years between 1989-95. Finally, \nthe fiscal year 1991 budget, issued before the 1990 budget summit at \nAndrews Air Force Base, contained a 5-year forecasting error of $1 \ntrillion.\n  Every Member of Congress relies on CBO's and the Joint Tax \nCommittee's [JCT] projections in deciding how to vote on legislation. \nQuite simply, we cannot make good decisions if we do not have good \ndata.\n  These flawed calculations were made using a static economic model \nthat assumes generally that Americans do not change their behavior, \nsuch as their spending habits and investment levels when Congress \nsaddles them with higher taxes. The consistent level of inaccuracy in \nstatic economic analysis threatens our ability to both reduce the \ndeficit and reduce the current unprecedented tax burden on the American \npublic.\n\n  The problem with static economic analysis is its failure to account \nfor the impact that changes in the level of taxes, or the amount of \nGovernment spending, will have on the average citizen's behavior. \nStatic estimates assume that the economy's overall performance is \ngenerally unaffected for the most part by changes in policy, regardless \nof how much individuals or businesses must pay in taxes. When we assume \nthat Americans will not change their spending and investment patterns \nto avoid paying new taxes, we ignore human nature. People generally \nseek to maximize the value of their dollars and their paychecks.\n  One well-known apostle of the static economic model; the current \nChairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Laura Tyson, recently \nwent so far to as to state that ``* * * there is no relationship \nbetween the levels of taxes a nation pays and its economic \nperformance.'' Such an attitude is the equivalent of an ostrich hiding \nits head in the sand. Dynamic economic analysis is the principal tool \nused in private firms and most universities which make estimates and \nconstruct models for economic analysis for the private sector.\n  One of the most successful economic models is the dynamic model used \nby Lawrence H. Meyers & Associates, an economic forecasting firm in St. \nLouis. Not only has this model received the Annual Blue Chip Economic \nForecasting Award in 1993 and 1995, but Lawrence Meyers himself was \nrecently appointed by President Clinton as a Governor to the Federal \nReserve.\n\n  By relying on static analyses, Congress is limited to a dangerously \nmyopic and usually inaccurate view of how our laws and our actions \naffect the Nation. There is a formidable argument that static analysis \nhas played an integral role in exploding our deficits. That is because \nstatic analysis often overestimates the Government's revenue from a tax \nincrease and then relies on such overestimates as the basis for \nprojecting decreases in the Federal deficits and the Nation's debt. As \na result the projected revenues never materialize and annual deficits \nincrease.\n  This problem is compounded by the fact that static analysis also \ngenerally underestimates the actual cost to the Government of spending \nincreases and thus contributes to even larger than expected budget \ndeficits. Such inaccurate predictions of what programs will cost lead \nlegislators to make bad decisions. This phenomenon helps explain why \nevery dollar raised in higher taxes has traditionally resulted in $1.58 \nin new Government spending since 1947.\n  By adding a more accurate method of analyzing fiscal proposals, \nCongress will have better information as it evaluates legislation. \nAdding dynamic scoring analysis will help us eliminate Congress' \ninstitutional bias toward higher taxes, increased spending, bigger \ndeficits, and a ballooning national debt.\n  Mr. President, I emphasize that this resolution does not seek to \nreplace the current static analysis model. It merely states that \ndynamic estimating techniques should also be used, in addition to \ncurrent techniques, in determining the fiscal impact of proposed \nchanges in Federal revenue law. Under this resolution, the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation [JCT] and the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] \nwould prepare an estimate of each proposed change in Federal revenue \nlaw on the basis of assumptions that estimate the probable behavioral \nresponses of individual and business taxpayers, and the macro-economic \nfeedback effects of any proposed change. This requirement will only \napply to changes in the law which would have an effect of $100 million \nor more.\n\n  I want to note that this proposal is a companion measure to House \nResolution 170, introduced by Representative Tom Campbell of California \nand to a similar proposal included in the 1997 legislative \nappropriations bill passed by the House. Tom Campbell has worked \ntirelessly to promote a pro-growth agenda. He has refused to sacrifice \nthe standard of living of hard-working Americans on the altar of static \neconomic analysis.\n  Dynamic economic analyses of tax cut proposals would take into \naccount the acknowledged growth effects of tax cuts on the American \neconomy. In fact, these growth effects could be used in calculating the \namount of spending cuts needed to offset a tax cut so that we \naccurately measure any reduction in revenue and do not increase the \ndeficit. For example, using dynamic scoring for the payroll tax \ndeduction I proposed--The Working Americans Wage Restoration Act S. \n1741--the tax deduction would be budget neutral in the first year. In \nother words, the relief offered by the payroll tax deduction would \ngenerate enough new revenue by growing the economy, that the proposal \nwould pay for itself.\n\n  Here is how. Based on a preliminary analysis, the payroll tax \ndeduction is projected to increase the Gross Domestic Product [GDP] by \n0.5 percent annually. According to the Office of Management and Budget, \na 0.5 percent rise in GDP would expand the tax base and increase \nFederal receipts by $30 billion per year--more than enough to pay for \nthe payroll tax deduction in the first year. However, the Budget Act \nrequirement that tax cuts be paid for by spending cuts would still \napply. Dynamic analysis would simply allow lawmakers and the public to \nunderstand the growth effects and judge this proposal's--and other \nproposals'--worthiness accordingly.\n  In calculating a tax cut's dynamic economic effects, the government \nwould be more realistic in its view of how government economic policies \naffect the economy. Under the current system of static analysis, our \nbudget forecasters produce skewed numbers causing Congress to make \nflawed decisions that drain the wallets of working Americans.\n  This proposed resolution also opens up the congressional economic \nanalysis process to much needed sunshine. Presently, we draft changes \nto the Federal Tax Code, submit these changes to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation for a revenue estimate and wait for the magic numbers to \nappear. It is time to bring sunshine into the black box of Federal \nforecasting. This resolution would do just that. Any report made by the \nJCT or the CBO that contains an estimate of revenue effects must be \naccompanied by a written statement fully disclosing the economic, \ntechnical, and behavioral assumptions that were made in producing both \nthe static and the dynamic estimate.\n  Last, under this joint resolution the JCT and the CBO may enter into \ncontracts with universities or other private or public organizations to \nperform dynamic analysis or to develop protocols and models for making \nsuch estimates.\n  By reforming the way we calculate the economic effects of \ncongressional proposals, we pave the way for an overall lowering of the \naverage American's tax burden by reducing the current forecasting \nmethod's prejudice against pro-growth policies. This resolution will \nsimply provide more information to Members of Congress and the public \nso that Congress can better determine the benefits of proposed \nlegislation. It\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nwill open up the budget forecasting process and permit more tools of \nmeasurement, so that over time we will have a clearer and more accurate \nunderstanding of the effects of the laws we pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8989-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nIllinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 773, a bill \nto amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for \nimprovements in the process of approving and using animal drugs, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dorgan, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1355, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to end deferral for U.S. shareholders on \nincome of controlled foreign corporations attributable to property \nimported into the United States.\n\n\n                                S. 1386\n\n  At the request of Mr. Burns, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Grams] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1386, a bill to provide for \nsoft-metric conversion, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1505\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Mr. Johnston] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1505, a bill to reduce \nrisk to public safety and the environment associated with pipeline \ntransportation of natural gas and hazardous liquids, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1726\n\n  At the request of Mr. Thomas, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1726, a bill to promote electronic commerce by facilitating the use of \nstrong encryption, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1908\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Feinstein, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Snowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1908, a bill to amend title \n18, United States Code, to prohibit the sale of personal information \nabout children without their parents' consent, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bingaman, the name of the Senator from Maine \n[Ms. Snowe] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1964, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage under part B \nof the Medicare Program of medical nutrition therapy services of \nregistered dietitians and nutrition professionals.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5059\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato his name was added as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 5059 proposed to H.R. 3540, a bill making appropriations \nfor foreign operations, export financing, and related programs for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8993-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8993-S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 283--RELATIVE TO THE CREATION OF A NEW POSITION IN \n                            THE WHITE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Faircloth) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 283\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Americans are increasingly concerned about anti-\n     Christian persecution overseas, including rape, torture, \n     enslavement, imprisonment, killings, mutilations, \n     discrimination and mistreatment of Christians, and the fact \n     that far too many foreign governments systematically deny \n     their Christian citizens religious liberty;\n       (2) reports indicate that the Government of Sudan is \n     currently involved in the enslavement of the Christian \n     populations of southern Sudan. Today in Sudan, a human being \n     can be bought for as little as fifteen dollars. It has been \n     estimated that in the last six years, more than 30,000 \n     children have been taken from their homes, forcibly interned \n     in ``cultural cleansing camps,'' forced to accept Islam and \n     then moved to the front lines of Sudan's civil war;\n       (3) in China, there are reports of the imprisonment and \n     detention of many Chinese Christians under a 1994 law which \n     restricts religious freedom. It has been reported that in \n     1992, Protestant leader Zheng Yunsu was arrested and \n     sentenced to twelve years in jail simply for practicing his \n     religion. Additionally, between October 1994 and June 1995, \n     more than 200 Christians were apparently detained in the \n     Henan province. One of those arrested, Ren Ping, was \n     sentenced, without trial, to three years of reeducation \n     through labor. According to Amnesty International, more than \n     thirty Chinese Catholics in Jiangzi province were arrested \n     and severely beaten while celebrating Easter Mass earlier \n     this year;\n       (4) in the Muslim-controlled Oromo region of Ethiopia, \n     reports indicate that in 1994, officials raided the area's \n     largest Christian Church and arrested most of its \n     congregants. Many of those arrested died while in prison. The \n     leader of the congregation was tortured and his eyes were \n     plucked out;\n       (5) in several Islamic countries conversion to Christianity \n     from Islam is a crime punishable by death;\n       (6) it has been reported that Christians have been \n     effectively excluded from the political process in many \n     countries. In Pakistan, for example, Christian can vote only \n     for token representatives to the National Assembly;\n       (7) there is no Senior Advisor on religious persecution in \n     the White House to ensure that anti-Christian persecution \n     overseas is given top priority by White House and to \n     coordinate efforts to combat such persecution; and\n       (8) the President had committed, in January 1996, to \n     appoint a White House Senior Advisor on religious \n     persecution, but has yet to do so.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should proceed forward as expeditiously as \n     possible by appointing a White House Senior Advisor on \n     religious persecution.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Helms, Bennett, and \nFaircloth I am submitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to highlight \nthe top priority that must be given to combating religious persecution \nin foreign countries. This resolution calls on President Clinton to \nlive up to his commitment, made in January 1996, to appoint a White \nHouse senior advisor on religious persecution.\n  The persecution of Christians and other religious minorities is a \ngrowing problem. In countries such as Saudi Arabia, Sudan, China, and \nEthiopia, among other countries, Christians are systematically denied \ntheir religious liberties. Christians have been the victims of rape, \ntorture, enslavement, imprisonment, killings, mutilations, and \ndiscrimination simply because of their religious beliefs. The \ngovernments of these countries all too often tacitly, or even openly, \nendorse this sectarian violence.\n  According to human rights organizations, the Sudanese Government is \nessentially waging a war against its Christian population. The \ngovernment's campaign against the Christian and non-Muslim populations \nof southern Sudan has resulted in more than 1.3 million deaths and the \ndisplacement of over 3 million people. Equally shocking are reports \nthat the Sudanese Government is involved in the enslavement and forced \ninternment and conversion of the Christian populations from the \nsouthern regions of Sudan. In the last 6 years more than 30,000 non-\nMuslim children have reportedly been abducted by agents of the Sudanese \nGovernment, taken from their homes and families, forcibly interned in \nhigh-security ``cultural cleansing'' camps, forced to convert to Islam \nand then sent to the front lines of Sudan's civil war.\n  Of course anti-Christian persecution and sectarian violence extends \nfar beyond Sudan. In the Muslim-controlled Oromo region of Ethiopia, \nreports indicate that government officials raided the area's largest \nChristian church and arrested most of its congregants. Many of those \narrested in this 1994 raid died while in prison. The leader of the \ncongregation was tortured and his eyes were torn from their sockets.\n  In Egypt, a country generally noted for its religious tolerance, \nChristians are increasingly the targets of militant Islamist terrorist \nattacks on the streets as well as more subtle persecution in the courts \nand businesses. Christians are also often denied participation in the \nEgyptian political process.\n  Persecution of Christians is by no means limited to the Islamic \nworld. It is reported that the Chinese Government has harassed and \nimprisoned many Chinese Christians simply for practicing their \nreligion. In 1992, Protestant leader Zheng Yunsu was arrested and \nsentenced to 12 years in prison because of his faith. Other reports \nindicate that between October 1994 and June 1995, more than 200 \nChristians were detained in the Hunan Province in a crackdown on \nunregistered Protestant house churches. One of those arrested, Ren \nPing, was sentenced, without trial, to 3 years of ``reeducation'' \nthrough labor. According to Amnesty International, more than 30\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\nChinese Catholics were arrested and severely beaten by the police while \ncelebrating Easter Mass earlier this year.\n  Examples of such religious persecution abound. The time has come for \nthe United States to stand up for the right of all people to enjoy the \nfundamental freedom of religious faith. Without further delay, the \nWhite House should fulfill its commitment to appoint a senior advisor \nto the President dedicated to combating religious persecution overseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S8993-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 284--TO AUTHORIZE THE PRODUCTION OF RECORDS BY THE \n                PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

On Sunday, July 28, \n1996, Miami will turn 100 years old.\n  I am often staggered when I ponder how much the Greater Miami area \nhas changed in the last century.\n  One hundred years ago, when Julia Tuttle, the mother of Miami, was \nbadgering Henry Flagler to extend his railroad line south of Palm \nBeach, Miami had one city street, several uncompleted stores, a hotel \nunder construction, and approximately 300 residents.\n  Flagler was unconvinced. But after scores of Mrs. Tuttle's letters, \nan offering of half of her land, and a cold snap that brought freezing \ntemperatures to Florida but left Dade County untouched, he was \npersuaded to extend his railroad, construct the Royal Palm Hotel, lay \nout the city streets, and build Miami's water, power, and medical \nfacilities.\n  In many ways, Miami today barely resembles the community that it was \nin 1896. A tiny city has been replaced by an exploding metropolis. 300 \nresidents have become over 2 million.\n  A place that almost didn't receive the private investment needed to \nbuild a railroad or town stores, is now one of the nation's most \nimportant transportation and commercial centers.\n  Each year, over 13 million visitors come to the Greater Miami area to \nvisit South Beach, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne, Joe Robbie Stadium, \nGulfstream Park, and the many other attractions that give Miami its \nyouthful vibrance.\n  But in some fundamental ways, Miami has not changed. Its pioneering \nspirit has thrived for the last 100 years.\n  Just as Miami was a pioneer in diversity a century ago, when its \nfounder was a woman and one-third of the citizens who met to \nincorporate the city were African-American, today it stands poised to \nlead a multicultural America into the next century.\n  And as the Gateway to Latin America and an important center of trade, \nMiami will help the United States play an increasingly vital role in \nthe new global economy. Miamians will lead us as we move to extend ties \nof trade, culture, and friendship around the world.\n  Miami is a community that has profoundly shaped my life. I was born \nhere almost 60 years ago, attended Hialeah Elementary and Junior High, \nand graduated from Miami Senior High School. This will always be my \nhome.\n  Again, I am delighted to be part of the centennial celebration for my \nhometown. I join my Senate colleagues and all Floridians in wishing \nMiami a very happy 100th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S9001-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN UNTIL 3 P.M.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 226) was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 226\n\n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, Nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of our society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the Nation;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civil groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character, and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by youth-influencing \n     institutions and individuals to help young people develop the \n     essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas character development is, first and foremost, an \n     obligation of families, efforts by faith communities, \n     schools, and youth, civic, and human service organizations \n     also play a very important role in supporting family efforts \n     by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize leaders to \n     recognize the valuable role our youth play in the present and \n     future of our Nation, and to recognized that character is an \n     important part of that future;\n       Whereas, in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``Effective \n     character education is based on core ethical values which \n     form the foundation of democracy society'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the six core elements of character;\n       Whereas the six core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and \n     fairness, caring, civic virtue, and citizenship;\n       Whereas the six core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states that ``The character \n     and conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     reach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the six core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the six core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate proclaims the week of October 13 \n     through October 19, 1996, as National Character Counts Week, \n     and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     embrace the six core elements of character and to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S9001-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Blackburn, \n     and ending Veda B. Wilson, which nominations were received by \n     the Senate and appeared in the Congressional Record of June \n     26, 1996.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm the \nnomination of our dear colleague, Claiborne Pell, as the U.S. \nrepresentative to the 51st session of the U.N. General Assembly. \nSenator Pell's career and accomplishments were what the Framers of the \nConstitution probably had in mind when they created the position of \nU.S. Senator.\n  For 36 years Claiborne Pell has graced the United States Senate, \nproviding thoughtful leadership on an exceptional range of issues.\n  Millions of Americans have been able to attend college because of his \nhistoric role in creating the program which the Congress, in an \nunprecedented honor for a sitting Senator, named Pell grants in 1980.\n  Thousands of American communities have been immeasurably enriched by \nthe National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \nHumanities, which he helped create in 1965.\n  Champion of international environmental concerns and nuclear \ndisarmament treaties, crusader for human rights, primary sponsor of \nlegislation to assist the handicapped, originator of the High-Speed \nGround Transportation Act; his vision has helped transform this country \nhe loves in so many tangible ways. But in light of his pending \nnomination, it is appropriate to speak of Claiborne Pell's first real \njob.\n  In the spring and summer of 1945, millions of us left military \nservice. Most of us went back, as I did, to the schooling or jobs we \nhad left to fight for our country. Claiborne Pell did something a \nlittle different. He helped change the world.\n  In June 1945, he went to San Francisco as a member of the \nInternational Secretariat of the U.N. Conference on International \nOrganization, the conference that drafted the U.N. Charter.\n  In all, 282 delegates representing 50 countries took part in drafting \nthe U.N. Charter, though the bulk of the work was accomplished by the \n1,058 persons working for the International Secretariat. He may be the \nonly government official of those participating in the organizational \nconference who is still in public office anywhere on this planet--young \nClaiborne Pell on assignment from his beloved Coast Guard.\n  As Assistant Secretary of Conference III, the Enforcement \nArrangements Committee, he helped draft articles 43, 44, and 45 of the \nUnited Nations Charter that gave the Security Council the right to take \nmilitary action to prevent aggression.\n  He collected the ballots at the vote to confirm the Charter. And to \nthis day he is never caught without a copy of the Charter in his \npocket. We in the Senate are honored to have the beloved former \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Claiborne Pell, \ncounted among those who were present at the creation of the Charter.\n  He has lived the promise of the United Nations Charter for 51 years--\non State Department assignment in Eastern Europe during the harshest \nearly days of the cold war; and as a private citizen organizing the \nrescue of over 100,000 Hungarian refugees after the betrayal of the \n1956 revolution against Soviet rule. In his efforts to enhance \nenvironmental protection, he is one of the few persons--the only United \nStates Senator--who attended both the 1992 United Nations Conference on \nEnvironment and Development [UNCED] in Rio, and its predecessor, the \n1972 Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm.\n  He has championed the adoption of an international legal regime for \nthe peaceful use of the seas. As such he has participated in the \ncreation of the Law of the Sea Convention. Beginning on September 29, \n1967 he introduced three Senate resolutions urging the President to \nnegotiate such a measure. Those resolutions and a draft treaty that \nSenator Pell proposed in 1969 led first to the Seabed Arms Control \nTreaty, prohibiting nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction from the ocean floor, ratified by the Senate in 1972.\n  The Law of the Sea Convention would not be opened for signatures for \n10 more years until 1982. Senator Pell's long efforts in this regard \nare reflected in the achievements contained in the Convention which \ncodifies, among other things, freedom of navigation rights, and the \nexclusive use of marine resources by countries within 200 miles of \ntheir shores.\n  Claiborne Pell is a Senator for the ages. We in the Senate shall miss \nhim. He will no doubt serve with distinction as the United States \nRepresentative to the 51st session of the United Nations General \nAssembly. I congratulate Senator Pell for his numerous achievements and \nwish him well in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S9002-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise as in morning business, and \nthank the Chair very much, to say just a few words about an amendment \nto the foreign operations appropriations bill that was adopted earlier \ntoday, an amendment which I was privileged to offer with a \ndistinguished list of colleagues. It was accepted by agreement last \nnight without debate, although I did put a statement in the Record at \nthat time. It is, I think, an important amendment and statement, a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, because it deals with the necessity to \nbring to justice those who have been indicted by the International \nCriminal Tribunal from the former Yugoslavia, which is meeting now in \nThe Hague, to bring them to justice because they, as the tribunal has \nsaid, are perpetrators of gross violations of international law.\n  Mr. President, I was stimulated in my desire to say just a few words \nto my colleagues here before we leave for the weekend about this by an \ninterview that was in the New York Times this morning with Antonio \nCassese, an Italian law professor who is the president of the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal.\n  The article begins:\n\n       The Italian law professor who is president of the War \n     Crimes Tribunal here is known for his cheerful nature, his \n     expertise in international law and his even temper. So his \n     public outburst in a quiet hall here the other day was all \n     the more shocking.\n       ``Go ahead! Kill, torture, maim! Commit acts of genocide!'' \n     said Antonio Cassese, president of the tribunal, his voice \n     rising, ``You may enjoy impunity!''\n       This, he said, was the message that would go ``to military \n     leaders and all dictators'' if the Bosnian Serb leaders \n     indicted for atrocities in the Bosnian war were not brought \n     before the tribunal.\n\n  Mr. President, thanks to my colleagues, the Senate has now spoken \nclearly on this issue. I was honored to be joined by Senators Lugar, \nBiden, Specter, Feinstein, Moynihan, Hatch, Levin, and D'Amato, a \nwonderfully bipartisan group, as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The point is this, as we state in the findings of this resolution: \nThe United Nations did create this International Tribunal. A Security \nCouncil resolution was adopted on May 25, 1993, early in this horrific \nepisode, which requires states to cooperate fully with the tribunal. \nThe signatories to the Dayton peace accord, signed December 14, 1995, \nhave accepted, in article IX of that accord, the obligation ``to \ncooperate in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes and other \nviolations of internationally humanitarian law.'' This means all the \nsignatories of the accord, including Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, and the \nRepublika Srpska.\n  In fact, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was \naccepted as annex 4 to the Dayton peace accord, provides in article IX \nthat--\n\n       No person who is serving a sentence imposed by the \n     International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and no \n     person who is under indictment by the tribunal and who has \n     failed to comply with an order to appear before the tribunal, \n     may stand as a candidate or hold any appointive, elective, or \n     other public office in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  The tribunal has now issued 57 indictments against individuals. It \ncontinues to investigate gross violations of international laws. \nSpecifically, on July 25, 1995, almost 1 year ago to the day, the \ntribunal issued an indictment\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\nof Radovan Karadzic, President of the Bosnian Serb administration of \nPale and Ratko Mladic, commander of the Bosnian Serb administration, \nand charged them with genocide, with crimes against humanity.\n  This was no opposition politician standing up and making a charge. \nThis was an international tribunal which, having heard evidence, \ncharged them with genocide, crimes against humanity, violations of the \nlaw or customs of war and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions. All \nof these charges arise from atrocities perpetrated, not against \nsoldiers, but against the civilian population throughout Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, as we remember from those painful, frustrating and \ninfuriating pictures, and including the taking of U.N. peacekeepers as \nhostages for their use as human shields.\n\n  On November 16, 1995, Karadzic and Mladic were indicted a second time \nby the International Tribunal, this time charged with genocide for the \nkilling of up to 6,000 Moslems in Srebrenica, Bosnia, in July 1995.\n  The U.N. Security Council, in adopting its own resolution 1022 in \nNovember of last year, decided that economic sanctions on Yugoslavia \nand Srpska would be reimposed if at any time the High Representative, \nCarl Bildt, or the IFOR commander, soon to be, perhaps already, Admiral \nLopez, informs the Security Council that either of these two \nGovernments, Serbia or the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska, have failed \nto meet their obligations under the peace agreement.\n  The fact is that these two entities have failed to arrest and turn \nover for prosecution indicted war criminals, including Karadzic and \nMladic. We know where they are, particularly Karadzic. A while ago one \nof these two went to Belgrade for a funeral. Authorities in Serbia knew \nthat he was there. Nothing was done to apprehend this indicted war \ncriminal.\n  Last week, again, in an extraordinary act of public service and \ndiplomatic skill, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke convinced Slobodan \nMilosevic, the President of Serbia--for fear of having the reimposition \nof economic sanctions against his country--to use his power to take \nKaradzic out of power, to take him out of the leadership of the Serbian \nDemocratic Party, and to remove any chance that he would be a candidate \nfor office in the elections.\n  It is startling, when you think about it. It is as if at the end of \nthe Second World War some leaders of the countries that we fought in \nthe Second World War remained in their countries and ran in the first \npostwar elections. It would have so infuriated the public here, \nunderstandably, that we probably would have done what we are asking \nhere, which is to arrest them and bring them to justice.\n  But Ambassador Holbrooke did take a step forward. Unfortunately, \nthough, these two war criminals remain at large. Just a few weeks ago, \non July 11, 1996, the International Criminal Tribunal actually issued \ninternational arrest warrants for Karadzic and Mladic.\n  The fact is--and we have heard this from all parties there in Bosnia; \nand it is just common sense as we move forward to the elections there \non September 14 of this year, which we hope will be the next step in \nrebuilding this country in going back to some form of cooperation among \nthe various peoples there--these elections could not go on with any \ncredibility were these war criminals at large and, in Karadzic's case, \nactually running a political party, perhaps even at one point thinking \nabout running for office himself.\n  So now, thanks to Ambassador Holbrooke, we have Karadzic out of \npolitical office and out of political leadership. But the truth is, he \nshould be out of that country. He should be taken to The Hague for \ntrial, to be brought to justice.\n  That is exactly the intention of the resolution that the Senate has \nnow adopted, accepting the principle that the human, but also the \npractical, principle of the apprehension and prosecution of indicted \nwar criminals--these two and all others--is essential for peace and \nreconciliation to be achieved and for democracy to be established \nthroughout Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Mr. President, we have sent 20,000 American soldiers to be part of \nthe implementation force, the IFOR, that has performed magnificently in \nseparating the warring parties and creating a sense of stability. We \nhave spent a lot of money in doing that and put some of our finest men \nand women in uniform on the line as part of that process.\n  But unless we remove these indicted war criminals, the prospects of \nredeeming the investment of courage and bounty that we have made in \navoiding broader conflict and ethnic partition in Bosnia will be for \nnaught, because the end result, when our troops pull out, will be that \nwe will have divided camps again, with no trust, not even the minimal \nelements of trust. So long as these indicted criminals are walking \naround flaunting their freedom, that trust will not be possible, that \ntrust that is necessary to rebuild a civil society within Bosnia.\n  So this resolution said very clearly, and I am very grateful to my \ncolleagues for supporting it, that it is the sense of the Senate that \nthe International Criminal Tribunal merits the continued and increased \nU.S. support for its efforts to investigate and bring to justice the \nperpetrators of these gross violations of international law.\n  Second, it is the sense of the Senate that the signatories of the \npeace agreement and those nations and organizations participating in \nthe Dayton peace agreement and the relevant mandates of the United \nNations and Security Council must continue to make it an urgent \npriority to bring to justice persons indicted by the International \nCriminal Tribunal.\n  Third, it is the sense of the Senate that the President of the United \nStates should support the request of the President of the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia to reimpose full economic \nsanctions on Serbia and Montenegro and the Republika Srpska in \naccordance with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolution, if \nSerbia and Montenegro and the Bosnian Serb authorities have not \ncomplied with their obligations under the relevant agreements and \nresolutions to cooperate fully with the International Criminal \nTribunal.\n  Finally, it is the sense of the Senate that all the States in the \nformer Yugoslavia should not be admitted to international organizations \nuntil and unless they have complied with their obligations under the \nDayton peace agreement and the relevant U.N. Security Council \nresolutions.\n  The Senate has said clearly in this resolution now adopted as part of \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill that while we take some \ncomfort and we have some appreciation for Ambassador Holbrooke for the \nstatement that Karadzic has made that he is removing himself from \npolitics, this is a small step toward what should be done. We are not \nleaving the field here. We have stated here quite clearly that we will \nnot redeem our investment in the end of this war and the reconstruction \nof Bosnia until we settle the moral accounts here, and bring those who \nhave been indicted by this very legitimate International Criminal \nTribunal to justice. Until that happens, we cannot rest. Until that \nhappens, there will not be a genuine hope of reconnecting and \nrebuilding this war-torn country.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I had the privilege of listening to most \nof the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut, and I simply wanted to \nexpress my agreement with his views and say on this occasion how much I \nadmire his dedication to the administration of justice, both here at \nhome but, particularly in this connection.\n  I can remember even in previous Congresses his frustration, our \nfrustration, over the way in which we conducted our relationships with \nBosnia and the tragedy that has continued there for so many years. His \nposition on this resolution, coming through this morning's foreign \noperations appropriations bill I think greatly strengthens it and I \nbelieve the other Members of the Senate and the people of the country \nowe him a debt of thanks for his dedication to this cause.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Washington very \nmuch for the very gracious words that mean all the more to me because \nthey come from him who I first met in our shared service as attorneys \ngeneral of our respective States.\n  The rule of law is the rule of law. It is what separates civilized \nfrom uncivilized people. It is true not just here for\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nus but in countries around the world, and insofar as we fail to bring \nto justice indicted criminals in an international situation like this, \nit is no better than if we failed to bring to justice murderers and \nrapists here in our own communities in the United States. But I mostly \njust thank my friend from Washington for his kind words and also for \nhis consistent and very important support of this effort to make sure \nthat there is both peace and justice in Bosnia, since without justice \nthere will ultimately never be peace.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/26/senate-section/article/S9003-4", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "26", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
