Thank you so much, Mr. President. I will just take a \nmoment of the Senate's time to say how really thrilled I am to have \nheard the prayer given by the Reverend Joan Thirkettle this morning. I \nwant to thank the Senate Chaplain, Dr. Ogilvie, for inviting her here \ntoday at my request.\n  To hear the sounds of a woman's voice coming from that particular \nplace in the Senate Chamber is not that usual, but it is becoming more \nusual as we see more and more women go into this field.\n  I also say that it is very important because this month we do \ncelebrate Women's History Month. So it is quite appropriate the \nReverend Thirkettle spoke to us today.\n  There is one last point I want to make. She has come a long way from \nSan Diego, CA, a beautiful part of the world. She spends her waking \nhours helping high school students, helping with family reeducation, \nhelping with reunification, helping with job readiness, working with \nchildren, working with the Salvation Army in charge of shelters for \nyouth and running the Christmas toy drive. So this is a woman who lives \nher beliefs.\n  I listened to her words today. She offers us, I think, some very good \nguidance. I thank her, and I thank Dr. Ogilvie.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3037-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2854, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2854) a bill to modify the operation of certain agricultural \n     programs, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by a majority of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the conference report.\n\n[[Page S3038]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, yesterday in the beginning of the debate on \nthe farm bill conference report, much of the debate centered upon title \nI, which is the Agricultural Market Transition Program. And, indeed, \nthis is an extraordinarily important title for producers in this \ncountry. Senators reviewed the fact that the new farm bill will offer \nmaximum flexibility to farmers in choosing what crops to plant and how \nmany acres they will plant to meet market conditions in this country \nand in the world.\n  Likewise, the nonrecourse marketing assistance loans will remain. \nThey are a safety net, as well as a method of managing income and \noperations, for producers.\n  Not mentioned yesterday, but clearly still in the farm bill, is a \npeanut program, modified somewhat during debate in both the House and \nthe Senate, a sugar program and a milk price support and marketing \norder program. The Federal Dairy Export Program, the northeast dairy \ncompact, payment limitations, commodity credit all come under this \ntitle I, the Agricultural Market Transition Program. I have no doubt, \nMr. President, there will be more debate on that issue this morning. \nBut I want to center on additional aspects of the farm bill that are \nextraordinarily important to all Americans.\n  Title II, the trade title, contains Public Law 480 and related \nprograms. The conference report reauthorizes Food for Peace and allows \nprivate sector participation for the first time. The Food Security \nWheat Reserve is renamed the ``Food Security Commodity Reserve'' to \nreflect that corn, rice, and sorghum are added as eligible commodities. \nA 4-million-metric-ton cap is placed on the reserve and access to \nreserve commodities is made easier.\n  Mr. President, there is also a provision for agricultural trade. The \nconference agreement reauthorizes several trade and export programs, \nwith additional emphasis on high-value and value-added products. The \nSecretary is directed to monitor compliance with the agriculture \nprovisions of the Uruguay round agreement of GATT and report violations \nto the United States Trade Representative. Agriculture producers are \ngiven additional protection against economic effects of agricultural \nembargoes.\n  In addition, several unnecessary and outdated provisions of Federal \nagricultural trade law are repealed.\n  The trade title contains a market access program. The Market \nPromotion Program is renamed the ``Market Access Program'' to more \naccurately reflect program goals. Expenditures are capped at $90 \nmillion per year, and reforms are implemented to restrict participation \nto small businesses, farmer-owned cooperatives, and agricultural \ngroups.\n  The Export Enhancement Program is contained in title II. EEP \nexpenditures are capped at $350 million a year in 1996; $250 million in \n1997; $500 million in 1998; $550 million in 1999; $579 million in 2000; \n$478 million in 2001 and 2002.\n  For the years 2000 to 2002, the funding levels for EEP represent the \nmaximum allowable expenditures under GATT. In addition, the Secretary \nis given authority to subsidize the export of intermediate value-added \nproducts.\n  Title III of the farm bill contains the conservation programs and, \nfirst of all, of course, is the Conservation Reserve Program, the CRP, \nwhich gives the Secretary authority to enter into new contracts and to \nextend CRP contracts. The authorized maximum acreage in CRP is \nmaintained at 36.4 million acres. It also allows participants to \nterminate CRP contracts, except on those lands that are deemed to be of \nhigh environmental value. Funds saved due to termination of contracts \nmay be used by the Secretary to enroll new lands in the program.\n\n  I point out, parenthetically, Mr. President, this arguably is the \nlargest conservation program, including one of the most important \nenvironmental aspects the Senate will adopt this year.\n  The Wetlands Reserve Program is retained with modifications to \nencourage the use of temporary easements and cost-share restorations.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentive Program [EQIP], is instituted. \nThis program targets approximately $1.2 billion over 7 years to assist \ncrop and livestock producers to deal with environmental and \nconservation improvements on their farms. Assistance can be used for \nanimal waste management facilities, terraces, waterways, filterstrips \nor other structural and management practices to protect water, soil, \nand related resources. Assistance to individual operations is capped at \n$10,000 a year, for a maximum of 5 years. Large operators, as defined \nby the Secretary, will be ineligible for assistance.\n  Other new conservation programs include the Farms for the Future \nProgram providing $35 million to preserve farmland from commercial \ndevelopment. A new conservation farm option offers producers an \nadditional alternative in meeting conservation goals. A Flood Risk \nReduction Program is also included to provide farmers incentives to \ntake out of production frequently flooded lands.\n  The Conservation Compliance Reform Program gives producers enhanced \nflexibility to modify conservation practices if they can demonstrate \nthat the new practice achieves equal or greater erosion control. \nVariances from conservation compliance can now be granted on account of \nadverse weather or disease, and program payment penalties can be \nadjusted to be commensurate with the violation.\n  Swampbuster reform is included in title III. The Natural Resources \nConservation Service is designated to lead Federal agencies in wetlands \ndelineation and regulation on grazing lands. The agreement stipulates \nthat current wetlands delineations remain valid until a producer \nrequests a review. Penalties can now be adjusted to fit the wetlands \nviolation. Exceptions can be granted for good faith. And wetlands \nmitigation options are expanded.\n  Title IV, a very important title, is the Federal Food Stamp Program. \nThe conference agreement reauthorizes the Food Stamp Program for 2 \nyears while Congress continues to work on comprehensive welfare reform \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, this issue has come before this body at least twice \nbefore. First of all, in the form of the Balanced Budget Act, where the \nfood stamp provisions were a part of the farm bill and likewise a part \nof welfare reform. The Senate has considered separately welfare reform \nwith food stamp provisions in that legislation.\n  As the Chair knows, in the case of both the welfare reform and the \nBalanced Budget Act, President Clinton vetoed this legislation. \nTherefore, it has been set aside. This farm bill recaptures now and \nreauthorizes the Food Stamp Program for 2 years pending action either \nin our committee, that is, the Agriculture Committee, or action by the \nCongress with regard to welfare reform that might encompass the Food \nStamp Program.\n  Title V is a miscellaneous title, but an important one in the \ncollection of programs that come under it. Crop insurance is one of \nthese programs. The conference agreement eliminates the mandatory \nnature of catastrophic crop insurance, but requires producers to waive \nall Federal disaster assistance if they opt not to purchase \ncatastrophic insurance. Dual delivery of crop insurance is eliminated \nin those States that have adequate private crop insurance delivery.\n  The bill corrects a provision of current law by amending the Federal \nCrop Insurance Act to include seed crops. Eligibility to purchase crop \ninsurance is no longer linked to conservation compliance and \nswampbuster for producers who choose not to participate in the farm \nprograms.\n  The Office of Risk Management is provided for. We establish in this \nlegislation, within the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Risk \nManagement to oversee and supervise the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation. The bill directs the Secretary to establish a business \ninterruption insurance program that allows producers of program crops \nto obtain revenue insurance coverage. The Options Pilot Program is also \nextended through the year 2002. The Office of Risk Management is \ncharged with oversight of these pilot programs.\n\n  Mr. President, the farm bill includes an Everglades Agricultural Area \nprovision. The conference agreement provides $200 million for land \nacquisition in the Florida Everglades for the purpose of environmental \nrestoration. An\n\n[[Page S3039]]\n\nadditional $100 million in Federal support will be financed through the \nsale or swap of other federally held land in Florida.\n  The farm bill provides a fund for rural America. And $300 million is \nprovided for the fund in the years 1997 through 1999. This was a \nrequest of the President of the United States, and the Secretary of \nAgriculture placed a high priority on this fund. The Secretary is \nrequired to spend at least one-third of the amount on research and one-\nthird of the amount on rural development. The other one-third of the \nmoney can be allocated to either purpose at the discretion of the \nSecretary. All of the funding must be spent through existing research \nand rural development programs.\n  The Agricultural Quarantine and Inspection provision appears in the \nconference report, which amends the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and \nTrade Act of 1990 to allow the Secretary to collect and spend fees \ncollected over $100 million to cover the cost for providing quarantine \nand inspection services for imports.\n  The Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel is created in this farm \nbill. The Panel of scientists within the Food Safety and Inspection \nService will be charged with the responsibility of reviewing all \ninspection policies from a scientific perspective. The Panel's report \nand the Secretary's responses must be published in the Federal \nRegister. State-inspected meat was discussed in our conference report. \nWithin 90 days of enactment, the Secretary shall report and recommend \nto the Congress the steps necessary to achieve interstate shipment of \nState-inspected meat products.\n  Title VI of the conference report deals with USDA Farm Lending \nProgram reforms. The conference report redirects farm lending programs \nto their original intent. Authority to make loans for a variety of \nnonagricultural purposes such as recreation facilities and small \nbusiness enterprises is repealed. The Secretary is given authority to \nuse collection agencies to recover delinquent loans. The agreement \nprohibits additional loans to delinquent borrowers and streamlines \nprocedures for disposal of inventory property. A portion of loan \nfunding is reserved for new and beginning farmers.\n  I point out, Mr. President, that that set of provisions comes after \nextensive hearings by the Agriculture Committee in which we found that \nborrowers sometimes are already delinquent and the Department was \nobligated, under previous law, to lend money to them in any event. Some \nof these obvious, glaring deficiencies have been corrected. I commend \nboth committees and the conference for that provision.\n  Title VII deals with rural development. The Rural Community \nAdvancement Program is authorized, and the Secretary may provide grants \nand direct and guaranteed loans and other assistance to meet rural \ndevelopment needs across the country. Funding under the Rural Community \nAdvanced Program will be allocated to three areas: First of all, rural \ncommunity facilities; second, rural utilities; and, third, a rural \nbusiness and cooperative development. The new program provides greater \nflexibility, State and local decisionmaking, and a simplified uniform \napplication process.\n  The Water and Waste Water Systems. Authorization for these systems is \nincreased from $500 million to $590 million.\n  In telemedicine and distance learning programs, the conference \nagreement reauthorizes and streamlines these programs. Under the \nprograms, the Secretary can make grants and loans to assist rural \ncommunities with construction of facilities and services, to provide \ndistance learning and telemedicine service. Funding is authorized at \n$100 million annually.\n  Title VIII is the research title. The conference agreement \nreauthorizes Federal agricultural research, extension, and education \nprograms for 2 years. This will allow Congress to continue ongoing \nreview of these programs and determine how best to use the $1.7 billion \nin annual agricultural research, extension, and education spending. \nAdditional research dollars are made available under this bill through \nthe fund for rural America that I discussed earlier and which President \nClinton and Secretary Glickman have championed.\n  Title IX, promotion, the generic commodity promotion program. The \nSecretary is directed to establish such a program. Under this program, \ninterested industries could petition the Department of Agriculture for \nthe establishment of a promotion program. Currently, each commodity \nmust receive specific authorization from Congress to have a promotion \nprogram. Recognizing the generic program will not be operational for \nsome time, the conference agreement authorizes new promotion programs \nfor popcorn, canola, and kiwi fruit.\n  The full conference report was printed, I point out, Mr. President, \nin the Congressional Record of Monday, March 25, 1996, so that Senators \nhave had an opportunity to review this conference report. The report \ncame after discussion of as many as 500 differences between the House \nand the Senate bills. During an extensive and constructive conference \nof the two bodies last Wednesday and last Thursday, all issues were \nresolved. It is in that spirit that this conference report came to the \nSenate last evening and for further debate today.\n  Mr. President, let me simply review the fact that the time limit \ncovering this report is 6 hours. Three of those hours are controlled by \nthe distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, an hour by the \nranking Democratic member of the Agriculture Committee, and 2 hours by \nmyself. Approximately an hour and a quarter of debate occurred last \nevening. The remainder of the debate lies ahead of us. Hopefully, \nSenators who are controlling that time would be prepared to yield back \nthat time to expedite the work of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3037-7", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3039-S3091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick \nSweeney, an employee of the General Accounting Office who has been \ndetailed to the Agriculture Committee, be granted privilege of the \nfloor during the pendency of consideration of the farm bill conference \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Noting no other Senators prepared to debate the issue, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be equally charged \nagainst the time allocated to the three Senators controlling time in \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask to take time that has been allotted \nto me under the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we spent a lot of months of very, very hard \nwork to craft this farm bill. Today, we are completing the final \nlegislative step in the farm bill process. I am glad that Secretary \nGlickman has said that he will recommend that the bill be signed.\n  The Secretary is one of the most knowledgeable Secretaries of \nAgriculture with which I have ever worked. He has been a Member of the \nCongress. He has worked on many farm bills. He knows, as I do, that \nnobody ever gets everything they want in a farm bill. You have to bring \nin a number of competing interests and ultimately make a judgment of \nwhether the bill should be signed or not. I believe it should be \nsigned. I concur with his judgment.\n  I am also pleased that the President said he would sign the farm \nbill. In my discussions with the White House and with the Secretary, I \nhave told them this is a good bipartisan bill that proves we can work \ntogether.\n  We were in a situation, Mr. President, where we were not going to be \nable to pass a Democratic or a Republican farm bill. However, if we \nworked as we have in the past in a bipartisan fashion, we could pass a \nvery good farm bill.\n  There are many who had a hand in this legislation. First and foremost \nof those is the chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry Committee, the senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar.\n\n[[Page S3040]]\n\n  Had it not been for his energy, foresight and perseverance, we would \nnot be on the floor today with a completed conference report. The \nAgriculture Committee is made up of members with very diverse and, I \nmight say, occasionally conflicting interests. For those who know the \nAgriculture Committee as Senator Lugar and I do, that is probably \nconsidered an understatement. The Senate has some committees that \ndivide along ideological lines and one can almost predict how a vote \nmight go.\n  That is not the case in the Senate Agriculture Committee. \nConservatives join with liberals on various issues; conservatives break \nwith conservatives; liberals break with liberals; moderates oftentimes \nhave a balance of power; regions have interests that conflict with \nother regions. This is not a case of ideological balances. This is a \ncase of trying to balance the different needs of different parts of our \ngreat and wonderful Nation.\n  Throughout the year, Chairman Lugar worked closely with members to \ncraft a bill that provides us with the basic road map for agriculture \npolicy. I appreciate both his leadership and his friendship. The bill \nrecognizes that farm policy has changed. It cannot be just about the \nproduction side of agriculture. It is about the consumption side of \nagriculture, too.\n  The bill provides important protection to consumers in key \nenvironmental conservation issues. The focus is on providing incentives \nto get farmers to voluntarily do the right thing for the environment, \ntheir communities, and their neighbors.\n  It is a major step away from the old focus of mandatory, detailed \nregulations. The conservation provisions break with the past. They will \nprovide cash payments to farmers for improvements that make sense for \ntheir farms. The bill will help farmers do those things that farmers \nknow should be done. The bill contains the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program, EQUIP, to assist farmers in solving critical water \nquality problems, for those farmers who want to protect lakes, rivers, \nand the ground water important to both them and their neighbors. This \nmeans that farmers will get funds to protect the groundwater that their \nneighbor's children drink.\n  There is $300 million in new spending to restore the Florida \nEverglades which is one of America's national treasures.\n  All of us should agree, whether we are from Florida or not, that we \nneed to restore the Florida Everglades to its full glory.\n  There is a $35 million initiative to buy easements sold by willing \nsellers, on farmland threatened by development. This voluntary program, \ncalled Farms for the Future in Vermont, allows farm families to save \ntheir farmland for their children.\n  The bill contains a conservation farm option that will encourage \nfarmers to use good conservation methods. I am pleased that, despite \nefforts to phase out the Conservation Reserve Program, we were able to \nsave it. It is the Nation's largest, and most successful, private land \nconservation program.\n  I also want to mention dairy. Let me speak not as the ranking member \nof the committee, but as a Vermonter.\n  I know the farmers in Vermont. They work very, very hard. They rise \nearly every morning and work late into the night just to get their milk \ninto the market. I have sat in the kitchens of farm houses throughout \nVermont and talked with the farmers, the women and men, and their sons \nand daughters, who run these dairy farms. I have gotten up with them at \n4 o'clock in the morning and gone into the barns and helped them do \ntheir chores and milking. One farmer said I probably made a better \nSenator than I did a hired hand.\n  I was helping Bob Howrigan bring a couple different herds in \ndifferent fields. As I helped him bring one of the herds across to the \nmilking shed, I said, ``Bob, I got that herd in for you, and I probably \nonly lost a couple cows on the way over.''\n  He said, ``Pat, I appreciate it. If I keep you around a few weeks I \ncan get out of farming altogether.''\n  That is the kind of humor that goes on. These are people who work \nharder than anybody else I know. These are small family farms. They dot \nthe New England countryside. They are a beautiful part of our heritage. \nBut they exist only if they work hard and efficiently.\n  So I am pleased this bill includes an issue very important to my \nregion, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Farmers in my State are \nnot looking for handouts.\n  All they want is a farm bill that gives them a fair price for an \nhonest day's work. They will work harder than anybody else, but they \nought to be recompensed for that work. I am tired of the person in the \nmiddle getting all the profits and the typical Vermont farmer going \nalmost 15 years without any kind of a price increase.\n  This compact is the last best hope of preserving Vermont's heritage. \nDairy farmers work harder than anyone I know. Cows have to be milked 7 \ndays a week. It does not make a difference whether it is 25 degrees \nbelow zero, as it is often in Vermont, or 5 o'clock in the morning. It \nmakes no difference. The cows have to be milked.\n  I commend Chairman Lugar for his help on the dairy compact. I commend \nthe other members of the Vermont delegation. Interestingly enough, we \nare a State where one-third of our delegation is independent, one-third \nis Republican, and the remaining third is me. We came together, all \nthree of us, to work for this. Chairman Lugar talked to farmers in \nVermont. He knew how important it was. After years of debate in \nCongress, we finally have a farm bill that gives them the dairy \ncompact.\n  I want to remind everyone that while retail prices for dairy products \nhave increased 30 percent, farm prices have actually decreased 5 \npercent. I want to also point out that although the price of a half \ngallon of milk has gone from $1.19 to $1.59 over the past 15 years, the \nfarmer's share has remained at just 59 cents.\n  The dairy compact establishes a system which gives the States and \nlocal farmers control over their lives.\n  It will ensure that New England consumers can find milk in their \nsupermarkets at fair prices.\n  It will also provide family farmers throughout the region with a \ndecent living, so that they will be able to pass on their farms to \ntheir children and their children's children.\n  Instead of a national standard imposed by the Federal Government, the \ndairy compact allows local citizens, farmers and officials to make \nlocal decisions on milk. That is good for dairy farmers, good for \nVermont and good for America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a resolution in support \nof the compact from the New England Governors, letters in support of \nthe compact from various groups in Vermont, the vote totals in each of \nthe State legislatures be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            New England Governors'\n\n\n                                             Conference, Inc.,\n\n                                    Boston, MA, February 13, 1995.\n     Hon.

On behalf of \n     the New England Governors' Conference, Inc., I write to ask \n     your help in moving the Compact bill forward as quickly as \n     possible.\n       The attached Resolution of the New England Governors' \n     Conference, Inc. was adopted unanimously at our recent \n     meeting in Washington, D.C.\n       The Dairy Compact has been enacted into law by the six New \n     England states. We hope you will support this unique \n     experiment in cooperative federalism. The Compact is a bi-\n     partisan, state-sponsored, regional response to the chronic \n     problem of low dairy farm prices. If successfully \n     implemented, the Compact will stabilize our region's dairy \n     industry and reinvigorate this crucial segment of our rural \n     economy, without cost to the federal government or adverse \n     impact on the national industry.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                William A.

The Coalition is a \n     group of land conservation and affordable housing \n     organizations, including the Vermont Land Trust, that have \n     been instrumental in the creation of the Vermont Housing & \n     Conservation Trust Fund and in the implementation of its \n     program. In less than eight years, that program has \n     permanently protected more than 125 operating farms in \n     Vermont through the acquisition of conservation easements, \n     and the momentum is growing. Over a third of the transactions \n     have involved the transfer of the farm from one generation of \n     owners to the next, which is a key element in maintaining the \n     long-term viability of the agricultural industry in this \n     state.\n       But that is not the only key element, as you well know. \n     What is also critically important, especially with dairy \n     farming continuing to be the largest sector of Vermont \n     agriculture, is that farmers receive a fair price for their \n     product. If milk prices continue at their present \n     disastrously low levels, Vermont may see a drastic shrinkage \n     in its number of family farms. Even if much of that land is \n     absorbed into other stronger farm operations, Vermont will \n     have lost some of the fabric which makes this state so \n     special.\n       Congress has been moving in the direction of returning more \n     control to the States. It is therefore highly significant \n     that the six New England States have all adopted the \n     legislation endorsing the compact. The only barrier to \n     returning some sense of fairness and control over milk prices \n     is Congress' authorization.\n       I understand that the Joint Resolution has been \n     reintroduced in the House and Senate. I hope you will do all \n     you can to push for its passage by Congress at the earliest \n     possible time. Time is short. An officer at the Farm Credit \n     Association, who works with many farmers and is a strong \n     advocate of Vermont's program to purchase development rights \n     on farmland, recently told me that Vermont may lose as many \n     as 800 farms in the next five years. He felt that the next \n     12-18 months will be the most difficult. We cannot afford to \n     wait for the Compact legislation.\n       Thank you for your support. With best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Darby Bradley,\n     Co-Chair.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Vermont Ski Areas Association,\n\n                                   Montpelier, VT, April 11, 1995.\n     Re Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     87 State Street,\n     Montpelier, VT.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As you well know, tourism and \n     agriculture in Vermont are mutually dependent industries. \n     More and more,\n\n[[Page S3042]]\n\n     these two industries depend on the health and prosperity of \n     each other. For as long as I can remember, the Vermont ski \n     industry has taken a keen interest in the health and \n     stability of Vermont's dairy farms. We not only share a \n     working landscape, but we also share common markets as well \n     as common values.\n       On behalf of Vermont ski areas, I want to thank you for \n     your continued support of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n     Compact. Solving our financial problems within the dairy \n     industry will challenge us for a generation to come, but \n     there is little question that an essential first step is the \n     passage of legislation creating the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy Compact.\n       I urge you to give this matter special attention in a very \n     busy legislative session. We in Vermont's ski industry know, \n     perhaps better than ever, what hard economic times can mean \n     and want to lend our voice of support to the enactment of \n     this legislation at the earliest possible date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Joseph A.

Patrick Leahy,\n     87 State Street,\n     Montpelier, VT.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: We appreciate your efforts of last year \n     to try to obtain passage of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \n     Compact legislation. Congress did not see fit to act on the \n     legislation. We still believe this legislation deserves your \n     strong support and so urge you to help accelerate Senate \n     Joint Resolution 28 through Congress.\n       It is clear that passage will not be easy against western \n     and mid-western determination to hold onto control of milk \n     pricing structures over the entire country. But, we believe \n     that if agriculture is to be sustainable over the foreseeable \n     future in New England, we must be able to set prices for our \n     products based on production costs in New England, not in the \n     corn belt, or on vast federal range lands of the west. The \n     dairy industry should lead the way; the other agricultural \n     sectors will follow.\n       It appears that now is not only an opportune time to press \n     this legislation because of the general mood on federal \n     deregulation and greater empowerment of the states to manage \n     their own affairs, but also because Vermont agriculture, and \n     dairy farms in particular, are undergoing increasingly \n     difficult financial times. Vermont lost 50 more dairy farms \n     in the first two months of this year. Where is it going to \n     end?\n       The Compact was adopted with near-unanimous support by the \n     six New England state legislatures. The Current Use Tax \n     Coalition supported the process then, and we continue to \n     believe that if agriculture is to remain an active part of \n     our lives in Vermont this key piece of legislation must be \n     passed.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of Vermont \n     agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               David A. McDonough,\n     Chair, Current Use Tax Coalition.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      National Bank of Middlebury,\n                                    Middlebury, VT, April 3, 1995.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, \n     U.S. Senator, State Street,\n     Montpelier, VT.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your efforts last year to \n     move the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact through the \n     legislature. National Bank of Middlebury continues to \n     strongly support the Compact, and we are pleased to see the \n     re-introduction of Senate Joint Resolution #28 on March 2, We \n     know that passage will not be easy. However, the Compact has \n     received near unanimous support from the six New England \n     state legislatures. There is a clear regional mandate to \n     solve this problem.\n       Time is of the essence because Vermont dairy farmers are in \n     trouble. The Vermont Department of Agriculture reported a \n     loss of 50 more dairy farms in January and February alone \n     bringing the total farms in Vermont to below 2,000 in number. \n     We will see one of our customers added to the list of \n     casualties in June. The ``loss-of-farms'' rate is alarming \n     for the industry, but also for the state economy. It is \n     unclear how much farming contributes to the tourism economy \n     and the postal nature of Vermont. Our instincts tell us it is \n     immeasureable. So, we urge you to promote passage of the \n     Compact at the earliest time possible. Thank you for your \n     efforts in supporting the Compact.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                G.

Mr. President, the bill expands a great program in Vermont \ncalled the Farms for the Future.\n  Vermont's dairy farms are part of what makes Vermont so special. That \nis why I want to help Vermont farm families keep their land in \nagriculture through the Farms for the Future Program.\n  I included this program in the 1990 farm bill, and since then, \nVermont has purchased the development rights for nearly 100 farms \nthroughout the State.\n  Let me put that another way--nearly 100 Vermont farmers received cash \npayments under this program. This kept their land in farming.\n  I am pleased that this bill contains $35 million more for farmland \nprotection programs throughout the Nation.\n  While this bill has many accomplishments, I wish we could have done \neven more in environmental areas. For example, the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram places a lower cap on enrollments than the bill passed by the \nSenate.\n  Retaining the Senate's cap would have provided further environmental \ninsurance to future generations.\n  The committee I sit on is called the Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry Committee for a reason.\n  We have a long bipartisan history of making sure every child in our \nNation--whether they are rich or poor--has enough to eat.\n  While agriculture programs now extend for 7 more years, one of our \nmost important child nutrition programs, food stamps, will expire 2 \nyears from now.\n  Fourteen million children benefit from the Food Stamp Program. I fear \nthat our precious children--those least able to defend themselves in \nour society--will be at risk in 2 years. I intend to work with Senators \nLugar, Daschle, Dole, and others to make certain that this does not \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, in closing, while this bill adopts important new \nprovisions in farm policy, we must be careful about patting ourselves \ntoo much on the back. There are important areas in conservation, the \nenvironment and nutrition where we have failed to go the extra step.\n  Although this bill is called the farm bill, it affects every American \nevery day of their lives. What we pass today will impact families when \nthey take a vacation to one of our national parks, spread a picnic \nlunch under a tree, bit into a sandwich or drink a glass of juice.\n  The 2 million farmers are important and this bill will serve them \nwell.\n  But we cannot forget that farm policy affects the more than 250 \nmillion Americans who are concerned about the environment, \nconservation, and important nutrition programs.\n  In the last year partisan fights on the budget and other issues have \ntied up Congress and shut down the Government on two occasions. We all \nrealize that is not the way to govern. That is why last month, when it \nappeared that the farm bill would be caught in the same trap, I decided \nto act.\n  With Senator Lugar and Senator Dole, I offered a bipartisan farm bill \nwith strong conservation, environmental and nutrition provisions. I am \nproud that a bipartisan step led to this final bill. I want to also \nthank Chairman Roberts for his efforts in working with me at \nconference. His freedom-to-farm idea has captured the hearts of many \nthousands of farmers through America.\n  This is Congressman Kika de la Garza's last farm bill, as it is the \nlast farm bill for Senator Pryor and Senator Heflin. I have greatly \nenjoyed working with all of them over the years.\n  Let me focus on the conservation provisions for a moment. They are \ndifferent from most--they will provide cash payments to farmers for \nimprovements they would want to make anyway.\n  One program is a voluntary program of payments to Vermont farmers who\n\n[[Page S3043]]\n\nwant to protect Lake Champlain, or protect rivers or other lakes near \ntheir fields. It is also a voluntary program for farmers around the \nNation.\n  It can be expensive to manage your land. Some may need assistance in \ngetting the job done right. That is why Senator Lugar and I designed a \nconservation program called EQUIP. It cuts redtape and guarantees \nfunding for conservation assistance for the next 7 years.\n  This is voluntary assistance that will be available if you need it. \nIt can help Vermont farmers comply with the State's new accepted \nagricultural practices.\n  We are in this together. We want to keep our streams full of trout. \nWe want to make sure St. Albans Bay, Lake Memphremagog, and Missiquoi \nBay are clean for everyone to enjoy. This bill also protects lakes and \nrivers in all States.\n  Keeping our State and regional dairy industry strong is the driving \nforce behind the Northeast Dairy Compact. Working together is how we \nhave gotten so far. At a later date I will thank all those involved in \ngetting the dairy compact approved.\n  Today I want to thank the agriculture committee chairmen in Vermont, \nSenator Tom Bahre and Representative Bobby Starr, Governor Dean, \nCommissioner Graves, Congressman Sanders, and the hundreds of dairy \nfarmers in Vermont who worked with me on getting the job done. And I \nwant to say a special thanks to Jim Jeffords. He and I have worked side \nby side throughout this fight.\n  I also need to highlight the role of Danny Smith. He came down to \nWashington and worked directly with me on getting the compact included \nin the final bill. His support was vital.\n  The compact has come a long way, from the State legislatures of New \nEngland, to the Congress.\n  Vermonters and all of New England know the importance of the dairy \nindustry. But in New England people know that the dairy compact is more \nthan helping farmers, and helping the dairy industry in the region.\n  To New Englanders, a vital rural agricultural economy is part of both \nthe heritage they treasure and the future in which they believe.\n  This bill represents real reform of Federal dairy policy. This bill \nphases down dairy price supports saving more than $300 million, more \nthan 20 percent compared to the baseline. This bill fully funds the \nDairy Export Incentive Program and poises the U.S. dairy industry to \ncapture expanding world markets.\n  The Federal milk orders remain in place but mandates their reform and \nconsolidated the current number of 33 by about two-thirds. I am \nconcerned that the Secretary has been given only 3 years to complete \nthis process. These provisions were hard fought compromises addressing \nthe concerns of farmers, processors, consumers, and the various \nregions. No region or interest group is completely satisfied, but that \nis the sign of a good compromise.\n  A major thrust of this bill is to reduce regulations that are imposed \non farmers and ranchers. It reduces conservation regulations and farm \nprogram regulations.\n  The conference report gives farmers a lot more flexibility to decide \nwhat crops to plant. That means farmers will be able to choose the crop \nrotations that are best for their farms, rather than planting to meet \nthe requirements of the farm program.\n  The bill eliminates existing penalties for producing hay and other \nresource-conserving crops, so the environment should benefit as well.\n  The conference report also brings to an end the practice of requiring \nfarmers to idle productive cropland. No longer will USDA decide each \nyear how much land a farmer must set aside to get farm program \npayments. From now on, the Government will pay farmers to idle land \nonly when that land is environmentally sensitive.\n  A key section of this farm bill is the continuation of international \nfood aid programs--Public Law 480, Food for Progress and the Emerging \nDemocracy Program. These programs are critical in our global efforts to \nfight world hunger. Our responsibility to help others is a moral \nobligation and I am delighted that the importance these programs play \nin the fight against world hunger is understood by all conferees.\n  I am pleased with the strong emphasis that this bill places on \nimportance of maintaining strong U.S. agricultural export markets. \nExport of U.S. agricultural products, especially in the value-added \nmarket, is one of the most profitable and fastest growing sectors in \nour Nation's economy. My home State of Vermont understands its \nimportance. Vermont export statistics indicate that Vermont exported \nmore than $175 million in agricultural-derived products--many of these \nin the value-added category. That translates into a thriving economy \nand local job creation.\n  This bill also streamlines USDA farm lending programs. The conferees \nworked hard with Secretary Glickman to produce a title both the \nadministration, Congress and farm borrowers can support, and I believe \nwe have crafted an effective policy to help farmers prepare for the \nnext century without creating the dependency on USDA loan programs that \nhave existed in past to the detriment of both USDA and the individual \nborrowers.\n  I am disappointed that the conference report does not provide a \nbetter safety net for farmers. Farm program payments will not be tied \nto market conditions, so farmers may get large Government payments when \nthey do not need them, and may not get sufficient aid when times are \nhard. I hope that we can work on new ways to help farmers deal with \nmarket risk.\n  I am also concerned with some of the changes that have been made in \nthe Crop Insurance Program. Farmers will no longer be required to \npurchase crop insurance to get farm program benefits. While I support \ngiving farmers freedom of choice, I fear that too many farmers will \nfail to obtain insurance.\n  If we have widespread crop disaster and many farmers do not have \ninsurance coverage, there will again be political pressure to enact ad \nhoc disaster programs. I supported the effort to reform crop insurance \nin 1994 largely because I wanted to bring an end to ad hoc disaster \nprograms. I want everyone to understand that my willingness to accept \nthese changes in the Crop Insurance Program should not be \nmisinterpreted as a willingness to return to wasteful disaster \nprograms.\n  I have two major concerns with the meat and poultry advisory panel. \nFirst, it will waste money that would be better spent on meat and \npoultry inspectors. Second, the scope of what the panel can investigate \nis too broad.\n  However, on the positive side, the panel is advisory and does not \nhave the constitutional or statutory power to delay food safety actions \nof the Secretary. Delays will only result if the Secretary voluntarily \nagrees that the delay is appropriate.\n  I accepted the provision on studying the usefulness of permitting the \ninterstate shipment of State-inspected meat. This idea was proposed by \nthe President of the United States in his farm bill recommendations. I \nthink it would be useful to have the Secretary's most recent views on \nthis issue.\n  I am especially happy that this legislation includes a proposal that \nwas added at my request, the Flood Risk Reduction Program contained in \nsection 385. I first became interested in this situation after the \ndisastrous floods of 1993. I raised this issue in a hearing with then \nSecretary Espy.\n  I asked the Secretary whether it would make more sense to stop \nfighting the Mississippi River and the natural elements of these lands \nand instead to enroll them in the Wetland Reserve Program.\n  In addition, I spoke to the President personally about this proposal. \nI also wrote a letter to the President detailing my emergency wetlands \nreserve initiative that would improve the proposed disaster relief \nprogram for the Mississippi Valley floods. In this letter I continued \nto attack the inefficiency and high cost of the disaster relief \nprogram.\n  In addition, I pointed out that there is a very good possibility that \nmany of the cropland areas that were once wetlands would be better off \nreturned to wetland status rather than repaired and kept in crops.\n  The success of voluntary programs to help farmers move off flood \nprone bottom land can be seen in the example of Levee District 8 in \nIowa. This area had a history of flood damage. It would have cost the \ntaxpayer about $1,500 per acre to return this land to farmable \ncondition. And then a few years later,\n\n[[Page S3044]]\n\nit would have flooded again. Instead this levee district was \nvoluntarily abolished. A decision that works for the farmers and the \ntaxpayer. I ask unanimous consent that a description of that success \nstory be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        The 1993 Floods--From Levee District to Wildlife Refuge\n\n                          (By Bruce Mountain)\n\n       The farmers were grim as they stood at the road below Bob \n     Hawk's house that leads into the upper end of Levee District \n     8 and Louisa County, Iowa. It was 7 a.m. on July 8, 1993, and \n     it appeared they were going to lose again. There had been \n     record rains in the Iowa River Basin; and Levee District 8, \n     only six miles from the Mississippi, was feeling the brunt of \n     the massive run-off as it funneled 12 million acres down the \n     river.\n       The levee was built in 1927 to protect 2,000 acres of crop \n     ground. The area also contained 600 acres of old oxbows and \n     sloughs (Spitznogle Lake, Sunfish Lake, Rush Lake, Parsons \n     Lake, Wilson Lake, Hall Lake, and Diggins Slough) and \n     riverine forests. It had been estimated the levee was a 25-\n     year levee (able to withstand floods that occur once every 25 \n     years), but in the last 60 years it had been breached 14 \n     times.\n       This looked like it would be number 15. Ed Yotter and the \n     other farmers stood at 551 feet above sea level, and the \n     lower end of the district, at 541 feet, was already under \n     several feet of water due to seepage up through the saturated \n     ground and through the levee. By 8 a.m. water started to lap \n     over the top of the levee at several locations, so the 25 \n     farmers and neighbors moved off the main levee and worked to \n     reinforce the cross levee between Levee District 8 and the \n     adjacent up-stream levee district, number 11.\n       At 9 a.m. word came that the main levee of District 11 had \n     broken and water was gushing in. By 11 a.m. water was coming \n     over the main levee in District 8 like a waterfall. \n     Officially, the main levee was breached in six locations and \n     the cross levee was breached in five, but actually these were \n     the accumulation of many smaller breaches all along the \n     levees. At its height, the flood water was more than two feet \n     over the top of the levee, drowning the hopes of another \n     year's crop.\n       When the flood water finally receded in September, the \n     farmers looked over the damage. They were stunned by the \n     numerous scour holes (some 25 to 100 feet long and 17 feet \n     deep), sand deposits (some 6 inches to 6 feet deep), and \n     flotsam. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS), now known as \n     the Natural Resources Conservation Service, moved in to \n     assess the damage to the crop ground in Levee District 8 (it \n     was later set at up to $3,000 per acre) and to estimate the \n     costs to fix the roads and drainage system. The Army Corps of \n     Engineers obtained estimates to fix the levees.\n       But the landowners were tired of fighting the river. And \n     conservationists and public officials knew this oft-flooded \n     land shouldn't be farmed. For a brief time after the waters \n     receded and before the repairs would need to begin, the \n     situation was ripe for change, and a variety of agencies and \n     nonprofits seized the opportunity. They put together a buy-\n     out of the properties in Levee District Number 8 and \n     created--a year and a half later--Horseshoe Bend, a division \n     of the Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge and a good case \n     study of how a coalition can move quickly when conditions--\n     and the will for change--are right.\n\n\n                   gathering funds and willing buyers\n\n       If the flooding of Louisa County's levee had been a \n     localized incident the levees would have been rebuilt \n     ($800,000), the drainage ditches cleared ($400,000), the sand \n     bars removed, the scour holes filled, and the debris removed \n     ($1.7 million) for an estimated $2.9 million. This excludes \n     the additional costs and federal dollars for disaster \n     payments ($200,000) as well as crop insurance payments and \n     the non-recoverable costs of the landowners. (Today, it is \n     believed that these estimates were low because in the \n     adjacent levee district, number 11, where the levee was \n     actually repaired, the initial estimate proved to be 80 \n     percent below the actual costs.)\n       This was not, however, a localized incident. The flooding \n     of the entire Upper Mississippi River Basin in 1993 was the \n     worst in years. At many of the U.S. Geological Survey gauging \n     stations along the Mississippi, the flow levels exceeded the \n     hundred year mark. In response, Congress passed the Emergency \n     Wet and Reserve Program (EWRP) in October 1993 as a part of \n     flood relief support. Without the funds provided by this \n     program, the Louisa Levee District buy-out could not have \n     occurred.\n       The federal government's disaster aid program was developed \n     to provide compensation for severely damaged crop ground and \n     also to break the cycle of paying for similar damage caused \n     by future floods. Under the program, the Department of \n     Agriculture would purchase a permanent easement on crop acres \n     where the damage caused by the flood exceeded the value of \n     the easement. The easement would prohibit all but very \n     limited agricultural practices, and in Louisa County, it was \n     set at $683 per acre.\n       In early October, the Iowa office of the SCS proposed the \n     idea of buying out the entire levee district, but only from \n     willing sellers and only if the district were dissolved so as \n     to ensure that future levee reconstruction costs would not be \n     incurred. The SCS did not have the funds or the statutory \n     authority to purchase the district, so, in late October, it \n     organized meeting with its own representatives, the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service (FWS), the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the \n     Corps, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the Iowa \n     Natural Heritage Foundation, Pheasants Forever, and other \n     interested parties to seek a solution.\n       The group immediately realized that for the project to be \n     successful, quick action would be needed. With winter \n     approaching, the dredge barges the Corps needed to repair the \n     levees would soon be frozen out. The group thought that a \n     buy-out of the fee title to the parcels in the levee district \n     could be accomplished through joining the Emergency Wetland \n     Reserve payment with additional cash to be raised to equal \n     the fair market value of the property.\n       The area also qualified for FEMA assistance. Applications \n     were made to the Iowa Disaster Management Office, which \n     helped handle FEMA payments, to have the buy-out declared as \n     an alternative floodplain project. That declaration would \n     make up to 90 percent of the disaster payments eligible to be \n     applied for the buy-out. However, an estimated additional \n     $500,000 to $600,000 would still be needed to accomplish \n     the project. Representatives for the FWS indicated they \n     would have the money but not until 1994. The National Fish \n     and Wildlife Foundation then agreed to provide a $250,000 \n     grant to be matched by $250,000 from The Conservation \n     Fund; these monies would be used as a loan or stop-gap \n     funding until the FWS funds became available. Other non-\n     profits, such as the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and \n     Pheasants Forever, also provided funding.\n       The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, a 15-year-old private \n     group, was asked to be the project facilitator. The \n     Foundation would coordinate the offers to purchase land from \n     the individual landowners, coordinate the Emergency Wetland \n     Reserve Program funding with the National Fish and Wildlife \n     Foundation and Conservation Fund monies, and oversee the \n     eventual transfer of the properties. Before the buy-out could \n     proceed, the ultimate owner and manager of the area had to be \n     determined. The choice was between the Iowa Department of \n     Natural Resources and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Due in \n     part to state budgetary constraints and federal management \n     personnel available at the nearby Mark Twain Wildlife Refuge, \n     the FWS was the logical choice to hold title and manage the \n     project.\n       Another condition for the project to proceed was the \n     closing of the levee district and drainage district. \n     Therefore, the statutory requirements for closing the \n     districts, including legal notice and voting procedures, had \n     to be researched. The final closing took place on March 31, \n     1994.\n       Once the landowners agreed to the concept, offers to \n     purchase had to be negotiated with each landowner. The \n     district is owned by 13 different landowners with parcels \n     ranging in size from 13 acres to more than 1,500 acres. One \n     farm is owned by an investor/operator, and another was deeded \n     by President James Polk under federal patent to the owners, \n     Jack and Merrit Parsons's great-great-grandfather, in 1846. \n     Two sisters, Mary Boysen and Martha Hawk, each owned Century \n     Farms, a designation given to farms that have been in the \n     same family for 100 years. Another farm was acquired by duck \n     hunters in 1929, and it is still operated as a private duck \n     hunting club by the heirs of the six original partners.\n       We concluded that all of the offers to landowners had to be \n     based on a consistently applied formula. Several of the \n     landowners said that they were dissatisfied with the offers, \n     but eventually agreed to them, based on the knowledge that \n     other landowners were getting the same offers and that there \n     were no ``special deals.'' By sticking to this strategy, \n     individual negotiations and appraisals were avoided.\n       The first offer was signed December 13, 1993, and the last \n     one was executed May 6, 1994. Seven of the ten landowners had \n     closed by November 30, 1994. The rest closed by the end of \n     1994 as the farmers finished their field work.\n\n\n                             many partners\n\n       Completing a project with so many partners and landowners \n     in such a short time required creativity, cooperation, and \n     attention to detail. One of the more important aspects of \n     this partnership was the Cooperative Agreement signed by the \n     Soil Conservation Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and \n     the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation. This agreement \n     delineates the responsibilities of each party. One useful \n     provision of the agreement is one that specifies that access \n     will be available to top-level officials when efforts were \n     stymied on the local level.\n       The public/private mix in the project was important. The \n     public and private partners can be divided into five \n     categories, each of which served different roles and \n     functions: implementing non-profit organizations, \n     jurisdictional agencies, funding agencies, funding non-\n     profits, and project managing agencies.\n       In this project, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation was \n     an implementing or facilitating non-profit organization. An \n     implementing non-profit was necessary because flexibility and \n     speed were needed to consummate the project. The Iowa Natural \n     Heritage Foundation's Wetlands for Iowa Program was chosen \n     for the project, in part, because\n\n[[Page S3045]]\n\n     it has expertise in land acquisition projects and in forming \n     partnerships with state and federal agencies and other non-\n     profits to fund the purchase of such projects. In this case, \n     the Wetlands for Iowa Program had the responsibility to \n     educate landowners on the concept of merging the Emergency \n     Wetland Reserve Program easement with a buy-out.\n       The Foundation also had many other tasks. It did a \n     preliminary appraisal of the land in November of 1993 and \n     devised the uniform buy-out plan. It paid for a quick \n     appraisal of cropland and non-cropland based on comparable \n     sales and pre-flood land values. From this, a portion of the \n     value due to the flood damage, as determined by SCS, was \n     deducted to arrive at the current value. In dealing with non-\n     motivated sellers, the Foundation packaged the idea as an \n     attractive alternative to farming in the floodplain and as \n     being fair among all neighbors.\n       The Foundation also negotiated offers to purchase land with \n     each landowner and provided the flexibility to customize each \n     transaction. Tax deferments were provided through three-way \n     land exchanges. For example, the Foundation purchased land \n     from a third party (pursuant to the instructions of the owner \n     of levee district land) and then traded the land for land in \n     the levee district. The Foundation then would receive the \n     EWRP payment. Non-levee district acres were purchased to \n     round out tracts that were not eligible for the EWRP. For \n     example, the Spitznogle brothers owned 12 acres inside the \n     levee district, but wanted to sell 20 acres to have square \n     boundaries. The additional eight acres was purchased with \n     some of the funds provided by other nonprofits.\n       Finally, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation developed a \n     timetable for all public and private participants to ensure \n     each was fulfilling its responsibilities. These included \n     appraisals, surveys, title problems, financing, preparing \n     grant applications, closing on each parcel, and transferring \n     each to the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n       The many jurisdictional agencies involved in the project--\n     the Soil Conservation Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Corps--had \n     responsibilities that varied in breadth and longevity. The \n     SCS was responsible for evaluating flood damage to each land \n     parcel and for implementing the Emergency Wetland Reserve \n     Program. The wetland restoration requirements of the EWRP for \n     the participating landowners were the responsibility of the \n     FWS. The FWS also conducted the environmental assessment and \n     environmental impact studies and engaged an independent \n     appraiser to assess the properties and develop comparable \n     figures from in-house appraisers. These figures were very \n     close to the ``quickie'' appraisal obtained by the Iowa \n     Natural Heritage Foundation.\n       FEMA's involvement included assessing damage compensation \n     under its statutory authority and developing the project as \n     an alternative plan. FEMA also had a role as a funding agency \n     for the project as did the SCS and the FWS. Funding non-\n     profits included the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, the \n     National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Conservation Fund, \n     Pheasants Forever, and the Izaak Walton League. The fifth \n     category of partners were project managing agencies, which \n     included the SCS, the FWS, and the Corps.\n       Typically, this type of project does not work in normal \n     regulatory frameworks. Entrenched bureaucrats, enamored with \n     their own regulations, can be a death knell to a project. The \n     time it takes to babysit hesitant landowners and coordinate \n     state and federal agencies does not permit one agency to be \n     inflexible in interpreting its regulations when the intent of \n     the regulations can be met through cooperative and \n     imaginative initiatives. All partners need access to top \n     agency personnel because someone outside the organization can \n     sometimes get results, whereas agency personnel may not have \n     the authority or the influence to buck their way up the \n     system.\n       The Louisa County levee buy-out required close interagency \n     cooperation. As an example, SCS defined the value of damages \n     to the land for purposes of qualification for EWRP. FWS then \n     directed its appraisers to use the same data and valuation \n     premises in determining the fair market value of the land. We \n     would have had difficulty closing the project if the agencies \n     had used two different methods of appraisal and the land \n     qualified for EWRP but would not qualify for the buy-out.\n       Another example: Regulations for the SCS for EWRP \n     easements, and the FWS for land acquisitions, required their \n     respective legal counsel to determine that landowners had \n     marketable title to the land, subject to the guidelines of \n     the project. Through negotiations, SCS agreed to accept FWS \n     opinions of title. This avoided a separate time-consuming \n     step by keeping the project out of the hands of at least one \n     set of government lawyers.\n       The last ingredient for success was agency flexibility. For \n     example, EWRP regulations require all easements to be \n     surveyed and this would have caused an immense delay in the \n     project. To its credit, SCS waived these regulations, since \n     most of the acquisitions involved the entire tract. Surveys \n     were then conducted only on five parcels split on irregular \n     boundary lines.\n\n\n                             severe lessons\n\n       This unique project is giving farmers an opportunity to \n     find alternative agricultural land to continue farming \n     without fighting the floods. Additionally, it provides short- \n     and long-term savings to taxpayers because a one-time, fair-\n     market purchase of flood-prone land is much cheaper than \n     continued, expensive federal programs to rebuild levees, \n     clean drainage districts, repair land, and pay disaster \n     payments. All of these costs are interspersed with crop-\n     deficiency payments and insurance claims. In addition, our \n     latest calculation shows the Fish and Wildlife Service saved \n     $235,000 by having the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation \n     facilitate the transactions. The federal government still has \n     the responsibility to provide existing protection in certain \n     floodplains; but it also must develop alternatives to \n     controlling nature, such as relocating willing landowners and \n     returning parts of the floodplain to the river.\n       The great flood of 1993 taught us some severe lessons. We \n     have to expand our mission from just controlling the water \n     that affects our individual properties to effectively dealing \n     with the effects of the water all the way down the river \n     ecosystem. We also have to learn to live with the river \n     system by holding more of the rain water where it falls and \n     by slowing its movement through the system, thereby allowing \n     the river to reestablish some of its checks and balances.\n       Lastly, we have to stop ``just greasing the squeaky wheel'' \n     and find ways to spread the available federal funds for \n     floodplain management among the various alternatives that \n     benefit the general public. This includes developing a \n     management plan for the entire river system, coordinating \n     pertinent programs and agencies and--where there are willing \n     landowners--giving some of our natural resources back to \n     nature.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The experience with the Emergency Wetland Reserve Program \nled me to include the flood risk reduction initiative into this \nlegislation. The purpose of this program is to help farmers who farm in \na areas that flood frequently to move their farming activities off \nlands that are flooded frequently. It helps farmers by giving them the \ncapital that they need to move their farming operations to fewer risky \nareas. To the taxpayer, it is a commonsense program that will reduce \nthe long-term taxpayers' exposure for agriculturally related flooding \ncosts. It should help reduce the severity and frequency of floods to \nthe farmers' neighbors.\n  Crop damages in recent years have been the source of more than half \nof the property damages in many floods, including the great Midwest \nflood of 1993. Our farm programs have unfortunately provided incentives \nthat increase flood damages because they have directly supported the \ngrowing of easily damaged commodities even in areas that are flood \nprone. The crop insurance, disaster assistance, and related programs \nalso make the public assume much of the risk of growing commodities in \nflood prone areas. We have a strong interest in eliminating the \nauthority to help farmers to switch to more flood resistant uses of \nflood prone land.\n  It gives farmers the financial capability to move their operations to \nless risky land. The incentives for farmers to switch to less risky \nland come from the funds that have in the past been paid to farmers who \nfarm the flood prone land. In this way, we will give farmers in flood \nprone areas the flexibility to shift to alternative agricultural or \nconservation uses of land that are less subject to flood damages.\n  Under section 385 of this act, the Secretary may enter into a \ncontract with a producer under which the producer will agree to forego \nvirtually all of the forms of Federal financial assistance received in \nflood prone areas. In return, this section provides that the Secretary \nwill provide the farmer a one-time payment equal to 95 percent of the \nfuture market transition payments on the land affected. It further \nprovides these funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation regardless \nof whether it has received advanced appropriations.\n  Subsection (e) of this section further authorizes the Secretary to \nprovide additional payments to encourage this switch to less flood-\nsensitive land. It gives the Secretary the authority to add to the farm \nbills' lump sum payments, funds appropriated for programs that would \notherwise be used to support agriculture in flood plans. For example, \nat a minimum this would include funds appropriated for crop insurance, \ndisaster assistance or conservation programs.\n  The Secretary is, of course, free to condition payment for these \nfunds on appropriate conditions.\n  The conferees, by including a separate subsection (e), were merely \nrecognizing that funds are available to the Secretary from different \nsources--CCC\n\n[[Page S3046]]\n\nand advanced appropriations. The conference included language requiring \nadvanced appropriations because the conference wished the Secretary to \noffset any funds provided through the Flood Risk Reduction Program from \nfunds for other appropriated programs that are saved by the flood risk \nreduction contract.\n  As you can see, I have fought hard for this Flood Risk Reduction \nProgram. That is why, I am very pleased it is part of this farm bill.\n  Mr. President, I will speak further at a later time. I notice other \nSenators on the floor. I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota here, and I know he wishes to speak. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  I ask the distinguished Senator, under whose time is he speaking?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Who has time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think everybody does, for and against.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be speaking in opposition.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Then, Mr. President, that time is reserved by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. On his behalf, I \nyield time to the Senator from North Dakota under the control of the \ntime of the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized. \nHow much time does he seek?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will just proceed and end at an appropriate time. That \nis the agreement that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and the ranking member for his \ncourtesy. I thank the chairman of the committee, as well, for his \ngraciousness throughout the debate. We have disagreed, but we have \ndisagreed in a way that I think you would expect of Senators who have \nmutual respect. I certainly respect the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I wish all committees were conducted in the way the Agriculture \nCommittee is conducted. People are given a complete and fair chance to \npresent their views. We disagree, but we do it without personal rancor. \nI think that is a tribute to the chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. President, we are in 1996, and we are working on the 1995 farm \nbill. Something is wrong. What is wrong is that there has been a \nfailure to act. This is the first time since 1947 that a farm bill has \nlapsed before a new farm bill has been put in place. So we are late.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we act quickly so that farmers \nknow the rules of the road as they proceed in this new crop year.\n  This new farm bill has many positive elements. Let me talk about \nthree.\n  First, this farm bill retains permanent law. That is critically \nimportant because, at the end of this 7-year period, if we had followed \nthe lead of the House, there would be nothing. There would be no \npermanent farm law. Farmers would have no assurance that there was \nprovision for them in the future. Mr. President, we have had tough \nfights on this question, but permanent law has been preserved.\n  The second positive element of this bill is that it provides a \ndramatic increase in flexibility for farmers. They can plant for the \nmarket and not for the farm program. That is certainly a significant \nimprovement.\n  Third, this farm bill provides a guaranteed payment that will help \nfarmers with the repayment of advanced deficiencies from last year. \nNow, some say that farmers ought to be repaying, without assistance, \ntheir advanced deficiencies from last year because prices have been \nhigh. It is true that prices are very good right now. But it is also \ntrue that you do not benefit from high prices if you do not have a \ncrop.\n  Mr. President, in my State, many farmers have had 3 years of very \npoor crops. They have had it because of very serious weather \nconditions. We have gone from the extraordinary circumstance of the \nworst drought since the 1930's--in 1988 and 1989--to having the wettest \nconditions, we have seen in decades, for 3 years in a row.\n  Mr. President, it is very hard for some people to understand why \nfarmers are complaining about weather conditions, when conditions turn \nwet. Mr. President, they just did not turn wet; we got the deluge of \nthe century. In one day, one little town in North Dakota received 10 \ninches of rain. This is an area that gets maybe 25 inches a year. They \nreceived 10 inches in one day. We have, in the Devil's Lake basin, what \nI have described to my colleagues in the past as a remarkable \ncircumstance of a closed basin with a large lake that is rising as a \nresult of these wet conditions. It has gone up 13 feet in the last 2 \nyears. The National Weather Service has just informed us it is going to \ngo up another 2\\1/2\\ feet this year. The surface area of the lake has \ndoubled. We had Federal officials come out to look at the disaster that \nis occurring there.\n  They asked the city officials of the little town of Minnewaukan why \nthey built their water treatment facility so close to this lake because \nnow this water treatment facility is surrounded on three sides by this \nlake. The city officials laughed, and told the Federal officials, \n``When we built this treatment facility it was 7 miles from the lake. \nNow it is surrounded by the lake.''\n  Mr. President, those very wet conditions have meant that many farmers \nhave gotten only a partial crop, and even though prices are high they \nhave not had the benefit because they have not had a crop to sell. So \nthese guaranteed payments--especially this year--are important in \nallowing them to repay and stay in business.\n  But just as I have talked about what are I think the positive \nfeatures of this bill, I would be remiss if I did not say that I \nbelieve the underlying farm policy contained in this legislation is \nfatally flawed. First of all, it decouples payments from prices and \nproduction. Mr. President, that is wrong. This legislation contains \npayments that are fixed but sharply declining. That is wrong. This \nlegislation provides no adjustments if prices plunge, or yields are \nlow. That is wrong.\n  I remember very well in 1986--that was the year I was elected to the \nU.S. Senate--wheat that is now selling for over $5 a bushel was selling \nfor $2 a bushel. But we had a safety net. We had a deficiency payment \nsystem that allowed some offsets from the Federal Government. That \nsaved literally thousands of family farmers in my State. Under this \nlegislation there will be no safety net. Thousands of farmers will be \nforced off the land if prices plunge, or if yields are abnormally low \nbecause of disasters.\n  I remember very well what it was like in the 1980's going town to \ntown and meeting to meeting. People came up to me broken financially \nand in spirit because prices collapsed.\n  Mr. President, we should not fashion a farm policy that turns its \nback on people in times of disaster, whether it is a price collapse, or \na weather disaster. We ought to maintain a safety net in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, in my State there are now 30,000 farmers. I believe \nthat under this legislation if prices decline--and they will; we know \nthat it is inevitable in agriculture that prices will decline--when \nthey do, literally thousands of family farmers in my State will be at \nrisk. I believe we will lose perhaps as many as 10,000 family farmers. \nThat will be felt in every city and town in my State. Every school, \nevery rural electric cooperative, every farm co-op, and every grocery \nstore will be hard hit, if more farmers leave the land. And what will \nhappen to those people? They will go to the cities of the country--the \ncities where there are already too many people. I look around us here \nin the Nation's Capital, Metropolitan D.C. and I see too many people \nhere already. It makes no sense to have more people come to the cities \nand leave the countryside bare.\n  Mr. President, in Europe they have a policy to keep people on the \nland. Europe has that policy because they have recognized that it makes \nsense. They understand the jobs that are created by having agricultural \nproduction in their countries. Mr. President, Europe has been hungry \ntwice. They never intend to be hungry again. As a result, they support \ntheir farmers at a level three to four times what we do for ourselves. \nOn exports they support their producers at a level eight times ours. \nThey understand that there are not just the jobs on the farm--that \nthere are the jobs in every element of agriculture that are attached to \nhaving that production in their countries.\n  In this country there are 20 million jobs involved in agribusiness, \nfrom trucking to running the elevator, to all the ancillary activities \nof agricultural\n\n[[Page S3047]]\n\nproduction--20 million jobs. Agriculture is one of the two shining \nlights in the export picture of the United States. Airplanes and \nagriculture are two places where we enjoy a substantial trade surplus.\n  But under this legislation, Mr. President, we are raising the white \nflag of surrender. We are engaged in what I call ``unilateral \ndisarmament'' because we are saying to our competitors, ``You go ahead \nand aggressively seek these markets. We are going to back off. We are \ngoing to back down. We are going to let you take them.''\n  Mr. President, this is a profound mistake. And, if we allow it to go \nforward, we will see happen to us in agriculture what has happened to \nus in automobiles and electronics, and every other place where the \nUnited States did not fight for its market share.\n  Mr. President, that is a mistake. We would never do it in a military \nconfrontation. It makes no sense to do it in a trade battle.\n  Mr. President, for those reasons I will reluctantly vote against this \nfarm bill in the hopes that it will send a signal that there are things \nwe must do for the future.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad pertaining to the introduction of \nlegislation are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, can you tell me the circumstances of the \ntime available on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 122 minutes, the \nRepublican leader has 65 minutes. Senator Leahy has 50 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Democratic leader has how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 120 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me yield such time as I may consume from the \nallocation allotted to the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the conference report on the farm bill is \nnow before the Senate. I listened to the presentation by my colleague, \nSenator Conrad, who intends to vote against it. I, too, will vote \nagainst it. This is not a decent farm bill. It is not a good farm bill. \nIt is attractive to some in the short term. It is sugar coating bad \npolicy.\n  Those who walk around here with bags of sugar putting out bad policy \nand want to brag that they have done something good for people I guess \nmight actually, in their minds, feel they have done something good for \nsomebody. However, I cannot conceive that this piece of legislation, \nbeing addressed in a serious way, says that we want to help family-\nsized farms in this country.\n  This is not a good piece of legislation. This started out as \nsomething called Freedom to Farm, which is a handy title, but it really \nis nothing more than a title. The whole proposition here was to create \nwhat is called transition payments. We would create these transition \npayments in order to get out of a farm program and pull the safety net \nout from under family farmers.\n  I guess it is appropriate for those who do not want a minimum wage \nincrease for the folks working at the bottom of the economic ladder to \nsay we do not want a minimum wage for farmers either. Let us pull the \nrug out from under family farmers. Let us do it this way. Let us \nprovide transition payments to farmers up front as a payment for our \ngetting out of the business of helping farmers when prices collapse.\n  And so they make the transition payments attractive enough so someone \nlooks at them the first year and says, ``well, this is going to a be \npretty good circumstance the first year; if I get a good crop and \nprices are high, I will make good money, plus the Government will give \nme a good payment.'' And they say, ``well, that is pretty attractive, \nisn't it?''\n  Yes, it is attractive. It is wrong. If you have a good crop and \nprices are high, you do not need the Government to give you a payment \nfor anything. But the whole premise of doing this is so that at the end \nof the 7 years you can pull the rug out from under them and say, ``By \nthe way, we gave you transition payments; we bought you off up front so \nyou have no farm program anymore; you have no safety net any longer.''\n  This bill passed the Congress, both the House and the Senate, and \nthen went to conference, and I wish to show my colleagues a chart that \njust pulls off the first sentence of a rather lengthy Associated Press \npiece describing this piece of legislation. It says it better than I \ncould, but let me just read it. Lest anyone who comes here bragging \nabout how wonderful this bill is for family farmers wants to continue \nto brag about that, here is what this bill is. Robert Green had it \nright in the Associated Press:\n\n       With a mix of luck, work, and unusual organization, the \n     lobby for big grain companies, railroads, meat companies, \n     millers and shippers scored a big win in the Senate-passed \n     overhaul of farm programs.\n\n  This is the overhaul of those farm programs. This is what they won, \nnot farmers. This is what the big grain trade firms won. They scored a \nbig victory. Guess what. When the big grain trade firms win, who loses? \nFamily farmers.\n  Is it unusual that the winner coming out of a debate about farm \npolicy in this Congress would be the biggest grain trade firms in the \nworld? I guess not. They have been winning right along. Why would they \nnot win this debate?\n  What bothers me a little bit is that the bill which is going to help \nfamily farmers is mislabeled. It is a bill designed to tell farmers \nthis is going to be in your best interests. The bill tries to sound \nattractive to farmers as a set of agricultural policies, but it is \nreally a big grain trade farm bill. They scored the big victory. They \nare the winners.\n  Now, what do we have when we deal with farmers? What we have in most \ncases is a group of family operations out there around the country. \nThey get up in the morning. They work hard. They go to bed at night. \nThey have tried to make their own way. They have a yard light out there \nin the yard that shines every night.\n  If you get on an airplane and fly across this country, fly across \nMinnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, what you see are those \nthousands of yard lights on at night. They all represent the economic \nblood vessels that feed into those small towns that make rural life \nworthwhile and possible. Every time one of those yard lights turns out, \nit means a little less economic life, a little less opportunity in \nrural America. And we have seen year after year after year fewer yard \nlights in our country.\n  There are some people who say it does not matter whether there are \nany lights out there in the prairie. They do not care whether the \nlights dot the prairie at night; that land will be farmed. We do not \nhave to have people living out there to have people farming. We can \nhave corporate agrifactories farm this country from California to \nMaine. We do not have to worry about the little guy. We do not have to \nworry about the family. It will get farmed. We have bigger tractors and \nbigger combines. We have bigger corporations. They will farm it. They \nare big enough.\n  So if you do not care who lives there, whether there are families out \nthere, then this is probably a great policy. Of course, food prices \nwill go up once corporations are farming the country, but that is in \nthe longer term. That may be what is behind all this. I do not know.\n  I do know this. I have a friend who lives 5 miles south of Regent, \nND, in Indian Creek. He is down there trying to operate a small farm, \nplanting in the spring, not knowing whether what he is going to spend \non planting--buying the seed, fertilizer, having a tractor--it is an \nolder tractor but having a tractor--and all the apparatus to plant that \nseed, he does not know whether that seed is going to grow.\n  All that money might be wasted because that seed may not grow. We may \nhave a drought. It may not come up. So you invest all that money at the \nfront end of the year and you may have no crop. Or it may come up and \nyou may have the most beautiful looking crop you have ever seen, and \nthen in July or June a hailstorm comes along and in 15 minutes the crop \nis gone. Your money is gone. Your dreams are gone. Your hope is gone.\n  Or let us assume that he plants that crop, it comes up, and it is a \ngorgeous\n\n[[Page S3048]]\n\ncrop, a bumper crop, and then he fixes up the combine and gases up and \ngoes to harvest that crop and discovers the price has collapsed. This \ncrop cost him $4.70 a bushel to produce, and then he takes the truck to \nthe elevator and drops off his grain or her grain and discovers that \nthe elevator says it is worth $3 a bushel. They have lost a $1.70 a \nbushel with all that work.\n  First you may not get a crop. If you get a crop, you may not get a \nprice. Those are the twin risks that almost no one else in our country \nfaces. For that reason, because we want families to have an opportunity \nto stay on the farm, we have had a safety net. The new mantra here in \nWashington is ``no more safety net.'' Let's do transition payments, buy \nthem off and say, by the way, we think you ought to operate in the free \nmarket.\n  Now, who is in the free market? What are the sharks out there in the \nfree market going to do when we set all of this free? First of all, you \nhave the big grain trading firms. What do they want? Do they want \nhigher prices? Absolutely not. They would like lower prices. You have \nthe big milling firms. Are they begging for higher grain prices? No. \nThey want lower prices. You have the grocery manufacturers. Do they \nwant higher grain prices? No. They want lower grain prices.\n  You have all these influences in the marketplace that in every way, \nevery day are trying to knock down grain prices. When they win, farmers \nlose. Lower grain prices mean farmers simply do not have the \nopportunity to make a profit on their product.\n  I have shown you the story that I think is probably the only accurate \none I have seen about what really happened with the farm bill passed by \nthe Senate and now is back before us:\n\n       With a mix of luck, work, and unusual organization, the \n     lobby for the big grain companies, railroads, meat companies, \n     millers and shippers scored a big win in the Senate-passed \n     overhaul of farm programs.\n\n  When big grain companies, the big shippers, the meat companies, and \nthe grocery manufacturers are having a party, when they are having a \nday of fiesta because of what this Senate did, does anybody here \nsoberly believe that is in the interest of family farmers? Those \ninterests do not run parallel, and everybody in this Chamber knows it. \nWhen these big grain companies win, farmers lose. It is very simple.\n\n  Let me talk just for a moment about grain prices. Some people say \ngrain prices are high right now, and they are record high compared to \nthe last 10 years. Take a look at what has happened to the price of \nwheat in 10 years. It goes all over the board. I must say, in every \ncase the price of wheat is still below what the USDA says it costs to \nproduce a bushel of wheat, $4.70 a bushel. In every case for 10 years \nthe market price is still below what USDA says it costs, the full cost, \nto produce a bushel of wheat.\n  Nonetheless, the wheat prices go down to $2.33 in 1977, meander up to \n$2.49, back to $2.42 in 1986. In fact, just 5 years ago wheat prices \nwere $2.61. I ask anybody in this Chamber, how many farm units do they \nthink will survive if we get to the point of $2.60 wheat and no safety \nnet? What will happen when we have transitioned people out of the farm \nprogram because we said we will give you a few payments up front and \nthen you are on your own.\n  I know I strongly supported retaining permanent law until the year \n2002, but everybody understands they included that in this bill to get \nit passed. The full intention of those who support this farm \nlegislation is to transition farmers out of a circumstance where a \nsafety net exists so when prices collapse they have a little help.\n  I am the first to admit, when they stand up to talk about, ``The farm \nprogram does not work,'' I am the first to admit the farm program, in \nmy judgment, needs improving. It became a straitjacket for farmers. We \nhad the Government telling farmers what to plant and when to plant it, \nand that did not make any sense. Every proposal before the Congress \nwould have changed that, including the substitute that we offered.\n  The current program did not work very well. What should have been a \nbridge across price valleys became a set of golden arches for the \nbiggest producers in the country. I agree with that as well, and that \nought to change. But none of those criticisms are a justification for \npulling the rug out from under family farmers--none. If we are going to \nwrite a farm bill, we ought to do it seriously and thoughtfully, in a \nway that says this farm bill cares about whether we have family \nfarmers.\n  Mr. President, if we in the Congress are not interested in who farms, \nif we are neutral on the question of whether there are family farms out \nthere with yard lights burning and people living on the farms, if we \nare neutral on that, if we do not care, then get rid of the whole farm \nprogram. Get rid of it altogether. We do not need a farm program. Do we \nneed a farm program to give incentives to the biggest agrifactories to \nproduce? I do not think so. Let them produce for the market. Let us get \nrid of the farm program.\n  USDA was created under Abraham Lincoln. Abe Lincoln created the \nDepartment of Agriculture with nine employees--think of that. In the \n1860's, USDA, nine employees. Now, a century and a third later, we have \na USDA with close to 100,000 employees. A third of those, I guess, are \nin the Forest Service. But think of what has happened with the USDA. We \ndo not need a USDA, in my judgment, if the purpose of the farm program \nhere in Congress is not to try to nurture and maintain and help and \nstrengthen family farms.\n  Someone says, how do you define a family farm? I do not have a simple \ndefinition. I guess a yard light. I mean, a family living out there on \nthe farm, human beings living out there, that is a family farm, I guess \nI could define it.\n  Michelangelo was asked, ``How did you carve David?''\n  ``I chipped away a piece of marble at a time and chipped away \neverything that was not David.''\n  I could chip away everything that is not a family farm and have a \npractical definition, I suppose. But my point is: If our business is \nnot to try to help families to have an opportunity to survive the twin \nrisks of the possibility of not being able to produce anything and the \npossibility of producing something and having no price, what is our \nbusiness? If our business is not to try to protect those families or \ngive those families some help, let us not have a farm program at all. \nIf it is our business, let us create a farm program that does just \nthat.\n  This farm program says to farmers, we are neutral on the issue of \nwhether families are living on the land. It says to farmers, ``We are \ngoing to transition you.'' We are going to say to you, ``We will give \nyou some really attractive-looking things in the first year or so. \nThen, we are going to pull the rug out.''\n  We are going to say to you, ``You might have record wheat prices this \nyear, grain prices this year. You might have a bumper crop this year. \nYou might have the best income you have had in a century of your family \nliving on and operating on the land. We do not care. We are going to \ngive you a big Government payment. But, down the road, you and your \nfamily might suffer catastrophe: no crop, no price, and do you know \nwhat we are going to say to you then? Tough luck.''\n  This year we are going to say, ``Here is a payment you do not need,'' \nand a few years down the road we are going to say, ``Sayonara, tough \nluck. We do not care.'' That is not much of a farm bill, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  For farmers in this country, people out there who are trying to make \na living, struggling against the odds, trying to deal with economic \ninfluences that are so much larger and so much more powerful than they \nare--this piece of legislation, while attractive in the first year or \ntwo, in my judgment undercuts the true long-term interests of trying to \nmaintain a network of family farms in our country.\n  Let me finish where I started. We have kind of come full circle, in \nmany respects. I know there are people on this floor who do not like \nwhat I said. They will stand up and say it is all baloney, this is a \nwonderful bill, they worked hard on it, they are wonderful people, and \nso on and so forth.\n  Let me admit they are wonderful people and worked hard on it, but let \nme also say the product they came up with does not serve the interests \nof family farmers in this country. I do not want more Government in \nagriculture. I want Government to let farmers farm. But I also want to \ncare whether there are family farmers left in our country. I want us, \nas a country, if we have a farm policy and we are going to\n\n[[Page S3049]]\n\nspend money on a farm policy, to decide we are going to spend it in \npursuit of helping farmers when prices collapse, helping them stay on \nthe land.\n  If that is not our business, get rid of the whole business, just get \nrid of it all. Do not come here and pretend you are passing a bill that \nis good for family farmers when you are going to pull the rug out from \nunder them 5 or 10 years from today.\n  There is great disagreement in my State among farm organizations and \ncommodity groups on this subject, but there ought to be no disagreement \nthat family farmers have been the economic all-stars in our country. We \nhave had, for some long while, a basic safety net to try to help family \nfarmers over price valleys, when international prices drop and stay \ndown. Those who believe that such a safety net is ill-advised are often \nthe same people who are here suggesting minimum wages do not matter and \na whole series of other economic contentions that I fundamentally \ndisagree with.\n  I think, if we are going to spend billions, we ought to decide to \nspend billions in pursuit of policies that really do help America's \nfamily farmers, America's economic all stars. The failure to do that \nforces me to vote against this piece of legislation and to conclude \nthat the winners, as is indicated in this piece of work, are the grain \ntrade firms. The winners are the millers. The winners are the grocery \nmanufacturers. Sadly, the losers will be America's family farmers.\n  We will have another day. This is advertised as a 7-year farm bill. \nThere will be changes in this body and, when there are changes \nsufficient so that those of us who believe differently can come to the \nChamber with additional ideas and have the votes to pass them, you will \nsee a new farm program. This may last a year. But I tell you this, when \nthis Chamber changes, we will be back. Those of us who believe that \nthere are two sides to this issue, that the economic well-being of the \nbig grain trading firms in this country is assured by their economic \nstrength but that the economic well-being of family farmers is assured \nby our determination to try to help them, will be back. Those of us who \nbelieve this will come back with a farm bill that will work for family \nfarms in our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Idaho [Mr. \nCraig], is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Lugar, for yielding time.\n  At the outset, let me thank Chairman Lugar and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Leahy, for the bipartisan way they worked, together \nwith the whole committee, in crafting the farm bill that we have before \nus today. It was a tremendous pleasure for me and my staff to work with \nthe staff of the Agriculture Committee to produce what I think is a \ntruly revolutionary document, and a change, a positive change for \nAmerican agriculture.\n  Let me also recognize Sara Braasch, who worked with me on my staff, \nfor the tremendous effort she put in, working with the Senate \nAgriculture Committee staff, resolving so many different issues that \nmake up a good farm bill.\n  Over the course of the last 2 years I have held a series of meetings \nacross my State, meeting with farmers and ranchers about what they \nthought ought to be in a new farm bill, a new, national, public policy, \nas to how Government, Federal Government, ought to interface with \nAmerican agriculture and Idaho agriculture. I heard in so many ways a \nlevel of frustration mounting across my State that, while they thought \nsome level of farm policy was necessary, Government was no longer a \ncooperating partner.\n  It had become a traffic cop, if you will, a conservation cop, if you \nwill, telling that family farmer how to farm, what to farm, how much \nresidue they could have on their soil, how they would have to do this, \nmaybe they ought to change their equipment line to accomplish a \ndifferent form of farming.\n  I doubt that that is the kind of agriculture that Abraham Lincoln \nenvisioned when he created USDA. I think he saw USDA as a partner for \nresearch, as a partner for bringing on new concepts and ideas, but \ncertainly not as a large, monolithic governmental agency that was \ntelling production agriculture how it ought to farm, and that is \nexactly where we saw farm policy heading.\n  This weekend, I met, once again, with farmers in Idaho to talk about \nwhat is in the new farm bill. There were potato growers there, bean \ngrowers, wheat growers, barley growers, ranchers--a broad cross-\nsection--along with processors. They were pleased with what they began \nto see and hear. Dairy was there, and dairy, of course, is a large and \ngrowing segment of my State's agriculture. They are concerned, but they \nbelieve that we have made the right decisions to move them toward a \nmore open market.\n  That is exactly what I think we have accomplished: a significant \nchange in agricultural policy, as the chairman of our committee so \nclearly spoke to last evening, and a very important change.\n  We are saying to American agriculture, ``You have an opportunity now \nto adjust and change with the markets; that you don't have to farm to \nthe program; that you don't have to have the Federal agent who comes \nout and says, `Oh, I think you are 7, 8, 10 percent over acreage, you \nare beyond the flex, you better take some of that out or change it a \nlittle bit.''' Is that farming or playing the game?\n  The young farmers of Idaho--and, yes, they are family farmers--but \nthey have millions of dollars invested. I find it interesting, when we \nworry about farmers, we always fall back on the word ``family,'' \n``family.'' Farming is a big business in my State today. It is family-\nrun, in many instances, but those families have assets in the millions \nof dollars, and they work daily as astute, well-trained businessmen and \nwomen trying to operate their agribusinesses.\n  We know agriculture is changing, and we know that it is capable of \nadapting. When those young farmers and ranchers come to me, in most \ninstances they find Government the liability and not the asset. I think \nthat is why they look at what we are doing in S. 1541, and the new farm \nbill that we have before us, and say this is good policy.\n  I will be the first to recommend to our chairman that the \nresponsibility of the Senate Ag Committee over the next several years \nwill be to monitor, to do effective oversight, to make sure that that \nwhich we are crafting into policy that will hit the ground in rule and \nregulation that American agriculture will respond to, we ought to \nwatch, especially in the more complicated areas like the dairy policy. \nBut certainly, as the chairman said last night, there will be fewer \nvisits to the local USDA office by production agriculture in the coming \nyears, he speaks well, because there should be. We are saying to \nAmerican agriculture and to my farmers in Idaho today, you have great \nflexibility to do what you said you wanted to do.\n  There are some provisions in this bill that are enhanced \nsubstantially, because along with all that we heard from agriculture \nover the last several years, Mr. President, there are several things we \nalso heard that we just did not change and did not just take away from \nfarm policy. Conservation is one of those. The CRP program has worked \nwell in my State, and agriculture likes it because it gives us an \nopportunity to build back wildlife habitat and to improve water quality \nand to improve the erosion that was happening on some of our more \nerodible lands, some of our steeper landscapes.\n  We kept CRP. We strengthened the conservation program. We recognized \nthat here is where USDA and Government can be a cooperating partner, \nand I underline the word ``cooperating,'' not going in and telling \nthem, ``Here is how you must do it,'' but ``Here are a variety of ways \nto manage your assets in a way that we can provide a better \nenvironment, and you can enhance your farmstead and all that you have \non your private property.''\n  Clearly, the chairman and the ranking minority member worked with all \nof us to assure that we had a strong CRP program; the creation of a \nwildlife habitat program; a grazing lands conservation initiative that \nwill provide technical assistance to private landowners in grazing \nareas, again, a very\n\n[[Page S3050]]\n\npositive approach toward dealing with the responsibilities we ought to \nhave; an extension of the resource conservation and development \ndistricts. That which the House did not do, we reinstated.\n  We have strong water language, as was spoken to last night by the \nSenator from Washington as it relates to the responsibility of the U.S. \nForest Service in responding to the relicensing or the recertification \nof water projects on public lands without holding these municipalities \nor water districts hostage or blackmailing them, as they should not do \nbut as they were doing. We have offered a moratorium to make sure that \nwe get USDA to understand their responsible and legal role under \nWestern water law, and that is, not to take without compensation a \nproperty right as is clearly established under Western water law.\n  Guaranteed payments to wheat and barley growers to help provide \nstability over a 7-year period--somebody said no more safety nets. I \nthink we have provided a very good glidepath and a very substantial \nramp on which to glide that path toward the market, and that is what we \nare asking American agriculture to do.\n  I fought hard for a readjustment in an important program for my \nState, the sugar program. We have made major changes in deregulating it \nand creating greater flexibility. But it is a program that is no net \ncost to the taxpayer. It is one that pays for itself, and it is one in \nwhich, again, Government can play a valuable role, and that is to solve \nthe political barriers that oftentimes happen in trade, where we can \nhave massive dumping in a domestic market that could destroy that \nmarket for the producer. We have said, ``Here are the regulations and \nthe process that will protect the domestic producer, while recognizing \nour responsibility to the consumer,'' and I think the sugar program \nreflects that.\n  The one program that was the most difficult to change was the program \nthat was the most regulated, and that was the dairy program. Literally \nfor months in the Senate we tried to resolve that issue. In the House, \nthere was a stalemate. Finally, in the last hours, we were able to work \nout compromises that like, again, all other programs in this bill, \nmoves the dairy producer toward the market while at the same time \nallowing a tremendous opportunity for that individual producer to get \ninto world markets. That is exactly where production agriculture in our \ncountry today must go to remain profitable.\n  I said on the floor of the Senate some months ago that in my youth, I \nhad the opportunity to be a national officer in the once called Future \nFarmers of America, now known as FFA. I remember standing on the floor \nat State conventions around this country and saying one farmer produced \nenough for his or herself and 30 other Americans.\n  Today, we know that has changed dramatically. That one farmer \nproduces enough for his or herself and about 130 other Americans or \nworld citizens. I use that to dramatize how important it is for \nGovernment to participate with agriculture in knocking down the \npolitical barriers that disallow us from entering world markets. That \nis a legitimate role of Government. It is clearly spoken to in this \nbill.\n  Another legitimate role is research. I think that is what our first \nagricultural President, Abraham Lincoln, had in mind, using the assets \nof Government to advance agriculture, not to control it and manipulate \nit and manage it. That is exactly what we have done historically. But, \nfrankly, over the last decade, we have backed away from Government's \nresponsibility in long-term research that has helped advance new \nvariety and kept productivity on the farms of America at ever \nincreasingly higher rates. I think we speak again to that issue in this \nbill.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by saying Government does, in my \nopinion, have a legitimate role in agriculture, and that is as a \ncooperator, to cooperate in the area of trade, to knock down the \npolitical barriers that might artificially be established that disallow \nproduction agriculture from getting into world markets.\n  It also has an area in research. That is what we ought to advance to \nassure the constant maintenance and ever-increasing productivity on \nAmerica's farms.\n  It also has a responsibility to cooperate in conservation and \nimproving environmental standards, but it does not have a \nresponsibility to dictate the market or to micromanage the family farm \nor the agricultural production unit. That is what this farm bill speaks \nto.\n  Let me close by once again thanking the chairman and the ranking \nmember for recognizing our role, as the Senate Ag Committee, to move \nquality legislation to this floor and now to the President's desk. I am \npleased to have been a part of it. I am proud to serve on the Senate Ag \nCommittee. I think we have made a quantum leap forward in working with \nagriculture to move itself into the 21st century as a market-producing \nentity of the American economy.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it has been our habit, at least thus far in \nthe debate, to alternate sides. The distinguished Senator from Idaho \nhas just spoken. The Senator from Oregon has been waiting to speak, but \nI request that it be permissible for the Chair to recognize a \nDemocratic Party speaker and ask the distinguished ranking member to \nyield time and then to alternate herein. I will grant time to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wish to let the Senator know I am \nspeaking against the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand. I have time reserved in favor of the bill. I \nwonder if I might yield----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought I had time from the minority leader to speak \nagainst the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator does, and the minority leader will let the \nSenator have whatever time he wants.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see two colleagues here. We have had a \nspeech in favor. Why do we not let the distinguished----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would yield myself 10 minutes from the minority \nleader's time to speak against the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Could I point out another thing, I say to the Senator? We \nhave a conference on the appropriations, and the distinguished chairman \nof that wants to go forward. As the distinguished Senator from Florida \nonly wants 5 minutes, why do I not yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Florida the 5 minutes so the distinguished Senator from Oregon, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, can then next be \nrecognized and then yield whatever time the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota wants.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have to go to the State Department for an \narrangement between a Minnesota company and another country in 15 \nminutes. That is why I have been here early.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask that the time from the Democratic \nleader be given to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota to speak in \nopposition. I ask if he might try, as best he can, to accommodate the \nothers, to limit his time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. I would be pleased to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, can I ask if I might be recognized after \nthe Senator from Oregon?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I assure the Senator from Florida, he will be.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I am sorry we \nare all here at once. I will try to be very brief. I have been on the \nfloor for some time waiting to speak.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me just thank all of my colleagues \nfor their work on the bill, including the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, whom I have a tremendous amount of respect for. I mean that \nvery sincerely.\n  Let me say that the good news is that farmers need to know where they \nstand. The spring planting season is upon us. People need to know what \nthe program is going to be.\n  The good news is that there are some programs, some provisions in \nthis legislation that are positive and very important. One of them is \nthe reauthorization of the Conservation Reserve Program, which I think \nhas been a win-\n\n[[Page S3051]]\n\nwin-win program. It does my heart good when environmentalists and \nfarmers and outdoor recreation people all come to my office, all in \nstrong agreement about the importance of this program.\n  I also think that the $300 million for rural economic development is \nextremely important. In particular, the focus on encouraging and \nproviding whatever kind of assistance we can for farmers to form their \nown value-added processing co-ops and retain as much of the value of \nwhat they produce as possible, is right on the mark.\n  Finally, I am no strong supporter of what was the status quo, and I \ndo believe, as my colleague from North Dakota said, in all too many \ncases farmers have had to farm a farm bill as opposed to farm the land. \nNo question about it: more flexibility is certainly one of the things \nthat farmers in my State have been very interested in.\n  Let me talk about two fundamental flaws of this piece of legislation. \nI take very serious exception--and I do not think it is really \nprovincial on my part to do so--to the dairy provisions. It has to do \nwith why we are elected. We are elected to do our best, to speak for \nand represent and sometimes, I suppose, fight for people in our States. \nI thought that the Senate had spoken clearly that we were not in favor \nof a northeast dairy compact. I was very involved in the effort to \nknock that provision out. In the conference committee, we got a \nvariation of that, giving the Secretary of Agriculture the right to \ncertify such a compact.\n  That troubles me to no end. It is a huge flaw in this legislation. \nThe dairy provisions of this bill are not favorable to farmers in \nMinnesota, period. There is not substantial, genuine reform of the milk \nmarketing order system, which is what we need. We have been losing \nthousands of dairy farmers in my State.\n  What this potential northeast dairy compact is all about is it gives \none region of the country an opportunity to have its own deal while it \ntakes the problems of another region of the country off the table. It \nis simply unfair. For that reason alone, I would not vote for this farm \nbill.\n  The second reason is--and I could go on and on, but I am not going to \nout of deference to my colleagues who are also here on the floor to \nspeak--but to make a very long story short, I believe that this piece \nof legislation is fundamentally flawed in one other respect. What we \nhave here is a carrot followed by a stick.\n  The carrot is that if prices are high--and they currently are--and in \naddition to your price, you have a hefty support payment that goes on \ntop of that, it is a carrot. I can hardly blame people for being \nattracted to that proposition. As a matter of fact, I can hardly blame \nsome farmers in my State who I think are saying, ``Look, we don't know, \nPaul, whether there's going to be any farm program in the future. We \nmight as well get the best financial deal that we can.'' I understand \nthat.\n  But the question is, what happens in the future? I heard my colleague \nfrom Idaho talk about a glidepath. But glidepath to where? I mean, if \nwe are going to cap the loan rate at $1.89 for a bushel of corn and \n$2.58 for a bushel of wheat, the 1995 level, my question is, since what \ngoes up, comes down, and what happens when prices are low again? That \nis the stick. That comes later on.\n  We are talking about children of farmers who want to farm in the \nfuture. We are talking about whether or not farmers are going to have \nany negotiating power in the marketplace. I think what happens is that \neventually, with this piece of legislation, the grain farmers in my \nState will be on their own. They are on their own with the grain \ncompanies, and they are on their own with the Board of Trade. They are \non their own with the railroad interests.\n  I agree with my colleague from North Dakota. I think the Tulsa World \nhad it right: ``With a mix of luck, work and unusual organization, the \nlobby for big grain companies, railroads, meat companies, millers and \nshippers scored a big win in the Senate-passed overhaul of farm \nprograms . . .''\n  Mr. President, again, there is so much more to say. Let me put it \nthis way. I wish there was a free market in agriculture. I wish Adam \nSmith's invisible hand was operative. I wish that in the food industry \nwe had many small economic enterprises in competition with one another. \nBut that is not what a rigorous economic analysis of the food industry \nreally shows us.\n\n  The conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table, \nexercising raw economic and political power over farmers, taxpayers, \nand consumers. Everywhere the farmers look, whether it is on the input \nside or whether it is the output side, they are the ones, the family \nfarmers are the ones, who really represent the free enterprise part of \nthis, but they are faced with oligarchy at best and monopoly at worst.\n  I think this bill is a piece of legislation that is great for the \ngrain companies because eventually they will get their prices low. If \nthe farmers, as they look to who they sold their products to, if the \nfarmers could see many small businesses, that would be fine. But that \nis not what they are faced with. They are faced with concentration. Now \nwe are simply taking away the very leverage that farmers have had for a \nfair price in the marketplace.\n  So this piece of legislation is a carrot, followed by a stick. I \nthink it is going to lead to the demise of many family farms. I really \ndo believe that. I know my colleagues disagree with me. I hope they are \nright. I hope I am wrong. Because the health and the vitality of \ncommunities in Minnesota is not based upon the acres of land that are \nfarmed or the number of animals, but the number of family farmers that \nlive there. I see this piece of legislation being a stacked deck \nagainst family farmers on the grain front. On the dairy front, the \nNortheast dairy compact is outrageous and discriminatory and never \nshould have been put in the bill by the conference committee. On that \nbasis alone, as a Senator from Minnesota, I do not support this piece \nof legislation. I hope my colleagues will vote ``no.'' I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes Senator \nHatfield.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield time to the distinguish Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of our Agriculture \nCommittee, the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, for yielding time. I, \ntoo, want to add my word of congratulations to the leadership of this \ncommittee, Senator Lugar and Senator Leahy, for bringing forth an \nupgrading and updating of this agricultural legislation.\n  Mr. President, the flood of 1996 in my part of the country has had a \ndevastating impact on much of my State. What I have enjoyed for many \nyears, and now in my adopted home, is the lush and green countryside of \nthe coastal area. It is now barren and covered beneath 2 feet of river \nsilt. The once bountiful pasture lands are no more, and the dairy cows \nstruggle, searching the bare landscape to find scant morsels of food. \nMany businesses, homes, and families have been adversely affected by \nthe flood. Imagine a small part of this flood damage area, a small \ncounty in northwestern Oregon, seven raging rivers running through it \nand the silt-laden waste water flooding into three bays of the Pacific \nOcean. There is such a county, and that county, Mr. President, is \nTillamook County, a good Indian name, Tillamook County.\n  Tillamook County on the northern Oregon coast is the poorest per \ncapita income county of the 36 counties in my State. The entire \npopulation of the town of Tillamook consists of only 4,000 people. \nRoads which connect Tillamook to the rest of the State have been and \nwill be closed for months. Highway 6, which is the east-west corridor \nto Portland, will be closed for months. Highway 101, which is the \nnorth-south corridor out of Tillamook, has been closed since November \nwhen the storm started hitting this part of the State.\n  The leading enterprise in the area is dairy. Mr. President, no \nindustry has suffered more than the dairy industry in Tillamook. As a \nresult of the floods primarily, and windstorms, is that thousands of \nacres of Tillamook are covered with silt--in some cases as high as 2 \nfeet. It may take as long as 2 years for these lands to recover. Added \nto the destruction of the grazing land, there have been tremendous \nlosses in livestock and feed, along with damaged equipment and \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n  Of this town of 4,000, more than 400 people work at the Tillamook \nCounty Creamery Association, a local co-op of producers and processors. \nIn this county, there are over 2,000 people directly involved in the \ndairy industry. Those numbers do not include veterinarians, \ntransporters, supply stores, restaurants, and businesses that live and \ndie based on the health of the dairy farmers.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this community is isolated due to closed \nroads. The land, which is the lifeblood of the communities, is \nsmothered under 2 feet of silt. The economic base of this community has \nbeen decimated. The short-term prospects for this community are bleak.\n  With such misery heaped upon this little community, it would have \nbeen easy for them to give up, but that is not what has happened. The \ncommunity of Tillamook locked arms and is working their way back. \nImmediately after the floods, efforts were made to keep production \nlevels as high as possible at the Tillamook County Creamery \nAssociation. Haygrowers throughout Oregon donated several thousand tons \nto feed the animals. The outpouring of relief efforts has been \nphenomenal. The Oregon Dairy Farmers Association coordinated relief \nefforts, which included $200,000 in donations from within the industry, \nlining up hay deliveries, and assisting hard-hit dairies outside of the \ntown of Tillamook--which, by the way, this town of 4,000 is the largest \ntown in that little county. Dairy farmers helping other dairy farmers. \nLocal, State, and Federal agencies are also assisting with potential \nloan programs and technical expertise.\n  I inquired if there was anything else that Congress could do for this \ncommunity. The response was, ``Help us with the Pacific Northwest Milk \nMarketing order.'' Now, Mr. President, I attempted to include \nlegislation in the farm bill which would have done so. My amendment \nwould have separated, temporarily, Oregon from this regional milk \nmarketing order. What is the Pacific Northwest Milk Marketing order? \nLet me explain.\n  Oregon and Washington and a small part of northern Idaho are part of \nthis regional marketing order. Federal milk orders are authorized by \nthe Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. Mr. President, this \ndepression legislation, almost 60 years old, unfortunately, is still \ngoverning much of our dairy industry. As the Senator from Idaho has \nindicated, this bill moves the dairy industry closer to the market \neconomy. Under this law the Secretary of Agriculture establishes \nFederal orders that apply to buyers of milk. Orders are initiated by \ndairy farmers normally through cooperatives and can be issued only with \nthe approval of the dairy farmers in the affected area. A milk order is \na legal document issued to regulate the minimum prices paid to dairy \nfarmers by handlers of grade A milk in a specified marketing area.\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment would have temporarily changed the \nmilk marketing order for a period of 2 years to let flexibility apply \nto this unique situation in one part of that industry in the Northwest, \nthe Tillamook County Creamery Association. The change would have \nallowed these farmers to get back on their feet and compete in an open \nmarket by giving them added flexibility in establishing their prices.\n  It was at this point that I hit a brick wall. What was that brick \nwall? Darigold, Inc. Prior to 1989, Oregon had its own milk marketing \norder, and it was not until that time that efforts were made to combine \nthe orders. Those efforts were headed up and dominated by Darigold. \nThey used their size and their strength to combine Washington and \nOregon under one marketing order, against the objections of the small \nmilk handlers in Oregon. Darigold is the fourth largest cooperative in \nthe Nation, the fourth largest cooperative in the entire Nation. \nDarigold had almost $1 billion in sales in 1994 alone, with much of \ntheir production--and please let me underscore this--with much of their \nproduction in powdered milk, for example, being purchased by Government \nsurplus markets. Compare this with the Tillamook County Creamery \nAssociation, which had $124 million in sales, all in consumer products \nproduced from local milk--consumer products, not big Government \ncontracts. In their January 1996 member newsletter, Darigold claims a \n1995 production of 4.7 billion pounds of milk, 10 times the volume of \nthe Tillamook County Creamery Association, with milk purchased from \nthree States. Darigold produces a wide variety of milk products, \nincluding powdered milk, ice cream, packaged cheese, and butter. \nCompared that with Tillamook, which focuses mainly on a specialty \nproduct known as the world famous Tillamook Cheese, which is sold to \nconsumers.\n\n  How did Darigold hold up this amendment? The same way most things are \ndone in this litigious society we live in--the Darigold lawyers came \nforth and threatened to tie up this legislation in the courts. They \nwere sure they could do so for at least a year, and this is the year \nthat needs help. This would have blocked the temporary separation of \nOregon from the Pacific Northwest Milk Marketing order for this year. \nTillamook County and its dairy farmers do not have the luxury of \nwaiting a year. The Darigold brick wall would have been able to thwart \nthe very will of Congress by stalling this amendment, if it had been \nadopted. Mr. President, this is a terrible injustice and a black eye on \nthe capitalistic system, when the giants can run out the small \noperators from the marketplace because they have Government contracts.\n  Tillamook County is small, it is battered, but I know it is not out. \nThe strong will of the people of this community and the dairy industry \nin Oregon will not allow this setback to discourage them. I am \ndisappointed that we will not be able to give Tillamook a helping hand \nat this time of great need. I am disappointed with the Darigold lawyers \nfor blocking this assistance, and I am disappointed by the greed of the \nDarigold, Inc. Mr. President, in this situation, the almighty dollar \nwas the bottom line, and compassion was nowhere to be found. That is \nnot and should not be the character of our economic system.\n  I thank my good friends from Washington and Idaho, particularly \nSenator Gorton and Senator Craig, who have been very sympathetic of the \nsituation in Oregon. They have offered their assistance where possible, \nand I thank my colleagues for their sensitivity to the plight of flood-\ndamaged Tillamook and the State of Oregon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield from my time such time as the \nSenator from Florida might need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to commence by stating my deep \nappreciation to Chairman Lugar and the ranking member, Senator Leahy, \nfor their great consideration of issues that were important to \nagriculture across America and especially important to agriculture and \nthe people of my State of Florida.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, the State of Florida is a State \npeculiarly vulnerable to a variety of climatic and other disasters. One \nof the things that we have tried to do is to learn from those disasters \nand avoid, where possible, a repetition of previous mistakes, and to \nbring to the attention of the appropriate decisionmakers steps that \ncould be taken in order to moderate the impact of future adverse \nconsequences.\n  In the last few years, we have had an unusual number of incidents \nthat have impacted Florida agriculture. Hurricane Andrew is the best \nknown, but by no means the only such incident. As a result of that, we \nhave assembled a number of lessons learned, in terms of how American \nagricultural law for disasters, crop insurance, and other steps that \nare intended to soften the impact of negative events, could be modified \nto be more effective and applied to the special agriculture of our \nState.\n  I wish to thank Senator Lugar, Senator Leahy, and their colleagues \nfor their consideration and for the number of steps that are contained \nin this legislation that will have that effect.\n  Let me just briefly summarize a few of those provisions. The Federal \nCrop Insurance Act will be amended by the legislation before us today \nto provide for coverage of crops that have been destroyed by insect and \ndisease, as well as those destroyed by storm or flood, or other natural \nconditions.\n  This act will expand coverage to nursery crops and to aquaculture, \nwhich have been two of the fastest-\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\ngrowing aspects of American agriculture. It will require that the \nFederal Crop Insurance Act consider marketing windows when determining \nwhether it is feasible to require replanting during a crop year.\n  To elaborate on that, Mr. President, as you know, much of Florida \nagriculture is targeted on a winter growing season. There have been \ninstances in which a natural disaster had occurred at the end of that \nseason--let us say, in this month of March, there were requirements \nthat you had to replant, even though by replanting the crops, they \nwould mature in the middle of the summer when the window for our \nparticular agriculture had closed. This will allow the Federal crop \ninsurance administrators to consider the economic feasibility, as well \nas the agricultural feasibility of replanting a crop that has been \ndestroyed. So, Mr. President, that represents an important set of \nlessons learned from disasters and now applied to moderate the impact \nof future disasters.\n  Second, Mr. President, there is an important provision in this \nlegislation that is to avoid what would be not a disaster, but a \ncalamity of global importance, and that is the collapse of the Florida \nEverglades. The Florida Everglades represent a treasure, which happens \nto be located within the State of Florida, but has been long recognized \nas a national treasure since 1947. The second largest national park in \nthe lower 48 States is Everglades National Park. It has been recognized \nby international bodies, including the United Nations, as an ecosystem \nof international importance. It is a system that has been in very \nserious trouble. It is a system, which started thousands of years ago \nas a unique flow of water, commencing in the central part of south \nFlorida, in a slow incremental process that eventually then led to the \narea that we now call Florida Bay. It provided one of the most fertile \nareas for wildlife, plants, and fisheries in the world. It is a system \nwhich has been destroyed largely because of its uniqueness.\n  When Europeans came to this region, they looked at the Everglades, \nand what they saw was a formidable swamp. They saw something that was \ndifferent than they had known in their previous home. They committed \nthemselves to the goal of turning this unique system into something \nthat was common and pedestrian. For the better part of a century, that \neffort was pursued with great vigor, and with the support of the people \nof Florida, and of the Governments of the State and the Nation.\n  It has been in the last 30 years that we have fully appreciated the \nfact that it was that very uniqueness of the Everglades that gave it \nits essential value. Also, it was that uniqueness that contributed to \nthe many ways in which the Everglades sustained life, for humans and \nothers, in the south Florida region.\n  So a major effort to save the Everglades has been underway. It has \nbeen recognized that that effort would require a partnership, and an \nimportant member of that partnership was the Federal Government. The \nFederal Government has significant interest in the Everglades National \nPark's national wildlife refuges and national fresh water preserves.\n  The Federal Government also will play a key role in executing those \nthings that will be necessary for the salvation of the Everglades. The \npeople of Florida do not ask the Federal Government to do this \nsingularly, but they ask for a unity of purpose between the National \nGovernment and themselves.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased to recognize the tremendous \nstep forward that this legislation represents with that goal of ``save \nthe Everglades.'' In this legislation, there is contained a direct \nentitlement funding for a special Everglades restoration initiative of \n$200 million. There are also contained various provisions which will \nencourage the disposition of surplus land, with the proceeds of that \ndisposition to be used for Everglades restoration. One of those \nprovisions could provide up to an additional $100 million for \nrestoration of the Everglades.\n  I want to particularly thank Senator Lugar, who has been especially \nvocal in his recognition of the importance of the Everglades, and \nSenator Leahy, who has been a staunch advocate of a whole variety of \ninitiatives contained in this legislation that are designed to \nrecognize the fact that there is no conflict between the economics of \nAmerican agriculture and the protection of the fundamental \nenvironmental resources upon which agriculture depends.\n  I commend both of these colleagues for their outstanding \ncontributions, and there is no place in which this will be more \nsignificant or more appreciated than in the contribution toward the \nsalvation of the Everglades.\n  So I wish, Mr. President, to conclude with a joint statement with my \ncolleague, Senator Mack, elaborating on the provisions that are of \nspecial importance to our State contained in this legislation, and to \nconclude with my deep thanks on behalf of the 14 million citizens of my \nState for what leaders of this legislation have done to prepare us for \nfuture disasters and to contribute to avoidance of what would be a \ndisaster of global proportion if we were to lose the qualities of the \nFlorida Everglades.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, Senator Mack and I would like to take a \nmoment to thank Chairman Lugar and ranking member Leahy for their hard \nwork on the 1996 farm bill. We are particularly pleased with the \ninclusion of provisions that will have a direct benefit to the State of \nFlorida, our growers, and the Everglades ecosystem.\n  First of all, this farm bill will address three problems that have \nfaced Florida growers of specialty crops. Upon enactment of Federal \nAgricultural Improvement and Reform Act, the Federal Crop Insurance Act \nwill be amended to provide for coverage of crops destroyed by insects \nand disease, expand coverage to all nursery crops and aquaculture, and \nrequire the Federal Crop Insurance Act to consider marketing windows \nwhen determining whether it is feasible to require replanting during a \ncrop year.\n  Disasters are a way of life for all involved in agriculture. Disaster \nrelief appropriations are an item of the past. The laws to today need \nto cover all of agriculture to allow recovery after time of great loss. \nThe amendments which were passed go a long way to addressing \ninequalities in law and definition to allow coverage for major \nagricultural segments.\n  Multiple weather-related disasters, from Hurricane Andrew to the \nrecord number of hurricanes in 1995, clearly illustrated deficiencies \nin disaster coverage of many agricultural commodities. Many \nagricultural products such as aquatic species and numerous \nhorticultural products are not clearly defined as being eligible for \ndisaster assistance. Additionally, even though the Federal Crop \nInsurance Act was passed, many agricultural commodities still do not \nhave crop insurance available and as such can not even recoup planting \ncosts under current guidelines.\n  Changes were clearly needed to allow coverage of all agricultural \ncrops during time of disaster. A tree grown for horticultural purposes \nshould be covered whether it is grown in a port or in rows in the \nground. Nontraditional species raised for food purposes should be \nclearly covered.\n  Acquaculture-raised species--whether for food or nonfood purposes--\nshould also be covered. Foliage plants are agricultural commodities \nraised for aesthetic purposes. Tropical fish, while not for food \npurposes, are clearly raised in aquaculture for aesthetic purposes, and \nshould be covered just as surely as our foliage protection. Many States \nnow find that horticulture and foliage plants have become their No. 1 \nagricultural commodity.\n  Disasters are likewise not just weather-related events. A rapidly \nspreading pest or disease can statistically be a greater danger than a \nhurricane event.\n\n\n     definition of disaster for federal crop insurance eligibility\n\n  The history of natural disasters in Florida has demonstrated the need \nfor the definition of disaster to include events that are not directly \nweather-related. Beyond a certain level, the devastation of the gypsy \nmoth, citrus canker, or other pests and diseases constitutes a disaster \nof major scale. The 1996 farm bill will establish a pilot program to \nhave the term ``natural disaster'' include extensive crop destruction \ncaused by insects and disease.\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\n    definition of agriculture for federal crop insurance eligibility\n\n  Florida growers of specialty crops also need a definition of \nagriculture that includes more than just food, fiber and grain. \nHistorically, for disaster purposes, neither aquaculture or nursery \ncrops have been covered.\n  As recently as the December freezes, producers in the Hillsborough \nCounty area were told that aquaculture species, such as tropical fish \nand aquatic plants, were not defined as agriculture. While these \nspecies are reared for aesthetic purposes, they are certainly \nagriculture--as much as any other horticultural production.\n  In-ground plants and trees for the nursery industry were still not \ncovered even after 4 years of negotiation and discussions with Federal \nCrop Insurance officials in Kansas City. Florida growers are \nappreciative that this farm bill will expand Federal crop insurance to \naquaculture and direct the FCIC to establish a pilot program to allow \nnursery crops to participate in the Federal Crop Insurance Program.\n\n\n  include ``marketing window'' as a criteria for requiring replanting\n\n  A third problem for Florida growers of winter crops has involved the \ninterpretation of the clause requiring replanting where feasible after \ndisaster destruction. Until this farm bill, the Federal Crop Insurance \nhas not considered marketing windows when making judgments about \nclaims. Given that USDA can consider economics, potential marketing of \nthe product must be considered as an economic factor.\n  As a recent example, a potato crop in Dade County was destroyed. The \nclimate of the county would have permitted the growers to replant and \nbarely get in a crop before that weather became too hot. However, the \nmarketing window and contracts for sale of the product would have been \ntotally nonexistent by the time a long-term crop like potatoes could be \nraised. The Federal Government required the growers to replant even \nthough no sales of that commodity would have been feasible after the \narea's marketing period was over. Florida growers raise crops in the \ndead of winter, and are often double and triple cropping the same land \nwith a succession of commodities to meet very defined and limited \nmarketing windows. I am gratified that the mangers of the farm bill \nagreed to include our provision requiring the Federal Crop Insurance \nCorporation to consider marketing windows in determining whether it is \nfeasible to require replanting during a crop year.\n\n\n                      brown citrus aphid research\n\n  This farm bill also provides authorization of up to $3,000,000 in \nresearch funding for the eradication and control of the brown citrus \naphid and the citrus tristeza virus. The virus, which is carried by the \naphid, poses the most formidable threat in decades to the Florida \ncitrus industry. The citrus tristeza virus, in several forms, has the \ncapability of killing millions of citrus trees in Florida, Texas, and \nCalifornia over the next several years. The language included in this \nbill will help us provide to the citrus community of our Nation the \ntools it needs to combat this serious threat.\n\n\n                     everglades restoration funding\n\n  The 1996 Farm bill also provides an unprecedented opportunity to \nfurther the restoration of the Everglades ecosystem. I yield to Senator \nMack.\n  Mr. MACK. I and my esteemed colleague Senator Graham rise today to \ncongratulate this Congress for its foresight and commitment to one of \nthe most important restoration efforts in our Nation's history, the \nrestoration of the south Florida ecosystem, better known as the \nEverglades. Under section 506 of the 1996 farm bill, the United States \nhas made a historical commitment to this unique national treasure.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The Everglades is an extraordinary ecosystem that travels \nsouth from the Kissimmee River through the Everglades and down to \nFlorida Bay. The Everglades ecosystem supports south Florida's \nindustries of tourism, fishing, and agriculture and special quality of \nlife of over 6 million residents by providing water supply and \nrecreational activities. The Federal Government has a direct vested \ninterest in the Everglades ecosystem, which houses the Loxahatchee \nRefuge, and three national parks: Everglades National Park, Big Cypress \nNational Park and Biscayne Bay National Park.\n  Mr. MACK. The health of the Everglades ecosystem is critically \nendangered. The same American spirit of ingenuity and adventure that \nled us to the Everglades at the turn of the century must now be called \nupon to save this extraordinary resource that is so emblematic of the \nAmerican character. The Everglades has taught us that a strong economy \nand healthy environment are not mutually exclusive.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Historically, we have tried to tame the Everglades by \nfocusing on small parts of the ecosystem without regard to how the \nwhole system works. This has proved to be a mistake. As we have tried \nto develop or manage parts of the ecosystem separately, the result has \nbeen to wreak havoc on the entire ecosystem, thus putting the entire \necosystem in jeopardy. The Everglades is not a set of discreet parts \nlike the limbs of a body but instead is a blood line that circulates \nthroughout the entire ecosystem. The long term viability and \nsustainability of the ecosystem--whether it is wildlife, urban water \nsupply, agriculture, tourism, recreation activities, or fishing--are \nall dependent upon the same lifeblood, the Everglades, the River of \nGrass. Decades of diking, damming and using the Everglades for singular \npurposes has so endangered the health of the Everglades that in the \nfuture the ecosystem may not be available to be used for any purpose.\n  Mr. MACK. The State of Florida has made extraordinary efforts to \naddress the complex problems of the region and to restore this precious \nresource. Because south Florida is home to 7 of the 10 fastest-growing \nmetropolitan areas in the Nation, we are at a critical crossroad in the \nEverglades restoration. Together the State of Florida and the Federal \nGovernment can continue their developing partnership to consummate \nEverglades restoration.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. While it is understood that a significant gap exists in \nour scientific knowledge about the ultimate ecological and water \nmanagement needs of the Everglades ecosystem--which necessitates \ncontinued detail studies--the framework for restoration and design of \nmajor projects for land acquisition, water storage, and restored \nhydrology are clear. Restoration of one of the largest functioning \necosystems in the world is a massive undertaking. Congress has \nacknowledged that success will depend on the Federal Government, the \nState of Florida, and local, regional and tribal interests working in \ntandem.\n  Mr. MACK. In acknowledgement of this responsibility, Congress has \nprovided $200,000,000 and possibly as much as $300,000,000 to expedite \nEverglades restoration activities, which will include acquisition of \nthe highest priority lands needed to improve water storage and water \nquality critical to the restoration effort. This unprecedented \ncommitment of $200,000,000 will be provided to the Secretary of \nInterior to either carry out the restoration activities or to provide \nfunding to the State of Florida or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \ncarry out restoration activities. Congress does not intend for these \nfunds to supplant any previous funds committed to any agency of the \nFederal Government or the State of Florida for the purpose of \nEverglades restoration, including the commitment to fund STA 1E, a \ncomponent of the Everglades Restoration Project.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Specifically, the legislation does the following:\n  Section 506(a) directs the Secretary of the Treasury to transfer to \nthe Secretary of the Interior $200,000,000 of any funds not otherwise \nappropriated.\n  Sections 506 (b) and (d) authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nuse the $200,000,000 until December 31, 1999 to conduct restoration \nactivities in the Everglades ecosystem in South Florida. In \nimplementing these sections, the Secretary may rely upon the \npriorities, programs, projects, and initiatives identified by the \nFederal South Florida Interagency Task Force.\n  Under Section 506(b)(3), the Secretary of the Interior can conduct \nrestoration activities that include the acquisition of real property \ninterests intended to expedite resource protection.\n  Under Section 506(c) as may be appropriate, the Secretary of the \nInterior and transfer the restoration funds to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers or the State of Florida or the South Florida Water Management \nDistrict to carry out restoration activities in the Everglades \necosystem.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n  Section 506(e) requires the Secretary of the Interior to submit an \nannual report to Congress that describes what activities were carried \nout under the initiative.\n  Section 506(f) also established a special account to be funded by the \nsale of surplus Federal property in the State of Florida. The special \naccount is to be managed by the Secretary of the Interior to carry out \nrestoration activities. The Secretary of the Interior is limited in his \nability to use the special account funds to acquire real property or an \ninterest in real property. The Secretary can use these special account \nfunds for real property acquisition only if the State of Florida \ncontributes or has contributed an amount equal to not less than 50 \npercent of the appraised value of the real property interest to be \nacquired. The actual sale of surplus property is to be managed by the \nAdministrator of the General Services Administration. This account will \nnot exceed $100,000,000.\n  And finally, under section 506(g), the Secretary of the Interior is \ndirected to submit a report to Congress that assesses whether any \nunreserved and unappropriated Federal lands are suitable for disposal \nor exchange for the purpose of conducting restoration activities in the \nEverglades ecosystem. Section 506(g) is not intended to amend or \nsupersede any applicable Federal statute that governs Federal land \nmanagement, exchange or disposal.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida for his kind words. I note that he and his colleague from \nFlorida worked very, very hard with both Senator Lugar and me on this \nissue. It is one where we came together to address not only a Florida \nissue but what is truly a national issue.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Lugar, our \nconference chairman, and his staff, Senator Leahy and his staff, \nChairman Roberts and his staff, and Congressman de la Garza and his \nstaff for helping us get to this important day for American \nagriculture.\n  Policymaking decisions in agriculture have never been simple or easy. \nChairman Lugar and the ranking Democrat, Senator Leahy, chartered a \ncourse that led them toward a bipartisan bill. Farmers and ranchers \nacross the country are now awaiting the passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  For the first time in 60 years, we have a commonsense approach that \nwill release farmers from the bureaucratic controls of USDA. Under this \napproach, farmers will no longer be told what to plant, where to plant, \nor how much to grow. Uncertain deficiency payments tied to market \nprices are eliminated and replaced with preset and market transition \npayments that farmers can count on with confidence.\n  This legislation, formerly titled the Agricultural Market Transition \nAct, has been renamed the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform \n[FAIR] Act of 1996. This legislation not only reforms commodity \nprograms but also includes rural development, conservation, credit, \nresearch, trade, and nutrition.\n  Highlights of the bill include:\n  Eliminates the requirement to purchase crop insurance to participate \nin commodity programs.\n  Establishes an Environmental Quality Incentives Program.\n  Export and promotion programs are reauthorized and refocused to \nmaximize impact in a post-NAFTA/GATT environment.\n  Maintains the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  Reauthorizes nutrition programs.\n  Reauthorizes Federal agricultural research programs.\n  Provides for dairy reform. Eliminates the budget assessment on dairy \nproducers, phases down the support price on butter, powder, and cheese \nover 4 years. Consolidates marketing years.\n  Provides funding for Florida Everglades restoration.\n  Establishes fund for rural America to be used for rural development \nand research.\n  Retains the 1949 Agricultural Act as permanent law.\n  Streamlines and consolidates rural development programs to provide a \nmore focused Federal effort while encouraging decisionmaking at the \nState level.\n  When we began the process of formulating an agricultural policy about \n14 months ago, the message I got was that farmers wanted less \nGovernment, less redtape, and less paperwork. They said we need \nplanting flexibility and less regulation--to put it more simply let \nfarmers be farmers.\n   Mr. President, many commodity programs and provisions in the 1990 \nfarm bill expired on December 31, 1995. It is now late March. Spring \nplanting is already underway in many Southern States, and it is \nimperative that producers know the requirements of the commodity \nprograms. The farmers in this country already have their schedules \naltered by Mother Nature--they shouldn't have to wait for Congress too.\n  Producers who raise wheat and feed grains and other commodities want \nto know what kind of program will be in operation before they make \ntheir planting decisions and seek money for their operating loans. \nProgram announcements are usually made in early- to mid-February, and \nfarmers usually begin to sign up for the programs at the beginning of \nMarch.\n  Farmers in my State and across the country can wait no longer. We \nneed a new farm program in place--quickly. It is time to pass \nresponsible legislation that provides the agriculture sector with \npolicy for the next several years.\n  There are many other provisions that deserve to be highlighted, \nhowever I wanted to mention a few that I took an active role in trying \nto resolve. I support this package and believe it provides a safety net \nand the opportunity for the agriculture sector to meet the challenges \nthat lie ahead.\n  First, I am grateful that language concerning the regulation of \ncommercial transportation of equine to slaughter is included. Under \nthis provision the Secretary of Agriculture is provided authority to \ndevelop sound regulations that will protect the well-being of equine \nthat are commercially transported to slaughter. Often these horses are \ntransported for long periods, in overcrowded conditions and often in \nvehicles that have inadequate head room. Some of these horses are in \npoor physical condition or have serious injuries. These regulations \nwould allow horses to get to a slaughter facility safely and as quickly \nas possible with the least amount of stress to the animal. I want to \nmake it very clear this provision does not authorize the Secretary to \nregulate the transportation of horses other than to slaughter or the \ntransportation of livestock or poultry to slaughter or elsewhere.\n  Second, I also want to thank Senator Cochran for his assistance in \nconfronting what may be the most serious health crisis facing the U.S. \nequine population. I'm referring to the Department of Agriculture's \nrecent decision to grant a waiver allowing the importation of horses \ninfected with equine piroplasmosis, also known as EP, so that they may \ncompete in the Olympic games to be held in Atlanta this year. With help \nfrom Senator Cochran we have strong report language stating that the \n20-point plan that has been agreed upon by the European Union, the \nGeorgia Department of Agriculture, and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture must not be relaxed and the conditions must be followed and \nadministratively enforced.\n  Third, dairy policy has always been a contentious issue and it was no \ndifferent during this farm bill. One provision I felt must be included \nwas the continuation of the Fluid Milk Promotion Program. Building a \nstronger demand for milk is essential to the entire dairy industry. \nFluid milk sales account for about 35 percent of the total amount of \nmilk produced, which means changes in this category are significant. I \nbelieve continuation of this processor-funded program is a very good \nway to attack misperceptions and to keep people drinking milk. We need \nto continue to increase people's understanding of the benefits and \nimportance of milk and continue to show consumers new ways to keep milk \nin their diets.\n  Fourth, conservation concerns in Kentucky have centered around how to \nhelp farmers improve water quality. A new program--the Environmental \nQuality Incentive Program [EQIP] will target over $1 billion for 7 \nyears to assist crop and livestock producers with environmental and \nconservation improvements on their farms. I believe\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nthis program will be very beneficial to the farmers in Kentucky in \nproviding cost-share and technical assistance in improving water \nquality.\n  Another issue I heard loud and clear from my Kentucky farmers dealt \nwith the mandatory purchase of catastrophic crop insurance [CAT]. I \nmade this one of my top priorities, and I am happy to report that my \nfellow conferees also heard similar comments from their farmers. The \nconference agreement eliminates mandatory catastrophic crop insurance, \nbut requires producers waive all Federal disaster assistance if they \nopt not to purchase CAT insurance. This means that tobacco farmers and \ngrain producers don't have to purchase CAT crop insurance to \nparticipate in a commodity program or to get their marketing card. \nEligibility to purchase crop insurance is no longer linked to \nconservation compliance and swampbuster for producers who choose not to \nparticipate in farm programs.\n   Mr. President, today's 2 million farmers and the 19 million workers \nemployed in our food and agriculture system generate over 16 percent of \nour Nation's income. We must keep the farmer, the rancher, the food, \nand the agriculture sector healthy and growing. It is time to give our \nNation's farmers and ranchers some answers and to pass this conference \nreport today.\n  Again, I thank our committee chairman, ranking member, and staff for \ntheir dedication and hard work.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the final \npassage of the conference report on H.R. 2854, the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act of 1996. In some ways, it is only natural \nthat this farm bill occurred like one of the other major factors \naffecting agriculture, the weather. With the weather, you're never sure \nwhen the rains will come, but inevitably, it will rain. This \nlegislation brings an end to the waiting and uncertainty currently \nsurrounding farmers and ranchers in my state, as well as around the \ncountry.\n  I would like to thank Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and \nranking member Leahy for their tireless work to bring together the many \ndifferent sides and address their concerns in this farm bill. And of \ncourse, a hearty congratulations to my fellow Kansans and members of \nthe Kansas agricultural triumvirate, House Agriculture Chairman \nRoberts, Senate majority Leader Dole, and USDA Secretary Glickman.\n  As a supporter of Congressman Roberts' freedom-to-farm bill, it is \nrewarding to see its inclusion in the final legislation. For production \nagriculture, this bill represents producer flexibility, program \nsimplicity, and stability--all important priorities that will allow \nU.S. agriculture to successfully compete in the world marketplace. For \nthe taxpayer, this legislation shows the continued commitment by \nagriculture to lower spending and reduce the deficit. Clearly, if all \ngovernment programs displayed agriculture's commitment towards reduced \nspending, there would be no deficit today.\n  Many other important programs are also included in this legislation. \nA clear priority was given to conservation programs, including a strong \nConservation Reserve Program [CRP]. The CRP has proven to be a valuable \ntool to promote wildlife habitat, reduce soil erosion, and improve \nwater quality. Reauthorizing this program at its current level and \nallowing increased flexibility for the producer will allow current \nprogram benefits to be retained and increase the focus of this program \nto improve the most environmentally sensitive lands.\n  It should be noted that this farm bill is truly comprehensive \nlegislation that will affect all Americans. Included in this bill is \nimportant trade legislation that maintains our commitment to providing \nvaluable food aid to those nations in need, strengthens our ability to \nopen new markets, and encourages the development of emerging trading \npartners. Research, nutrition, rural development, and credit programs \nare all included in this bill to ensure to their future viability.\n  Mr. President, it is true that the rains will inevitably come. \nHowever, no action by Congress can remove the uncertainty of how much, \nwhen, and where it will rain; but we in Congress can and should remove \nthe uncertainty surrounding agricultural programs by passing this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                              section 147\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the chairman and I want to discuss in more \ndetail what was intended in section 147 of H.R. 2854, the section which \ngrants congressional consent to the northeast interstate dairy compact, \nsubject to certain conditions.\n  This compact will allow the six New England States to regulate the \nprice of all class I drinking milk sold in those States. The regulation \nmay apply to any class I milk sold in the New England States but \nproduced elsewhere, as well as to such milk produced by New England \nfarmers. The compact also provides that farmers from beyond New England \nreceive its benefits as well as their New England counterparts.\n  The conditions of congressional consent are intended to ensure the \ncompact operates in harmony with the Federal milk market order program, \nand in complement with the changes otherwise being imposed on that \nprogram by this act. Seven conditions of consent are identified.\n  The condition in section 147(1) requires that the Secretary of \nAgriculture make a finding of compelling public interest in the compact \nregion before the compact may be implemented. This provision ensures a \ndetermination by the Secretary of the compact's need in the region \nbefore the compact's authority to regulate interstate commerce, as \ngranted by the consent provided by this act, can become operational.\n  The next four conditions of consent outlined in section 147(2) \nthrough section 147(5) constitute substantive restrictions on the \ncompact's operation, as entered into by the States. In response to \nconcerns raised by some conferees, section 147(2) limits the compact's \nregulatory authority to only class I milk. Notwithstanding any \nprovision of the compact to the contrary, the compact commission will \nnot be able to regulate other classes of milk. This condition limits \nthe compact's regulatory reach to only the local and regional, fluid \nmilk market. It ensures that the compact will have no effect on the \nnational market for manufactured dairy products.\n  Section 147(3) constitutes a procedural limitation on the compact's \noperation. This condition establishes a finite time limit for the \nprovision of congressional consent to the compact. The section \nestablishes that congressional consent terminates concurrently with the \ncompletion of the Federal milk market order consolidation process \nrequired under section 143 of the act.\n  Also in response to concerns raised by committee conferees, \nconditions in section 147(4) alter the procedure by which additional \nStates may enter the compact. The list of potential new entrants is \nlimited to a named few. Such States may only join if contiguous to a \nmember State and only upon approval by Congress.\n  Section 147(5) requires the compact commission to compensate the \nCommodity Credit Corporation [CCC] for purchases by the Corporation \nattributable to surplus production in the New England States. This \ncondition was necessary for the compact to ensure that there would be \nno score from the Congressional Budget Office. The compact commission's \nresponsibility to make compensation is to be measured by the \nSecretary's reference to a comparison of the rate of increased \nproduction. The compact commission would have the responsibility to \nprovide compensation for those CCC purchase attributable to an increase \nin the rate of New England milk production in excess of the national \naverage rate of increase.\n  Section 147(6) provides for cooperation by the Department of \nAgriculture in the compact's operation. The Department has in the past \nconstrued findings of fact in the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act \nof 1937 as precluding the Department's cooperation in the operation of \nState over-order pricing programs. This condition makes clear these \npast departmental determinations do not apply to the compact, and that \nthe Department shall provide such technical assistance as requested by \nthe compact commission and requires that the compact commission will \nreimburse the Department for that assistance. The provision is designed \nto avoid duplication in\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\naudit procedures and any other mechanism needed to administer the \ncompact, and thereby to reduce the compact's regulatory burden and \ncost.\n  Except in one regard section 147(7) provides only language of \nclarification, rather than imposes any additional, substantive, or \nprocedural restriction on the compact's operation. This condition in \nthe main part clarifies that the commission may not limit or prohibit \nthe marketing of milk or milk products in the compact region from any \nother area in the United States. It also clarifies that the commission \nmay not alter or amend procedures established under Federal milk \nmarketing orders relating to the movement of milk between or among \norders.\n  Neither of the first two sentences of that section is intended to \nlimit the compact commission's authority to establish a compact over-\norder price regulation for all fluid milk marketed into the compact \nregion in any form, packaged or bulk, produced in another production \nregion in the United States. The last sentence of this section 147(7) \ndelineates this point.\n  The one substantive restriction of this condition is its limitation \nof the use of compensatory payments under section 10(6) of the compact. \nBecause the use of compensatory payments is disfavored in milk \nmarketing law, the compact itself placed strict restrictions upon their \nuse in section 10(6). Their use even as so restricted proved to be of \nsome concern, accordingly, the conference report further restricts \ntheir use under section 147(7).\n  Does the chairman agree that this description accurately reflects the \nviews of the conferees.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Section 334 establishes a new conservation program \ncalled the environmental quality incentives program. One of the \npurposes of the program, as stated in section 1240(2)(B), is to assist \n``farmers and ranchers in complying with this title and Federal and \nState environmental laws.'' Could the Senator explain to me how this \nmight occur?\n  Mr. LEAHY. In order to provide the opportunity for an environmental \nquality incentives plan to be designed to assure that a producer is in \ncompliance with other Federal State rules, regulations, and laws, USDA \nshould enter into agreements with the appropriate agencies to assure \nthat USDA is the only agency with routine decisionmaking authority and \noversight of development and implementation of the plan. These inter-\nagency agreements should focus on the development process of the plan, \nnot specific conservation practices or management techniques; strive \nfor maximum flexibility due to the variability of agricultural \noperations and resource conditions; provide that specific practices in \nthe plan may be implemented in varving timeframes within the duration \nof the plan; assure that implementation of the plan is not interrupted \nby frequent revisions caused by changes in agency agreements; and \nrecognize the need to encourage producers to develop plans by allowing \nreasonable implementation periods that provide for economic recovery of \ncosts. If a plan is designed to assure that a producer is in compliance \nwith other Federal or State rules, regulations, and laws, the producer \nmay request plan revisions when necessary to accommodate any \nsignificant operational changes or unforeseen technical problems within \nthe farming or ranching enterprise.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield, from the time of the distinguished \nDemocrat leader, Senator Daschle, to the Senator from Wisconsin such \ntime as he may need to speak in opposition to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, we have heard many good things about this farm bill \nand the promises of market orientation and positive reform that it \nbrings to farm policy, but I believe a more critical examination of \nthis bill demonstrates something entirely different, and so I want to \nrefute some of the assertions that have been put forth during this \ndebate.\n  I think every Member of the Senate would agree that agricultural \npolicy needs reform. The realities of production, markets and budgets \nchange rapidly, and therefore what is demanded is a periodic revamping \nof agricultural policy. I agree that we need greater market orientation \nin farm policy, and I agree that we need less Government intervention \ninto the production decisions of farmers. However, we also need a farm \npolicy that is defensible to all citizens of our country, and I believe \nthat this bill will ultimately fall short in this very important \nregard.\n  The structure of current farm programs is basically to provide a \nsafety net, making supplemental payments to farmers only when prices \nare low, and freeing farmers to make their money from the market when \nprices are sufficiently high, as they are currently.\n  In contrast, this bill offers farmers a so-called guaranteed payment \nevery year for the next 7 years, based entirely on their past \nproduction, regardless of market prices. If market prices are high, as \nthey are today, farmers will receive the same payments as they would in \ntimes of low prices. In fact, farmers will not even be required to \nplant a crop in order to get the Government payment. I have a very hard \ntime defending this as a wise expenditure of Federal dollars.\n  Another assertion about this bill that I challenge is the idea that \nthe goal of simplification and flexibility in farm programs requires \nguaranteed payments to farmers, even if they do not plant a crop. We \nall agree that farmers should have greater planting flexibility and \nthat the Federal Government should get out of the business of dictating \nplanting decisions to farmers. But again, farm programs must be \ndefensible to all citizens of our country, not just those few in a \nposition to reap short-term windfall profits from the Government.\n  Another assumption that the casual observer of this farm bill debate \nmight be tempted to make after listening to the debate is that this \nbill cuts the cost of farm programs. Yet, a quick analysis of the cost \nprojections for this bill indicates that in the first 2 years of this \nbill the taxpayer will be required to pay an additional estimated $4 \nbillion for farm programs over what they would pay under the current \nprogram. Why? Because the taxpayer will be required to make large cash \npayments to farmers in times of expected high market prices, as opposed \nto making payments to farmers only in those years when prices are low.\n  While these are a few of my concerns about the overall structure of \nthe bill, as a Senator from Wisconsin, my overriding concerns are with \nthe dairy provisions of this bill. And in that regard I believe that \nthis bill offers a very mixed and a dangerous message.\n  On the one hand, I am hopeful that the milk marketing order reform \nprovisions of the final farm bill will give the USDA the tools that are \nnecessary to bring about greater regional equity in milk pricing \npolicies and to make the milk marketing order system more reflective of \ntoday's markets.\n  The bill instructs the Secretary of Agriculture to consolidate and \nreform orders within 3 years, and essentially instructs him to do so \nwithout consideration to the existing price system established by the \n1985 farm bill. I think this is a positive change, and I am very \nhopeful it will bring about a marketing system that is more defensible \nin today's economy and more equitable to all the dairy farmers of our \ncountry.\n  However, I am stunned by the inclusion of another provision of this \nbill, which I believe goes in the complete opposite direction of market \norientation, and that is the northeast interstate dairy compact. While \nthe bill does not approve the compact, it does explicitly give the \nSecretary of Agriculture the authority to do so on a temporary basis if \nthe Secretary determines that there is a compelling public interest in \nthe area.\n  My colleagues will recall that during the Senate consideration of the \nfarm bill, we voted to strike the northeast dairy compact from the \nbill. In doing so, the majority of the Senate demonstrated their \ndisagreement with efforts to establish what amounts to regional dairy \ncartels, and on the House side the northeast dairy compact never was \nincluded.\n  So it is very hard for me to understand how a dangerous provision \nlike this can appear in a conference report when it has been clearly \nrejected by both Houses of Congress. In my mind, Mr. President, that is \nback-room dealing at its worst.\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n  It is true that some provisions have been added to the compact to try \nto blunt its negative effects. Other safeguards that had been agreed to \nin previous debates were deleted. But my overriding concern about the \nnortheast dairy compact is now and always has been one of dangerous \nprecedent.\n  Since my first day in the Senate, I have fought to make Federal dairy \npolicy more equitable to the dairy farmers of the Upper Midwest. Most \nagricultural economists, and now even the Secretary of Agriculture, \nagree that the current milk pricing policies have had a \ndisproportionately negative effect on the farmers of my region, and I \nam hopeful that the milk market order reform provisions of this bill \nwill help reverse that injustice. But I fear that even the most \nequitable milk market order reforms will be meaningless in the long run \nif we start allowing regions to segregate themselves from the rest of \nthe country economically through efforts like the Northeast Dairy \nCompact.\n\n  Our country and its Constitution are built on the concept of a \nunitary market without barriers. While I appreciate the efforts that \nhave been made to water down the ill effects of the compact, I strongly \nbelieve that the long-term ramifications of this compact on a State \nlike Wisconsin, which depends so heavily on national markets, are \nominous.\n  A New York Times editorial this past weekend stated the following \nabout the Northeast Dairy Compact:\n\n       A House-Senate conference committee has managed to tarnish \n     the most important farm bill in years by inserting a last-\n     minute provision for a New England milk cartel that would \n     gouge consumers and violate the free market concept that has \n     made the 1996 farm bill worthwhile. The regional milk \n     monopoly is the very opposite of the kind of reform this bill \n     was meant to provide.\n\n  It will now be up to those who support true market-oriented dairy \npricing reform to make that case to the Secretary of Agriculture and to \nassure this regional compact does not come into effect.\n  Lastly, while this farm bill eliminates the 10 cent per hundredweight \nbudget assessment that all dairy farmers hate, its net effect on dairy \nfarm income will be negative. In fact, I know of no other farmers that \nare asked to give up their price safety net as dairy farmers are \nthrough the elimination of the Milk Price Support Program without \nproviding some sort of direct transition payment to soften the blow. \nWhile I question the wisdom of the overall structure of this bill, it \nwould seem only logical to apply that structure equitably across \ncommodities, and this bill does not do that with respect to the dairy \nfarmer. So I will cast my vote against this farm bill.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LUGAR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania [Mr. Santorum].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation, and I do so \nenthusiastically, although I must say I do have some reservations about \na few of the titles which I will talk about later.\n  Overall, this bill does move in the right direction. It moves toward \nfreedom to farm, which I think is absolutely important for agriculture \nin America, to be not only profitable for the farmer but to be able to \nproduce goods that can be sold all over the world.\n  I am very proud of the conservation title in this legislation. I \nthink the dairy title takes a step in the right direction. Dairy, as \nhas been said by various people on the floor, is probably the toughest \narea to reform, but we have taken steps in the right direction. It is \ngoing to take a little bit longer to get the kind of reforms in dairy \nthat are necessary to be more free market oriented, but I think we have \nmoved substantially in the right direction, and I support this bill.\n  I have some problems with respect to sugar and peanuts, but they will \nnot keep me from voting in favor of this legislation and to commend \nboth Chairman Lugar and Senator Leahy, the ranking member, for a job \nwell done in putting this agreement together under fairly serious time \nconstraints as we approach the planting season.\n  Let me first focus on the conservation title because this Congress \nhas been excoriated by many in the national media for being an anti- \nenvironmental Congress. I suggest this farm bill is the most \nproenvironmental farm bill ever passed. It makes some terrific reforms \nby focusing on incentive-based programs, where we encourage farmers to \nbe good stewards of the land. Farmers are good stewards of the land, by \nand large. We should have programs to complement their natural \ntendency, which is to take good care of the land that they need to grow \ntheir crops or to raise their cattle or sheep or whatever the case may \nbe.\n\n  This is a very important step in the right direction. We should \ncommend the leaders here, and the Congress, for putting this bill \nforward in an area, as I said before, where we are being criticized for \nnot being sensitive to the environment. We have established new \nprograms, incentive-based programs, that I believe will have a \ntremendously positive effect on the environment in rural America.\n  As a sponsor of the Environmental Quality Incentive Program that \nSenators Lugar and Leahy introduced and incorporated into this bill, I \nam particularly encouraged by the cost-shared assistance that will be \navailable for livestock and crop farmers.\n  Senator Lugar mentioned the Farms for the Future Program earlier. \nThis is an amendment I offered on the floor of the Senate to provide \n$35 million for farmland preservation. It is an incredibly successful \nprogram in Pennsylvania. In fact, we have an overwhelming demand for \nthis program in Pennsylvania that we simply cannot meet. This is an \nattempt to have the Federal Government help out to preserve high-\nquality farmland that happens to be located in an area near an urban \narea that is under very intense pressure for development. What we are \nseeing happen, obviously, as the urban sprawl continues to move out \ninto the rural area, we are losing very valuable farmland. In fact, in \nmany of my counties, particularly in southeastern Pennsylvania, we are \nseeing the whole farm economy destroyed because of the pressure of \ndevelopment. I know it is not just happening in Pennsylvania. It is \nhappening across the country. Farmland preservation is a way to \nrecognize that the farm economies in these areas where we have such \nhigh quality farmlands and we have a good agriculture base are worth \npreserving and protecting. This is a way to do it. So I am very excited \nabout this aspect of the conservation title.\n  Finally, the whole freedom to farm concept is important with respect \nto the environment. Instead of dictating our farm policy from \nWashington, we are now giving flexibility to farmers. So they are not \ngoing to plant the same crop on the same ground, year after year. This \npractice requires increased uses of pesticides and fertilizers, because \nyou are draining the ground of nutrients every year because you are \nplanting the same crops. Now, you will see different crops planted and \na reduction in the use of pesticides and herbicides. That is a very \nimportant, environmentally positive aspect to the freedom to farm \napproach.\n  So, there are a lot of things in this farm bill we should be very \nexcited about from that perspective. I want to congratulate, again, the \nAgriculture Committee and the conferees, for keeping these programs \nstrong and crafting a good title.\n  Let me now move to an area I am concerned about and that, obviously, \nis sugar and peanuts. But one other thing before that. I am \ndisappointed we were not able to eliminate permanent law. Permanent law \nis from 1949. It is a law that is obviously not in use. It is \nsuperseded every few years when we do a farm bill, as we will this \ntime. We will suspend permanent law, but it is still on the books. We \nsay, ``What does it matter if it does not come into effect? Why is it \nso important that you want to get rid of this?''\n  Permanent law is really the hammer held over our heads, that if we do \nnot pass a farm bill, if we do not keep these farm programs going and \nwe do not repeal permanent law, we kick back to this permanent law \nwhich means we have outrageously-priced commodities. This is, really, \none of the reasons I believe we continue to pass farm bills and we \ncontinue to have an interfering Government hand in agriculture.\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n  If we got rid of permanent law, then the farm bill would have to be \npassed based on its merits as a bill, not because there is a hammer out \nthere that would throw the economy into disruption if we did not pass a \nfarm bill. So, retaining the permanent law hammer gives me a little bit \nof trepidation that, when this farm bill comes up again for \nreauthorization, the transition to more free markets could be hampered \nbecause of that hammer. So I am disappointed in that. But, again, it is \nanother fight for another day.\n  Finally, on the sugar and peanuts--I could talk at length about both, \nbut I am going to focus my attention on what I see is the more \negregious of the two programs and that is the peanut program. I stood \non the floor right at this spot and offered an amendment on peanuts, \nwhich was a gradual phase-down of support price. The opponents of that \namendment got up here and demanded--they said, ``Look, you guys do not \nunderstand. We have real reform in here.'' They just said, ``This is \nsubstantially reformed in the original bill. You do not have to go this \nfar. This is outrageous reform, the Senator from Pennsylvania is \ntalking about. This is just too severe. We have real reform in this \nunderlying bill. As a result, you can be for reform of the peanut \nprogram and not vote for the amendment of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.''\n  Well, as I knew at the time and as I said at the time, I said: Yes, \nthere are some reforms in here. They are not substantial. It is \nlipstick on a pig. But, yes, you can argue there are reforms here. But \nyou know what is going to happen. These folks, who are advocates of \nthis program, they are going to get in conference and they are going to \ngut all the reforms and they will come back and it is business as \nusual.\n  Surprise, what happened? They get to conference and almost all the \nminimal reforms that occurred in the original bill are gone. They are \ngutted. There is almost no reform in this bill anymore with respect to \nthe peanut program in particular. That is fine. I should have known \nbetter. In a sense, I did know better. But I will state right here, \nthat this program, while it is only reauthorized every few years--5, 7, \nwhatever years it is--may be only reauthorized that often, but we are \ngoing to have another vote on the peanut program this year, maybe more \nthan one vote. We are going to do it on appropriation bills. We may do \nit on who knows what other bills. We are not going to continue to \nsandbag reform on peanuts and then go to conference and gut it and have \nit included in the big bill where you cannot get to it anymore.\n  This battle is not over. There will not be any argument anymore from \nthe other side that we actually reformed it because you did not reform \nit. Now we are going to talk about the merits of this program, as to \nwhether it should go forward. Let me talk about the merits of this \nprogram. Yes, we cut the support price of peanuts from $678 a ton down \nto $610 a ton for quota peanuts.\n  By the way, the world price for peanuts is $350 a ton, but we are now \nat the tough, mean-spirited rate of $610 a ton, if you are on quota. We \nhave two classes of citizens in peanuts, who grow peanuts. We have \npeople who are lucky enough that their granddaddy was able to get a \nquota or license from the Government to grow them, and you get $610 a \nton. If your granddaddy was not around when they were giving out the \nquotas, you only get, if you sell them on the additional market to the \nGovernment, $132 a ton.\n  It is the same quality peanuts, maybe grown by the same farmer, some \nare quota some are additional. But you get $132 versus $610. OK? The \nworld market is $350.\n  So we have two classes of people out here. You say, ``Well, yeah, you \nreduce the price.'' ``Well, yes, we reduce the price. Guess what? We \nnow have made this a no-cost program.'' That is the way they sort of \ngot around it.\n  No, it is not reform. It is not going to cost money anymore. How do \nthey do that? Every year the Secretary of Agriculture estimates what \nthe consumption of peanuts will be in this country and sets the quota. \nLet us say it is 1.2 million tons of peanuts, and he sets the quota.\n  The Secretary cannot allow the Government to be a big buyer of \npeanuts, and the reason is because we cannot get stuck with a lot of \nexpensive peanuts and not be able to sell them.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. So the problem is, he will have to go out and short the \nmarket; in other words, he will have to have a lower quota than they \nactually expect so they do not end up buying a bunch of peanuts and \nbeing stuck with the cost.\n  We had two provisions in there that actually penalized farmers 5 \npercent every time they sold their peanuts to the Government when they \nhad a price equal to the quota price available on the market. Well, \nthey gutted that provision. They gutted that provision completely.\n  How do they do it? First, they said the farmer has to put up his \nentire crop. What do you mean ``entire''? You put up 99 percent of your \ncrop and you sell 1 percent on the open market, and you avoid all \npenalties. That is No. 1. There is a big loophole here, No. 1.\n  No. 2, it says that you have to sell your entire crop to the \nGovernment for 2 consecutive years, and then you get penalized. One \nyear one producer sells it all to the Government, the next year another \none does, and you play games with producers so nobody gets caught. That \nis another big loophole in this.\n  I can go on with a whole variety of other gutting amendments that \noccurred in conference. But the fact of the matter is this program is \nnot reformed in this bill. We are going to have plenty of opportunities \non the floor of the Senate over the next 6 months to reform it, and I \nam looking forward to that debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Ten to twelve minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Alabama. My time is \ndwindling, so I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a few moments on the \nfarm bill conference report that is before the Senate. Last year, when \nthe farm bill process began, farmers came to me representing all types \nof commodities enthusiastically supporting the continuation of the \npresent programs which provided a safety net for farmers in times of \ndisaster or low market prices. They told me the programs were working \nwell, and, particularly in the South, these programs had worked \nexceptionally and extremely well, specifically in regard to cotton.\n  However, there was substantial Republican opposition to the \ncontinuation of such programs, even within budgetary limits. Therefore, \nthe Republicans pushed the Agricultural Market Transition Act of 1996, \nformerly known as the freedom to farm bill, in which the farm program \npayments were decoupled and all Government programs would ultimately be \nphased out at the end of 7 years.\n  In order to gain producers' support for a farm program phaseout, the \nRepublicans advocated fixed, but declining, payments regardless of \nmarket prices. The program that they advocated guaranteed payments to \nfarmers whether they needed them or not. This program, in my opinion, \nconstituted a welfare program.\n  In regard to cotton, it is understood that if you can produce cotton \nand get a price close to the target price, which is 72.9 cents a pound, \nyou can make a living. The target price was based on the idea of taking \nthe cost of production and the minimum amount necessary to have a \nreturn on equity comparable to what business groups endeavor to try to \nhave as a return on equity, on a conservative basis.\n  But we find that under this program, this freedom to farm act, that \nif cotton went up to 85 cents a pound, which would be a bonanza year \nfor profits and for prices, nevertheless under this, you would get a \nGovernment payment, a mailbox payment. If cotton went, as it did last \nyear, to $1.06 a pound, you would, nevertheless, under the Republican \nproposal, get a Government subsidy. There is no point in paying money \nto people who do not need it, and that would be what would have \nhappened last year under this particular program. Support for farmers\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nshould be available during times of low market prices or uncontrollable \nnatural disasters. Payments should not be made to farmers when \ncommodity prices are as high as they currently are.\n  I oppose such an approach, feeling that this program could not \nsurvive close public scrutiny and is simply not good policy.\n  However, in the Senate, there was extended debate, there were cloture \nmotions filed, and it appeared that cloture would not be obtained at \none point, so compromises were worked out. Senator Leahy took a lead in \ntrying to work out a compromise, and I commend him for the end result. \nI do not like all the compromises, but at least with the circumstances \nwith which we were faced, we did achieve a bill.\n  One aspect of the compromise was reinstating permanent law. Permanent \nlaw will ensure that Congress in the future must address farm programs \nand not simply allow them to expire.\n  The addition of permanent law as a part of the now called Federal \nAgricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 is a vital element for \nassuring that the Federal Government will refocus its attention on \nagricultural policy and ensure that we maintain a partnership with \nrural America and not abandon our agriculture producers at the end of 7 \nyears.\n  The Senate compromise also reauthorized conservation programs, \nincluding the Conservation Reserve Program [CRP] and permitted new CRP \nenrollments. The conservation title of the farm bill demonstrated a \nvery strong commitment to the environment.\n  In addition, the very important nutrition programs were also \nreauthorized.\n  Discretionary agricultural programs, such as research, trade, rural \ndevelopment and credit were also rolled into the final bill.\n  The conference report before us today contains much of the Senate \nbill, and even some improvements were achieved in conference, including \nimprovements in the peanut program. However, to me, this bill contains \nabout an equal amount of good and bad, and this is so even after the \ncompromise changes were included in the conference report.\n  If I had to weigh the good and the bad on a scale, they would come \nout about equal. But we are faced today with the fact that the planting \nseason is upon us. A day has not passed in which I do not hear from \nfarmers anxious for some direction from Congress regarding farm \nprograms. Time is of the essence. The planting season is upon us, and \nthat is an element that we must consider.\n  Nevertheless, I cannot overlook my strong concerns regarding the \noutyears when it is predicted that commodity prices will fall and the \nfarmers will need an adequate and certain safety net.\n  The agricultural policy in China, for all practical purposes, is \ntoday controlling cotton prices in America, among others. They have \nvast billions of citizens to feed, and whatever policy they may \nestablish concerning agriculture, it certainly affects the commodity \nprices in America today. If Chinese agricultural policy changes \nimmediately, or in the next couple of years, then we will again \nexperience commodity price fluctuations and the safety net provided in \nthe bill before the Senate does not provide an adequate safety net to \ndeal with this potential problem, and this concerns me deeply.\n  But at the same time, we also are faced with another situation. In my \nState of Alabama and in the Southeast, and in other sections of the \ncountry, last year saw disastrous conditions that affected the \nproduction of farm commodities. In the cotton belt, we had to deal with \nthe boll weevil, the tobacco budworm, and the beet armyworm. Alabama \nalso experienced a terrible drought, and then had to deal with two \nhurricanes unfortunately at harvest time. Alabama, along with other \nregions of the country, each had their share of uncontrollable factors \nto deal with this last season. Unfortunately, catastrophic crop \ninsurance proved to be inadequate and many farmers struggled to make \nback their cost of production, and many did not. We tried to pass some \nlimited degree of disaster assistance for cotton farmers during \nagriculture appropriations, but this effort was unsuccessful. So we are \nlooking at a situation today where the first payment under the, as I \ncall it the freedom to farm act, would act as a disaster payment to \nfarmers for the disastrous situations experienced last year.\n  Therefore, while I believe this bill to be flawed in some areas, I \nhave decided to vote for the conference report. I base this decision on \nweighing the good and the bad, and I believe it to be about equal. The \nfact that it is late in the day and this bill does provide some \nimmediate assistance to farmers, I will, with reservation, vote for \nthis conference report. I have hopes in the future that we will come \nback and take a responsible look at the policy, a year from now or 2 \nyears from now, and look again at the overall policy pertaining farm \nprograms.\n  I would like to commend Senator Leahy for his work in this regard.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield another minute for that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. I think he did a great job and he reestablished a great \ndeal of Democratic principles into the policy that we have, \nparticularly research and conservation and environmental as well as \nothers in regard to it.\n  I would briefly like to mention the peanut program. In my judgment \nthe peanut program reform went far too far. According to studies that \nwere made by Auburn University, the final version of the peanut program \nbeing voted on today will result in a 28-percent loss of income to the \npeanut farmer. While other commodity producers are receiving transition \npayments, the peanut producer is seeing nearly a one-third reduction in \nhis income. In my judgment, the degree to which the program was \nreformed was unnecessary and punitive.\n  Mr. President, as I am looking at this farm bill, this will be the \nlast farm bill that I will participate in, since I am retiring at the \nend of the year. I have long been a supporter of the American farmer. \nMy commitment to agricultural producers has been constant throughout my \ncareer. I am concerned that the bill before us today does not provide \nthe kind of safety net that I would prefer to see and leave as a legacy \nfor future generations of farmers. I hope that in the future, Congress \nwill not turn its back on American farmers in the event that commodity \nprices fall and farmers are left without any price protection.\n  I ask the Senator if I could have a couple more minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield another minute to the Senator.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Basically, I think that the farm bill ought to have \nbalance. Take for example feed grains. Feed grains are important to the \nproducers, and the structure of their program is important to them. But \nso on the other hand are the users of feed grains, such as the \nproducers of cattle, hogs, and catfish. It is so necessary to have a \nbalance. So I hope that as we look to the future and look again in \nregard to these matters, that we will attempt to achieve a balance \nbetween producers and users of agriculture commodities.\n  I would like to recognize Senator Lugar for his work on this farm \nbill. Senator Lugar has been a good chairman. I disagreed with him on \nmany aspects of the bill and of the overall policy but he was certainly \na gentleman throughout; he made certain that everybody had an \nopportunity to be heard. I think that he wants to achieve a balance in \nregard to farm policy and hopefully this will be addressed in the \nfuture.\n  So, as we look forward toward the future, we hope we can have a farm \npolicy that has balance. At some time in the future I will deliver a \nspeech to the Senate relative to balance--balance relative to trade, \nbalance in regard to agriculture policy. But today, Mr. President, I \nwill vote for the conference report.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are going back and forth. I see a Member \non the other side of the aisle. But I note, if I might, the \ndistinguished chairman. I do intend to make a statement later in praise \nof both Senator Heflin and Senator Pryor, two of our most distinguished \nMembers, who are leaving the committee at the end of this year.\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Senator Grassley is prepared to wait for \nSenator Kerrey's speech. Senator Kerrey has been on the floor. I will \nask recognition for him to speak following Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I am not seeking recognition to speak, but \nmerely to ask the question, is there a possibility that we could seek, \nonce the speakers coming up are through--I have been here for a good \nwhile this morning. In fact, I have enjoyed being over here this \nmorning listening to some of this debate. But I see some of my \ncolleagues, Senator Kerrey, Senator Bryan. I would be glad to follow \nthem, if I just knew some order.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wonder on our side, as we go back and forth on the \nDemocrat side, I wonder if my colleagues would be willing to have it be \nthe sequence of Senator Kerrey, Senator Bryan, Senator Pryor. Is that \nwhat the Senator is suggesting?\n  Mr. PRYOR. I would be glad to follow my colleague, Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might, the distinguished Senator from Arkansas has \nbeen here longer than I.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why not Senator Kerrey, Senator Pryor, Senator Bryan, as \nwe take our turns. That is assuming there will be a chorus between each \nDemocrat of a Republican seeking recognition.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Chair would permit, following Senator Kerrey, \nSenator Grassley would be the Republican speaker, to be followed then \nby the two Democratic speakers, and then any Republican that comes on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the chairman\n  Mr. PRYOR. So I will not surprise either of the splendid managers of \nthis piece of legislation, I am going to vote against this bill. But \nthere is one section I find very appealing in this legislation. I want \nto talk about that section just for a while, 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Those in opposition will have time yielded by the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, and we will take that at that \nappropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has 84 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the Senator from Nebraska speaking in opposition?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes. I ask for 10 minutes, to be charged against the \nDemocratic leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first let me praise the conferees. Given \nthe acrimony surrounding the debate, and given the lateness of the \nhour, it is entirely possible for conferees to look and produce \nnothing, or to produce a bill which the President would have had to \nveto. I appreciate very much--I know a great deal of movement had to \noccur in order to resolve many of the conflicts. I applaud them for \nhaving produced a piece of legislation that the President has indicated \nthat he will sign and that he would like to revisit next year.\n  Mr. President, I would like to go through some of the things I see \nare good in this bill. I do intend to vote against it, but there are a \nnumber of things that are quite good.\n  First, in the area of conservation, one of the great success stories \nof farm programs over the past 60 years has been the tremendous \nimprovement in conservation of soil and of water that has occurred on \nthe private property in this country. Very often one of the political \nlines is used when describing the farm program as ``What a failure it \nhas been.'' But one need only look at the snapshot of what this country \nlooked like in the 1930's versus what it looks like in the 1990's. \nIndeed, you can go back to the 1980's and see considerable progress \njust in the last 10 years. It has been a great, often untold story, \nthis success story in this country.\n  This bill authorizes the CRP at 36.4 million acres through 2002. All \nconservation programs are going to become more responsive to State and \nlocal needs since the technical committees that control will be \nrequired to include agriculture producers as well as nongovernmental \norganizations, giving them an expanded role.\n  This is no small item, Mr. President. It empowers people at the State \nlevel to come up with plans for the CRP that dovetails with their plans \nfor conservation, their plans for tourism, their plans for water \nquality. We have tried that at the State level in Nebraska, and I can \nalert colleagues that groups that typically opposed one another have \nbeen able to reach agreement as a consequence of being given the power \nand control over making these kinds of decisions.\n  There is simplified conservation planning in this legislation for \nfarmers through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program and the \nConservation Farm Options. It is a tremendous improvement. I applaud \nthe conferees for including it.\n  It provides for pilot wetlands mitigation projects to give farmers \nflexibility in managing their frequently cropped wetlands that have \nbeen badly degraded.\n  It makes many improvements to the law dealing with good-faith \nviolations of conservation requirements and granting of variances from \nconservation requirements, stemming from ``abandonment'' of farmed \nwetlands and in defining ``agricultural land'' so the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture will be the agency responsible for delineating wetlands \non pasture, rangelands and tree farms.\n  Next, the Resource Conservation and Development Program, which has \nalso been very successful in my State, is reauthorized through the year \n2002. The next big thing I identify is something quite good, spoken at \nlength by many other people, but we have retained permanent authority \nfor farm programs. Thus, we are not phasing out the farm program, not \nonly at the end of 7 years, but the door is open if this program turns \nout not to be successful, for us to revisit and perhaps change the law.\n  Third, it increases planting flexibility, though we take a step \nbackward from the 1990 farm bill in planting flexibility for farmers \nwho want to plant fruits and vegetables. I am pleased the conferees \nadopted a provision I requested regarding alfalfa and other forages. \nFor the first time, farmers and ranchers will not be penalized for \nharvesting alfalfa and other forages on their base or contract \nagencies. This will help farmers meet their conservation compliance \nrequirements and may result in more conserving-use species being grown \non environmentally sensitive land.\n  I point out there was an alternative, called the Farm Security Act, \nproviding tremendous flexibility and simplicity by reverting to the \nnormal crop acreage system, what we, on the Democratic side, proposed \nand tried to get supported. It would have retained a market orientation \nbut would have provided tremendous new simplicity and flexibility for \nthe farmer.\n  In addition, the rural development programs are improved. The \ncreation of the Rural Community Advancement Program will give States \nmore flexibility to address their individual needs, and the Fund for \nRural America will provide additional resources for addressing needs in \nboth rural development and in research.\n  Next, on the negative side, now moving from the good to the bad, \ndepending on your point of view, my point of view is that it is very \nbad to create a fixed payment system that is, in essence, ignorant of \nthe market, ignorant of the farmer's revenue, and ignorant of whether \nthe farmers even plant a crop. This decoupled program of so-called \nguaranteed payments is far from being market oriented. It is market \nignorant. American taxpayers would not stand for our Government giving \nAFDC payments to a family making $100,000 a year, any more than they \nwill stand for our Government giving producers a freedom-to-farm \npayment--up to $230,000, in fact--when that farmer has received record-\nbreaking profits or when he decides not to plant at all.\n  Next, it overpays farmers when revenue is high but leaves farmers \nwithout adequate protection during bad years when they need Federal \nsupport the most. Worse, the loan rate is capped for the 1995 levels. \nIt can go down, but it can never go up. In a time when farm prices have \nincreased and are projected to remain high for several years, these cap \nloan rates quickly become as outdated as the crop basis of previous \nfarm bills.\n  Wheat and feed grain farmers, the individual producers themselves, \ncame and said, ``If you take these caps off, we will pay for it by \ntaking reduced guaranteed payments,'' but the majority party refused to \nmake this commonsense change.\n  In 1996, the farm program was expected to cost very little. To be \nclear\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\non this, in 1985 the farm program cost $26 billion; last year, $10 \nbillion. This year was going to cost $6 billion; next year it is \nforecasted to be $3 billion as a consequence of prices being high. \nFarmers are getting a decent income from the market, and the taxpayers \nare benefiting from the greatly reduced cost of the farm bill.\n  As much as I dislike many of the aspects of the 1990 farm bill, it is \nundeniable, from a taxpayer's perspective, that the 1990 farm bill was \nworking. Our deficit will actually increase by $4.5 billion by the end \nof 1997 as a result of this bill.\n  Yesterday, we heard the Secretary of Agriculture come before the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee and present the President's \nbudget for 1997 to Congress, and he had to say, ``We did not know what \nthe farm bill would be, so we could not include the farm bill \nconsideration.'' But his budget, assuming spending needs would be the \nsame as they have been under the 1990 farm bill, shows that there is a \n$3 billion increase in the mandatory side of the farm program payments.\n  So, please understand for those who will vote for this thing and \nissue the press release talking about how it will be cheaper in the \nfirst year, and the budget that we will debating this year, the budget \nwill actually increase on the mandatory side by $3 billion. Increasing \nmandatory spending by $3 billion in 1997 can mean one of only two \nthings, Mr. President: Either the deficit will increase, or \ndiscretionary spending will have to decrease.\n  In the President's 1997 budget, budgetary authority for discretionary \nspending amounts to $13 billion. Budget authority for mandatory \nspending is $59 billion, including the nutrition programs. That $13 \nbillion is a $200 million increase over last year. With inflation \nrunning about 2\\1/2\\ percent, that is an actual cut, Mr. President. \nWith this $3 billion increase in the mandated side, unless we bust the \nbudget or find an offset someplace else, we will have to take the \ndiscretionary programs down even further than is being recommended by \nthe President.\n  Next, Mr. President, our Nation's neediest people are shortchanged by \nthis bill, since the Food Stamp Program is reauthorized for only 2 \nyears. Only 2 years' authorization of food stamps, while farmers are \nsupposedly guaranteed payments up to $230,000 for 7 years.\n  Research is shortchanged as well, Mr. President, with programs being \nauthorized only through 1997. This is a result of the House insistence \nthat we should force ourselves to craft a new bill dealing with \nresearch within that time period. I agree our research program should \nbe reexamined and updated. However, if the past 14 months is any \nindication of how quickly the House and Senate Agriculture Committees \nand Congress as a whole will act to reauthorize agriculture-related \nprograms, the majority's insistence of only a 21-month authorization \nfor research is not a very good idea.\n  Less planting flexibility for farmers who grow fruits and vegetables \nis the next objection I have, Mr. President. Potatoes, in particular, \nis a crop grown increasingly in my State, and not only grown but also \nprocessed. So it is an important source of jobs. Under the 1990 farm \nbill, the current law, any farmer could plant potatoes as long as that \nfarmer agreed to give up any Federal subsidy on the acres that were \nplanted to potatoes. That is fair policy.\n  Unfortunately, I was unable to persuade the majority that we should \nadopt the same policy of planting flexibility for potato growers under \nthis bill. Instead, the conferees adopted a provision that will create \nan allocation system, a quota, Mr. President, for farmers who want to \nplant potatoes or other fruits and vegetables on contract areas. \nInstead of allowing any farmer to plant potatoes, if the farmer agrees \nto forego his Federal subsidy it limits potato production on contract \nacres to three situations: First, a region with a history of double \nplanting; next, a planting history that includes potatoes; and farmers \nthat can prove to the U.S. Government, the USDA, they have grown \npotatoes in the past, but that farmer is limited to planting no more \nthan his average production of potatoes in the 1991-95 period.\n  So in conclusion, we are saying freedom to farm, more flexibility, \nbut you are not able to do what you are allowed under the old farm \nbill, which is, if you want to plant an alternative crop you are \nallowed to take a decreased payment off your normal base. I object to \nthis arbitrary planting restriction, particularly since farmers of each \nof the three situations must also give up their guaranteed payment.\n  Mr. President, the last time the Congress failed to enact a farm bill \nduring the year it was due was in 1947. I point out, in 1990, when this \nbill was being debated, when the current law was being debated, in July \n1990, there was a great debate over an amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Bentsen. What he said was, we are going to \nauthorize the Secretary--any section of this farm bill is extended \nduring that 5-year period to reauthorize the rest of the farm bill. \nWhy? Because the Republicans at this time were quite concerned--there \nwas a colloquy between the distinguished Senator from Indiana and the \nSenator from Kansas saying, we have to do this because July is too \nlate.\n  We waited far too long, Mr. President, this time around. 1947 was the \nlast year when this happened. That year there was a Democrat in the \nWhite House and Republicans controlled the House and the Senate. In my \njudgment, we are going to have to do the same thing that the voters did \nin 1948 to break the current logjam we have on the farm bill and the \nappropriations bill if the American people's will is not going to \ncontinue to be frustrated.\n  However, the conference committee--as I said at the beginning, I must \nrevert to praise--the conference committee does a terrific job. They \ncould have ended the day and passed nothing. They were up against a \ntime line--self-imposed, in my judgment--as a result of not getting the \nwork done. That having been said, it would have been very easy for them \nto have passed something the President could not have signed.\n  I hope that the political changes in 1996 present us with an \nopportunity to revisit this bill on behalf of farmers who need income, \non behalf of people in communities who depend upon that income for \njobs, on behalf of the taxpayers who are going to pay for it, and, most \nimportant, on behalf of the American consumer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Congress and the Senate takes up today \nthe passage of legislation regarding the farming community and is \npresenting legislation as a basis for a safety net for the agriculture \nof the next century. The programs of this century are outdated for the \nagriculture of the next century.\n  Now, Mr. President, the opponents of this bill take great delight in \ncalling this a welfare bill for farmers. Well, of course, that shows a \ncomplete lack of understanding of the farm economy and of farm \nprograms.\n  First of all, farmers have relied on a Government program for the \npast 60 years. The urban press has always referred to Government \nprograms as ``welfare'' because they are too stupid to understand the \ninterrelationship between food production and what goes on in cities \nand the jobs that it creates.\n  But what the press does not tell you is what the farmers have done \nfor the American consumer. Farm programs have helped farmers to supply \nus with the best and the cheapest food supply in the world. Is this \nwelfare? Everyone--most of all, the consumer--has benefited from farm \nprograms, and they will continue to do so under this bill.\n  But Congress has passed, in this bill, the most sweeping changes in \nfarm programs in 60 years. We will not, in this new environment of \nchange, pull the rug out from under farmers in this legislation.\n  We are providing in this legislation a glidepath to the free market \ntype of agriculture that most farmers want. This bill provides a \nglidepath. It provides guaranteed, certain payments to farmers to allow \nthem to adjust to a new era of agriculture.\n  This era will be heavily influenced by free market forces instead of \nGovernment programs. This new era will also be influenced by the \nopening of markets in Europe and the Pacific rim when free-trade \nagreements, such as GATT, are allowed a chance to work.\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\n Most farmers welcome the opportunity to meet every competitor abroad, \ncompete in every market, and send a clear signal--which this bill \ndoes--that we are going to supply that market. We are going to be in \nthe market to stay.\n  But, of course, during transition, there must be an adjustment \nperiod. The Government safety net must continue in order to ease the \ntransition. This bill accomplishes that goal.\n  And anyone in this Chamber who thinks farmers will take this market \ntransition payment and not plant a crop has a total lack of \nunderstanding not only about farming but about economics in general.\n  The farmers I know cannot afford to pay the property tax on their \nland and to take these payments and expect to make a living from them. \nThey will have to earn income from the land. Not only do they have to \ndo it, they want to do it. They have to produce and market a crop in \norder to provide such a living.\n  With all due respect to any of my colleagues who think otherwise, it \nis insulting to our farmer constituents to insinuate that they will \ntake a Government payment and fly off to Florida and let the \nproductivity of their land and the return from that productivity be \nnonexistent.\n  Obviously, you are not talking to the same farmers that show up at my \ntown meetings and visit my office. These farmers want to continue to \nfarm the land and make a living from that land.\n  So let us give farmers just a little bit of credit. Let us trust them \nnot only to do the right thing, but to do the only thing that makes \nsense economically. That is what most of this farm bill is all about--\nletting farmers make their own decisions, instead of Government making \nall of their decisions for them.\n  Mr. President, I simply cannot, on another point, buy the argument \nmade by the opponents of this bill that we have failed to provide an \nadequate safety net for farmers. The farmers I talk to do not think the \ncurrent program is any safety net at all.\n  If you want to see how the current program would work for some \nfarmers if it were extended, talk to the farmers in southern Iowa, \nwestern Illinois, and northern Missouri who did not get a crop planted \nin 1995, and ask them about a safety net. They had little or no crop to \nmarket this year. Yet, they did not receive a deficiency payment \nbecause prices are so high. They lost a lot of income, and many of them \nare on the verge of going out of business. Yet, some of my colleagues \nwant to extend the 1990 farm program because they think it is a better \nsafety net.\n  This new farm bill has all the components of an adequate safety net. \nFirst, it makes guaranteed, fixed payments to farmers for the next 7 \nyears--something they can count on. It lets farmers manage their income \nfrom the Government, instead of some bureaucrat in Washington doing it.\n  Since we know the amount that we have to spend on the farm program \nover the next 7 years--and we have to know that if we are going to get \nto a balanced budget--why not let the farmers manage this money instead \nof Washington? Once again, the opponents of the bill would rather keep \nthe powers in the hands of unelected, faceless bureaucrats, when the \nfarmers, business people, as they are and must be, are competent to do \nthis and want to do it and welcome the freedom to do it.\n  This farm bill also has a strong Marketing Loan Program. This \nrepresents the true safety net for our farmers. It protects the farmers \nagainst rapid decline in prices. Finally, we establish a new program in \nthis farm bill called revenue insurance. In fact, it is already being \nused in Iowa under the name of crop revenue coverage. This new product \nis a public-private partnership that represents the future of farm \nprograms. The farmers I talked to in town meetings over the past \nweekend are very excited about this product. They feel that it is the \nonly safety net that they need, one that they can control, and one that \nis related to the marketplace.\n  So let us not substitute our judgment for that of our farmers. It is \ntheir business, their livelihood, and there is nobody who knows better \nhow to manage the 350-acre average-size farm in Iowa than the man who \nis operating it or the woman who owns and operates it. They know better \nthan many people here. Let them decide what a sufficient safety net is \nfor their business. I think most of them will decide that this new \nrevenue insurance product is a very strong safety net.\n  Also, Mr. President, the opponents of this bill argue that we are \nending Government involvement in farming, and that this is just plain \nwrong. These are scare tactics designed to undermine the intent of this \nbill.\n  First of all, permanent law, specifically the 1949 act, is still in \nplace as an incentive for Congress to consider farm legislation after \nthe year 2002.\n  Second, I understand from the Congressional Budget Office that \nagriculture will have about a $4 billion baseline for farm programs \nafter 2002.\n  Finally, and most significantly, the bill establishes a strong \ninsurance program. This program will be a public-private partnership \nthat provides a very strong safety net for family farmers.\n  So Government will continue to play a very important role in farming. \nBut the role will be much more limited. It is accurate to say that \nfarmers' business decisions will no longer be made in Washington. But \nthe Federal Government will continue to play a role in providing a \nsafety net.\n  Maybe the opponents of this bill want the Government to continue to \ncontrol all aspects of agriculture. But farmers do not want that, and \nthe supporters of this bill do not want that. But it is just fear-\nmongering to insinuate that the Federal Government will pull the rug \nout from under the family farmers. This simply will not happen under \nthis very good piece of legislation.\n  I commend the manager of the bill for writing a very good piece, as \nwell as the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield time from the time of the \ndistinguished Democratic leader to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, for yielding to me. I want to compliment not only \nSenator Leahy but also our friend and chairman of the committee, \nSenator Lugar of Indiana.\n  This has been a very, very difficult process indeed--Mr. President \nsteering this particular piece of legislation through the Agriculture \nCommittee ultimately onto the floor of the Senate. In my opinion, it is \nlong overdue. We will not fight that battle now. That has been the \nbattle of the past days, and perhaps it could be a battle for a future \nday. But at least let me say that our two ranking members, our two \nmanaging members, this afternoon have worked very hard and very closely \nto bring this matter to the floor of the Senate this afternoon.\n  I would like to take just a moment to highlight section 926 of the \nfarm bill conference report to my colleagues in the U.S. Senate. I find \nmyself in a very unusual position of pointing to something in this \nreport which I actually support, and those sections are few and far \nbetween. But this is section 926 that I strongly support.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have not nor will I today support \nthe freedom-to-farm concept espoused in the philosophy of this \nlegislation. I believe it ends the much-needed safety net for our \nfamily farmers. However, I have stated my opinion numerous times on \nthis floor, in the Agriculture Committee, and most recently in the last \nweek or so as a member of the conference committee that brought this \nbill to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to very quickly highlight one particular \nprovision which was included to recognize one of our distinguished \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate. Section 926 of the report designates the \nresearch facility operated by the Agricultural Research Service--ARS--\nnear Booneville, AR, as the ``Dale Bumpers Small Farms Research \nCenter.''\n  Booneville, AR, by the way, is less than 15 miles south from an even \nsmaller Arkansas town known as Charleston. The reason I bring this up \nis that Charleston, AR, just so happens to be the hometown of our \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Arkansas, the Honorable Dale \nBumpers. At one time Senator Bumpers not only operated a small \nbusiness, which was a hardware store, but he was also an attorney in \nCharleston, AR. He took great pride in stating that he was not only the \nonly\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nattorney but that he was the best attorney in Charleston, AR.\n  Mr. President, naming this research facility after the Honorable Dale \nBumpers could not be more appropriate, and I am very pleased today to \nplay a very small part in making this distinction possible. Senator \nDale Bumpers has been a tremendous ally for the farmers and ranchers of \nArkansas and across the whole country.\n  As chair and now ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Bumpers has worked and continues to work \ntirelessly on behalf of the agriculture community. He is also, as we \nall know, the former chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee.\n  It was early 1976 when the Booneville Chamber of Commerce went to \nwork to find a better way to utilize State-owned land near this \nparticular town. With the tireless help of Senator Dale Bumpers, the \nnecessary groundwork began, and this truly grassroots project was off \nand running. After consideration of all possible uses for this land, \nthe overwhelming conclusion was that a research facility to benefit \nsmall farms would be the most valuable use. I so well remember this \nproject. It seems so many years ago, as I was Governor at the time and \ndid what I could at the State level to push this project forward.\n  Over the next couple of years working with Senator Bumpers, with his \nhelp, vision, and foresight with the feasibility studies that he was \nresponsible for when they were conducted, additional backing was \ngained. Certainly they showed that a research facility for small \nfarmers in small farming operations was justified. Since it was State-\nowned and State-involved, Mr. President, support from the Governor was \ncrucial. And when my successor, Governor Bill Clinton, entered office \nin 1979 he quickly recognized the merit of establishing a small farms \nresearch center. Approval from local organizations was also obtained, \nand the citizens of Booneville traveled to Washington, DC, to the \nNation's Capital to follow through on their efforts. I remember so well \nthose meetings. I also remember the leadership of Senator Dale \nBumpers--that much-needed fire that got these funds committed, and the \nproject was then off the ground.\n\n  Finally, in 1980, Mr. President, with all of the planning, and all of \nthe studies finally completed, about 15 acres of State-owned land was \nleased to the University of Arkansas, which in turn was leased to the \nDepartment of Agriculture to be used in research. All of this would not \nhave been possible without the leadership and the vision--and certainly \nthe commitment--of the Honorable Dale Bumpers.\n  On behalf of the citizens of Booneville, AR, and throughout our \nentire State, on behalf of the farmers and the ranchers who have and \nwill continue to benefit from the important research conducted there, \nlet me at this time express the much-deserved appreciation for all of \nSenator Bumpers' efforts in making a worthy project become reality. We \nhope that this small token of recognition will demonstrate our \ngratitude to Senator Dale Bumpers.\n  Let me conclude, Mr. President, by stating that this idea to name \nthis particular facility has been kicking around I must say for a long \ntime. For a long time many members of the community of Booneville have \nthought that the appropriate name for this center would be the ``Dale \nBumpers Small Farms Research Center.'' We have leaders like Jeral \nHampton, Rick Lippard, Gene Remy, Don Dunn, A.B. Littlefield, and John \nT. Hampton who served on a committee to steer this center from the \nblueprint stage to the active research stage that it finds itself in \ntoday.\n  It is a great opportunity, and I must say a great challenge that lies \nahead to benefit not only small farmers in our State but small farmers \nin research across this great country of ours.\n  It is a great honor for me. It is great to be able to assist in the \nproper naming of this U.S. Department of Agriculture research center \nafter our distinguished colleague and senior Senator from the State of \nArkansas.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand that under unanimous consent \nSenator Bryan would be recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Responding to the floor manager's inquiry, I will speak \nfor less than 10 minutes, hopefully.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry: This Senator would like to know \nwhat the speaking order is that is coming down the pike?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let us defer to the floor manager.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, may I suggest to the Chair that it might be \nappropriate after Senator Bryan is recognized that Senator Jeffords be \nrecognized on our side, and then Senator Harkin, if that would work out \nwith the arrangement. We have attempted to alternate back and forth. \nBut there was no Republican present when Mr. Bryan appeared and, \ntherefore, I recognized that he was the next speaker on that occasion. \nBut after him, I would like to proceed to Senator Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I understand Senator Bryan, Senator Jeffords, \nand Senator Harkin, in that order.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I thank the majority floor manager for \naccommodating me and recognizing me in sequence.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the conference report \nand to speak about an aspect of this farm bill that is particularly \ntroubling to me and has been troubling to me for many years.\n  Again and again this Senate has passed provisions to reduce and to \nreform the Market Promotion Program which is also known as MPP. Each \nand every time the Senate has called for reform of MPP the conference \ncommittees which convened subsequent to the passage of those reforms \nhave removed the reform language from the final conference report.\n  By way of background, Mr. President, the Market Promotion Program was \ncreated to encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of \nexports of U.S. agricultural products. MPP is a successor to the \nTargeted Export Assistance Program [TEA] which was established in 1986. \nTEA was originally created to counter or offset the adverse effect of \nsubsidies, import quotas, or other unfair trade practices of foreign \ncompetitors directed at U.S. agricultural exports. Since 1986, the \nFederal Government has spent $1.43 billion on TEA and MPP.\n\n  The General Accounting Office has pointed out that the entire Federal \nGovernment spends about $3.5 billion annually on export promotion. \nWhile agricultural products account for approximately 10 percent of \ntotal U.S. exports, the Department of Agriculture spends about $2.2 \nbillion each year or 63 percent of that total. By contrast, the \nDepartment of Commerce spends $236 million annually on trade promotion.\n  MPP is operated through approximately 64 organizations that either \nrun market promotion programs themselves or pass the funds along to \nindividual companies to spend on their own advertising efforts. In \nfiscal year 1994, about 43 percent of all MPP activities involved \ngeneric promotions while 57 percent involved brand-name promotions.\n  In fiscal years 1986 through 1993, $92 million of MPP funds went to \nforeign companies.\n  Mr. President, when I talk about MPP funds, I am talking about tax \ndollars collected from American citizens who remit their taxes to the \nFederal Government each year. That $92 million represents nearly 20 \npercent of the total funds allocated for brand-name promotions during \nthose 8 years. In fiscal year 1994, more than 140 foreign companies \nreceived MPP funds.\n  Although the stated goal of MPP is to benefit U.S. farmers, the \nprogram can also benefit foreign enterprises. By funding foreign firms, \nthe General Accounting Office has contended that MPP can make it more \ndifficult for U.S. firms to compete and to obtain a foothold in foreign \nmarkets. While it has been argued that the funding of foreign companies \nmay produce short-term gains in the export of U.S. agricultural \ncommodities, those gains are likely to come at the expense of U.S. \nfirms gaining a more permanent foothold in overseas markets.\n  On September 20 of last year, the Senate voted 62 to 36 to reform the \nMPP Program and to lower the amount of Federal Government money \nsupporting it. This amendment was cast in the\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nform of the Bumpers-Bryan amendment and would have made three reforms \nto MPP.\n  First, under the provisions of the amendment, only small businesses \nand Capper-Volstead cooperatives would be eligible for financial \nassistance.\n  Second, no funds would be used to provide assistance to foreign trade \nassociations.\n  Third, the funding level would be reduced to $70 million.\n  When the fiscal year 1996 agriculture appropriations conference \nreport came back to the Senate on October 12 of last year, it was \npassed on a voice vote. The conference committee had removed the Senate \nlanguage reforming MPP and restored its level of annual funding to $110 \nmillion.\n  Again we tried to reform MPP when the 7-year farm program \nauthorization first came before the Senate last month. The Senate \npassed the Bryan-Kerry-Bumpers-Reid amendment by a vote of 59 to 37, \nand it contained the same provisions that were previously included in \nthe Bumpers-Bryan amendment, the reforms as well as reducing funding to \n$70 million annually. Now the farm bill conference report has come back \nto the Senate and, again, repeating the pattern of the past MPP reforms \nthat passed the Senate, have been removed.\n  Let me make specific reference, Mr. President, to language contained \nin the conference report itself that addresses this subject, and I \nquote:\n\n       Funds shall not be used to provide direct assistance to any \n     foreign for-profit corporation for the corporation's use in \n     promoting foreign-produced products.\n\n  Now, at first blush, a superficial reading of the language might \nsuggest that foreign companies would be excluded from receiving money \nthrough MPP, but this apparent reform is disingenuous. While the \nlanguage adopted by the conference committee might prohibit direct \nassistance to foreign companies, it does not prohibit indirect \nassistance to foreign companies by nonprofit associations. And in what \nmay be the ultimate irony, the conference report implies that a new \nreform is being enacted that would preclude payment to foreign \ncorporations for foreign-produced products. MPP was never designed--and \nI repeat never designed--to compensate corporations for foreign-\nproduced products. This claim of reform is illusory.\n  At a time when the gospel of budgetary restraint has reportedly been \nembraced by all, a majority of the agricultural conferees continue to \npursue a taxpayer giveaway to foreign corporations.\n  Finally, this conference report adds a new and rather curious \nmandate. It officially changes the name of the Market Promotion Program \nto the Market Access Program [MAP] as it will now be designated. Is \nthis reform? I would submit that if it looks like a duck, walks like a \nduck, quacks like a duck, swims like a duck, it is a duck. Whether it \nis called MPP or MAP, this program remains what it has always been, a \nfrivolous use of taxpayer money and a prime example of a corporate \nwelfare program that should be eliminated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont, Senator Jeffords.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. First of all, I commend the chairman of the Committee \non Agriculture, along with the ranking member, for the incredible work \nthat they have put into this bill. I believe it is an excellent piece \nof legislation that provides stability, enhances markets, streamlines \noutdated programs, creates incentives to protect the environment, and \nbenefits all farmers from all regions of the country. Having worked on \nseveral farm conferences in my period in the House, I know how \ndifficult and how hard it is to come through with a consensus. Not only \ndo you have to worry about all the farm interests but also you have to \nworry about all of those who are affected by farm policy. It is a \ntremendous piece of work which they have accomplished. I also thank the \nMembers in the House with whom I worked for many years, for their \nsupport at the critical time on the conference committee. Without their \nhelp this could not have come about.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference reached a comprehensive \ndairy title that reflects the interests of all regions of the country. \nI was most keenly concerned about the Senate farm bill's inability to \ngive our dairy farmers at least a fair deal. It was this concern that \nmotivated me to vote against the bill for the first time in my 20 years \nin Congress.\n  Fortunately, through the help of our chairman and ranking member from \nmy good State of Vermont, the conference committee, after hours of \nintense consideration produced a dairy title that provides stability \nfor our farmers and true reform in the dairy program. The dairy title \neliminates the 10-cent-per-hundredweight assessment paid by dairy \nproducers, returning $150 million annually to dairy producers \nthroughout the country at this difficult time for them. It reforms and \nconsolidates the Federal milk marketing order system, consolidating the \norders from 34 to between 10 and 14 will help bring more uniformity in \nprices throughout the country. It continues price support purchases \nfrom December 31, 1999, followed by a recourse loan program for butter, \nnonfat dry milk and cheese beginning on January 1, 2000, giving the \nindustry the means to compete in world markets and enhancing the future \nof a strong, renewed dairy industry. Most significantly for the farmers \nof New England, the bill grants consent to the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact.\n  Mr. President, in March of last year, I introduced the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact along with the entire New England delegation. \nThe dairy compact is intended to help give farmers and consumers fair \nand stable milk prices in New England. It will establish an interstate \ncommission consisting of one delegation from each of the six New \nEngland States. The commission will have the authority to hold public \nhearings on the fluid class 1 milk market in New England.\n  The dairy compact originated in the Vermont legislature over 7 years \nago. It has universal support among Vermonters and throughout New \nEngland and is critical to the maintenance of the region's dairy \nindustry, if not its survival, offering both income stability and \nincome enhancement. The compact has been overwhelmingly approved by the \nlegislatures of all six New England States and simply needed the \nconsent of Congress.\n  What the State legislatures offered was not at all a novel idea. The \nwidespread support for and central importance of the dairy compact to \nNew England has been throughly emphasized by the regions Governors, \nlegislatures, consumers, farmers, and local processors.\n  The single most overwhelming fact about the economics of dairying in \nNew England is that the price to the consumer continues to increase at \nthe same time the price to the farmer continues to go down. In fact, \ncurrent farm milk prices are, as low as they were over 10 years ago \nwhile the price to consumers is substantially higher.\n  The hard working dairy farmers of New England have seen federally set \nminimum prices return less money than it costs them to produce their \nmilk. The result, during the 1980's, 40 percent of the New England \nfarms ceased to operate. In my own State of Vermont, where agriculture \nis such an important part of our economy and way of life, nearly 50 \npercent of the farms have been lost in past 10 years.\n  The inclusion of the dairy compact in the conference report is a \ntribute to the hard-working dairy farmers of New England, who are such \na vital part of the region's heritage. The compact ensures that family \nfarms from St. Albans to Pawlet, to those in the Northeast Kingdom and \nall across New England will have the ability to survive and remain \neconomically viable into the next century.\n  Mr. President, milk processing plants, feed and equipment \ndealerships, veterinarians, banks, and many others suffer when farms in \ntheir communities go out of business.\n  Not surprisingly, the dairy processors' lobby fought hard to prevent \nCongress from approving the compact. After all, they have benefited for \na long time on both ends of their business from cheaper farm milk and \nhigher consumer prices.\n\n  Several of my colleagues have heard from large milk processors in \ntheir States about how this compact could hurt the national dairy \nindustry or the farmers in their own State.\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\n  Such claims are false. The compact would in no way prevent milk from \ncoming into the region or affect the price of milk in any other region \nof the country. Despite the claims of the processors' lobby, the fact \nremains that the compact is very similar to existing State over-order \nprograms currently in place. Like those programs, the compact would not \nconflict with or alter the Federal milk marketing order system, but \nonly complement its operation. In short, New England States are working \ncooperatively as a region only to maintain a healthy dairy industry in \nNew England, without adverse effect on the rest of the country.\n  The compact has been carefully crafted so that it will not affect the \nnational dairy industry. Nonetheless, in order to address any concerns \nthat the conference committee may of had of how the compact will work \nin practice several additions were included.\n  The compact limits the ability of other States to join; allows \nfarmers outside New England who sell milk within the region to benefit \nfrom the compact; restricts the interstate commission to regulate class \nI milk only, and will terminate concurrent with the Secretary's \nimplementation of the dairy pricing and Federal milk marketing order \nconsolidation and reforms.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that this bill takes great strides \nat addressing conservation practices. USDA conservation programs have \ntraditionally addressed the problems faced by producers growing row \ncrops. The technical and financial assistance that livestock producers \nneed have not been well addressed by our current set of conservation \nprograms. This bill creates a new Environmental Quality Incentives \nProgram to help farmers with conservation projects, creating new \nincentives for farmers to protect and enhance the use their land.\n  In addition, the bill includes a $35 million initiative to buy \neasements on farmland threatened by development and $50 million \nwildlife habitat program. These provisions, along with several others \nwill help farmers from throughout the country deal with water quality, \nerosion and other conservation challenges.\n  Mr. President, the hard work and partnership with both the House and \nSenate has produced a comprehensive bill that reflects accountable \nreform, important market stability, and environmental responsibility.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement on the farm bill.\n  This is the first major, fundamental change in Federal agriculture \npolicy since the first farm programs were created in the 1930's.\n  Today an international market has developed for America's farm \nproducts and we need to provide the mechanisms that allow farmers to \nbase decisions on market conditions and not on Government programs.\n  This conference agreement provides farmers with that mechanism \nthrough the Market Transition Program.\n  The Market Transition Program moves agriculture in a new direction \nwhich will give farmers the freedom to plant what they want, when they \nwant.\n  The Market Transition Program also ends the production control \nprograms of the Depression era.\n  Under our current system, farmers may be required to take land out of \nproduction which allows our foreign competitors to make up the \ndifference in the world markets.\n  This conference agreement gives the farmer the flexibility to base \nbusiness decisions on market conditions and not on Government programs.\n  Mr. President, this conference agreement allows the Department of \nAgriculture to spend $67.7 billion on commodity, trade, research, rural \ndevelopment, and conservation programs over the next 7 years as \nestimated from the December 1995 baseline.\n  CBO's preliminary estimates indicated that this conference agreement \nsaves $2.1 billion over the next 7 years.\n  This conference agreement does not achieve the $4.6 billion in \nsavings that was included in the Vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. \nHowever, it does provide a down payment toward a balanced budget and is \na step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President this bill also adds spending discipline to the \ncommodity programs by including a spending cap. Spending for commodity \nprograms through the Commodity Credit Corporation has varied widely \nfrom $600 million in 1975 to $26 billion in 1986.\n  The spending cap will limit unforseen spending increases which have \nfrequently occurred in past years.\n  Mr. President, on a more parochial issue, the bill includes a \nprovision regarding the New Mexico valencia peanut pool.\n  The Senate-passed bill included an amendment to clarify the original \nintent of the law. The House passed bill had no such provision.\n  Mr. President, as part of the 1985 farm bill, Congress created an \nexclusive pool for New Mexico valencia peanuts, and the provision was \nretained in the 1990 farm bill.\n  The original intent of the law is to allow only those valencia \npeanuts physically grown in New Mexico to enter the pools of the State.\n  However, peanut growers in my home State have notified me that \nvalencia peanuts grown in Texas have entered the New Mexico pool \nbecause of a loophole in existing regulations.\n  It is my understanding that the USDA regulations allow a producer to \nenter valencia peanuts grown on a Texas farm if that producer has a \ncombined New Mexico-Texas farm that is administered in New Mexico.\n  The compromise reached in this agreement clarifies that valencia \npeanuts must be physically produced in New Mexico in order to enter the \nNew Mexico valencia peanut pool for 1996 and subsequent crop years.\n  The compromise also grandfathers those producers who entered valencia \npeanuts grown in Texas during the 1990 to 1995 crop years.\n  Producers may enter Texas grown valencia peanuts in the New Mexico \npool, but the amount is limited to the 6-year average--1990 to 1995--\nthat the producer entered into the pool during that period.\n  For example, producer ``A'' entered 10 tons of Texas grown valencia \npeanuts for each year during 1990 to 1995--a total of 60 tons for the 6 \nyear period. Producer ``A'' would have a 6-year average of 10 tons.\n  Producer ``A'' will be able to enter up to 10 tons of Texas grown \nvalencia peanuts per year into the New Mexico pool.\n  Producer ``B'' also has a combined New Mexico-Texas farm administered \nin New Mexico. But, producer ``B'' has no history of entering Texas \ngrown valencia peanuts into the New Mexico pool during the 1990 to 1995 \ncrop years.\n  Under this scenario, producer ``B'' would not be allowed to enter \nTexas-grown valencia peanuts into the New Mexico pool for future crop \nyears. Producer ``B'' could, however, continue to participate in the \nNew Mexico pool with peanuts physically grown in New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, this conference agreement also includes other \nprovisions which are important to native Americans and the operations \nof the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nAgriculture Committee for their review and consideration of this and \nother issues that I brought to the committee's attention.\n  I urge the adoption of the conference agreement.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nconference report to H.R. 2854, the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act--the farm bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill which has been too long in coming to \nthe floor of the Senate. The authority contained in this bill expired \non New Year's Eve. This debate began on the 1995 farm bill. And with \nthe tardiness of our action this bill will barely be in time for the \n1996 crop.\n  I will cast my vote in favor of adopting this report. I feel that it \nis essential that we get this legislation passed and to the President \nfor his signature. It is time for our Nation's food producers to know \nwhat their program will be in the coming year.\n  It is my hope that by next week, this bill will be signed into law. \nThe Secretary of Agriculture has recommended that the President sign \nit. And the President has indicated he will do so. So I am pleased that \ntoday we will pass this bill.\n  There are a number of important items which have been included. In my \nmind, the most important inclusion is\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nretaining the 1949 Agricultural Act as underlying, permanent law. Mr. \nPresident, I am convinced that the 1949 act is the reason we have had \nthis farm bill debate. And I expect that 7 years from now, it could \nvery well be the reason we have a farm bill debate at the sunset of \nthis bill.\n  This legislation contains a number of valuable conservation programs. \nIn our part of the country, the Conservation Reserve Program, the CRP, \nis a major factor in wildlife habitat conservation, water quality \nenhancement, and soil conservation. We are continuing this valuable \nprogram. And we are authorizing a new Environmental Quality Incentive \nProgram which will help producers of both crops and livestock to make \nmanagement changes for the improvement of the natural resource on which \ntheir future and their livelihood depends. This program will also \nprovide for cooperative efforts with conservation organizations to \nenhance wildlife habitat. It's a win-win for States like Montana.\n  I am pleased that this is comprehensive legislation--it extends \nbeyond the commodity programs. In addition to conservation, we have \naddressed credit, research, trade, rural development, and promotion \nactivities. In the arena of trade we have authorized the important \nMarket Access Program, the Export Promotion Program, and the Foreign \nMarket Development Program. These programs are vital to our export \nactivities.\n  Agriculture trade is a real bright spot in our total trade effort. \nOur agriculture exports last year were over $54 billion dollars. This \nyear, we are expected to exceed that, reaching $60 billion. That will \nleave us a positive agriculture trade surplus of $30 billion.\n  The commodity program featured in this bill directs our farmers to \nobtain an ever-increasing percentage of their income from the \nmarketplace. In today's world, that means American producers will need \nto be very competitive and expand their exports. And while our export \nprograms are not funded at levels I would prefer, they will go a long \nways toward our export goals.\n  The commodity programs will provide farmers the flexibility to plant \ncrops which the market demands. No longer will the Government be making \nplanting decisions. While that will be helpful to many farmers that \nflexibility will carry with it a need to develop and improve \nalternative crops to grow more successfully in arid climates like that \nin Montana. Only then will Montana farmers have true planting \nflexibility. The work at Agricultural Research Stations like the one in \nSidney, MT will be an important part of this equation.\n  In this year, with good prices and sizeable payments it should be a \npretty good year for our Montana producers. I hope that the prices we \nare now experiencing can be maintained. If so, this program should work \nwell for the entire 7 years it is authorized. However, we need to take \nadvantage of the strong price cycle we are in to reform the crop \ninsurance program so it is a more functional system of risk management. \nIf we fail to accomplish this task we could be in for tough times in \nthe late years of the bill.\n  There are other problems I see in this bill. I am disappointed that \nthis will end the Emergency Livestock Feed Program. And I would like to \nsee the loan rate caps removed. I would also prefer that the research \ntitle was authorized for the entire 7 years. This forces a research \ntitle to be authorized next year or to risk authorization by \nappropriation in our important research program. Some might find these \nto be small concerns, however, to my State they are important.\n  Before I close Mr. President, I want the record to reflect my \nappreciation for the work of our Senate conferees on this issue. They \nhad a difficult task and I would like to thank them because this bill \nis far preferable to the bill brought to conference by our colleagues \nacross the Hill. So I would thank the conferees, especially the \nchairman and the ranking member for their efforts in getting this \naccomplished.\n  And with that Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to approve this \nconference report and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has \nfinally reached closure on the farm bill.\n  Bringing the farm bill to this final stage in the legislative process \nhas not been an easy task. As we approach the end of this debate, I am \nreminded of the words of Thomas Jefferson, who once said ``Were we \ndirected from Washington when to sow and when to reap, we should soon \nwant bread.''\n  While we are far from wanting bread in America, Jefferson's words \nsound almost as if they had been said by a farmer only 2 hours ago, \ninstead of two centuries ago. Farmers today, like farmers in \nJefferson's time, want to get their profits from the market, with as \nlittle Government interference as possible.\n  The new approach to farm programs embodied in this bill, known as the \nMarket Transition Act, or freedom to farm, finds its roots in these \nviews. The new commodity programs are designed on the belief that it is \nimportant to reduce Government interference with planting decisions. \nThese new programs have been fashioned to provide farmers with the \nsimplicity, flexibility, and certainty that they seek.\n  I have great reservations about some aspects of this new approach, \nhowever. Farmers still need a system in place to help moderate risk, \nand provide a financial safety net. In this regard, the Market \nTransition Act falls profoundly short. And that is a very serious flaw \nwe must revisit as quickly as possible.\n  Perhaps these problems would have been resolved had the farm bill \nbeen handled by this Congress as farm bills have been handed in the \npast. For over 40 years, farm bills were considered early, and passed \non time. Farm programs, which are so very important to rural America, \nand which can have far-reaching effects, were rigorously debated and \nreviewed well in advance of their expiration date. While the results \nmay not have been perfect, previously Congresses gave farm bills the \ntime and attention they deserved.\n  But, I am not running the Senate. And the hour is late. There is a \ntime to debate, and a time to act. Planting season is upon us. We must \nmove beyond politics, and move ahead. Farmers need a farm bill in \nplace--now.\n  The Market Transition Act may need to be revisited. But it is time to \nenact a law. My vote for the 1996 farm bill was a vote to end debate, \npass a farm bill, and provide farmers with the certainty they need for \nthis crop year.\n  There are good things about this farm bill. The bill is strong in the \nareas of conservation, environment, rural development, and research. \nThe Conservation Reserve Program is maintained at 34.6 million acres. \nThe Environmental Quality Incentives Program is authorized at $200 \nmillion per year to help livestock and crop farmers control pollution \nand erosion. The Fund for Rural America, a program I support, was \ncreated to provide $300 million for rural development and research \ninitiatives. The Market Promotion Program, now known as the Market \nAccess Program, survived and is authorized at $90 million to promote \nU.S. agriculture exports overseas. And permanent law is retained, \nlessening the danger that in 7 years, Federal support for agriculture \nwill end.\n  I am particularly pleased this bill includes my proposal to increase \nthe marketing loan rate for oilseeds. For soybeans, a major Illinois \ncommodity, the marketing loan rate will be set at 85 percent of the \nOlympic 5-year average, but no less than $4.92 or no more than $5.26 \nper bushel. Allowing the soybean loan rate to rise by 5 percent if \nprices increase helps to treat soybeans equitably with other crops, \nallows soybeans to compete more effectively for acreage, and provides \nsome protection for small producers against increased volatility in \nproduction and prices that may result from full planting flexibility.\n  With other aspects of this bill, however, I have serious concerns.\n  I am greatly disturbed by the decision of the conferees to include \nthe Northeast interstate dairy compact. These provisions were soundly \nrejected by the Senate, not considered by the House, and, therefore, \nwithout question, should never have been included in this conference \nreport. I intend to work with my Midwestern colleagues in the Senate to \nensure that the U.S. Department of Agriculture never implements this \ncompact, which would set dangerous constitutional precedent and have a \nserious impact on both dairy farmers and dairy companies in Illinois.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  I am also concerned that food stamps have been reauthorized for only \n2 years. Roughly 27 million Americans are served by food stamps, 1.2 \nmillion of whom are Illinoisans, and over half of whom are children. \nFood stamps are about providing the nutrition necessary to ensure that \nmothers and babies remain healthy, students remain alert, and the \nunemployed make it through tough times. It is poor policy for Congress \nto play political games with programs designed to support the health of \nchildren, working families, and the elderly.\n  Many of the improvements in this bill would not have been possible \nwithout the leadership of the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle. While he will vote no on this bill, he has worked to make this \na better bill, and I commend his leadership on agriculture issues which \nare so very important to his State.\n  I would also like to thank the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nDole, and Senators Lugar, Leahy, Grassley, and Cochran for their work \non this bill, and for their assistance and support for programs \nimportant to the State of Illinois.\n  Mr. President, agriculture programs must change with the times. The \neconomic practices and social trends in rural America are vastly \ndifferent than in decades past. These changes aren't just important to \nfarmers and rural communities. They are not just about dry statistics \nburied in some obscure report. They are about issues that are \ncritically important to everyday people.\n  That is why changes to farm programs must be made judiciously. Major \nchanges to Federal farm policies must receive careful attention before \nthey are made, so that inadvertent mistakes that could be very harmful \nto farmers are avoided.\n  We can do far better than this bill. But doing nothing--having no \nbill--is not an option, and that is why I will vote in favor of the \n1996 farm bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased that we finally have a \nfarm bill which will pass and will be signed by the President. The bill \nis long overdue. Farmers should not have to wait any longer for \ncertainty regarding the programs they will operate under.\n  I regret that the bill has taken so long. The process itself has \ncontributed to a poor outcome for American agriculture and for rural \nAmerican communities. There are some positive sections of the bill--\nconservation, nutrition, and needed funding for rural development. But \nthe commodity provisions take us exactly in the wrong direction. The \nbill decouples Government support from production and from market \nprices. It caps loan rates at low levels. And it directs the majority \nof taxpayer payments to the largest, most affluent farms to the same \ndegree as the status-quo programs which operate so unfairly now.\n  It would be more appropriate to refer to this legislation as the \n``corporate agribusiness bill'' than as a farm bill. After a few short \nyears, American farmers will be left to the tender mercies of a global \nmarketplace that is dominated by corporate conglomerates and trading \nboards.\n  We might have produced a better farm bill if our debate over it had \nbeen more timely and deliberate. The effort to include an entire 7-year \nbill in last year's budget reconciliation bill, with little debate and \npractically no input from Democrats, followed by the now-successful \npush to pass a plan that was not subjected to extensive hearings or \nsubstantial input from rural America has produced a bad bill. Better \nproposals were offered in both the House and the Senate, including a \nreform bill introduced here last year by Senate Minority Leader \nDaschle, which I was proud to cosponsor. But those proposals were never \ngiven real consideration.\n  This bill is as deeply flawed now as when I voted against its \noriginal Senate version. It was not improved by the conference \ncommittee. It does not represent good farm policy and will not likely \npromote economic revitalization in rural America. I will vote against \nit now, and it is my hope that as this bill's flaws become even more \napparent in its implementation, the result will be its reconsideration \nby the next Congress so that more genuinely progressive reform of \nFederal farm policy can be enacted.\n  Some people, including some Minnesotans, believe that the so-called \nfreedom-to-farm approach to farm policy is the best way forward for \nAmerican agriculture. I profoundly disagree with that judgment. I \nbelieve it is designed to benefit large corporate agribusiness and will \nactually harm most family farmers. It will likely increase current \ntrends toward economic concentration in agriculture, to the \ndisadvantage of small and moderate-sized farm operations.\n  I have consistently favored long-term Federal farm policy that would \npromote family agriculture and revitalize our rural economy. That is \nnot what freedom-to-farm represents. It is such bad policy that it will \ndiscredit farm programs forever. The public will not support farm \nprograms that write checks to farmers when prices are high, and no \nmatter what, or even whether anything, is planted.\n  During initial consideration, Senator Dorgan offered an amendment \nwhich I supported, which would have required that farmers plant a crop \nin order to receive the guaranteed Government payment. That was voted \ndown. I don't think this is the kind of policy that reaches out to the \ngeneral public for support at a time when we are looking at slashing \nthe budgets for health care and education programs.\n  Freedom-to-farm represents a dubious carrot followed by a very real \nstick. What is the short-term carrot? The carrot is so-called \n``contract'' payments, or ``transition'' payments on the way to the \nelimination of farm programs. Farmers who have some debt, or who have \nhad a poor crop in the past couple of years, or who did not get good \nprices last year, would like a Government payment this year on top of \ndecent prices. There is no question about that.\n  I understand why some people consider that promise attractive. They \nbelieve that a promise of 7 years of payments is the best they will get \nfrom this Congress. But the contracts cannot be guaranteed. Congress \ncan do another budget bill at any time and reduce or eliminate the \npayments. The entire purpose of freedom-to-farm is to reduce farm-\nprogram spending, then eliminate it. Even current policy, which I have \nnever supported, offers farmers more protection over seven years than \nfreedom-to-farm.\n  What is the medium-term and the long-term stick? Prices will not stay \nwhere they are likely to be this year. Freedom-to-farm caps loan rates \nat 1995 levels. As the so-called guaranteed payments diminish, and then \nwhen they run out, how many Minnesota farmers can make a living off of \n$1.89-a-bushel corn, or $2.58-a-bushel wheat? Is that the future we \nwant to leave our young farmers?\n  That is the reality of freedom-to-farm. It ultimately leaves farmers \nto the tender mercies of the grain companies and the railroads and the \nChicago Board of Trade--$1.89 corn is what freedom-to-farm is about. \nMaybe not this year. But who believes that prices will always be \nstrong? I voted for an amendment to lift the caps off the loan rates. \nThat amendment failed. If farm policy were designed to deliver farmers \na fair price in the marketplace, there would be no need for any \nGovernment payments. But this bill is designed to encourage maximum \nproduction and low prices.\n  I have supported what I consider to be genuine reform of farm \nprograms. I cosponsored a 7-year proposal last year which called for a \ntargeted marketing-loan approach. That plan would provide farmers the \nplanting flexibility they need. But it also would provide needed long-\nterm protection from some of the uncertainties that farmers face--\nuncertainties of weather, and of markets that are dominated by large \nmultinational companies. It also would raise loan rates and target \nfarm-program benefits to family-size farmers. I still believe that our \nproposal, modeled after the Farmers Union plan and endorsed by the \nMinnesota corn growers, was the best proposal. Perhaps the debate over \nagriculture policy in the United States will be resumed next year. I \nintend to see that it is.\n  Mr. President, I have been working since I arrived to the Senate 5 \nyears ago to achieve an improvement in Federal dairy policy and \nmeaningful reform of the Federal milk marketing orders. This bill does \nnot achieve that goal. Some small improvements in dairy policy were \nincluded in the conference committee, notably the elimination of \nassessments. But not nearly\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nenough. And the bill now will allow creation of a Northeast dairy \ncompact, despite our overwhelming vote here during initial \nconsideration of the farm bill against that outcome, and despite the \nfact that the compact was not in either the House or Senate version of \nthe bill. The Northeast compact would only further forestall real \nFederal order reform. It would cut a special deal for one region's \ndairy farmers to the detriment of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. \nAnd it would set a bad precedent for interstate commerce in milk by \ncreating new regional barriers. We need good national dairy policy. And \nI will continue to resist establishment of a Northeast compact in the \nabsence of substantial reform which will benefit the Midwest. Minnesota \nand Wisconsin are the best natural dairy-producing states in the \ncountry. It is not rational that Federal policy should drive thousands \nof Minnesota producers from business.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we finally have authorized the \nenrollment of new acres into the successful and popular Conservation \nReserve Program [CRP]. I worked very hard on that. And I am pleased \nthat we could include some additional conservation, rural development \nand nutrition provisions. It is very important that we ensure that \nrural development efforts include assistance for farmer-owned, value-\nadded processing cooperatives, which represent an extremely hopeful \ndevelopment in rural America. They are the best of rural America's \ninnovative, self-help tradition, which keeps capital and jobs in local \ncommunities.\n\n\n                 Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection Panel\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the inclusion \nin the farm bill conference report of language establishing a Safe Meat \nand Poultry Inspection Panel. This seemingly innocent-sounding \norganization may actually be a device to delay needed food safety \nreforms, and give power over crucial safety decisions to a part-time, \nadministratively unworkable group. Under the terms of the conference \nreport, it would be superimposed over the Food Safety and Inspection \nService as one more, unaccountable layer of government.\n  Authorization for this new panel was contained in neither version of \nthe farm bill, and it was not subjected to hearings in either body. It \nwas slipped into the report at the last minute and has had no public or \npress scrutiny. Not only would it duplicate existing bodies such as the \nNational Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods, the \npanel would also be exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act and \nits open-government requirements. Even worse, should it be used to \ndelay or restrict needed safety reforms, the result will be disastrous, \nnot just for consumers but also for the industry itself.\n  At a time when Britain may be compelled to kill its entire cattle \nherd because of mad cow disease, the meat industry cannot afford any \nmore actions which will diminish public confidence in our food supply.\n  I am especially concerned that the new panel would delay issuance of \nthe final version of the proposed pathogen reduction; Hazard Analysis \nand Critical Control Point System [HACCP] rule. This set of \nregulations, more commonly known as the E. coli rule, is crucial for \ncontrolling this deadly organism and modernizing American meat \ninspection.\n  Mr. President, a year ago last March I introduced the Family Food \nProtection Act which built on these regulations and extended them even \nfurther. I was moved by the death of Katie O'Connell, a beautiful, \nhappy 2-year-old girl from my home State of New Jersey who died from \neating a hamburger at a fast food restaurant. Although her meal was \ncontaminated with the deadly pathogen called E. coli, the meat that \nKatie ate had been declared safe by inspectors from the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture.\n  Katie died from a disease that should have been detected through our \nFederal meat inspection system. Katie is no longer alive because that \nsystem failed her and her family and has failed thousands of others \nacross the country.\n  Diseases caused by foodborne illness often strike those most \nvulnerable in our society: our children. Two summers ago, health \nofficials in New Jersey battled another outbreak of the disease that \nkilled Katie O'Connell. One family, the McCormicks of Newton, NJ, had \ntwo of their children (ages 2 and 3) hospitalized. Their lives were in \ndanger because they, too, ate meat that was declared safe by Federal \ninspectors in the Department of Agriculture.\n  These cases are far from isolated: the Centers for Disease Control \nestimates that over 9,000 people die and another 6.5 million get sick \nfrom food borne illnesses each year.\n\n  The USDA regulations proposed a year ago February would require a \ndaily testing for salmonella at meat and poultry processing plants \nacross America. Additionally, each of the Nation's 6,000 \nslaughterhouses and processing plants would have to develop operating \nplans designed to minimize possible sources of contamination--in other \nwords, to design systems to avoid contamination in advance instead of \nfighting it after it breaks out.\n  This proposal represents a significant improvement over the current \nsystem which has remained in place remarkably unchanged for over 90 \nyears--since the reforms put in place in the wake of Upton Sinclair's \nwrenching expose, ``The Jungle.''\n  Ironically, a cost-benefit analysis was done on the proposed rule. \nEven though it used a very conservative figure for the value of human \nlife, the ratio was still extremely favorable. According to the \nanalysis, while the rule would cost $250 million per year initially, \nfalling to $220 million a year once it was fully implemented, the \nbenefits were at least $1 billion per year. If a more generous value \nwere used for human life, the cost-benefit ratio was, of course, even \nmore positive.\n  And $220 million would be the cost to consumers only if every penny \nof the system's costs were passed along--just two- tenths of a cent per \npound. That's right. Two-tenths of a cent per pound. So a consumer \nwould have to buy 5 pounds of hamburger before incurring even a penny \nof cost. Contrast this with the cost to consumers of $1 billion to $3.7 \nbillion per year attributable to lost wages and medical costs that \notherwise would occur without the rule. Surely, the typical American \nwould be more than willing to pay this modest price to avoid sickness \nor even death to a loved one.\n  I don't want any more children to die. According to the USDA, the \nsummer months are the prime time for food borne diseases. I question \nthe need to reinvent the wheel at this time.\n  Unfortunately, these proposed regulations have been the subject of \ncountless hearings, roundtable meetings with industry and consumer \ngroups, and on and on. At one point the industry even claimed that the \nE. coli organism was not technically an adulterant under our food \nsafety laws in an attempt to deny the agency the ability to regulate. \nThis new panel is yet another attempt to delay.\n  Do we really need to waste years, lives, and money redoing old \nanalyses and creating new ones in an effort to stall or even defeat \nthese regulations?\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that these regulations are already a \ntarget of members in the other body who would try to delay them further \nthrough appropriations riders and other techniques. Instead of delay, I \nurge my colleagues to stop interfering with these regulations. They are \nexactly the kinds of regulations we claim to want. They are cost-\neffective, deal with a serious problem, and have been subjected to \nclose scrutiny by a wide variety of interests. We should not misuse the \nfarm bill to thwart these important regulations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my colleagues have been speaking today \nabout their frustrations with the 1996 farm bill. I share those \nfrustrations as well as dismay about the process in which this body has \nbeen engaged.\n  In early February we considered this legislation on the Senate floor. \nThe specific commodity program provisions of that bill were never once \nthe subject of a Senate Agriculture Committee markup, and in fact, were \nnot even the subject of a single hearing in that committee. That the \ncommodity provisions represented a drastic change from both the \nphilosophy and mechanics of current policy appeared irrelevant to the \nsponsors of this bill.\n  The process for consideration of this bill was flawed in numerous \nways. For example: The text of the underlying bill considered on the \nfloor was written\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\nin the backroom, separate even from the eyes and ears of members, of \nmany members of the Agriculture Committee; Almost immediately after the \nbill was introduced, the majority leader filed cloture to limit debate \non the measure before debate had even begun; This bill was considered \non the floor with just 10 hours for members to offer and debate \namendments prior to final passage; Farmers, the public, and even \nSenators were not given an adequate opportunity to review this bill \nbefore it passed on the floor of the Senate.\n  Contrast that to consideration of the 1990 farm bill in which each \ntitle of the bill was considered separately by the Agriculture \nCommittee during extensive public markup sessions. Consideration of the \n1990 farm bill, reported on June 21, 1990, gave Senators nearly a month \nto study the bill and another 7 days of floor consideration before \nfinal passage. Senators were free to iron out their differences with \nthe managers and were provided time for full and open debate with \nadequate opportunity to offer amendments to the bill.\n  The 1985 and 1981 farm bills provided similar opportunities for \nreview and debate. Senators had roughly 2 months to review the 1985 \nfarm bill after it was reported and had 12 days of active floor debate. \nFollowing the filing of the committee report on the 1981 farm bill, \nSenators were provided with over 3 months to study and review the bill \nbefore its passage in September after 5 days of floor debate.\n  It is no wonder that the general public is frustrated with Congress. \nBased on this farm bill process they have every right to be. The \nconference agreement on which we are to vote in just a few hours was \nprinted in the Record just 2 days ago. I ask how many of my colleagues \nhave had an opportunity to read this bill? There are numerous \nprovisions in this bill that were in neither the House nor the Senate \nbill. The implications of these provisions have not been fully \nexplored.\n  I wonder if Senators are aware that this bill gives broad authority \nto the Secretary of Agriculture to propose and implement commodity \npromotion programs without an initial congressional authorization. In \nfact, producers of any commodity could be assessed a mandatory tax \nunder this proposal for a period of 3 years before they ever get a \nchance to vote on the promotion program they have been forced to pay \ninto. This bill contains no protections for consumers in the event that \nagricultural processors wish to establish mandatory promotion programs \nand pass those costs directly on to consumers.\n  Are Senators aware that section 501 of this bill attempts to rewrite \n30 years of legislative history with respect to commodity promotion \nprograms in an effort to combat Federal court challenges to these \nprograms? Mr. President, that language was in neither the House nor the \nSenate bill and has not been the subject of hearings or debate in \neither Chamber of Congress. I want to make clear that the legislative \nfindings in section 501 of this bill are not indicative of the views of \nmore than a handful of farm bill conferees. Many of these findings, in \nfact, do not even make sense unless one is aware of the efforts of \ndissenting farmers to reform programs or are familiar with the first \namendment challenges to these programs. Indeed Mr. President, this bill \ncontains some very creative language intended to rewrite an already \nwell-established history as to the purpose and intent of these \nprograms.\n  I think this has been a shameful process, Mr. President, \nirresponsible to farmers, consumers and taxpayers, and completely \ninconsistent with our responsibilities to carry out a deliberative \nlegislative process.\n  It seems the Congress can't even decide what this farm bill is about. \nSince its inception, the name of this farm bill has changed 3 times. \nFirst we were told this bill was the freedom to farm bill. Then it \nbecame the Agricultural Market Transition Act--a name which perhaps \nmost accurately described the motivation of the sponsors of this \nlegislation: to transition farmers away from the basic safety net \nprovided by existing programs. Now, Mr. President, it is called the \nFederal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act, or FAIR. That name \ncreates a catchy, if not superficial, acronym, but is about as \ninaccurate a name as could be found. It presumes this bill represents \nboth reform and improvement of existing programs. In my opinion, this \nbill does neither.\n  Even the catchy acronym is a misnomer. To whom is this bill fair? I \ndon't see any fundamental fairness in this bill.\n  Is it fair to the average farmer to be given an ultimatum on the very \nprograms that help manage the vagaries of farming caused by factors \nbeyond his control? Because that is what many farmers in Wisconsin felt \nthey were given. They were told that Congress was going to eliminate \nfarm programs in any case, so they had better grab the money in these \ntransition payments while they can.\n  However, when some of these farmers argue in favor of the bill, they \nreally appear to be arguing for the maintenance of the safety net, not \nin favor of termination of these programs and the so-called transition \npayments. They argue that farm programs are critical in allowing family \nfarmers to secure credit. They argue that farm programs provide them \nwith the security to adopt forward-looking business plans. They argue \nthat without farm programs, the attrition rate in farming will only \nincrease while younger people will be unable to enter farming. I have \nnot heard substantive arguments in favor of eliminating the basic \nsafety net for farmers and replacing it with guaranteed but declining \npayments that aren't tied to market prices.\n  Is it fair to small farmers who rely more on the existence of farm \nprograms for their survival than larger corporate farms, that this \ndeclining pot of money is not targeted more toward their needs? This \nbill bases a farmers' payment on what he received in the past. Large \nfarmers continue to get large payments under this bill. How does that \nhelp small farmers transition away from their reliance on Federal \nprograms? The answer is, it doesn't, Mr. President.\n  This bill could have provided a tremendous opportunity to reform farm \nprograms by targeting limited Government funds to smaller farmers. \nWhile this bill takes some steps to reduce corporate welfare, Congress \ncould have made far greater reductions in the payment limitations. \nInstead the bill makes a slight reduction in the maximum deficiency \npayments one can receive but fails to eliminate loopholes that allow \nlarge farmers to get twice that amount. Eliminating loopholes and \nreducing payment limitations would have likely achieved greater Federal \nsavings in commodity programs than the commodity titles in the so-\ncalled FAIR Act without hurting America's family farms. Instead, this \nbill depletes the small pot of money for farmers by providing \ntransition payments in the same proportions as they are now provided. \nThat doesn't sound very fair to me.\n  Is this bill fair to taxpayers who will now be asked to provide \nannual checks to farmers even when market prices are good? The fact is \nthat these market transition payments cannot be justified on sound \nfiscal grounds. While this bill may save money over 7 years, based on \nCBO projections, it results in far greater costs in the next 2 years \nfor commodity program payments compared to current law. That is because \nwe don't make unnecessary payments under the current farm bill. \nGovernment costs are low when market prices are high. Existing programs \nmake payments to farmers only when market conditions are poor and farm \nincome is depressed. But market conditions are expected to be favorable \nin the next few years. Even so, the FAIR Act doles out the money to \nproducers even if they are making a profit through the marketplace. \nThis bill is fiscally irresponsible and fundamentally unfair to \ntaxpayers. USDA reports that, based on their estimates, taxpayers will \npay out $25 billion more to farmers under this bill than under current \nlaw. Every taxpayer should ask why they should pay farmers when market \nprices are high.\n\n  Is this bill fair to consumers when the most costly programs from \ntheir perspective, such as the sugar and peanut programs, are left \nfundamentally untouched? Is it fair that the program which has very \nlittle effect on consumer prices, the dairy price support program, is \nthe program eliminated in the name of consumer protection? Is it fair \nto consumers that this bill virtually ignores the aspects of Federal \nmilk marketing orders that do have a substantial impact on consumers--\nthat is the federally established\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nprices for fluid milk that are excessive in many parts of this country? \nNo, Mr. President. This bill is not fair to consumers, particularly on \ndairy policy. It is a fraud from the standpoint of consumer protection, \nmaking only token changes in the programs that most offend the \npocketbook.\n  In my opinion this bill should be called the unfair act of 1996 \nbecause it is most unjust to dairy farmers in the upper Midwest. \nFundamentally, this bill includes major provisions strongly opposed by \nthe upper Midwest dairy industry. This bill provides congressional \nconsent to the Northeast Dairy Compact and includes much of the House-\npassed Solomon amendment which the upper Midwest had opposed.\n  The provisions of the House-passed dairy amendment were improved \nsomewhat in the conference committee but are still devastating to \nAmerica's family dairy farmers. The House passed amendment reduced \ndairy farmer income by $4 billion over the next 7 years by eliminating \nthe price support program for milk. The conference agreement is \nexpected to cause only slightly less pain because the support level is \nnot reduced as much prior to program termination. However, the \nconference agreement eliminates the price support program in 1999 \nrather than 2000 as provided by the House bill.\n  It is ironic the dairy price support program is eliminated in this \nbill given that it was the lowest cost of all commodity programs in \nfiscal year 1995, except for no-net cost programs such as sugar and \ntobacco. The program cost less than $4 million in fiscal year 1995 \naccording to USDA. Interestingly, the no-net cost programs all operate \nunder strict supply control mechanisms in order to extract the support \nprice from consumers through higher market prices. The dairy price \nsupport program does not rely on supply control and has had little \nimpact on consumer prices unlike the sugar and peanut programs.\n  And yet, the dairy price support program is the only commodity \nprogram actually terminated in this legislation and dairy farmers the \nonly producers not provided with transition payments. Not only do \nproducers of other commodities continue to benefit from their \nunderlying programs maintained in this bill, but they also receive \nsizable transition payments annually.\n  As a result, most observers expect dairy farmers to suffer from a \nlarger decrease in family farm income than producers of any other \ncommodity affected by this bill. Producers of some other commodities \nwill actually enjoy income increases out of this so-called reform bill, \nat least in the next 2 years. But dairy farmers are asked to suffer.\n  Mr. President, I am baffled as to the reason why this was agreed to \nin this conference report. The dairy price support program has made \ngreat strides toward market orientation and operates truly as a safety \nnet. While the conference agreement authorizes a processor recourse \nloan program for dairy after price supports are terminated, such a \nprogram can merely act as a price stabilizer, not as a price support \nmechanism.\n  I am extremely concerned about the impact of terminating the price \nsupport program. Wisconsin loses over 1,000 dairy farmers annually. I \nam fearful that without a basic safety net, that rate will increase in \nthe coming years, particularly if the inequities of the Federal milk \nmarketing order system are not eliminated.\n  I have spoken often on the floor and to the Agriculture Committee \nabout the need to reform Federal orders to eliminate market \ndistortions, regional inequities, and consumer-related costs caused by \nexcessive class I differentials. Even Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman has conceded that Federal orders have created regional \ninequities and that upper Midwest producers have suffered as a result. \nI had hoped the farm bill process would ultimately provide for those \nmuch needed changes.\n  I am concerned, however, that this bill does not ensure that such \ndiscriminatory features will be eliminated. The House bill provided \nexceptionally limited reform of the Federal milk marketing order \nsystem, which is among the most outrageous commodity programs in \nexistence.\n  Unfortunately the minimal reforms in the House bill were made only \nslightly stronger by the conferees. The agreement requires the \nSecretary to reduce the existing number of orders to between 10 and 14. \nThat is certainly a step in the right direction. However, consolidation \nalone does not guarantee a fundamental restructuring of class I prices \nnor does it ensure that Eau Claire, WI will no longer be used as the \nbasing point for pricing milk. These should have been simple assurances \nto provide if the conferees were sincere in their reform efforts as \nsome claim.\n  The conference agreement appears to release the Secretary from \ncompliance with statutorily required class I differentials in the \nreform process, but provides no further guidance on what factors the \nSecretary is to consider in these deliberations. All too often, those \nfactors are political, not economic, and they do not work in our favor. \nThere is absolutely nothing in this bill to ensure that class I \ndifferentials will be reformed or substantially altered from their \ncurrent levels. In fact, the report language appears to specifically \nallow for an outcome in which reformed differentials are virtually the \nsame as the current excessive statutory minimums. I will work to ensure \nthat does not happen.\n  I think, however, that the greatest blow to the upper Midwest is the \ninclusion of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact in the conference \nagreement. The compact was not only defeated in the Senate, it was also \nexcluded from the House bill. Its emergence in the final conference \nagreement is outrageous and unconscionable. While many might contend \nthat the conference agreement provides a scaled back version of the \ncompact, I am still concerned about its ultimate approval, its \nprecedent, and its potential impact.\n  The conference agreement gives congressional consent to the compact \nsubject to the Agriculture Secretary's determination that it serves a \ncompelling public interest in the Northeast. I have a number of \nconcerns with this. First, while this may put some members at ease, I \ncaution those who think the Secretary of Agriculture will be more \nresilient against the political forces that came to bear upon the \nentire U.S. Congress and which resulted in the inclusion of this \nlanguage. Second, a finding of a compelling public interest in the \ncompact region is not an appropriate test for approval of this compact. \nThe U.S. Constitution requires Congress to approve interstate compacts \nin order to protect the national interest. We can assume that the \nStates agreeing to the compact have already determined that this is in \ntheir States' overall public interest. That test should be irrelevant. \nRather, Congress should be able to ensure that the compact serves a \ncompelling national public interest. I think the Northeast Dairy \nCompact would fail that test. Third, I think it is quite cowardly for \nthe Congress to abdicate its role in the approval of this very \ncontroversial compact by making the Secretary do the dirty work. \nAuthority for compact approval resides in the legislative branch, not \nthe executive branch. This is a congressional responsibility, and this \nbill shirks it.\n  That the term of congressional consent for the compact is tied to the \nimplementation of consolidated Federal orders, is somewhat of an \nimprovement over a compact of indefinite term. I would provide two \ncaveats to those who think this provides protection to dairy producers \nelsewhere, and in particular in the upper Midwest. First, once consent \nis provided, it will be easier to reinstate after expiration. Second, \nthe compact could remain in place much longer than the 3-year deadline \nfor implementation of order consolidation. Consolidation can be delayed \nif the Secretary is enjoined by a court order from implementing order \nchanges, thus providing continuing consent for the compact.\n  The conference agreement attempts to provide safeguards to prevent \nthe compact from interfering in interstate commerce by keeping \nnoncompact milk outside of its borders. However, the compact commission \nwill still be able to require that anyone buying milk from outside the \ncompact region pay the compact over-order price. That provision, \ncoupled with transportation costs, is still an extremely effective \nbarrier to trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep in mind that the fight over the compact \nwas not just about the regional walls it erected. It was also about the \nimpacts\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\nthe compact would have on national markets for milk and dairy products. \nAnd, Mr. President, the dairy compact will have impacts outside its \nregion. Increasing prices in the compact States, particularly to the \nlevels anticipated by those farmers, will cause increased production. \nThat production will likely spill over from fluid markets into \nmanufactured product markets. That will ultimately impact the base \nprice that all farmers receive for their milk, since prices nationwide \nare linked to prices for manufactured dairy products. In fact, the \nconference agreement neglected to include language contained in Senate \nJoint Resolution 28, ensuring that such production responses would not \nimpact the national market.\n  Furthermore, the conference agreement will allow the compact States \nto provide their processors with export subsidies so that they can \nexport their high cost product to other parts of the United States that \nare playing by the rules. This is the type of subsidy we are asking \nother countries to eliminate through our trade agreements, yet we are \ncreating our own domestic export subsidies through this compact.\n  The Senate made clear by voting down the compact during consideration \nof the farm bill that this type of price fixing compact is not \nacceptable. And yet here we are again, fighting the Northeast Dairy \ncompact. Having won this issue in the Senate we will now be forced to \nfight this administratively as well. And if it is approved \nadministratively, we will have to fight when the Northeast comes back \nto Congress seeking renewal of this consent. And finally, we will fight \nthis battle as other regions come to Congress looking for approval of \nsimilar price fixing agreements for dairy farmers in their regions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the New \nYork Times regarding the compact be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 23, 1996]\n\n                        Milk Sours the Farm Bill\n\n       A House-Senate conference committee has managed to tarnish \n     the most important farm bill in years by inserting a last-\n     minute provision for a New England milk cartel that would \n     gouge consumers and violate the free-market concept that has \n     made the 1996 farm bill worthwhile. The full House and Senate \n     need to excise this noxious favor to the New England dairy \n     lobby before approving the bill in voting set for next week.\n       The dairy interests achieved their victory in the \n     conference committee after failing to persuade either chamber \n     to enact such a proposal earlier. The conferees accepted the \n     bill's major reform, a seven-year phaseout of subsidies for \n     corn, wheat, rice and cotton. That could save billions \n     eventually and release farmers to make their own marketing \n     decisions free of government supervision. But the conferees \n     adopted a weak Senate provision that would reinstate the \n     subsidies after 2002 unless Congress again votes them out.\n       The conference committee also weakened the Government's \n     ability to preserve wetlands, something neither house had \n     done on its own. The committee wants to restrict the \n     Agriculture Department's valuable program to prevent \n     diversion of fishing streams that run through Federal land.\n       There were some environmental gains. At least $200 million \n     was approved to buy and restore major stretches of the \n     Florida Everglades. A program to encourage farmers not to \n     develop environmentally fragile land was renewed, as were \n     food stamp and nutrition programs. A program to help farmers \n     keep their animal waste and other pollutants from running off \n     into waterways was adopted.\n       But the regional milk monopoly is the very opposite of the \n     kind of reform this bill was meant to provide. The bill would \n     authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to permit the six New \n     England states to set high prices and erect tariff hurdles \n     against outside competition. That is totally alien to the \n     central idea of agriculture reform, which is to set loose the \n     forces of free-market competition.\n       How could such a backlash occur? The agriculture committees \n     of both Senate and House are dominated by farm and dairy \n     interests. By appointing conferees from this limited group, \n     Congressional leadership vests tremendous power with the \n     members least responsive to the current popular concern over \n     the environment and over consumer prices. The full Senate and \n     House can do better.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at the beginning of the 104th Congress I \nthought it inconceivable, given the deregulatory and market-oriented \nrhetoric of some of our Senate leaders, that the Northeast Dairy \nCompact would be granted approval. It is the antithesis of market \norientation. It seeks to protect agricultural producers in one \nparticular region by imposing artificially high costs on consumers.\n  In fact, this compact flies in the face of the rhetoric associated \nwith this very farm bill. I've heard so many Senators claim this bill \nallows farmers to make decisions based on the market, not on Government \npayments. But the compact attempts to insulate a small group of farmers \nfrom the very market conditions this bill embraces so tightly.\n  Mr. President, I am opposing this farm bill for the many reasons I \nhave outlined today. And I know this bill will pass. I intend to fight \nhard for the upper Midwest as both the Northeast compact and Federal \norder measures proceed through the administrative process. I will work \nwith Secretary Glickman to ensure that meaningful reform of Federal \nmilk marketing orders is implemented in a timely manner.\n  And if, as the minority leader has suggested, this is a 1 year farm \nbill, I will be back on this floor trying to improve dairy farmer \nincome which is so badly slashed in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on March 15, 1996, I wrote to Chairman \nLugar to express my concerns about the potential undermining of \nwetlands conservation provisions in the farm bill. Proposals to exempt \na vast number of wetlands from the Swampbuster Program and changes to \nthe definition of ``agricultural land'' for purposes of wetlands \ndelineations were among the specific concerns raised in my letter. I am \npleased to report that Chairman Lugar has responded to these concerns. \nA letter written by Chairman Lugar upon the completion of the \nconference states:\n\n       The bill makes no changes to the existing definition of a \n     wetland, and does not exempt any lands based solely on \n     cropping history or size. Although the report does define \n     ``agricultural lands'' for the purpose of implementation of \n     the interagency memorandum of agreement on wetlands \n     delineations, it does not amend Section 404 of the Clean \n     Water Act or require any changes to the 1987 Army Corps of \n     Engineers wetlands delineation manual.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter \ndated March 23, 1996, be printed in the Record following this colloquy. \nI congratulate Chairman Lugar and ranking member Leahy for their \nefforts in crafting a sound conservation title that will benefit the \nenvironment and the economy well into the next century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LUGAR. I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind \nwords. As I mentioned in the letter, I believe that this conference \nreport is the most environmentally responsive and responsible farm \nlegislation in our Nation's history. As chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Clean Water Act \nand the Federal Wetlands Program, Senator Chafee's support means a \ngreat deal to me.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,    \n                Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 1996.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \n         Dirksen 410, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chafee: Thank you for your letter of March 15 \n     in which you expressed interest in the conservation \n     provisions of the 1996 farm bill. I am pleased to report that \n     the Conferees agreed to what I feel is the most \n     environmentally responsive and responsible farm legislation \n     in our nation's history.\n       You specifically mentioned a concern that existing wetland \n     conservation provisions might be undermined in the farm bill. \n     In fact, the Conference agreement makes several common-sense \n     updates to the ``swampbuster'' compliance requirements that \n     will make the program more flexible for producers while still \n     protecting wetland functions and values. The bill makes no \n     changes to the existing definition of a wetland, and does not \n     exempt any lands based solely on cropping history or size. \n     Although the report does define ``agricultural lands'' for \n     the purpose of implementation of the interagency memorandum \n     of agreement on wetland deliberations, it does not amend \n     Section 404 of the Clean Water Act or require any changes to \n     the 1987 Army Corps of Engineers wetland delineation manual.\n       In other areas, the Conference agreement established the \n     new Environmental Quality\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\n     Incentives Program, which stands to make a significant \n     positive impact on water quality. In addition, the \n     Conservation Reserve Program and Wetlands Reserve Programs \n     are reauthorized through 2002, with new provisions that will \n     make the WRP more attractive to producers. Combined with the \n     new crop planting flexibility provisions in the commodity \n     title, these conservation efforts represent an impressive \n     commitment to addressing the potential adverse environmental \n     impacts of agricultural production. I know that, as Chairman \n     of the Environment and Public Works Committee, you can \n     appreciate the tremendous investment made in this new farm \n     bill. I hope you can enthusiastically support the Conference \n     Report when it is debated on the floor later this week.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard G. Lugar,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased that the conferees agreed to include a \nprovision in the bill that I originally authored regarding revenue \ninsurance. I and the farmers in my State truly believe that revenue-\nbased risk management tools are a vital resource for today's and \ntomorrow's American farmer as the weather, market, and global trading \npatterns continue to fluctuate and pose often unpredictable risks for \nfarmers worldwide.\n  The FAIR Act would require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to \noffer pilot revenue insurance programs for a number of crops for crop \nyears 1997 through 2000 so that by 2002 and the end of the production \nflexibility contracts provided under this bill, we will have well-\ntested revenue based risk management products available for farmers.\n  It is very important to note, however, that it was never my intent to \nrestrict the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation as it \ncurrently exists under law to conduct pilot programs. There are two \nrevenue insurance pilot programs currently operating for crop year \n1996. I, and I do not believe the conferees, intend for this new \nlanguage in any way to interfere with the operation or expansion of \nthese existing programs to other crops under the same terms and \nconditions under which they are currently operating. Rather, my intent \nwas to encourage the Corporation to expand current efforts to other \ncrops and speed the development of such products for the American \nfarmer. Does the chairman agree with this interpretation--that the FAIR \nAct language is not intended to restrict the existing authority of FCIC \nto approve pilot programs under similar terms as the 1996 revenue pilot \nprograms--for example on a whole State basis, although in a limited \nnumber of States?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes; I would agree that the conferees intended for this \nlanguage not to restrict FCIC authority to implement the revenue \ninsurance pilot program authorized by this Act.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the chairman. I strongly urge the Corporation \nto further experiment with revenue-based insurance products and to do \nso under similar terms and conditions represented by the 1996 crop year \nrevenue insurance programs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Federal Agricultural Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 eliminates the requirement that farmers buy \ncatastrophic crop insurance in order to participate in other USDA farm \nprograms. However, as I indicated in my letter to you on March 20, \nthere is some concern that language as drafted may not technically \ndelink the crop insurance purchase requirement for forage. The language \nin the bill delinks the crop insurance purchase requirement for crops \nplanted in spring of 1996. However, forage crops, as perennials, are \ntypically planted once every three or four years. Thus, forage crops \nwhich will be harvested in 1996 may have been planted several years \nago, and may not be captured by the language in the bill.\n  It is my understanding that it was the intent of the conference \ncommittee and the intent of this legislation to delink crop insurance \npurchase requirements for participation in other USDA programs for all \ncrops, including forage. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct. section 193(a)(2) of this bill is \nintended to allow delinkage of the purchase of catastrophic crop \ninsurance for all crops including forage harvested in 1996 and beyond. \nProducers of forage crops harvested in 1996 should be able to \nparticipate in all USDA programs without purchasing catastrophic crop \ninsurance, regardless of when that forage crop was planted. There was \nno intent to exclude forage from these delinkage provisions and the \nSecretary should interpret section 193(a)(2) as such.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I had hoped to be able to support the farm \nbill conference report. On balance, however, the conferees did not make \nenough improvements to the bill passed by the Senate for me to do so. \nIn several important ways, the conferees have made it worse. It is \nunfortunate that this Congress, overdue in completing action on a farm \nbill, has produced this bill in apparent haste to get something down.\n  The conferees have included a dairy title that treats milk producers \nvery differently from other agriculture sectors, and is potentially \ndamaging to Michigan milk producers. This bill reauthorizes the basic \ndairy price support program that we have today, but reduces the price \nsupport level from $10.35 per hundredweight [cwt.] in 1996 to $9.90/\ncwt. in 1999. Then, in the year 2000, the program is somehow to \nmagically transform into a recourse loan program. This type of \nexperimentation, without adequate consideration or hearings on its \neconomic effects, could seriously harm the dairy sector and producers \nincome, not to mention supply and price stability. I regret that the \nconferees did not incorporate more of the comprehensive and cost-\neffective Gunderson approach into the final product.\n  Further, the bill opens the door for establishment of the Northeast \nDairy compact, a door that we had closed in the Senate bill. It gives \nthe Secretary of Agriculture the authority to create the compact if he \nfinds a ``compelling public need in the [Northeast] region.'' This is a \nmistake and I will join efforts to repeal this provision if this bill \nbecomes law.\n  I have been open to producers' desire to increase their flexibility, \nin the context of Federal farm programs, so long as it has not required \ncrops like fruits and vegetables to unfairly compete against crops that \nreceive Federal price supports. This bill continues that protection, \nwhich is important for Michigan's diverse and productive fruit and \nvegetable sector. But, my colleagues and producers should remember why \nthe Federal Government has a farm program--our Nation needs a secure \nand stable supply of food. Producers have always had the flexibility to \nnot participate in these programs.\n  The contract payments in the bill may assist producers to achieve \ngreater flexibility and encourage them to be more sensitive to the \nmarket. But, I am still disturbed that the Government payments bear no \ndirect relation to market prices. Producers will receive these payments \nin times of high prices even though they are doing well. That makes no \nsense. There are no provisions for a safety net when prices drop. That \nmakes no sense either.\n  The managers of the bill have informed me that there is no \nrequirement that a contract payment recipient actually engage in \nfarming on contract acreage for the 7 years that the contract runs. At \na time when we are reforming welfare and emphasizing work, I find it \nunacceptable to give taxpayers dollars away to a producer or owner who \nmight decide to leave contract land fallow and still collect a tidy \nGovernment payment.\n  Simplification of Federal agriculture programs is generally a good \nidea. That is one positive concept in the bill before us, which I hope \nwill bear out in implementation. I am also pleased that this bill \ncontains most of the important conservation programs, particularly the \nConservation Reserve Program, and the trade, and research titles that \nwere included in the Senate bill. And, we have been able to prevent any \nserious damage to the sugar program.\n  In my judgement, however, Congress could and should have put together \na better farm bill than this one, and in a more timely way. The \nmajority should have put the farm bill higher up on its agenda so that \nwe would not be acting hastily now to give producers some direction on \nGovernment agriculture policy so far into the crop year. This bill \ncharts a controversial and uncertain course for 7 years. But, at least \nwe have retained permanent law so that Congress must revisit \nagriculture policy no later than 2002.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act.\n  Mr. President, I am one of only a few working farmers in Congress. \nHaving worked the land most of my life, I know, first hand, what it is \nlike to try to make a living under Federal farm programs. As my \ncolleagues began crafting a new farm bill, I believed we had an \nhistoric opportunity to change the way our farm sector operates while \nstill maintaining a strong commitment to conservation practices that \ntruly protect the environment.\n  Now that our work is complete, I can tell you that Congress is \nsteering the farm community in the right direction. Through the FAIR \nAct, farmers will no longer be told by someone in Washington what to \nplant, how much to plant and even how much not to plant. Farmers will \nnow have the freedom to make their own planting decisions based on \nmarket demands rather than mandates from Washington.\n  The age of micro managing the farm sector from a corner office at the \nUSDA is over. And it should be. The world has changed dramatically \nsince I first took over the farm from my father. Whether we like it or \nnot, NAFTA and GATT are now the law of the land. Fortunately, Congress \nrecognized this and crafted a farm bill that gives farmers the freedom \nto respond to these new market demands. Had Congress not done their job \nby producing the FAIR Act, farming in this country would have been left \nbehind in the cold.\n  This farm bill also goes a long way toward protecting the \nenvironment. Mr. President, it only makes common sense that farmers \nwould support strong conservation practices because a healthy \nenvironment is essential to a good harvest. As a matter of fact, the \nconservation title attracted strong bipartisan support because it \nreauthorized and expanded the Wetlands Reserve Program and the \nConservation Reserve Program and created new conservation initiatives \nlike the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. Through strengthening \nthe conservation title, this Congress has proven our commitment to \nprotecting the environment while allowing farmers to make a living from \ntheir land.\n  I am proud of the work done by my colleagues in both the Senate and \nthe House. Senator Lugar, Representatives Roberts, and the conferees \nhave produced a farm bill like no other in the history of this Nation \nand they should be commended for it.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in many ways this farm legislation is \nhistoric. In my 23-plus years as a member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, I have never been faced with so many changes in the overall \nstructure of American agriculture--and, in large measure, for the \nbetter most of America and the farmers of this country.\n  I doubt that anymore seriously imagined that this Congress could \nsucceed in streamlining agriculture programs and increasing the \neffectiveness of agriculture. This bill includes reforms to most of the \nmajor commodity programs, including peanuts, cotton, dairy, feed \ngrains, and wheat.\n  In my home State of North Carolina, agriculture has long been a \nleading industry, providing jobs and economic opportunity for countless \nsmall family farmers and their communities. This legislation will give \nNorth Carolina's farmers stability for at least next 7 years while \nremoving the strong arm of government controls over our commodity \nprograms. It will ease the strain on rural America.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the two chairman for undertaking these \nmarket-oriented reforms that will unquestionably help the family \nfarmers adapt and adjust to 21st century. As a former chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee, I know and understand the difficult and \npainstaking process that has consumed weeks and months.\n  I am convinced that this farm bill will help farmers become more \nproductive, and will continue to save tax dollars and it will improve \nthe rural environment.\n  At a time when the Federal debt has climbed beyond the 5 trillion \ndollar mark, Congress owes it to the farmers and taxpayers of this \ncountry not to enact a meaningless temporary solution, but to establish \na sound new policy of agricultural reform.\n  That is what happened, and I, for one, believe both Agriculture \nCommittees, House and Senate pursued the real reforms that were needed. \nIn that, I am proud of the peanut farmers of my State and other States \nfor embracing a no net cost program and sacrificing close to $500 \nmillion out of their pockets to contribute to balancing the Federal \nbudget in 7 years. In order to save the peanut program we all had to \nsacrifice, but in the end, this bill retains the peanut program and \nreforms it to make it more efficient for the farmers and less costly \nfor taxpayers.\n  This bill offers a future to the farmers of America, who can now wake \nup everyday and knowing what their future payments will be. The \ntaxpayers will know how much of their money will be spent. U.S. \nagriculture now has a future--our farmers have a future.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to offer my full support \nfor the farm bill conference report. I believe this bill, carefully \ncrafted after many months of hard work and compromise, will offer much \nneeded stability to farmers across America. In addition, it symbolizes \na new path for our agricultural industries, leading us away from the \nDepression-era policies of the past and towards a freer, more flexible \nsystem which will empower our farmers to face the challenges of the \n21st century.\n  I am particularly pleased and supportive of the conservation and \nnutrition components of the bill, which I believe illustrates the \nstrong bi-partisan collaborative work that crafted this compromise. The \nenvironmental provisions will help farmers protect agricultural lands \nthrough specific appropriations that will conserve farmland from \ndevelopment. With my homestate of Colorado facing a tremendous growth \nin population, this will enhance the precious preservation of private \nland, open space and wildlife habitat from developers and subdivisions. \nIn addition, by recognizing the inexorable ties between agriculture and \nwater, this bill will provide much needed support to farmers to help \nprotect our water supplies and maintain water quality.\n  I also want to congratulate the managers of this bill--Senators Lugar \nand Leahy, and the conferees in maintaining and extending the Food \nStamp Program. This will reiterate the commitment of the Federal \nGovernment to families, women and children that rely on this vital \nprogram for their daily subsistence. I know there are many issues that \nstill need to be resolved for welfare reform legislation, but I am glad \nthat the farm bill recognizes the importance of the Food Stamp Program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude my statement by reiterating \nthe fundamental importance of agriculture to my homestate of Colorado's \neconomy, environment, and identity. The importance of this bill to my \nconstituents is tremendous, and I hope these dramatic reforms will \nbreathe new life into the farms of America to revitalize the industry \nfor the next century.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as you know, every 5 years Congress \nundertakes a rewrite of farm legislation. Some years this process is \nrelatively painless, some years it is more difficult. Farm programs are \nbipartisan efforts, with both sides working to achieve the best result \npossible for the nations farmers.\n  This year has proven to be the most contentious, hard fought farm \nbill in memory. I am fortunate, through seniority, to have become a \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Committee--the first Senator from \nVirginia, I might add, in nearly 30 years.\n  For close to 1 year the Agriculture Committee has been working \ndiligently to craft a new farm bill for our country. On September 30 of \nthis past year, the old farm bill expired. Under the necessary budget \nchanges and spending priorities that we set forth, a large portion of \nthe farm bill was part of the Balanced Budget Act that Congress passed \nand sent to the President. The President, unfortunately for America, \nvetoed it. This veto created a critical problem for U.S. agriculture.\n  The problem is that commodity support programs for the next 7 years \nwere wiped out with the President's veto of the Balanced Budget Act. \nExisting authority for those programs had expired. All the remain are \noutdated statutes from 1938 and 1949.\n  The solution required action. Chairman Lugar skillfully negotiated \nthe regional and political obstacles that\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\ncould have doomed this effort. Certainly, there are areas still to be \naddressed and work to be done. But today we take a major step forward \nin farm policy--a step toward the future.\n  Mr. President, the farm bill debate is a microcosm of the larger \ndebate we have witnesses over the balanced budget. It represents a \nstruggle with those who are comfortable with the status-quo, who want \nto continue the failed policies of big government intervening in \npeople's lives and dictating their decisions. We are ending Washington \ncontrol of farm policy.\n  Reformed farm policy is one step towards our goal of smaller \ngovernment and a balanced budget. But, as you know, this is a new \ndirection. Even the name of this bill--the Agricultural Reform and \nImprovement Act--indicates the direction toward which farmers want to \ngo.\n  Briefly, this farm bill will accomplish several things. The bill will \nreform and modernize farm programs; provide a more certain income \nsafety net for farmers through direct payments; strengthen conservation \nprograms; and, provide broad planting flexibility.\n  In short, we give farmers what they want--greater flexibility and \nfreedom from Government intervention. Farmers like the plan because it \nis good for the bottom line. Support is broad because it will have the \nmost positive impact on farm income. The plan is simple, certain and \nefficient. It eliminates layers of bureaucracy and accompanying \nregulations. Best of all, this bill shifts decision making from \nWashington back to the farm.\n  The bill calls for the end of Government planting controls. It \nprovides an entirely new outlook for American agriculture, which I find \nvery exciting both as a member of the Committee responsible for farm \npolicy and as somebody who has owned and operated a farm.\n  The plan is simple, in contrast to the needless complexity of current \nprograms.\n  It offers certainty. Farmers will know what their future payments \nwill be. Taxpayers will know how much these programs will cost. U.S. \nagriculture will have more security against future budget cuts.\n  Finally, it is market oriented. Farmers' payments will be the same \neven if they choose to plant alternate crops. Producers' planting \ndecisions will be based on the market--as these decisions should be. \nUnder this bill there will be planting freedom, not arbitrary \ngovernment controls.\n  This bill is good for the environment. It strenghtens conservation \nprograms, enhances wetlands protection, and emphasizes improving water \nquality, which is of critical importance to Virginia and the Chesapeake \nBay.\n  This bill's agricultural provisions are a long-term plan endorsed by \na broad spectrum of agricultural groups, including, in my State, the \nVirginia Farm Bureau and the Virginia Agribusiness Council. Let us be \nclear: U.S. producer and agribusiness organizations nationwide support \nthis plan. We owe it to those who work in agriculture in our respective \nStates--not to those who would dictate farm policy from behind a desk--\nto pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, I have heard many Senators lament the delay in \nenacting a new Farm Bill. While this bill is a few months late--due in \nlarge part to President Clinton's veto of the balanced budget bill--the \nreforms it contains are years overdue.\n  I am proud to have participated in this historic legislation during \nmy first term as a member of the Agriculture Committee. And I commend \nChairman Lugar and his able staff on a job well done.\n\n\n                              section 389\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, section 389 comes as a result of many hours \nof negotiations involving the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. \nForest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and various Members \nof Congress. The language agreed to by the conference committee is a \nstep forward in an effort to ensure that the Forest Service does not \ntake water from existing users without providing proper compensation.\n  My amendment, as modified by the conference committee, provides for \nan 18-month moratorium on any U.S. Forest Service decision to require \nbypass flows or any other relinquishment of the unimpaired use of a \ndecreed water right as a condition of renewal or reissuance of a land \nuse permit. Nothing in this section changes current law regarding the \nallocation of water or rights to the use of water, and the expiration \nof the moratorium is not intended to be a recognition or grant of \nauthority to the Forest Service for imposition of bypass flows.\n  The amendment also creates a water rights task force to study, make \nrecommendations, and report back to the Congress and the administration \non questions of: First, whether, and the manner in which, a Federal \nwater right should be acquired by the U.S. Forest Service for minimum \ninstream flow, environmental and watershed management purposes on the \nNational Forests domain either through purchase from or a lawful \nexchange of valuable consideration with a willing seller; second, \nmeasures, if any, deemed to be necessary to protect the free exercise \nand use of decreed non-Federal water rights which require land use \nauthorization permits from the U.S. Forest Service; and third, the \nlegal and economic effects of creating a Federal environmental water \nright upon existing state laws, regulations, and customs of water usage \nand measures that would be useful in avoiding or resolving conflicts \nwith any regulatory taking of a valuable decreed water right pursuant \nto conditions for the reissuance of a special use permit.\n  This language is intended to reaffirm the fact that for over 150 \nyears, the United States has followed a policy of deferring to State \nlaws governing the use and allocation of water in the western United \nStates. As the Supreme Court observed in California v. United States, \n438 U.S. 645, 653 (1978):\n\n       The history of the relationship between the Federal \n     Government and the States in the reclamation of the arid \n     lands of the Western States is both long and involved, but \n     through it runs the consistent thread of purposeful and \n     continued deference to state water law by Congress.\n\n  It is also necessary to understand that national forests were created \nto protect and allow water uses, not as an excuse to take water away \nfrom people that have been using it for decades. The national forests \nwere created pursuant to the Organic Administration Act of 1897, 16 \nU.S.C. 481, which explicitly provides for the use of water from \nnational forests for domestic, mining, milling, or irrigation purposes. \nIn United States v. New Mexico, 438 U.S. 696 (1978), the United States \nSupreme Court rejected claims by the Forest Service that the Organic \nAdministration Act authorized the assertion of claims to the use of \nwater for fishery and other secondary purposes of the national forests. \nThe Supreme Court held that the Organic Administration Act was enacted \nby Congress ``principally as a means of enhancing the quantity of water \nthat would be available to the settlers of the arid west.'' The Court \nrejected the Forest Service claims to the use of water for secondary \npurposes because they would defeat the purpose for which the national \nforests were created, in part because these claims would result in a \ngallon-for-gallon reduction in the water supply available for use by \nfarmers and cities in the West. The bypass flows that the Forest \nService now wants to require are for the same secondary purposes, and \nwould result in the same, or even greater, losses of water by existing \nusers.\n\n  The assignment of land management functions to a Federal agency in \nand of itself does not provide an appropriate legal basis for assertion \nof water rights by Federal agencies to preempt State law with regard to \nthe expropriation of already existing decreed water rights. The \nenactment of the Multiple Use and Sustained Yield Act [MUSYA], 16 \nU.S.C. 528-31, and the Federal Land Policy Management Act [FLPMA], did \nnot change or expand the primary purposes for which the national forest \nlands are to be managed pursuant to the Organic Administration Act. In \nfact, the National Forest Management Act [NFMA] expressly provides that \nany change in land use authorizations ``shall be subject to valid \nexisting rights,'' 16 U.S.C. 1604(i). In addition, sections 701 (g) and \n(h) of the Federal Land Policy Management Act [FLPMA] contain explicit \nsavings provisions regarding the management and use of water, \nspecifically disclaiming any delegation of authority to ``affect'' the \nuse of water. The provisions make\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nit clear that these acts create no new Federal authority over the use \nor water, and most certainly do not authorize the imposition of bypass \nflows on existing facilities.\n  It is also important to recognize that any Federal claims to water \nfor the Organic Administration Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act \n[FLPMA], National Forest Management Act [NFMA], or other Federal \npurposes, whether based upon appropriative rights, riparian rights or \nreserved rights, must be asserted and established pursuant to the \nMcCarran amendment, 43 U.S.C. 666.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask that the Senate act favorably to \npass the conference report to H.R. 2854, the Agricultural Market \nTransition Act, which includes my amendment containing the subject \nmoratorium and task force language. I would hope that in the coming 18 \nmonths an agreement will be reached on this subject--an agreement which \nwill ensure the adequate protection of western water.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in supporting the \nfinal passage of the conference report for the farm bill, and \napplauding the efforts the members of the Senate and House Agriculture \ncommittees. In particular, I call attention to the efforts of Senator \nCraig, coauthor of the compromise which this body adopted a few weeks \nago, and which formed the basis for the bill we are adopting today.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important step forward for our \nNation's agricultural policy. For Idaho's farmers, it means the freedom \nto have the Federal Government off their backs and out of their \ntractors. For the first time in a century, they will be able to plant \ncrops according to the market, instead of according to Uncle Sam's \noutdated policies. The 7 year contracts and loan programs provided in \nthe bill give farmers the safety net they need to make this transition.\n  Under the bill, Idaho's wheat farmers will have the security to \nanalyze market demands. Idaho's growing dairy industry will be better \nprepared to take their place in the world market. And Idaho's sugarbeet \ngrowers will be in an excellent position to compete as domestic market \nrestrictions are removed.\n  This bill grants agricultural producers the freedom to meet the \ndemands of growing international markets. They will be able to step \nback and look at their crop rotation plans, and to try new and \ninnovative crops that might not have been allowed under the old \nprograms. Some of those new crops may well prove to be the solution to \nsoil erosion, or a dependable alternative source of income. Such \nindividual innovation and specialization were not possible under the \nold bureaucratic dictates.\n  Mr. President, this bill is important because of what is changes, but \nit is also important for what it strengthens, and that is our Nation's \ncommitment to research and international trade development. Of all the \nconcerns raised by Idaho's farmers since we began debate on the bill, \ncommitment to research and international trade has been at the top of \ntheir list.\n  Under the new rural development provisions, and specifically through \nthe agriculture competitiveness initiative, we will see a strengthened \nagriculture research program, the key to our Nation's strong food \nsupply system. This research program will encourage the development and \napplication of new technologies, such as the precision farming research \nbeing conducted at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho \nFalls.\n  The bill also maintains a strong commitment to international market \ndevelopment programs. So long as our Nation's agriculture producers \nface subsidized competition in our foreign markets, we will need to \nensure that our producers are in a position to meet that challenge. We \nhave maintained the Export Enhancement Program and the Market Promotion \nProgram, and elevated the Foreign Market Development Program to an \nindependent status. These programs are vital tools for Idaho \ncommodities, such as wheat, beans, peas, and lentils, to help them \ndevelop their overseas markets.\n  The bill also removes needless burdens and provides important \nincentives. It eliminates the requirement that farmers sign up for crop \ninsurance and encourages private insurance companies to fill the gap. \nIt streamlines current USDA conservation programs, and provides new \nincentives to help farmers achieve these national goals. I am \nparticularly pleased to see that successful conservation programs, \nincluding the Conservation Reserve Program and the Wetlands Reserve \nProgram, will continue to be a tool to protect the environment and \nprovide habitat for wildlife.\n  Agriculture is Idaho's No. 1 industry. Its diversity forms the \nfoundation for the rest of the State's economy. There is still work to \nbe done to remove regulatory and tax burdens on farmers, these small-\nbusiness people who are the stewards of our Nation's open spaces. This \nincludes our efforts to reform the Delaney clause and its unrealistic \nlimitations on pesticide tolerances, and to remove disincentives to re-\nregistration of minor crop pesticides. But this farm bill is the first \nstep to bringing Idaho's and the Nation's farmers into the 21st century \nand I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first let me express my sincere admiration \nand respect for the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nLugar of Indiana. Senator Lugar is a man of vision and reason with \nrespect to our nation's agricultural policies, and the Senate is \nfortunate to have a man of his caliber as Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee. It is an extremely challenging position, due to the \npleadings of numerous regional and narrowly-focused agricultural groups \nthat descend in droves upon the Congress every 5 years. They urgently \nrequest more and more Federal aid, lest the extent of their taxpayer-\nfunded subsidies, price supports, and grant programs stray too far from \nthe status quo.\n  A Senate that is split between Members dedicated to fiscal \nresponsibility, and those equally dedicated preserving virtually every \naspect of Federal largesse, is not a promising forum for a boldly \nreformist farm bill. For those of us that were hoping for a \nsignificantly less costly, less expansive farm bill, this is deeply \nregrettable. I cannot support a massive new farm bill that does little \nto lighten the heavy burden that price supports and farm programs have \nlong placed on taxpayers, and I will oppose this conference report.\n  Mr. President, the unprecedented election of 1994 has been \ninterpreted in many ways; its signals meant different things to the \ndiverse Members of this body, and among the luminous commentators who \npurport their views to represent the pulse of the masses. My personal \nbeliefs about what the American people are calling for often run head-\non into the resistance of this body. I can, however, confidently convey \nmy judgment about one meaning of the November, 1994 election without \nreservation. Clearly, the new Congress was not empowered to cautiously \npiece together an expensive array of farm programs, and pass the bill \nto taxpayers. This Congress was not directed to timidly wander among \nagricultural special interest groups and seek a consensus that would \noffend no one. No one, of course, except for taxpayers, who unknowingly \nwill be stuck with the bill.\n  I oppose this conference report with regret. I supported H.R. 1541 \nwith the understanding that it would actually reduce the cost of farm \nprograms by 15%. The Senate-passed version of S. 1541 was widely \ndescribed as a substantial reduction of spending on farm subsidies. I \nalso hoped that the House would make further reductions and fiscally \nresponsible reforms. I was mistaken. This conference report contains \nalmost $50 billion in direct farm subsidies over the next seven years, \nand in its entirety will cost taxpayers close to $70 billion over that \ntime. If any savings are achieved they will be modest, and I am all too \nfamiliar with the outcome of previous farm bills, which routinely cost \nbillions more than anticipated.\n  This is simply unacceptable, Mr. President. We are acquiescing to the \nwell-organized interests who are satisfied with nothing but a bigger \ntrough from which to feed.\n  At a time when Congressional overspending has already rung up a $5 \ntrillion dollar debt; and when we must fight the administration and its \nfree-spending allies every step of the way for even the most modest \nrestraints on spending, a $70 billion farm bill is simply indefensible. \nI cannot justify voting\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nfor such a bill to my constituents in Arizona, who this year must work \nfive months a year just to pay their taxes!\n  The logic of passing a new, $70 billion farm bill escapes me, Mr. \nPresident, but I think it will prove positively unfathomable to most \nAmericans. A large segment of the Congress seems to operate in a world \ncompletely disconnected from any sense of urgency about deficit \nspending. News reports which mindlessly turn reductions in increases \ninto life-threatening cuts--as we saw with the School Lunch Program \nlast year--cynically feed this atmosphere. This manipulative shell game \nwill go on and on, I'm sure, until a decisive majority of the \nCongress--with the support of a President who has the courage to lead--\nstands up and simply says, ``Enough!''\n  To the contrary, this conference report--and this Administration--\ncontinues to say: ``No problem.''\n  Just last week the Washington Post had a prominent story about how \nthe fiscal year 96 deficit will be dramatically lower than expected. It \nwill undoubtedly bolster the administration's confidence in striving \nfor billions more in domestic spending. Of course, there was no mention \nin the article about how this year's cheery, refreshingly low deficit \nmeans that at best, the Federal Government will spend $400 million more \neach day than it takes in. This farm bill will keep the tab on that \ncredit card rolling along with respect to agricultural spending for the \nnext 7 years.\n  During the initial Senate debate on the 1996 farm bill, I was \noptimistic that the freedom to farm concept of decoupling farmers from \nbureaucratic crop controls would be a ground-breaking, cost-effective \nreform. It has not turned out that way. With this conference report, \nfarmers do get a freedom to farm, but lurking just below its surface is \nthe same, dusty maze of permanent price subsidies that the Congress \npurportedly wanted to move away from.\n  Let me point out several other areas where this conference report has \nstumbled badly away from the Senate bill I supported. First, it has \nseveral dairy provisions which boggle the mind of anyone interested in \ncost-efficient, pro-market farm policies. The Northeast Dairy Compact--\na price control consortium reminiscent of the very best of Soviet block \nagricultural policies--is given new life despite being previously \nrejected by the Senate. Furthermore, this conference report will allow \ndairy interests in the State of California to impose a new trade \nbarrier on out-of-state milk. California's price-enhancing dairy \nregulations jack up milk prices for its nearly 30 million consumers, \nand they will now be codified in Federal law to shield California's \ndairy industry from fair and open competition. The California solids-\nadded provision is incontestably anti-competitive, anti-market, and \ndefinitely anti-consumer. However, even in 1996, those dubious \nattributes are not enough to exclude them from being tucked into a farm \nbill.\n\n  There are many more areas of great concern for me in this measure. A \nnew, $300 million-a-year rural development program--added at the behest \nof the administration--was the subject of some thirty seconds of debate \nin the Senate; There is a $360 million grant program for private \ngrazing lands; a $600 million grant program for livestock activities; \n$360 million for a new twist on the Market Promotion Program. And, of \ncourse, cherished, old standbys like the sugar and peanut programs.\n  Let me emphasize, Mr. President, I support providing a credible level \nof truly-needed assistance to farmers in America. I would oppose \npulling the rug out from under them with a complete elimination of farm \nprograms. Many agricultural producers in Arizona have relied on price \nsupport programs, and dozens of rural communities in my State have \ngreatly benefitted from important rural development initiatives. We \nshould continue meritorious farm programs that work, and that also \ncomply with the fiscal discipline necessary to balance the budget.\n  I want to express my gratitude to Senator Lugar for preserving an \namendment that will assist Native American community colleges. Indeed, \nI recognize that if Senator Lugar was able to fully develop all of his \nideas for federal agricultural policies, our country would be in much \nbetter shape. I regret that his best efforts have been dissipated by \ninterests unwilling to yield in their defense of a status quo we can no \nlonger afford.\n  I cannot support a massive package of $70 billion in agricultural \nspending at a time when the administration and the Congress has been \nunwilling to stem the tide of deficit spending. It represents too \nlittle real reform, not enough relief for taxpayers, and too much \ntoleration of business as usual.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconference report on the the farm bill. While I strongly favor some \naspects of the bill, I have serious reservation about the 7-year \ncontract and the dairy provisions.\n  This bill ends the system of giving subsidies to farmers when market \nprices drop. Instead farmers sign a 7-year contract to get annual \nmarket transition payments regardless of market conditions. I support \nmoving to a market oriented farm policy. However, I think it is wrong \nto pay farmers regardless of market conditions and I strongly oppose \npaying farmers when they do not plant a crop. In times when commodity \nprices are high, such as now, farmers will receive big checks they do \nnot need, in bad years farmers will receive little or no support.\n  I also oppose giving the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to \nimplement the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. This provision allows \nsix States more leeway in setting their own prices. I think we need to \ntake a good look at our current system of dairy price supports and move \ndairy along with the other commodities into a realistic market oriented \nsystem.\n  I support the conservation provisions put forward in this bill which \nemphasize land management options for farmers and livestock producers, \nnot simply land retirement, to reduce the harmful environmental and \neconomic impacts of agriculture activities. For example, the bill \nauthorizes the Environmental Quality Incentives Program [EQIP] which \ncombines the functions of several current conservation programs into \none voluntary incentive and cost-share program for crop and livestock \nproducers. I am pleased that the bill channels additional needed funds \nto rural development and agricultural research programs through the \nFund for Rural America.\n  I do not believe this bill is good public policy. I am concerned it \nwill cost us more to phase into the new program than to maintain \ncurrent law. And finally, I also feel that the Congress will be forced \nto return to this issue as soon as less favorable market conditions \nreturn for farmers.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my opposition to \nthe 1996 farm bill. Although the conferees have worked hard on this \nlegislation and have obtained many good things for rural America, \noverall the bill is a bad bill, it is bad policy, and it is bad for the \nsmall family farmer in South Carolina. With this bill, Congress isn't \nthe goose that laid the golden egg. It's the goose that is laying the \nrotten egg. And like rotten eggs, this bill stinks.\n  As I said, this farm bill does have some positive aspects. We \nestablish the Fund for Rural America to infuse $300 million into \nresearch and rural development--something that South Carolina and other \nrural States can definitely use. We create a new Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program that will help smaller farms with conservation \nprojects.\n  We also reauthorize the Conservation Reserve Program, a program which \nis extremely popular among farmers and which improves millions of \nhighly erodible acres across the country. Finally, we reauthorize \nseveral nutrition programs for 7 years. I am disappointed that the \nconference committee chose to reauthorize food stamps for only 2 years, \nbut I hope we will revisit this issue soon.\n  Despite the few good portions in this farm bill, it remains bad farm \npolicy. Here's how absurd the bill is. Instead of the current price \nsupport system in which we help farmers recover their losses with \ndeficiency payments, this bill allows the Government to pay farmers in \neach of the next 7 years--regardless of whether they have a good or bad \nyear, regardless of whether they plant anything at all or regardless of \nmarket prices. Do you know what that means to the budget? It means \nwe'll\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nhave to spend a lot more money than we currently spend on farm \nprograms. It is estimated that this farm bill will cost the taxpayers \nan additional $4 billion over the next 2 years compared to current law. \nThe current system works--why fix it? Current law provides that farmers \ndo not receive Government subsidies in good years. But under this bill, \nwe'll essentially give farmers a bonus in good years--like this year. \nThat makes no sense to me in this environment of fiscal responsibility \nin which everybody and his brother is trying to find ways to save \nmoney.\n  The small family farmer--especially the South Carolina farmer--comes \nunder attack in this wrong-minded legislation. Through this bill, \npayments to farmers will decline over the next 7 years. But farming, \nlike history, occurs in cycles. This bill doesn't take the cyclical \nnature of farming into account. Over the next 7 years, prices almost \ncertainly will decrease from the high prices we now enjoy. But, at the \nend of this 7-year farm bill, prices likely will be low at the same \ntime that payments are low. In other words, farmers who might be living \nhigh on the hog now will be scraping to make ends meet later on. I am \nworried that this will have catastrophic effects on the small farmer in \nmy State and that many small farmers will have no choice but to harvest \ntheir fields for the last time.\n  And that, in turn, could lead to the expansion of corporate farming. \nWhile I do believe there is a place for corporate farming, I don't \nbelieve that their successes should come at the detriment of small \nfamily farms. These folks, including many of my friends in Mullins, \nDillon, Manning, Kingstree, Bamberg, Hampton, Orangeburg, and \nCharleston, have faithfully cultivated their land for many years. I \nbelieve they should be able to continue their profession, not be forced \nout of it by ill-conceived legislation. This bill is shortsighted. Down \nthe road, it will hurt farmers.\n\n  Mr. President, we should have passed a farm bill last year and farm \npolicy should never have been considered as part of the budget package. \nThe hour, however, is late. Farmers need to know where they stand for \nthe coming crop year. For this reason, I understand that the Secretary \nof Agriculture has reluctantly recommended that the President sign this \nlegislation, and that the President has agreed to sign it with serious \nhesitation. The President, however, also has indicated that he will \ncontinue to work with Democrats in the Congress to propose more farmer \nfriendly legislation next year. I look forward to working with the \nPresident on this issue because, as sure as I stand here today, I \nguarantee that this farm bill won't be around for the 7 years it \nstipulates.\n  The so-called freedom to farm concept has been flawed from the start. \nThis piece of legislation, although it may have a different name, \nfollows in the same disastrous direction. I refuse to turn my back on \nthe family farmers of South Carolina and I believe it is wrong for us \nto pay money to farmers when they do not need it. As a result, I will \nvote against the farm bill this afternoon. I look forward to revisiting \nthis issue again next year.\n  I thank the chair.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, In many important ways, this farm bill is a \ngood bill for Illinois. While it is not a perfect bill, I'm pleased to \nsee that some of the most meaningful programs were protected. The bill \noffers farmers limited certainty in the area of income protection and \nprovides a safety net for farmers in future years. In addition, it \nimproves conservation efforts and reauthorizes important nutrition \nprograms, as well as trade and research titles.\n  Illinois is second only to Iowa in soybean production, with 9.7 \nmillion acres planted to soybeans. Exports for soybeans and soybean \nproducts totaled $7.9 billion in 1995, making soybeans the largest \nexport, in terms of value, in U.S. agriculture.\n  This bill raises the marketing loan rate for soybeans to 85 percent \nof an Olympic 5-year average, with a ceiling of $5.26 per bushel. \nDespite a 3-percent annual growth in world demand for vegetable oil and \nprotein meal, U.S. oilseed acreage has declined by 17 percent since \n1979. This slight increase in the marketing loan rate creates some \nincentive for soybean production here at home, which helps our trade \nbalance.\n  The bill also retains permanent law for farm programs. Agriculture \npolicy should protect family farms as well as consumers. The original \nfreedom to farm proposal eliminated permanent law for farm programs, \nallowing no safety net past the year 2002. Through the leadership of \nSenator Daschle, Democratic Members of the Senate were able to \nguarantee a safety net for farmers in year 7.\n  I strongly object to language in the bill giving the Secretary of \nAgriculture authority to implement the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact and will work to see that it is not implemented. Dairy farmers \nin the Midwest cannot compete against this kind of regional price \nfixing. It is bad policy, legally questionable and the Senate voted to \nremove it from the Senate bill.\n  In addition, we are making a big mistake authorizing the safe meat \nand poultry inspection panel. The role of the panel is to delay \nimplementation of proposed meat inspection regulations. We need to \nmodernize our meat and poultry inspection system and speed up efforts \nto implement the proposed hazard analysis and critical control point \nsystem, not set up road blocks to improving the system. Meat and \npoultry inspection is a human health issue. At a time when the world is \nfacing serious food safety problems, such as the British beef crisis, \nthe rejection of United States poultry imports to Russia due to \nSalmonella contamination and the E. coli disaster in the United States, \nit is simply irresponsible and shortsighted to be stalling efforts to \nimprove the system. I will work with my Democratic colleagues to \nprevent funds from being appropriated for the panel.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote against the farm bill \nconference report. I believe that the farm bill, in its present form, \ngoes against the true purpose of a farm bill--to help America's \nfarmers. While I support the reauthorization of the Conservation \nReserve Program and other conservation and nutrition programs, I do not \nbelieve this bill is in Maryland's interests.\n  I realize that spring planting is fast approaching, but that is no \nreason to be forced into accepting a bill that will hurt Maryland \nfarmers and the Maryland industries that depend on our farmers. This \nbill does just that.\n  I believe that the Freedom to Farm Act, included in this bill, will \nhave harmful long-term effects on the family farmer in Maryland. This \nbill puts the family farm up for sale. The bill does not provide a \nstrong enough safety net for farmers. Setting a flat subsidy rate, then \nremoving it in 7 years, without allowing flexibility during extreme \neconomic conditions or natural disasters, is dangerous for farmers in \nMaryland and across the country. Under this conference agreement, \nproducers will be paid even when prices are high, but will not receive \nnecessary protection when prices are low.\n  I am particularly concerned that this bill continues and expands the \nSugar Price Support Program to the detriment of cane refiners such as \nDomino in my hometown of Baltimore. This sugar program jeopardizes the \nfuture of the cane refining industry. It provides additional protection \nto domestic growers that would increase the price of raw cane sugar and \nput Domino and its 600 employees out of business. This is totally \nunacceptable. Sugar cane refining is one of the few manufacturing \nindustries still left in our inner cities. The farm bill conference \nreport threatens Domino's future. I see no reason why a farm bill must \nthreaten an entire industry.\n  Also of deep concern to me is the fact that this bill reauthorizes \nthe Food Stamp Program for only 2 years. What happens to Maryland's \npoor after that? To add insult to injury, while it provides a helping \nhand to the most impoverished in our communities for only 2 years, this \nbill guarantees corporate welfare to huge agribusiness for 7 years.\n  During this Congress, we have debated the issue of a balanced budget. \nWe need a balanced budget, and I regret that we have not succeeded this \nyear in finding consensus and the sensible center on a plan to \neliminate the deficit. This bill will make this task even more \ndifficult. Originally designed to save billions of dollars, this \nconference report will end up costing\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nthe American people an extra $1.3 billion.\n  It is for these reasons that I must vote against the farm bill. I \nacknowledge that this bill will likely pass and be signed into law by \nthe President. But I also believe that the flaws in this conference \nreport are so severe that Congress will need to revisit these issues \nnext year. I hope at that time we will be able to produce a workable \nfarm bill, one that addresses the best interests of farmers, business, \nand families.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend from \nIndiana, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and all of my \ncolleagues involved in the farm bill debate for their hard work in \ncrafting legislation which reforms our Nation's agriculture policies. \nThe conference report on the Federal Agricultural Improvement and \nReform Act represents a long-term plan to get the Government out of the \nfarming business--an idea I strongly support. The final agreement \noffers farmers flexibility, simplicity, certainty, opportunity and \ngrowth and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Under the provisions of this bill, farmers will have the flexibility \nto plant the crop or crops that best suit their climate, conditions and \nmarket opportunities. No longer will the Government tell farmers which \ncrops to plant and no longer will the Government tell farmers to leave \nproductive land idle in exchange for a Federal handout.\n  Current agriculture programs will be simplified by allowing farmers \nto enter into 7-year contracts. After the initial sign-up, many farmers \nwill never need to visit USDA again. I strongly support provisions in \nthe bill which eliminate the countless rules and costly regulations \nthat accompany today's farm programs.\n  The conference agreement provides certainty to farmers by ensuring \nthey will know all program parameters and payment rates for the next 7 \nyears. Under current programs, payment rates often change after program \nsign-up and payments in future years are unknown. A fixed stream of \npayments bolsters confidence in farm lending and all areas of farm \nbusiness decisions.\n  I believe in the opportunity this legislation provides to farmers. \nDecades-old planting patterns that limit profits are eliminated and \nreplaced with flexibility and fixed market transition payments. Farm \nincome will grow as farmers are no longer limited to planting stagnant, \nlow-value, market crops.\n  With respect to haying and grazing provisions included in the \nconference agreement, I want to thank both the House and Senate \nCommittees for their commitment to allowing farmers to hay and graze \ntheir lands. I was involved in amending the original bill, which \nrestricted haying and grazing, and I thank my colleagues for their \ncontinued interest in providing the utmost flexibility to those who \nearn their living in agriculture.\n  Finally, as many of you know, Oklahoma and other Western States have \nsuffered a severe drought during the past 6 months. Farmers tell me \nthat if Congress doesn't enact this farm bill many will be forced out \nof business. Frankly, I do not want to see that happen.\n  Congress has a responsibility to farmers in Oklahoma and every other \nagricultural State to enact a farm bill this week. I support the \nconference report before the Senate and urge my colleagues to vote for \nits adoption.\n\n\n             applicability of the congressional review act\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would ask the sponsor of the just-passed Congressional \nReview Act of 1996, the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, whether the \nbill, if signed by the President this week, will apply to the \nDepartment of Agriculture's rules that will be promulgated under the \nAgricultural Reform and Improvement Act.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, I will inform the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee that all Federal agency rules will be subject to \ncongressional review upon enactment of the Congressional Review Act.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if the Department of \nAgriculture were to issue major rules under the Agricultural Reform and \nImprovement Act, that is rules that would have a large economic impact \non the agricultural community might be held up for 60 calendar days by \nthe Congressional Review Act?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, my colleague is correct. If any Federal agency \nissues what the Congressional Review Act defines as ``major'' rules, \nthose rules would not be allowed to go into effect for at least 60 \ncalendar days. However, I advise my colleague that the President, by \nExecutive order, may declare a health, safety, or other emergency, and \nthat particular major rule would be exempt from the 60-day delay. I \nwould add, that the President's determination of whether there is an \nemergency is not subject to judicial review.\n  Mr. LUGAR. As the Senator from Oklahoma may know, we in the \nconference on H.R. 2854 did not contemplate such prompt enactment of \nthe congressional review bill. I would inform the chairman that H.R. \n2854 requires that the Secretary of Agriculture, within 45 days of \nenactment, offer market transition contracts available to eligible \nproducers. These contracts must not be further delayed, or they will \nnot be effective for the 1996 planting season. Moreover, these \ncontracts are worth billions of dollars, and are certainly going to \nqualify as major rules under the Congressional Review Act. Would the \nchairman agree that these major rules are the type that are \ncontemplated by his committee as qualifying for the emergency exception \navailable to the President?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, I agree with the chairman of the committee that the \nother emergency exception from the 60-day delay of major rules was \nincluded for this kind of circumstance. Certainly, it would be totally \nappropriate for the President to determine by Executive order that the \nmarket transition contract rules promulgated this spring under the \nAgricultural Reform and Improvement Act are emergency rules that would \nnot be subject to the automatic 60-day delay.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for that clarification.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering the \nconference report on the farm bill. I had hoped that the conference \nwould produce a bill that would be more fiscally responsible than \neither its House or Senate predecessors. However, I regret that in my \nview it does not achieve that fiscal reform. I voted against final \npassage of the Senate's farm bill, S. 1541, when the Senate acted on it \nlast month because, while it was improved considerably in some key \nrespects from the bill that the Republican leadership originally \nintroduced, ultimately, it was not the reform package that I believe \nour Nation needed and had the right to expect. Unfortunately, neither \ndoes this conference report provide the improvements that would be \nneeded to secure my support.\n  I understand that the President, with some reservation, is expected \nto sign into law the conference report now before us. I know that \nfarmers, as they head into the spring planting season, need to know the \nconditions under which they must operate. And I acknowledge that this \nbill is probably the best package that could be expected to emerge from \na conference with the House in the contentious, partisan environment \nwhich pervades Capitol Hill. Indeed, the conference package is far \nbetter than the House bill, which, in fact, was not complete \nlegislation because it did not reauthorize important conservation and \nnutrition programs that have traditionally been addressed in omnibus \nfarm legislation.\n  It is imperative that I congratulate and sincerely compliment the \nSenators who worked diligently to secure an agreement at least as good \nas the one before us today. Agriculture Committee Ranking Democrat Pat \nLeahy deserves our commendation for his successful struggle to insist \nthat adequate conservation and nutrition provisions be included. \nChairman Lugar again on this bill demonstrated his well-known and \nrespected ability to place the Nation's interests as his first \nobjective instead of partisan scoring and ideological rigidity. The way \nin which Senators Lugar and Leahy worked together in pursuit of \nresponsible legislation that could pass both houses and receive the \nPresident's signature is a model that others in this body would do well \nto emulate.\n  I compliment Senator Leahy, also, for his instrumental role in \nincluding in this conference agreement a provision important to me and \nmy New England colleagues allowing the Northeast\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nInterstate Dairy Compact to go into effect upon the approval of the \nSecretary of Agriculture. As a cosponsor of the compact legislation, I \nam very pleased that it will be included in a bill that apparently will \nbecome law.\n  This conference agreement includes important rural development \nprograms that are important to farmers in my State of Massachusetts as \nwell as to farmers across the country. The bill retains new development \ninitiatives such as the multimillion-dollar Fund for Rural America and \nthe new structure for delivery for rural development programs, the \nRural Community Advancement Program [RCAP]. RCAP provides important \nflexibility to States to allow them to develop innovative approaches to \ntheir unique rural development problems by permitting each State \ndirector to tailor assistance to local needs. This is a vast \nimprovement over the previous Republican proposal for block grants to \nthe States.\n  But on the central question of the way it deals with farm incomes, I \nreluctantly must conclude this conference report fails to make the \ngrade. While it eliminates the current price support structure for many \ncommodities programs, it replaces it with an extremely costly fixed \ndirect payment to farmers. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat for the first 2 years under this new proposal--fiscal years 1996 \nand 1997--the Treasury will pay out $5 billion more to farmers than \nwould be paid under a continuation of the current price support \nprograms.\n  While some claim that this 7-year direct payment program is necessary \nto wean farmers off Federal support, that argument is significantly \nweakened by the provision in the bill that retains the outdated 1949 \nAgricultural Act as the permanent law governing Federal commodity \nprograms. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the \n1949 statute, if enacted today, would cost taxpayers $10 billion for \n1996 alone, substantially more than the recently expired provisions.\n  I remain convinced that we need a new approach to farm policy. We \nneed to transition to a situation where we permit the free market to \nfunction with much less interference, regardless of how well-\nintentioned it may be. When this issue first came before the Senate, I \nsupported cloture on the Leahy-Dole reform package--although it was far \nfrom ideal in my mind--because it would have replaced the 1949 statute \nand the financial support provided by the current price support \nprograms with a 7-year phase-out plan. Also, importantly, that package \nwould have reauthorized critical conservation and nutrition programs, \nincluding food stamps, through 2002. The conference agreement \nreauthorizes food stamps for only 2 years.\n  Today we must vote yes or no on the conference package in its \nentirety. While it contains many important and acceptable nutrition, \nconservation and rural development provisions, it falls well short of \nthe kind of bill we ought to be passing. While I accept the explanation \nof Senators Lugar and Leahy that this is the best bill they could get \ntheir House counterparts to approve, it falls too far short of what our \nNation needs and there will be too little to show for too great an \nexpenditure of tax dollars for me to be able to vote affirmatively.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I will cast my vote in opposition \nto this conference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this Farm Bill Conference Report \nrepresents a bold new direction for the future of this Nation's \nagricultural policy. A direction I do not support. The removal of the \nsafety net for our farmers will prove itself to be a mistake, I think. \nUndermining the safety net is easy now since prices are relatively \nhigh, but when prices drop, and we all know they will, I fear this farm \nbill may come back to haunt us. In fact, it may well come back \nregardless of prices. It may come back because of the so-called market-\ntransition payments: guaranteed payments to farmers regardless of \nmarket conditions or production. I am truly afraid that the American \npublic will not view these payments as a safety net to maintain a safe \nand stable food supply. They will view the payments as a give-away. \nThose of us who understand the importance of farm programs know better \nthan to undermine farm support structures in this way. That is why we \nthink the payments should continue to be tied to production and the \nmarketplace.\n  Many have expressed the sentiment that after the 7 years of Freedom \nto Farm, we will continue to maintain some kind of farm program. While \nthe preservation of permanent agricultural law in the conference report \nprovides some assurance that this will be the case, I am not so \nconfident. The proponents of ``Freedom to Farm'' have made it \nexplicitly clear that they view the market transition payments as a \ntransition to nothing. Moreover, I am also concerned that public outcry \nover these direct payments will force us to revisit the farm bill \nsooner than 7 years. If this occurs, I am not at all convinced that \nCongress will seek to rectify the situation by reinstating a more \ntraditional safety net, they may well decide just to end the payments, \nperiod.\n  Which just goes to the point: we had the opportunity to appropriately \naddress national agricultural policy and we failed. Instead, we chose \nto let budget priorities drive farm policy. By putting forward policies \nthat could not even make it out of committee, we undermined the process \nand the result is far from satisfactory. Congress has let our farmers \ndown. The farm bill has traditionally been bipartisan with considerable \ntime provided for debate and discussion. Congress sought to provide all \nparties a chance to provide their input. That tradition has ended with \nthis bill. Take the dairy provisions for example. There is still a \nconsiderable amount of disagreement over these provisions, a compromise \nhas not been achieved.\n  Despite all this, our farmers do need certainty for the 1996 season. \nI spoke with the wheat growers in my State of Washington yesterday. \nWhile they share many of my concerns with this farm bill, they told me \nthey need something for this season. It would be unfair to hold the \nfarmers of America hostage to our disagreements. While in the long \nterm, I have serious concerns about the future of our farms under this \nbill, in the short term, they need to know what to plant for. I \ntherefore will support this conference report, with serious \nreservations, in order for my farmers to have the certainty they need \nthis season. I am committed to protecting the ability of our farmers to \ncontinue producing a safe and stable food supply for this Nation and \nthe world. I will be watching the impacts of ``Freedom to Farm'' on our \nNation's farms closely as the program, or lack of program, moves \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on the procedure we have, we have been \ngoing back and forth. I know the distinguished Senator from Iowa was \nseeking recognition.\n  I yield, from the time of the Democratic leader, time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there are really two parts to this farm \nbill. One component was in general put together in a very bipartisan \nand cooperative manner. That process has produced a number of sound \nprovisions that deserve broad support.\n  There are many good features in the titles of this bill dealing with \nconservation, for example, the continuation of the Conservation Reserve \nProgram and the Wetlands Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality \nIncentives Program and improvements in the wetlands conservation rules. \nThe wetlands rules are something that has concerned me greatly. They \nhave been very confusing and frustrating to many farmers in Iowa, but \nthere some positive changes in this bill that should make wetlands \nconservation rules more reasonable and workable for farmers.\n  One of the wetlands changes involves farmland that has been converted \nin the past and drainage tiles have been put in, but for one reason or \nanother, such as tile plugging up, the land has returned to wetland \nagain. Farmers in this situation have had problems with the rules in \ntrying to reopen their drainage systems. This bill will allow farmers \nto go in and unplug their tiles and go ahead and drain those fields, if \nthey have already been previously converted. That is very important.\n  This bill also provides that farmers can take a wet spot, a small \nspot in the\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\nfield, and go ahead and convert it and farm it if they mitigate the \nloss through improving, restoring or creating wetlands in the area. \nSometimes that is the best thing to do, because there may be a better \narea for a wetland than where it is existing right now in the middle of \na field. And the bill also calls for clarifying the rules on the types \nof wetlands that are so insignificant that they are not subject to \nwetlands rules. So these are very good changes for our farmers.\n  Although there are a number of positive features in the bill, there \nis one aspect of the bill that outweighs everything else, and for that \nreason I cannot support this farm bill. I am speaking about the \ncommodity program provisions in this bill. They are the most \nsubstantial part of the bill: $35.6 billion in direct payments alone. \nCommodity programs involve by far the largest amount of Federal \nagricultural outlays, and they will have, naturally, the largest effect \non the agricultural economy of my State of Iowa. So, if the commodity \nprograms in the farm bill will not be good for the farm families in my \nState, I simply cannot support the bill. Regrettably, that is the case \nwith this bill.\n  It is true it is late in the season. This farm bill is at least 6 \nmonths late--more like 9 months late. Farmers, at least in my area, are \nstarting in their fields. They are wondering why the leadership of this \nCongress could not get its work done to pass the farm bill on time. I \nwill not be forced into voting for a farm bill simply because the \nRepublicans could not get their act together and get it done last year.\n  I have here the Congressional Record from July 26, 1990. I was here. \nI was working on the farm bill at that time, the 1990 farm bill to take \neffect with the 1991 crop. Here is what the minority leader, Senator \nDole, said at that time, July 1990:\n\n       Mr. President, we are rapidly approaching the August \n     recess, and back in my home State of Kansas farmers are \n     preparing for the seeding of the winter wheat crop. Even as \n     they reflect upon the record Kansas wheat crop recently \n     harvested, uncertainty lies ahead. That is because Congress \n     again has been unable to finish the farm bill in a timely \n     manner so that producers of fall crops will know their \n     program in advance.\n\n  Here is the Senator from Kansas, Senator Dole, complaining in July \n1990, that we do not have the farm bill done in July 1990 to cover 1991 \ncrops. Here it is March 1996 and we do not have the 1995 farm bill done \nto cover 1996 crops.\n  Again, it was the other side that was in charge. We could have had a \nfarm bill out here on the floor last fall. We passed commodity \nprovisions out of our committee last September. We could have had a \nfarm bill on the floor in October or November or December. We sat here \nand twiddled our thumbs, waiting to try to get some kind of budget deal \nthat was never agreed upon. We could have had the farm bill done at \nthat time, but the leadership did not bring it up. So now we have a gun \nheld to our heads, saying we have to pass it now, it is awfully late. I \ndo not like to operate in that atmosphere, and I will not vote for it \non that basis--just on that basis.\n  I cannot support the bill because it sets up a farm program with \npayments that have no relationship to commodity prices, crop \nproduction, or farm income levels. This bill has it exactly backward. \nIt will provide far less protection against low farm income than \nprevious farm bills. But then it turns around and makes substantial \npayments to farmers in good times, when there are good prices and high \nincomes. What this is going to mean is it will hurt agriculture's image \nand undermine support for any sound farm policy in the future.\n  A sound farm policy is one that promotes good farm income from the \nmarket, but helps farm families survive circumstances beyond their \ncontrol, when the market goes down or they have a disaster. The farmers \nI know want to farm for the market and not the mailbox. This bill says \nno matter what the market does, no matter how good your income, you are \ngoing to get a check in that mailbox. Most farmers I know do not want \nto farm like that.\n  I want to make it clear that I want reform in farm programs with full \nplanning flexibility, less paperwork, less redtape, less hassle. We can \ndo that. There was general agreement on both sides of the aisle, in a \nbipartisan fashion, to make those reforms. We can provide that planting \nflexibility without adopting the payment scheme in this bill that will \nsend checks to farmers, even when they have a good income from the \nmarket.\n  I want farm programs that work better for farmers, but this bill goes \nfar beyond reasonable reforms to destroy the farm income safety net. It \nis absolutely unnecessary to take the radical approach in this bill in \norder to achieve the commonsense reforms that farmers have told me they \nwant.\n  The proponents of this farm bill are not really telling farmers the \nwhole story. The payments may look good now, but if commodity prices \nand farm incomes fall--and past cycles in the farm economy show how \nquickly and devastatingly that can happen--this bill sets farmers up \nfor a big fall. By the time we get to the later years in this farm \nbill, the maximum payment for corn is about 28 cents a bushel--no \nmatter how low the price may fall, 28 cents a bushel.\n  Have no doubt about it, what this bill does is it shifts risk. It is \na tremendous shift of risk onto farmers. They are being told to produce \nall they can so that grain companies will have plenty of grain to \ntrade, but if surpluses and low prices develop, as they most certainly \nhave many times before, it will be the farmers who get the short end of \nthe stick.\n  They will have much less help in working out of that low-price \nsituation than we have had in the past. There will be no farmer owned \nreserve, for example, because this bill specifically takes it out, and \nthe bill also raises the CCC interest rate by a full percentage point \nabove the cost of money to CCC. I offered amendments here on the Senate \nfloor to put the farmer owned reserve back in and take out the CCC \ninterest rate hike. Only two Republican Senators voted for those \namendments and neither was approved.\n  To see how the farm income safety net is slashed in this bill, let us \ntake, for example, an Iowa farmer with a 350-acre corn base. If the \nprice of corn, let us say, is $1.90 in 2002, that farm will have about \n$23,000 less income protection under this bill than it would have under \nthe 1990 farm bill. That is because this bill will not respond to low \nprices.\n  I suppose some of you might say, ``Well, $1.90 a bushel, we won't get \nto that price.'' I have been around long enough to remember when Earl \nButz in the 1970's said that American farmers should plant ``fence row \nto fence row'' to meet burgeoning world demand for U.S. agricultural \nexports. In my State of Iowa, we plowed up a very large share of the \nhills in southern Iowa, planted soybeans and planted corn. I tell you, \nwe had a ride. There was a boom. Farmers had a good ride and a lot of \nthem went deeply into debt. Why shouldn't they? There was supposed to \nbe no end to it. Land prices skyrocketed. A lot of big new tractors and \ncombines were bought. Many young farmers, in particular, took on a lot \nof debt to get started or to expand. Then in a few short years the \ncrash came and out went the young farmers. We had a devastating time in \nthe 1980's. I am very concerned this bill is setting farmers up for \nthat same kind of situation again, because it does not have enough \nprotection against low prices and farm incomes.\n  This bill also imposes a new cap on loan rates for wheat and feed \ngrains, which is another weakening of the farm income safety net. The \nloan rate for corn cannot go above $1.89 a bushel, but it can go below \n$1.89. I offered an amendment in conference, backed by the National \nCorn Growers and the National Association of Wheat Growers, to lift the \ncap on loan rates for wheat and feed grains, but, again, I could not \nget one vote from the Republican side of the aisle.\n  To illustrate the lack of farm income protection in this bill, I did \nsome rough calculations and determined that if this bill had been in \neffect in Iowa for the last 5 years of the 1980's, Iowa's farm families \nwould have had about $2 billion less in farm income than they had under \nthe farm bill in effect at that time. That would have been devastating \nfor Iowa's farm families and rural communities. That kind of situation \ncould develop again, and if it does this bill will be woefully \ninadequate.\n  I am convinced this bill will hasten the trend to larger farms and \nthe decline of the family farm. The largest\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nshare of these contract payments will go to the larger farms, and there \nwill be much less income protection for the smaller farms against low \nprices and incomes. Do not take my word. Here is an article that \nappeared in the March 24, 1996 Sunday New York Times:\n\n       The new approach, called Freedom to Farm by its supporters, \n     would accelerate the ongoing consolidation of smaller less \n     profitable farms into larger, more efficient corporate farms. \n     That has serious implications, not only for the face of \n     farming in America but also for the livelihoods of rural \n     communities.\n\n  That is from the New York Times. I might also point out, Mr. \nPresident, that the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Wall \nStreet Journal have all editorially endorsed this so-called freedom-to-\nfarm type of program. I tell farmers in Iowa, any time the New York \nTimes, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post all editorially \nendorse a farm program, I get worried, I get really worried.\n  Let us talk about fiscal responsibility. Here we are trying to reduce \nthe deficit. We want to get a balanced budget. I support that. We ought \nto be as tight as we possibly can with taxpayers' dollars. If someone \nneeds help, yes, that is when you come in with some assistance. But if \nyou do not need help, why spend taxpayers' dollars?\n  This bill will spend $35.6 billion on direct payments to farmers, \neven if prices are high and farm incomes are high. Those payments, made \nwhether they are needed or not, hold huge potential for embarrassing \nfarmers and those who support sound farm policy. We should save that \nmoney for farmers when and if they need it.\n  Going back to the example of the Iowa farm with the 350-acre corn \nbase, that farmer would get a payment of about $13,000 in 1997, even if \ncorn is $3 a bushel and yields are good. No matter what that farmer \nmakes from the market, the Government will send out a check for \n$13,000. I just do not see how that is fiscally responsible when we are \ntrying to balance the Federal budget.\n  Here is another example: a large Kansas wheat and grain sorghum farm, \nwith 1,800 acres of wheat and 600 acres of grain sorghum. Let us assume \nwheat is selling for $5 and grain sorghum for $3 in 1998. That farm \nwould have a net income of about $195,000 after costs. That is net farm \nincome. On top of that, Uncle Sam will write a check to that farmer for \njust under $40,000. Furthermore, if a farmer arranges his or her \nbusiness carefully to take full advantage of the programs and maneuver \naround the payment limitation, that one individual farmer could receive \nas much as $80,000 in a year in direct cash payments from Uncle Sam, \neven if the farmer makes a net income of over $195,000, as in the \nexample, or more. That money will be paid out regardless of how much \nmoney that farmer makes in the market.\n  I want someone to explain to me why the taxpayers--especially \ntaxpayers living in rural communities across this Nation trying to make \nends meet in small businesses or working at low wages--should be asked \nto pay for a farm program that makes sizable payments to farmers, even \nif they are making a good income from the market?\n  Where is the fairness in a system of income transfers from taxpayers \nwho are struggling to make a living if that money will be spent in \nproviding payments to other people when they do not need the help?\n  And the impact of this bill on taxpayers could be substantial. The \nCongressional Budget Office has estimated this bill will send out over \n$5 billion more in direct farm payments during fiscal 1996 and 1997 \nthan would be the case under the 1990 farm bill. USDA estimates that \nthis bill will result in direct income support payments of about $25 \nbillion more over the 7-year period than would have been the case if we \nhad just continued the 1990 farm bill.\n  Mr. President, here is the conference report on the farm bill. I know \nnot too many people read these documents. I just want to read one \nsentence out of section 113. It is titled ``Section 113. Amounts \nAvailable for Contract Payments,'' and it spells out for every fiscal \nyear how much money would be available. It amounts to about $35.6 \nbillion. But listen to this:\n\n       The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable, \n     expend the following amounts to satisfy the obligations of \n     the Secretary under all contracts.\n\n  ``The Secretary shall, to the maximum extent practicable'' make these \npayments. Wait a minute. I thought we were trying to save money for the \ntaxpayers. I thought we were trying to reduce the deficit and balance \nthe budget. Here is a bill that says USDA has to pay it out no matter \nwhat happens, no matter how much money farmers make; to the maximum \nextent practicable, it has to make those payments.\n  I would like someone to show me one other bill passed by this Senate \nor House that says, for example, that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices has to pay out, to the maximum extent practicable, a sum of \nmoney for welfare payments. Or let me see a bill stating that the \nSecretary of Education has to pay out, to the maximum extent \npracticable, money for title I. I do not believe you will find such a \nprovision anywhere.\n  I certainly have never seen anything like this in an agriculture bill \nin all the time I have been here. I just do not see how anyone who \nclaims to be a conservative can be in favor of mandating that the \nSecretary shall make the maximum payments possible no matter what \ncommodity prices or farm incomes are.\n  I offered an amendment on this very point. My amendment said that \npayments under this bill could not be any higher than they would have \nbeen under the 1990 farm bill, except in the case of a farmer with a \ndisaster loss. Farmers with disaster losses would receive the whole \ncontract payment. Any money saved in a fiscal year through my amendment \nwould be rolled over and reserved for payments to farmers in later \nyears when they may have a greater need for them.\n\n  Here is an article from the front page of the Iowa Farm Bureau \nSpokesman dated November 18, 1995, quoting Dean Kleckner, the president \nof the American Farm Bureau Federation. Mr. Kleckner is not a member of \nmy political party, and we have disagreed on issues in the past. But \nhere he is, quoted just a few months ago, expressing opposition to the \npayment mechanism that is in this bill, just as I have:\n\n       ``In order to provide a long-term safety net, the \n     conference committee should develop a program that maintains \n     a price-payment linkage and allows budgeted funds not \n     expended in years of high prices to be available in years \n     when farm income is low,'' the Rudd, Ia., farmer said in a \n     letter to House and Senate budget conferees last week.\n       ``Failure to resolve this issue will render farm programs \n     either an ineffective income support mechanism or subject \n     them to being an irresistible political target,'' Kleckner \n     said.\n\n  Mr. President, I offered an amendment in the conference committee to \ndo just that. It would have kept the money in reserve in times of high \nprices; USDA would not have paid out any more than under the 1990 farm \nbill unless the farmer had a disaster. Any money that was not paid out \nwould have been rolled over for use in making payments in future years \nwhen the need may be greater because of lower prices or disaster \nlosses. Again, my amendment was rejected along strict party lines. \nEvery Republican voted against it.\n  Some people get pretty edgy and touchy when they hear it said that \nthis farm bill makes farmers vulnerable to criticism that they are \nreceiving welfare payments. If this bill becomes law, I can only say, \nget used to it; get used to it. The national press, who have never been \nfriendly to agriculture, will have plenty of new material. There will \nbe television stories and the same editorial writers at the New York \nTimes, the Washington Post, and others will go to work. You mark my \nwords. There will be editorials about USDA making large payments to \nlarge farmers no matter how much money they are making from the market.\n  The editorial writers do not understand what is going on in \nagriculture anyway, but what I am concerned about is the damage this \nbill threatens to do to the public's image of farmers and of \nagriculture programs. Farmers do not want to be perceived as receiving \nsomething for nothing, regardless of whether they need it. I do not \nbelieve farmers receive welfare, or that farm programs are welfare. \nFarmers work very hard for their money. They are proud people. They \nwant to get their income from the market and not\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\nfrom the mailbox. There is real potential for this bill to contribute \nto an impression among the public that farm programs are welfare.\n  What I am saying is that I firmly believe and most sincerely believe \nthat those who support this program are doing a great disservice to \nfarmers because it sets up farmers for this kind of attack, that they \nare receiving welfare, getting payments even though they are making \ngood money from the marketplace. It is setting up farmers, I think, for \na big fall.\n  Not only are farmers going to have a greatly reduced farm income \nsafety net under this bill, they are also likely to suffer damage to \ntheir public image because of the payment scheme in this bill. We \nshould not pass a bill that gives critics of farmers and sound farm \npolicies more ammunition to fire away in the national press. It can \nonly be damaging to hard-working farmers in Iowa and across our land. \nIt is hard enough sometimes to explain to our urban counterparts why we \nneed a decent farm policy, without having to overcome the image created \nby this bill.\n  Mr. President, farm programs should be there as a safety net to \nprovide adequate protection when times are hard, not to pay out over \n$35 billion to the maximum extent practicable even when commodity \nprices and farm incomes are high. This bill slashes the farm income \nsafety net, and it is not fiscally responsible. For those reasons, I \ncannot in good faith support this farm bill. I hope we can come back \nnext year, perhaps, and readjust this bill so that we will have enough \nmoney available for farm programs in the years when it is really \nneeded.\n  I hope and pray this radical so-called freedom-to-farm approach will \nnot devastate our farm families. I am very concerned that the payments \nmade in the next year or so will create a political liability. When we \ndo have a downturn in the farm economy and there is a real need for an \nadequate farm income safety net, the political capital required to pass \nthe necessary legislation will have been used up. Those of us who care \nvery deeply about family farms and about rural America will not be able \nto get anything through here to help them through their tough times.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I cannot support this farm bill. I \nsee the train is on the track expect this bill will pass. I understand \nthe President has indicated he will sign it reluctantly. I must say, in \nall candor, I am disappointed that the President did not rely upon his \nauthority under the existing law to carry out a decent farm program and \navoid being cornered into signing a bill as objectionable as this one. \nFarmers should not be in the position of having an entirely new farm \nbill enacted at this late date. We should not have been in a position \nof writing a farm bill with a gun held to our head, instead of working \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to hammer out a really good, sensible \nfarm bill for farmers. I am just sorry the President did not use his \nauthority to avoid this situation. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa for his excellent statement. I do not know that anyone could \nsay it any better. He has capsulized very well what many of us feel \nabout this legislation. He has been in the trenches and has fought the \nfight and has led the effort in many cases. I applaud him for his \nstatement and for the contribution he has made to this debate again \nthis morning.\n  As I consider the contributions made by many of our colleagues, let \nme also call attention to the fact that this is the last farm bill that \nthe Senator from Alabama, Senator Heflin, and the Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, will probably be involved in. Over the years \nthey have been remarkable advocates of sound farm policy and leaders in \ntheir own right in so many ways. The people of Alabama and the people \nof Arkansas could do no better than to have the representation that \nthey have had in Senators Heflin and Pryor. They will certainly be \nmissed as we consider farm legislation in the future.\n  Let me commend as well our distinguished ranking member and the \nchairman for their work in bringing us to this point. We may not agree \nentirely on many of the issues involved in farm policy or ultimately on \nwhat we should do with this legislation, but no two people have worked \nharder and in a more bipartisan manner to bring us what we have been \nable to achieve today. So I again publicly thank them for their \nleadership.\n  As I said last night, Mr. President, this bill is long overdue. I do \nnot have an explanation as to why, as late as it is, we are dealing \nwith the 1995 farm bill in 1996, but we do know this, we know that \nfarmers need certainty. We do know that it is too late to start over. \nWe know that the winter crop will soon be harvested. We know that \nsouthern crops are already in the ground. We know that midwestern \nfarmers are ready to begin planting.\n  In fact, just recently a farmer from Volga, SD, called me from a \nsupply store trying to decide what kind of seed to buy for spring \nplanting because the seed was going to be determined in part by what \nthe ground rules are for the farm bill. How much planting time he had \navailable to him, what the planting year was going to be like was going \nto be determined by what we decided. He simply said, ``We can't wait \nany longer. Get it done. Get it done.''\n  So we are here with that realization. We know we need to get it done. \nWe received hundreds of calls to do something, to provide certainty, to \ntake what we can now and to fix the rest later. That is exactly what we \nare doing. I do not know what the farm programs eventually will be, but \nI do know this, that the time for action is long overdue. I know and \nfarmers know that we cannot wait any longer.\n  As a result, the President is going to be forced to sign this \nlegislation, forced to sign a bad bill because of a late date. He \nshares our concern about the safety net and the decoupling in this \nlegislation. But with our ranking member and with others, we intend to \nfight another day, to come back, to do even more to ensure that farmers \nwill have the kind of certainty, the kind of assurances that they have \nhad in past farm legislation.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill. No one should be misled \nin that regard. The continuation of the Conservation Reserve Program is \na good thing. The incorporation of many of the conservation programs \nand the adequate funding for those programs is a good thing and would \nnot have happened without the effort made by the ranking member.\n  The Fund for Rural America is a good thing. That it guarantees \nspending on rural development and research, that it addresses the needs \nof rural America, especially in creating new value-added markets all \nover the country, is a good thing. We provide assistance for value-\nadded processing facilities through the Fund for Rural America. I must \ntell you, it is one of the best features of this farm legislation.\n  The increased flexibility for some producers also is a good thing. \nSimplification is a good thing. Perhaps most importantly of all, the \nguarantee that we will have permanent law, with the expiration of this \nlegislation, is perhaps the most important thing of all. Ensuring that \npermanent law will be there, regardless of circumstances, regardless of \nour inability to find some consensus about what to do after this \nlegislation expires, in my view, is perhaps the best thing.\n  In spite of all of that, and that does represent a significant amount \nof bipartisan consensus, there are at least six serious flaws, Mr. \nPresident, that in my view, bring me to the same conclusion that the \nSenator from Iowa has just expressed. I cannot support this bill in \nlarge measure because, simply, it fails to provide the safety net that \nwe believe is so essential in any piece of farm legislation.\n  Loan rates are capped in this bill. They can go down. They can never \ngo up. The farmer owned reserve is eliminated. There is no possibility \nfor farmers to truly have the freedom to farm if they do not have the \nfreedom of access to the tools necessary to farm. The farmer owned \nreserve is one of the best tools farmers ever had. It is no longer \nthere. It is not freedom to farm when you take the tools, financially \nand otherwise, away from the same farmers that ostensibly have such \nfreedom today. The Emergency Livestock Feed Program is gone, another \ntool that undermines a real opportunity to provide\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\nthe freedom that we all say we want for farmers today.\n  Not long ago, three South Dakota farmers met with the President. If \nthey expressed anything in the short time they had with the President \nof the United States, it was this: ``Mr. President, we need that safety \nnet. Mr. President, we know we will face national disasters. We will \nface natural calamities in South Dakota and throughout the Midwest, and \nfor that matter in all parts of the country that will require we have a \nsafety net, an insurance program. Do not be a part of taking that \naway.''\n  The second and perhaps equally as significant a problem I see with \nthis bill is it pays producers, regardless of price. It requires \nguaranteed payments, as the Senator from Iowa has indicated today, \nprobably in an unprecedented fashion. It requires the Government to pay \nproducers, regardless of their circumstances. As the Senator so ably \nsaid, where else in law today are people required to get a payment, \nregardless of need, regardless of circumstance? I must say, Mr. \nPresident, of all the things in this bill, that is the one that \ntroubles me the most.\n  Third, while we do have some degree of flexibility, some degree of \nnew-found simplicity in this legislation, no one should be misled about \nthe fact that there are some who have less flexibility. Vegetable \nproducers are treated differently than grain producers. A potato \nproducer in South Dakota is not given the freedom to farm, is not given \nthe flexibility he may need to be able to compete effectively in the \nmarketplace. Why? Because we are protecting other potato producers in \nother areas of the country.\n  That kind of freedom to farm is not articulated very well by \nproponents of this bill. Instead of getting signals from the market, \nsome producers are receiving stronger signals from the Government for \ncertain products, such as potatoes.\n  Fourth, the research program, in my view, Mr. President, is one of \nthe greatest concerns as I look to the long-term future of farm \nlegislation. What happens in 2 years to research? How do we assure \nthose who are involved in research today in our colleges and \nuniversities across this country, in agricultural clinics and \nlaboratories all over the country, what we are going to do with regard \nto basic and applied research 2 years from now? We do not have the \nluxury of turning the spigot on and off. We do not have the luxury of \ntelling a researcher out there, ``Go ahead and do it, but we cannot \ngive you any guarantees 2 years from now you will have any assurance \nthat money will continue.'' What kind of a vote of confidence is this? \nResearchers want to know that when it comes to new production or new \nmarkets, we are going to stand, ready in partnership, with research to \nmake sure that agriculture continues to be what it is today.\n\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about the deficit consequences of \nthis legislation. No one denies this bill increases the deficit in the \nfirst 2 years by more than $4 billion. In rooms just down the hall we \nare trying to figure out how to cut billions of dollars from education, \nthe environment, national service, programs that directly affect people \nin virtually every walk of life. We are cutting billions there and \nadding billions on the floor as we speak--$4 billion in the next 2 \nyears, largely in payments given to farmers who will tell you privately \nthis is not the year they need them. You do not need farm payments when \nprices are as high as they are in grain today, but we are going to \nprovide them. We are going to mandate them. We are going to tell \nfarmers you go out and do whatever you want, get as much money as you \ncan from the marketplace, God bless you, we will still give you \n$50,000, $100,000, $200,000 in some cases.\n  Mr. President, the nutrition program, as well, troubles me a good \ndeal. How we can reauthorize farm program benefits and these payments \nto farmers for 7 years, but payments to nutrition for children for only \n2 years, is troubling in many ways.\n  Having said all of that, we recognize the good things. We wish we \ncould improve those that are not good. We recognize that we will fight \nanother day. We recognize that there are a lot of people out there \nstruggling who want certainty. Bob Ode, a farmer near Brandon, SD, who \nwas just in my office the day before yesterday. He is concerned about \nthe lack of a safety net. He has told me that grain farmers and \nlivestock producers in our State 2 years ago lost 13 percent of their \nincome. Last year, they lost 18 percent of their income. In the last 2 \nyears, many farmers have lost over 30 percent of their income, and our \nresponse today is to say we are going to take away your safety net. It \nis no longer there. You are on your own.\n  Are we really prepared to do that? Do we want to tell Bob Ode and \nfarmers across this country that is the best we can do? Mr. President, \nwe can do better. We must do better. We must come back, whether it is \nnext year or at some time in the not-too-distant future. We must \naddress these deficiencies. We cannot conscientiously allow this to \nhappen.\n  I am very pleased that the President has promised to join forces with \nus, next year, to make that happen. We can do better. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand the Senator wishes to speak in opposition to \nthe bill?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 5 minutes, from the distinguished Democratic \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished ranking member, my good friend \nfrom Vermont.\n  First, I want to express my profound gratitude to my colleague, \nSenator Pryor, for the very laudatory and kind words he delivered on \nthe floor a moment ago when he referred to a provision in the bill to \nname the U.S. Department of Agriculture Small Farmer Research Center in \nArkansas after me.\n  As I sat there in my office watching Senator Pryor deliver those \naccolades I couldn't but help question if it was really me he was \ndescribing. He laid it on pretty thick.\n  The thing that makes Senator Pryor easily the most popular politician \nin Arkansas is because he is one of the most generous to a fault and \none of the hardest working people I have ever known. You never see his \nname mentioned in the Arkansas press that it does not say, ``Senator \nPryor, the most popular politician in Arkansas,'' as the lead to \nwhatever story they are reporting.\n  I have been deeply honored to have him as a colleague, and deeply \ndistressed to know that he will depart this body at the end of this \nsession of Congress. We have had what I think is probably as fine a \nworking relationship as any two Senators in the U.S. Senate have ever \nhad. But I want to publicly express my gratitude to Senator Pryor for \nall the kind things he did say about me.\n  He gave me much too much credit. Of course, that is one of the things \nthat makes him so popular back home. He gives other people credit for \neverything that happens, no matter what his role was in it.\n  In this particular case I can honestly say the Senate would have been \njustified in naming that after an aide, my agriculture assistant back \nin those days, Rhona Weaver. It was essentially Rhona's idea. She \nworked with the State leaders and the leaders of the community. I would \nbe remiss if I did not pay tribute to her. We politicians take credit \nfor everything, but the truth of the matter is most of it originates \nwith our staff, and this is a classic case in point.\n\n  I am deeply honored, Mr. President. And now, because I detest this \nbill so much, I am in the very ambivalent position of having to vote \nagainst a bill that places a great honor on me. Nevertheless, I have no \nchoice but to vote no.\n  Let me just say, in these few remarks, that I personally thought the \nbill before us, which will probably be always remembered as the \nfreedom-to-farm bill, was fatally flawed in concept. Senator Conrad of \nNorth Dakota said it more appropriately several times, and it bears \nrepeating. This bill is like the people who followed Jim Jones down to \nGuyana, and he told them, when they were committing mass suicide, to \ndrink the Kool-Aid, it tastes good, and the children drank the Kool-\nAid. It was after they got it down that the problems began. And so it \nis with this bill. It is going to taste good to the farmers, initially, \nbecause they\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\nare going to be paid a handsome bonus on top of record commodity \nprices. They do not even necessarily have to farm to get the bonus. The \nconference report did make one improvement from the earlier Senate \nversion. To get the bonus, they at least have to engage in some sort of \nagricultural activity. But I can think of all kinds of activities that \nI can argue are ``agricultural'' in nature but do not resemble farming \nas farmers in my State would recognize it. You are going to see ``60 \nMinutes'' stories of farmers who are maybe getting 80 cents or a dollar \na pound for cotton, plus a very handsome, generous payment from ``Uncle \nSugar.'' To make matters worse, depending on how they finally define \n``agricultural activity,'' you might see farm payments being paid to \npeople who no longer plant a seed or turn a clod of dirt.\n  That is not what farmers want. They do not want welfare. That is what \nthis is, pure and simple. Actually, I suppose you could argue that \nwelfare is what you give to people who need it, which may not be the \ncase with these freedom-to-farm handouts. But the problem is going to \nbe just like drinking the Kool-Aid. Seven years from now, or sooner, \nwhen these payments have been terminated or have dwindled to nearly \nnothing, if commodity prices are back where they were 2 years ago, I do \nnot know what is going to happen. We either go back to the drawing \nboard and draft a bill similar to the one we are abandoning, or we just \nsay ``adios'' to the farmers of America. I might remind my colleagues \nthat in 1987 when the farm credit crisis was at its worst, the Congress \ndid not abandon America's farmers. We stood by them in bad times as \nwell as good and helped many of them make a substantial come-back. But \nwith this bill, we are virtually saying ``don't let the door hit you on \nthe way out.''\n  The tragedy of this is that many aspects of current law--the \nmarketing loan in particular--that we have used all of these years is \nworking. And they are working as they were intended. According to the \nCBO baseline estimates--one of our more esoteric exercises--USDA will \nshow a $4 billion reduction in spending of farm programs in 1995 below \nwhat we anticipated less than a year ago. While terms like ``baseline'' \ndo not mean anything to laymen, we all understand that we spent $4 \nbillion less last year than we anticipated because wheat, cotton, and \ncorn are well above the target price. Rice is really the only major \ncommodity that is below the target price, and under current law, rice \nfarmers would benefit. If commodity prices in the next 7 years stay as \nhigh as they are right now, the freedom-to-farm bill will cost $21 \nbillion more than current law. In fact, if prices stayed at current \nprices, and rice improved a little, then every penny paid out as \nfreedom-to-farm welfare is money we have no business spending this way. \nI can think of lots of better uses of this money for rural America. We \nare cutting conservation, we are cutting research, we are cutting rural \nwater and sewer programs, we are cutting rural housing, and the list \ngoes on and on. If you will give these billions of dollars that you are \nwilling to give farmers already making record profits to us on the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for discretionary spending, I \nwill show you how we can put it to use in a way that can really make a \ndifference in farming communities in every State of this Nation.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me speak about the Market Promotion \nProgram, which Senator Bryan and I have tried to kill as religiously as \nI have tried to kill anything in my life. On a very handsome vote in \nthe U.S. Senate, we cut the Market Promotion Program--the program that \nsubsidizes Tyson, McDonald's, Hiram Walker, Gallo Brothers, and many \nother of the biggest corporations in America These subsidies were paid \nto them for advertising they ought to be, and perhaps would be, doing \non their own, according to the GAO. Finally, we got that program cut \nback to $70 million less than 2 months ago on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. What do you think? Here it is reincarnated in this bill at $90 \nmillion.\n  Senator Bryan has already spoken on some of the ways the reforms he \nand I successfully brought to this program were dismantled one by one. \nDefenders of this program may have tried to hide their changes by \nchanging the name of the program or by using language that appeared to \nbe making reforms but were actually just a restatement of current law. \nMPP may have become MAP--and I won't begin here to describe the fun the \npress can have with this new name when you consider some of the former \nprogram beneficiaries--but it is really nothing new. Fortune 500 \ncompanies will still find ways to taxpayer-finance their already huge \nadvertising budgets and foreign companies can still get the federal \ngovernment to advertise in a way that might be adverse to similar U.S. \ncompanies. And so, is the only reform a provision to prohibit giving \nfederal assistance to foreign companies for the purpose of promoting \nforeign agricultural production? And they call this bill the Federal \nAgriculture Improvement and Reform Act [FAIR]? This measure is hardly \nan improvement or a reform, and it certainly isn't fair.\n  So MPP, MAP, or whatever it ultimately gets called, lives on. I guess \nthat is one of the unique things about the U.S. Senate. Nothing ever \nreally dies. Rasputin finally died, but it seems that the Market \nPromotion Program, or whatever you call it, never will. So while there \nmay be some things in the bill that have some redeeming value, they \nseem to have miraculously escaped my attention under the glare of such \nunbelievable policies as those I have just described.\n  So, Mr. President, when the roll is called, I will have no choice but \nto vote ``no'' on this. That is not to say that I do not admire the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member for their endless hours of \ntrying to craft something that this body could agree on and that the \nHouse could agree on. Maybe it is the very best anybody could do. I do \nnot know. But those best efforts do not require me to vote ``aye.'' \nTherefore, I will vote ``no.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will speak on my own time. I always enjoy \nhearing the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. I told him before that \none of the joys of coming here is that we came in the same class. He is \none of the best friends I have had for 22 years here. I almost hate to \ngo into this speech and muddy the water with facts, but one that I \npoint out is on the Market Promotion Program, which I voted to cut and \nchange over the years. There are significant changes. We made \nsignificant reforms to this program in 1993, and we gave a great deal \nof flexibility to the Secretary to carry out the reforms we had. I \nagree that participation in this program should be limited. This \nprogram is designed to help those who do not have large marketing \norganizations or deep pockets. It is designed for the small dairy co-\nops in Vermont that use it now to promote exports to Canada, and other \nplaces, or the small rice dealers in Arkansas, who might use it. And \nbit by bit, this supertanker is being turned around, I tell my friend \nfrom Arkansas. We are improving it and will continue to do so.\n  I also tell my friend from Arkansas--and he knows this, as I do--that \nnobody ever brought to the floor a farm bill where they liked every \nsingle page of it. There is no legislation that comes before this \nCongress that is more a product of having the balanced interests of \nregions, individuals, of commodities, and balance of the needs of \npeople who are not directly involved with farming, but have an actual \ninterest--people who see the legislation in here to protect the \nEverglades and to help rehabilitate the Everglades, and those who see a \nConservation Reserve Program continued and strengthened, those who see \npermanent law maintained, those who see improvements in some of our \nnutrition programs, as well as several new environmental initiatives \nlike the EQUIP program, added here. These are things that effect every \none of us, whether we are farmers or not. There are those throughout \nthe country, farmers or not, who applaud these initiatives in this \nbill.\n  I would like to take this time, Mr. President, to thank several of my \ncolleagues for their work on behalf of agricultural interests, who will \nnot be here in the next farm bill. One, of course, is the distinguished \nranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Kika \nde la Garza. He went out of his way to be not only bipartisan in his \nown body, but in this body, as we have tried to bring together \ncompeting interests of\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nfarm bills. His most recent success was accomplished while chairman of \nthe House Agriculture Committee, with a reorganization of the USDA and \noverhaul of the Federal Crop Insurance Program.\n  Then, in our body, let me speak of two Members I will miss greatly, \nboth in serving with them on the Agriculture Committee and serving with \nthem in the Senate.\n  One is my colleague from Alabama, Senator Heflin. I am proud to say I \nhave served for 15 years on the Agriculture Committee with Judge \nHeflin. I served with him also on the Judiciary Committee. But I think \nin many ways I have relied on his expertise and his good humor. His \nability to help forage consensus and coalition has been on the \nAgriculture Committee. His expertise and his judgment is going to be \nsorely missed. He has been the spokesman for southern agriculture. \nCertainly nobody ever discussed peanuts without Judge Heflin being \nthere, and so much else of southern agriculture.\n  I think of the times when I traveled to his State of Alabama with \nhim, with he and his wife, Mike, and on occasion when my wife was able \nto join us. I remember going to one function--a dinner in a school--\nwhere there were several hundred people there. I am positive that the \njudge called every one by name and asked about members of their family \nby name. I was then chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. I was \nnothing but a spear carrier on that trip to Alabama. I can assure the \nChair, they were there to see Senator Heflin and this Eastern Senator \nwho came with him, and who talked funny as far as they were concerned.\n  So I want to thank Senator Heflin for all he has done to further \nagriculture programs and, in particular, the rural development \nprograms--the rural development programs that helped Alabama but also \nhelped rural Vermont, and have helped rural areas throughout our \ncountry.\n  Another person I want to recognize from that committee is Senator \nDavid Pryor. I never have known any Member of the Senate, Republican or \nDemocrat, who did not have great affection for Dave Pryor. I know I \nhave been proud to serve on the Committee with him and proud that he \nhas been one of my close friends in the Senate over the years.\n  Again, David Pryor is one who has time and again helped us bring \ncoalitions together--his quiet dedication, his obvious knowledge of the \nfacts, but also his knowledge that, as a Senator, there are certain \nprerogatives, especially debate prerogatives, that are available to all \nof us, and my memory of that goes back to the 1985 farm bill.\n  Senator Pryor and his colleague Senator Bumpers were concerned that \nthe bill would cut Federal price supports for the rice industry. They \ncame to the Senate floor and they delayed action by reading their \nfavorite rice recipes into the Congressional Record. The opposition \nfinally gave in to these Southern gentleman when Senator Pryor \nannounced that he knew of 1,000 rice recipes. I checked that figure \nwith Senator Pryor this morning, and the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas told me that not only did he know them but that he kept copies \nof them in his desk should the need arise to add to our education in \nthe Senate. Should he suddenly be called upon to give us time for \nreflection, he is prepared to talk about rice recipes.\n  That kind of dedication is going to be sorely missed. But these are \npeople--Senator Heflin and Senator Pryor--who have improved the Senate \nAgriculture Committee by their presence and have left a great legacy \nfor all of us.\n  Mr. President, I have sometimes joked that Senators are merely \nconstitutional impediments to their staffers, or constitutional \nnecessities for their staffs. But I must say that this bill was made \npossible by the hard work of staff. And I think of those on my side of \nthe aisle that I was able to appoint who have worked tirelessly in 1995 \nand 1996 on this farm bill.\n  I am particularly indebted to my staff director, Ed Barron. He joined \nme in 1987, and he has been a great fountain of education, \nencouragement, and tireless work. He is a good friend. He is a good \nadviser.\n  In the past he was the lead staff person who handled nutritional and \nrural development programs. The continuation of the nutrition programs \nin this bill is a tribute to his commitment to these issues. Ed also \nhad a critical role in getting the dairy compact included in the final \nbill. His attitude on the compact reflected mine: ``Never give up.'' \nAnd he never did.\n  Ed worked tirelessly in a bipartisan manner demonstrating superb \npolitical judgment and negotiating skills.\n  I thank him for his hard work. And, I believe his sons, James and \nStephen, and his wife, Bonnie, will be delighted to know that they \nfinally are going to see him again. They will have him back this \nweekend.\n  Jim Cubie, my chief counsel, has been with me over a decade on both \nappropriations matters and agriculture matters. His commitment to \nconservation and environmental issues has helped make this the most \nenvironmentally progressive farm bill in history. Without his \ndedication, there would not have been such a strong connection between \nfarm policy and conservation initiatives.\n  Working alongside Jim was Brooks Preston whose commitment to the \nenvironment was forged during a childhood spent outdoors. Brooks \nprovided invaluable legislative support for both my personal office and \nthe committee on environmental and forestry issues.\n  Pat Westhoff, my chief economist, poured endless amounts of energy \nproviding economic analysis for the committee on commodity program and \nbudgetary issues. I felt confident knowing that Pat was leading the \ncomplex negotiations needed to fine tune the intricate details of the \nbill. Pat, your dedication and service to this committee is recognized \nand commended.\n  Thanks, as well, to Pat's wife Elena and to his children Christina, \nBen, and Maria for letting us borrow Pat for what seemed to them to be \nabout 50 years.\n  Kate Howard, my counsel for international trade, joined the staff for \nthe 1994 GATT deliberations. Since then, Kate has continued to play a \nlead role in the trade, international food aid, and agricultural credit \nprograms. Kate's efforts to build a bipartisan consensus for the \ninternational programs in this bill, and her support for the \ninternational food assistance programs, is especially appreciated.\n  Tom Cosgrove played a leading role in the passage of the dairy \ncompact and other dairy reforms. On my committee for the past 5 years, \nTom has worked endless hours on behalf of dairy farmers in Vermont and \nacross America. Born on a dairy farm himself, Tom connected with the \ndairy community and understood their concerns, enabling him to \neffectively translate their needs into legislation.\n  David Grahn spent countless hours drafting the bill and deserves a \nspecial mention. Without him, the drafting of this legislation would \nnot have been as successful. David would be here now--except that he \nand his wife just had a baby during the last 2 weeks of the farm bill. \nCongratulations, David and Jill, on your baby girl, Carolyn Elizabeth \nGrahn.\n  Bob Paquin has worked tirelessly for me on agriculture issues in \nVermont. I appreciate that he flew down to Washington to help out on \nthe compact at the critical moment. His talents are greatly \nappreciated.\n  Diane Coates, who started in my Vermont office and has been working \non the committee for 2 years, provided invaluable support to Ed Barron. \nHer work on nutrition programs was particularly helpful.\n  Kevin Flynn, who started with me in the Washington office and joined \nthe committee last fall, provides excellent support for everyone on the \ncommittee.\n  I was also very fortunate to have on staff several people as fellows \nor from the Department of Agriculture. Rob Hedgerg provided invaluable \nexpertise in the areas of conservation, research, and rural \ndevelopment. Kate DeRemer's efforts ensured that the final bill \nincluded a research title that prepares our farmers for the next \ncentury.\n  Ron Williams, who arrived right in the thick of things, provided \ncritical assistance. His patience and unflappable personality are \ninvaluable.\n  There are a number of people who are no longer on the committee but \nworked very hard to help get us to the point we have reached today. \nNick Johnson did\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\n a superb job for Vermont and me on rural development and nutrition and \nI wish him all the best at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.\n  Craig Cox, who left my committee to join the Natural Resources \nConservation Service at USDA, spent countless hours over the past 3 \nyears to help lay the foundation for the conservation title that we \nincluded in the farm bill.\n  Bryant Farland, who left the committee last year to enter law school, \nprovided excellent support to the committee. His professional attitude \nand cheerful approach to every assignment is sorely missed.\n  Senate legislative counsel--especially Gary Endicott, Tom Cole, and \nJanine Johnson--deserve a lot of credit for their willingness to stay \nlate and their excellent work.\n  I must also thank Secretary Glickman, and his chief of staff, Greg \nFrazier, as well as the Secretary's dedicated staff at USDA for \ncountless hours of support during this long process.\n  But I have emphasized over and over again that this is bipartisan \nlegislation. I compliment my good friend from Indiana, as I have \nbefore, Senator Lugar, who listened and worked so hard with me so that \nwe could pass this bill. We agreed on some issues and disagreed on \nothers. But, we know that we can always take each other's word.\n  I think many times staff reflect the Members they work for. Chuck \nConnor deserves a great deal of credit for that. He works for one of \nthe most honest, dedicated, hard-working Senators here. This is \nreflected in the type of person Chuck Connor is. He is someone I have \nrespected in all of the years that I have worked with him. I consider \nhim one of the finest staff in this body. I compliment him, and I thank \nhim for his work and the direction he gave to Randy Green, Dave \nJohnson, and Michael Knipe, and others.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, our side will be represented ably by the \nmajority leader in a moment as he will make a final statement.\n  For several decades, the U.S. Department of Agriculture subsidized \nfarmers with target prices and deficiency payments. Target prices for \nwheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice were set at levels believed to \nrepresent a fair price for the crops.\n  Whenever the average market price was below the target price, the \nFederal Government paid farmers the difference. This was called a \ndeficiency payment.\n  Now Congress is considering a plan that would scrap deficiency \npayments and target prices and replace them with fixed payments. The \nfarmer receives the same subsidy payment whether prices are high or \nlow. Advocates for change believe this system provides the certainty \nfarmers need with regard to payments and the predictability taxpayers \ndemand with regard to balancing the target. Defenders of the status quo \ncriticize this plan because farmers receive payment during periods of \nextremely high prices.\n  While no one wants subsidies paid when they are not needed, the \ncurrent system of deficiency payments and target prices fails even the \nmost modest standards of targeting or means testing.\n  Deficiency payments are a poor indicator of farm wealth. Price \nrepresents only one-half of the farm income picture. Cash receipts in \nfarming are a product of price per bushel multiplied by the quantity \nproduced.\n  Recent history is a case in point: 1994 was a remarkable year for \ncorn production. Total corn production for the country exceeded 10 \nbillion bushels--a feat most thought was impossible. In the Midwest, \nwhole fields averaging over 200 bushel per acre were commonplace.\n  Large supplies caused prices to fall. The average corn price for the \nyear was $2.26 per bushel--almost 50 cents below the target price. \nAccording to our system of calculating farm wealth, 1994 was a terrible \nyear because prices were lower. Taxpayers came to the rescue with \nsubstantial subsidies even though farmers harvesting 200 bushels per \nacre corn at $2.26 per bushel grossed a record breaking $450 per acre.\n  As is often the case in farming, 1995 was different than 1994. \nWeather problems and pestilence plagued farmers throughout the year. \nMany farmers who harvested 200 bushels per acre in 1994 saw their \nproduction fall to 90 bushels or less in 1995. Some farmers lost their \nentire crop. With falling production and strong demand, prices were \nsubstantially above target price levels. Corn farmers received $3.00 \nper bushel or more for their crop.\n  1995, however, was a very difficult year for many farmers because \nthey had little, if any, crop to sell at higher prices. Ninety bushels \nper acre at $3.00 per bushel represents a per acre gross of $270 per \nacre--40 percent below 1994. Yet the USDA declared 1995 as a good \nincome year, and took away all subsidies for the 1995 crop. Generous \nsubsidies were paid to 80 percent of the corn farmers in America in \n1994.\n  Freedom to farm gets the Government out of the business of estimating \ngood income years and poor income years. The 7-year baseline payment \nlevels are distributed--on a declining basis--to farmers over the next \n7 years without regard to commodity prices.\n  Will there be years in which farmers receive a subsidy even though \ntheir income was high? Perhaps. But this is no more the case than under \npresent law. The current system has indeed failed to identify genuine \nneed. Let's give the USDA something better to do with their time.\n  In short, Mr. President, although it has been suggested that the \nfreedom-to-farm bill would not be a good idea in the event that a bad \nyear came along on the farm, the fact is the current program has not \nbeen particularly helpful. In those years in which we have had a great \nabundance of crops in and great revenue from the fields, we have also \nhad target prices in addition or great deficiency payments. That is an \nimportant point to make, and I make it for the Record.\n  Mr. President, I thank, once again, the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Leahy, for an extraordinary opportunity to work with him and to \ncreate, I believe, a remarkable farm bill.\n  Today, as we pass a farm bill that shapes the outlook of agriculture \nfor the 21st century, it is time to recognize the tireless efforts of \none of the finest staffs on Capitol Hill.\n  I want to start by recognizing the efforts of the professional staff \nof the committee led by senior professional staff member, Robert \n(Randy) Green. Randy deserves special credit for his outstanding \nprofessional efforts in translating complex ideas into effective \nlegislation. Often working through the night into the mornings and on \ncountless weekends, Randy and his staff exemplified a dedication to the \ntruth in the details of the committee conference process. While \nrespecting the views of others, the professional staff crafted a bill \nin a manner that was fair. They have worked on endless proposals and \nthrough many very tough negotiating meetings to achieve the exciting \nnew concepts about agriculture that were passed today. Katherine \nBrunett McGuire, David Stawick, Darrel Choat, Terri Nintemann, Terri \nSnow, Elizabeth Johnson, Douglass Leslie, Patrick Sweeney, and Bill \nSimms combined their extensive knowledge of agricultural issues to \ncreate this landmark revision of Agriculture policy. They are the \nunsung heroes who took the plight of the American farmers seriously and \nkept their shoulders to the task until we have arrived at the \nconclusion of this conference.\n  Dave Johnson, chief counsel, Marcia Asquith and Michael Knipe, \ncounsels, spend endless hours giving assiduous attention to the details \nin the drafting of legislation to forge compromises on the most \ndifficult issues. They worked diligently to negotiate provisions that \nwould be effective and yet pull together diverse interests. Patiently \ndrafting and redrafting a great many ideas that ultimately were not \npart of this legislation, but necessary in arriving at the concluding \nlanguage, they never gave up and determinedly made the resulting Farm \nBill a strong one.\n  Chief economist, any Morton, spent hours crunching numbers for the \ncommittee to ensure that the bill's cost fell within budgetary \nconstraints. It is a tribute to his ability that this bill is scored so \nsuccessfully by CBO and achieves the numbers that are required. Andy's \nknowledge of agricultural economics has proven to be a most valuable \nresource to the committee.\n  Andy Fisher did a superb job of keeping the press informed of the \nbill's\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\nprogress and his ability to translate complex agricultural issues for \nthe press and operate under severe time constraints ensured that the \npublic was well informed.\n  Chief clerk, Robert Sturm, along with Debbie Schwertner, Danny \nSpellacy, David Dayhoff, Mary Kinzer, Jill Clawson, Cathleen Harrington \nand Barbara Ward kept the office running smoothly throughout this \nprocess. In conducting many hearings, both here and in the field, \nresponding to hundreds of letters, answering thousands of telephone \ncalls, and tracking a very active staff they demonstrated their \ndiligence and loyalty to the Committee.\n  I also want to thank Gary Endicott, Janine Johnson and Thom Cole from \nthe legislative counsel's office for their willingness to respond to \nthe committee's requests and for lending their valuable expertise to \nthe development of this bill.\n  As well, I want to commend the minority staff of the committee who \ncontributed greatly with their professionalism and cooperation. In \nparticular, I want to thank minority staff director, Edward Barron and \nchief counsel, Jim Cubie. They led the way to agreement through many \ncontinuous issues.\n  I would especially like to commend staff director, Chuck Conner for \nhis tremendous contribution to the committee. Chuck's leadership and \nbroad expertise in agricultural policy provided the committee with \nsound guidance on key issues. His resolute attitude and strong \nconvictions kept the conference advancing when the process seemed mired \nin difficulty. Chuck molded a superb staff and prepared them with \nprecision so that they could navigate a steady course to the passage of \nthis legislation. The public rarely sees the work of the Senate staff \nbut they give so much to our country. Their sacrifice and long hours \nare shared by their families and I applaud their efforts.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we have had a number of farm bills discussed \nand passed since I have been in the Senate. Of course, the first \nquestion is, is it good for agriculture and good for the consumers and \ngood for the American people generally? I think we can say that the \nanswer is in the affirmative in each case.\n  I certainly thank Senator Lugar, the chairman of the committee, and \nSenator Leahy, the ranking Democrat on the committee. They have worked \ntogether, as we must, in agriculture. I have always found that if you \nbring a bill to the floor that is too partisan, either Democratic or \nRepublican, it is not going to pass. And so, as has been the case in \nthe past 20, 30 years, as far as I can recollect, this is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation. It should be bipartisan or nonpartisan. I do not \nbelieve that to the American farmer who is sitting out there making his \ndecision on what is good or bad it depends on whether it has a D or an \nR behind it. But if it is worked out in Congress, as it has been, on a \nbipartisan basis, then I believe the American farmer, rancher, and, of \ncourse, the American taxpayer, too, is generally more satisfied.\n  This bill is also a good environmental bill, as I will touch on \nlater.\n  I would like to also congratulate my friends and colleagues on the \nother side of the Capitol, Pat Roberts, and Congressman de la Garza. I \nhave worked with them over the years. My friend, Pat Roberts, is my \nCongressman in western Kansas. He has done an outstanding job working \nwith the Senate and working with the House and again in coming up with \na very important piece of legislation. It is truly a bipartisan effort.\n  I congratulate my colleagues, particularly those who were conferees. \nIt has required a lot of patience and a lot of perseverance, qualities \nwhich farmers and ranchers have to have themselves. They have to have \npatience and persistence or they would not be in business very long.\n  The legislation before us will transition America's farmers into the \n21st century without disrupting the farm economy or land values, and \nfarmers, as other Members in the Chambers have said, finally are going \nto plant for the market and not for the Government.\n  In addition, this legislation provides farmers with what they have \nasked for the most--certainty, simplicity, and flexibility. As I travel \nacross America, farmers and ranchers tell me the same thing: Keep it \nsimple. All Government programs, and especially all regulations, must \nbe simpler and less intrusive. The farm program should pass the common \nsense test.\n  As I said, another big winner in this bill is the American taxpayer. \nThis legislation ensures reasonable and responsible spending through a \ncapped entitlement. If we are to balance the budget--and we will--the \nAmerican farmer will tell you that everyone must contribute including \nhimself. Farmers often remind me that they are taxpayers, too. And as \ntaxpayers, farmers want a balanced budget because they know under a \nbalanced budget, spending on interest payments are projected to decline \n$15 billion over 7 years. And the farmers would be one of the greatest \nbeneficiaries in that event.\n  For family farmers who often struggle to make ends meet, the money \nsaved through reduced interest payments could make the difference \nbetween success and failure.\n  This is landmark legislation. The bill contains one of the most \nsignificant conservation packages ever enacted. Instead of mandates and \nthe heavy hand of Government, this bill reflects a common sense \napproach. This historic farm bill is one that conservationists can be \nproud of.\n  This legislation includes elements from the conservation bill \nauthored last year by Senators Lugar, Craig, Grassley, and myself, also \nknown as S. 1373, the Agricultural Resource Enhancement Act.\n  For example, this farm bill continues the Conservation Reserve \nProgram which, at 36.4 million acres, makes the program twice the size \nof the National Wildlife Refuge System. This program is the Nation's \nbiggest and the most successful private lands conservation program.\n  The bill streamlines cost-share incentive programs into one \nrevitalized program, the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. The \nprogram will spend $200 million per year on cost-share assistance for \ncrop and livestock farmers as they work to control pollution and \nerosion.\n  For years, farmers have been planting the same crops year after year \nwhich leads to excessive use of fertilizer, chemicals, and tillage to \ncontrol pests and maintain crop yields. This bill provides farmers with \ncomplete planting flexibility, allowing them to plant environmentally \nsensitive crops.\n  The bill also ensures sound conservation practices on over 300 \nmillion acres. This legislation continues the successful record of the \n1985 and 1990 farm bills by requiring participating producers to meet \nsoil conservation and wetlands protection standards.\n  In addition, the bill provides funding for the restoration of the \nFlorida Everglades, balances conservation compliance regulations, \nexpands mitigation options for wetlands, and authorizes new \nconservation and wildlife enhancement programs.\n\n  Several national farm organizations have praised the conservation \nprovisions as providing a more common sense balance between practical \nconservation methods and protection of natural resources and wildlife.\n  As I see it, this bill is not the end but a beginning. It is a \npositive first step in a larger effort to ensure that rural America \nprospers. From here, we can address other issues. Tax and regulatory \nreform are a must. Property rights protection and health care reform \nare vital. I am committed to taking action on these issues, so that \nrural America can realize a brighter future.\n  American agriculture is ready and waiting for policies that will help \nprepare it for a successful 21st century. This legislation lays a solid \nfoundation for sustained growth.\n  Like other members on the Ag Committee--and I have been proud to be a \nmember of that committee for a long time--I certainly have had \noutstanding staff, headed by Mike Torrey, who has worked closely with \nChuck Conner and others, along with Dave Spears, who is in my Kansas \noffice but has been back here from time to time to help us on this \nlegislation, and Bruce Knight, who helped us a great deal with the \nconservation title.\n  I want to thank my three staff members, in addition to all the others \nthat have been mentioned by Senator Leahy\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nand Senator Lugar. Without staff, I do not believe we could be here \ntoday, on the verge of voting for this historic legislation.\n  This is historic legislation. This is a complete departure from the \npast when it comes to agricultural legislation.\n  Again, I want to particularly commend our distinguished chairman, \nSenator Lugar, along with Senator Leahy and others, who have made it \npossible.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Is the Senator from Montana speaking in favor of the bill?\n  Mr. BURNS. In favor of the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. BURNS. Two minutes or less.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will yield to the Senator, not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy, the ranking member \nof the Ag Committee, and of course Senator Lugar, who has displayed \ngreat leadership crafting this legislation.\n  I rise today in support of the conference report of the Federal \nAgriculture Improvement Act of 1996, now known as FAIR. I see this as a \npositive move forward for agriculture and agricultural production in \nAmerica. This is a bill--and an idea--that is overdue and now the time \nhas come for the implementation.\n  As I review this conference report, I see many components that I \nfavor, and of course there are provisions that I think are softer than \nthey should have been for the good of the producer and the good of the \nNation and its economy. Positive steps have been taken in the Commodity \nprograms and in the marketing and foreign trade provisions. However, I \ndo believe that we could have provided greater flexibility for our \nproducers in some of the conservation programs.\n  I have listened to many of the Members of the Senate in the past day \ndiscuss that this will doom the future of agriculture, and that we are \nproviding welfare for the American farmer. This is truly not the case. \nThis act will provide for the future of the American farmer in a way \nthat Congress has not had the nerve to address for almost 60 years. \nThis bill will assist many young farmers to have access to the land and \nallow for the future development of agricultural production in this \ncountry.\n  I have heard many times that we have not provided for a safety net \nfor the small farmer. As I look at the programs that were enacted to \nprotect the small family farmer in the past, they have not done a very \ngood job at offering protection to these people that make their living \nof the land. In recent years, due to many circumstances, we have seen a \ndecline in the number of small family farmers.\n  What we have done is bring American agriculture into the future. Gone \nare the days that a producer can take grain to the elevator and figure \nthat the job is done as they watch the grain drop through the grate. \nAmerican producers are going to have to take an active role in \nmarketing their own products, from the field to the final product.\n  I suggest that with the passage of this bill our work has just begun. \nWe now need to work on the improvements for the future of agriculture \nin our Nation. With the passage of this measure we will finally take a \nstep toward getting Government out of the farming business. We need to \nset our sights on those areas of law and Government assistance that \nGovernment should work on. The role of Government in this new future \nwill be those areas that the individual farmer has little or no real \naccess to. The role of government in the future should be in the \ndevelopment and expansion of research assistance in the marketing in \nboth domestic and foreign markets. This is how we can and should \ndevelop the future for our producers.\n  As we place our producers in the world market, we need to provide \nthem with the tools to compete in this market. To do this we need to \noffer to them the advancements that will keep American agriculture a \nlead player in the world. At a time when we see a trend in declining \nyields, we need to provide our producers with the best research in \ndeveloping resistant crops. The market is there for them to be active \nin, but they need the tools available to them to see meaningful gains \nin the amounts that they can earn from their had labor. Just recently, \nwe have found the presence of a fungus in grain that could, if it was \nnot properly dealt with, permanently damage our access to foreign \nmarkets. I would like to commend the Department of Agriculture for the \nwork that they have done with the recent discovery of karnal bunt \nwithin our country. With a meaningful and dedicated research effort, we \ncan and should be able to find a way to develop a resistant seed to \nthis and many of the diseases that target our crops in the United \nStates.\n\n  In addition, we need to offer to our producers the understanding and \nassistance in marketing their commodities. As I have previously stated, \nmany producers think that their job is done when it reaches the \nelevator. As we move into this new program, our producers are going to \nneed the knowledge and the access to information and opportunities to \nimprove their ability to make a return on their investment. In my \ndiscussions around the State of Montana, many farmers, young and old, \nhave stated that they are glad to have the Government out of their \nbusiness. What they would like to see from Government now is a little \nassistance in learning what it takes to market their product. They do \nnot want Government directly involved. They would like assistance in \nmarketing their efforts, both here in the United States and on the \nworld market. This was one of the major reasons that I worked hard to \nhave this legislation include wording on the foreign market development \ncooperators program.\n  Finally, but not least of all, we need to address a major concern in \nthe agriculture community: tax reform. This Congress has been called \nupon by the people to institute tax reform to address the concerns of \nall Americans. Any progress that we make on this front will greatly \nbenefit the American small family farmer. Provisions must include \nchanges in the inheritance tax code, to allow more families to keep \ntheir operations in the family. For generation after generation, our \nfarm families have worked to keep their operations within the family, \nyet current tax structure seeks to penalize those people who want to \nkeep the operation in the family.\n  Another of the Tax Codes that we need to address is the capital gains \ntax. There are a great number of Montanans who would like to sell their \noperation. However, with current structure and the price of land, they \nare not in a position to put their property on the market. Action in \nthis tax will allow many new and younger farmers to move onto land that \nmay now be out of production. This must be addressed, and we must do so \nsoon.\n  We have taken the first step to address the future of American \nagriculture. It is only the first step. The future is upon us and we \nmust make the most of it for the family farmer in America. I support \nthis first step and I hope the Senate will endorse it fully for the \nproducers in the field.\n  I want to make a further comment. I think there are some areas where \nwe have to continue to work. I think the market development amendments \nwe got put in there to develop markets abroad, our foreign trade--we \nknow agricultural exports are one of the great, bright, and shining \nspots of our trade. But I think tax reform for agriculture still \nremains a very, very important part of our work to be done here on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  We had a hearing this morning on agricultural appropriations and the \nwork of the ARS. Of course, with the inspection service, we know we \nstill have problems. Sometimes we look at the funding. Maybe it is not \nquite enough in our Agricultural Research Service. We have to continue \nto do research on how do we produce food and fiber for America, this \ngreat Nation, and also, over in the area of inspection, on how do we \nisolate these very disastrous things that can happen to us in \nagriculture.\n  I will give you an example, karnal bunt now in wheat. They got it \nisolated. They knew what to do. But it is a situation that could have \ndevastated the durum wheat industry in our part of the country. In \nMontana, it is karnal bunt. All we have to do is look\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\nacross the ocean and take a look and see how important APHIS is to us, \nthe inspection service on plants and animals, when we take a look at \nEngland and the situation they are in with their ``mad cow'' situation.\n  So I congratulate the leadership on this bill. We will be supporting \nthis bill. It is a departure from even the carryover from the 1930's.\n  I thank the leadership, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, my understanding is we will go to \ndiscussion on minimum wage at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time remains on the farm issue.\n  Mr. SIMON. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the minority leader \nhas 12 minutes remaining. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me yield myself as much of that 12 \nminutes as I shall use. I shall not use the entire 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague from Montana just a few \nmoments ago spoke of something my colleague from North Dakota spoke \nabout earlier this morning. Let me just make a comment about that \ntopic. I also want to make a couple of final comments about the \nconference report that is on the floor before us.\n  My colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, and my colleague, Senator \nConrad, talked about actions Canada has taken in the last 24 hours with \nrespect to the restriction of durum, durum wheat, moving into Canada \nbecause of a fungus called karnal bunt. I have in the last couple of \nhours talked to Chief of Staff at the White House, Leon Panetta, who is \ngoing to be contacting the agriculture secretary of the trade \nambassador to talk about the actions Canada has taken. It has the \npossibility of causing some real chaos in our ability to export durum \ngrain, because that durum goes through ports on the Saint Lawrence \nSeaway that are Canadian facilities. To suggest somehow American durum \ncould not move through those facilities could have a devastating impact \non our ability to export durum grain.\n  The Canadians, I think, have created a circumstance that is \nfundamentally unfair. Karnal bunt does not survive above the 35th \nparallel, we are told by the scientists. The suggestion that they can \nuse karnal bunt as some sort of an excuse to injure our ability to \nserve export markets is, I think, a transparent attempt to create \nadvantage for themselves in international trade at our expense. I have \nasked the President to take some immediate action to respond to this \nissue.\n  But the reason I make that point now is my colleague from Montana \nmade the point about things like karnal bunt and the problem they pose \nin the marketplace. There are a whole series of things that can cause \nsignificant changes in grain prices. We had someone out here recently \ntalking about, ``Well, we have a loan rate in this bill which provides \na safety net. So there is, in fact, a safety net.'' However, the fact \nis that the loan rate in this piece of legislation creates a safety net \nthat is so far below the market price that, for family farmers to make \na living, it is not much of a safety net at all.\n\n  The point I wanted to make finally in this discussion is one about \nmarket power. I brought to the floor a story that was written following \nthe Senate passage of the farm bill. This news story says that the big \ngrain trading firms won in the U.S. Senate, the meat companies won, the \nmillers won, the grocery manufacturers won. The biggest economic \ninterests got a full plate when the Senate passed this farm bill.\n  The fact is, when the big grain trading firms win in farm policy it \nmeans family farmers lose. What happens is, you set people loose in a \nsurvival of the fittest circumstance and say, ``You just battle it out, \nout there in the marketplace,'' And what do you face in the \nmarketplace? You face grain trading firms, one of which has more \nstorage capacity in one firm than all of the wheat raised in my State, \none grain trading firm can store all the wheat that is raised in North \nDakota--that is market power.\n  Now, if you put 8 or 9 grain trading firms at the choke neck of the \nbottle through which all that grain has to move and then you say to the \n30,000 North Dakota farmers, ``Each you should compete in these \ncircumstances,'' guess who wins and guess who loses? It is not a \nsurprise. The story I showed on the floor of the Senate describes it \naccurately.\n  This bill is a major victory for the biggest grain trading firms, the \nbiggest millers, grocery manufacturers and others, because they like \nlower grain prices in the long run. They are in the marketplace in \norder to nick grain prices back, to keep them down. What does that \nmean? Family farmers cannot survive. The deck is stacked against them. \nThe odds are against them. The fact is, there will be fewer yard lights \nout there, fewer families able to live on the farm and make a decent \nliving.\n  When you see those yard lights, those economic blood vessels that \nserve small communities and create a rural life style, turn out, you \nlose something important. When those blood vessels shrink away, you \ndevastate something I think is very important in our country.\n  The reason I keep talking about family farmers is I care who farms \nthis country. It makes a difference to me. It makes a big difference to \nme, whether an corporate agrifactory is farming America from California \nto Maine, or whether America is dotted with yard lights where families \nexist out on the land, trying to make a living.\n  We had an world renowned author from North Dakota who died last year, \nwhose name was Critchfield. He wrote several wonderful books about what \nthis country gains from the rural parts of America. He talked about the \nnurturing of values that comes from the farms to the small towns and to \nthe cities, as people move in our country.\n  I think to suggest somehow that those values, which have always \nstarted at the family farm, are not important is a mistake. These \nvalues have moved their way through this country of ours--I'm talking \nabout helping one another, shared sacrifices and so on--and to suggest \nthat this is not important in our future is a regrettable oversight for \nthis country.\n  It does matter who farms in this country. If we do not have a farm \nbill that stands up for the interest of family farmers, let us not have \na farm bill at all; we do not need it. And if we have a farm bill, let \nus have a farm bill that stands up and speaks for the economic \ninterests of families out there trying to make a living. We need a farm \nbill for those trying to make a living in circumstances where, if they \nplant a seed, they may not get a crop, and if they get a crop, they may \nnot get a price. Family farmers face twin risks that no one else in \nthis country faces.\n  Time after time when international prices drop--and they will and \nthey do--family farmers go bankrupt. That is why we for years have \ndecided we will provide a basic safety net to try to give family \nfarmers a chance to survive over those price valleys.\n  This bill, for all of the huffing and puffing of those who support \nit, basically pulls the safety net out from under family farmers. Yes, \nit is attractive in the first year. Yes, there will be money in the \nfirst year, the second year and people will like it. But that money is \nlabeled ``transition money.''\n  What is the transition from? The transition is to move farmers away \nfrom a safety net. If we do this we will be left one day with more \nexpensive food produced by corporate agrifactories that farm all of \nthis country. There will be precious few lights dotting America's \nprairies because this Congress says family farmers do not matter.\n  I will make one final comment. This issue is over this year. We are a \nyear late, we are pretty short on the correct policy initiatives, but \nthis issue is not over for the long term.\n  Next year there will be a different Senate, and those of us who \nbelieve that we ought to invest in the future of family farmers will be \nhere. We will be here to give family farmers a chance to make it in a \nmarketplace where there are a lot of larger interests that want lower \nprices and do not care whether family farmers survive. Those of us who \nbelieve in a different philosophy in a different approach will be back. \nWe will be back to rewrite a farm bill\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nbased on a policy approach that is more appropriate for the long-term \neconomic interests of those families who today struggle against the \nodds.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I know of no one else who wishes to speak. \nI have been authorized by the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator \nDaschle, and the ranking member, Mr. Leahy--and I have exhausted my \ntime--to yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3039-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3091-S3100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRESIDIO PROPERTIES ADMINISTRATION ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 30 minutes equally divided \nprior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  We are talking about the minimum wage. We are talking about 12 \nmillion Americans who can benefit, and what that means to 12 million \nAmericans, people who are struggling, I do not think I need to spell \nout for most people. But unfortunately, in the U.S. Senate, we have to \nspell it out.\n  We ought to spell it out, among other things, in terms of welfare. I \nhave heard the phrase ``welfare reform'' on the floor of the Senate \nover and over again this year and last year. Let me tell you, this \nminimum wage bill will do more to help people on welfare and for \nwelfare reform than any welfare reform bill that has been before us. \nAnd it will save money for the Federal Government.\n  Once in a while, we can do the humanitarian thing and save money. We \nwill save welfare money. We will save money on the earned income tax \ncredit if this is adopted. So for people who are interested in saving \nmoney, moving toward a balanced budget, here is one practical way of \ndoing it.\n  But let me mention one other observation that I think is important, \nand that is the way we finance campaigns and distort what is taking \nplace. Probably before this session of Congress is over, we are going \nto reduce the capital gains tax. Primarily 10,000 people will benefit \nfrom that. People are going to come out with the numbers, but 60 \npercent of the benefits go to 10,000 people. But those 10,000 people \nare contributors on both sides of the aisle, and we listen to them.\n  How many of the 12 million people earning the minimum wage are big \ncampaign contributors? Virtually none. So their voice is muted in this \nprocess. We ought to today speak up for 12 million people who are not \nbig campaign contributors but need our help.\n  Mr. President, I see you are about to gavel me down, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 12 minutes 15 seconds remaining on \nyour side and 15 minutes remains on the other side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this minimum wage increase is a very \nsimple and straightforward proposition. Minimum wage right now is $4.25 \nan hour. You can work 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week and you still do \nnot make poverty wages. This is important for working families in \nMinnesota and across the country--almost 200,000 workers in my State--\nmuch less their children.\n  We are talking about a 90-cent increase over 2 years--90 cents over 2 \nyears--to try and respond to the concerns and circumstances of working \nfamilies in the United States of America, working families in \nMinnesota.\n  Let me put it another way. The U.S. Senate a few years ago voted \nitself 1 year a $30,000 increase in salary. That is almost four times \nthe total yearly income of what minimum wage workers make right now in \nour country. The U.S. Senate voted itself a $30,000 increase in 1 year, \nwhich is almost four times the total annual salary of a minimum wage \nworker and his or her family in this country, and we cannot raise the \nminimum wage for working people?\n  I do not consider this to be partisan strategy. I do not consider \nthis to be a game. I do not consider this to be tactics. People in the \nUnited States of America make it a plea that we respond to the issues \nthat they care about; that we respond to fundamental economic justice \nquestions. That a worker in our country should be able to see his or \nher wage raised from $4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour over 2 years is a \nmatter of fundamental economic justice. It is what I call a Minnesota \neconomic justice issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, thank you. I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues in asking the rest of my colleagues to join with all of us \nin voting for this increase in the minimum wage.\n  This vote is not a vote on process, it is not a vote on cloture, it \nis not a vote on who controls the Senate, it is not a vote on \nPresidential politics; it is a vote on whether or not people who are \ntoday working at the minimum wage who are at a record almost 40-year \nlow in the purchasing power of that wage are going to get a raise.\n  We hear colleagues try to make diversionary arguments: ``Well, this \nis going to lose jobs.''\n  We have heard those arguments, Mr. President. We put the minimum wage \nin America into effect in 1938 at 25 cents. Obviously, to get up to the \n$4.25, it has been raised in the meantime.\n  In 1989, we raised it here, and 89 U.S. Senators, Democrat and \nRepublican alike, joined in raising the minimum wage. We raised it each \ntime against the arguments that, ``Oh, this is going to lose us jobs.''\n  Finally, in the last 5 years, because that argument keeps being \nraised, a series of studies have been done, study after study. More \nthan two dozen of them have shown you do not lose jobs when you raise \nthe minimum wage. As long as you obviously raise it to a reasonable \nlevel, you increase employment.\n  The study by Lawrence Katz, of Harvard, and Alan Krueger, of \nPrinceton, most recently has showed what happened in New Jersey. New \nJersey, Mr. President, raised the minimum wage to a level that is well \nabove the $5.15 that we are seeking. If you had a comparable level \ntoday to what they raised it in New Jersey, it would be the equivalent \nof $5.93. We are only asking to raise it to something that is still 13 \npercent below the level the minimum wage had in the 1980's. We are not \nasking to raise it to the full level of purchasing power the minimum \nwage has had in the past.\n  America was never slowed by having it at that level in the past. We \nhave increased employment in this country. In fact, after adjusting for \ninflation, studies would show that if we raised it now to just $5.15 an \nhour, you would still be below the purchasing power level of the \nminimum wage in prior years.\n\n[[Page S3092]]\n\n  The other day we had an employer stand with us talking about the \nminimum wage. He is in the restaurant business. That is one of the \nbusinesses you most often hear about might be negatively impacted. This \nemployer not only pays more than the minimum wage in his restaurant \nbusiness, but he gives everybody in that business full health care--\nfull health care--more than the minimum wage, and he is doubling his \nbusiness every single year. He keeps the people employed. He keeps the \npeople working for him. It is good for his business. It is good for the \ncountry, Mr. President. This is fair.\n  When chief executives are getting paid more, when the stock market \ngoes up 34 percent in 1 year, when the productivity of this country \nincreases 12 percentage points over the course of the last 5 years, but \nwages only go up 2 percent, it is time to say, give those people \nworking at the least point of the economic ladder a raise. I hope we \nwill do that in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, let us not misunderstand this cloture vote today; let \nus not misunderstand what it means about the prevailing political \nagenda of the majority leadership who have consistently supported huge \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and millions of dollars in \ncorporate give-aways, but will not allow a simple up-or-down vote on \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  This cloture vote today is that vote. Some on the other side of the \naisle would have us believe that this is a vote about schedules, or \nabout Presidential politics, or about Democratic attempts to usurp \ncontrol of the Senate when, in fact, it is none of those things. It is \nthe vote on whether or not we support an increase in the minimum wage. \nIt's a vote about economic justice.\n  Mr. President, I have offered, on my part, and we, on this side, have \nall said that we would ``sit down and shut up,'' in exchange for a vote \nanytime between now and June--an honest, up-or-down vote on rasing the \nhourly wage of the poorest American workers. But even that request was \nrejected by the majority leadership. So, this is not about us--on this \nside of the aisle--taking hold of the Senate's agenda, or stalling \naction on the Presidio bill. On the contrary, it is an honest \ninsistence that we address this fundamental issue of fairness and \neconomic justice.\n  The arguments that we are hearing from the other side--that an \nincrease in the minimum wage loses jobs, that somehow giving people a \nbetter chance at survival is a bad thing--simply do not hold up on the \neconomic side or on the fairness side.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the last time we raised the minimum wage by \n90 cents over 2 years, it was with broad bipartisan support and the \nsignature of a Republican President. These arguments never came up \nthen, but now, we cannot even get the Republican majority to bring the \nissue up for a vote. It would seem to me that the only thing that has \nsignificantly changed--besides the inability of 22 million hard working \nAmericans to keep up in this economy--is the political imbalance of a \nRepublican Party sliding hopelessly to the extreme. Because--based on \nempirical evidence--the need for an increase is clear.\n  Study after study show that increasing the minimum wage helps.\n  I have brought up example after example in the last few days of young \nsingle mothers and working families in my State, trying desperately to \nfind a job that pays them enough to raise their families with dignity--\nthat pays enough to provide health care for their children, a decent \nsafe place to live--enough to afford daycare and groceries, pay the \nheat and pay the electricity. Mr. President, is that too much to ask \nfor people on the job and off the doles?\n  The evidence is clear. This increase would not be out of the range of \nincreases that have been enacted at the Federal level and in some \nStates, and the overwhelming preponderance of evidence--in studies that \nlooked at the two-step 90-cent increase in the Federal minimum at the \nturn of the decade, as well as State increases at the level of nearly \n$5.70 an hour in 1996 dollars--is that these increases do not increase \njob loss.\n  So any argument here that points to job loss as a reason for voting \nagainst giving people a raise, is, on its face, absurd. David Card, in \n``Industrial and Labor Relations Review'' in October 1992, studied the \nfirst 45-cent increase to $4.25 in the Federal minimum wage and found \nthere to be no increase in job loss. Now, that study is in 1991 \ndollars. The equivalent in 1996 dollars is $4.93--without--without \ncausing job loss.\n  Another study by Card and Alan Krueger, ``The Effect of the Minimum \nWage on the Fast Food Industry'' studied the effects of New Jersey \nincreasing its minimum wage by 80 cents, from $4.25 an hour to $5.05 an \nhour in 1992--that's $5.69 an hour in 1996 dollars--and they found that \nthe increase did not cause job loss.\n  And a specific study by David Card entitled, ``Do Minimum Wages \nReduce Employment: A Case Study of California, 1987-1989'' that looked \nat California's 90-cent increase in the minimum from $3.35 an hour in \n1987 to $4.25 an hour in 1988--that's $5.68 in 1996 dollars--has no \nsignificant impact on job loss.\n  Card concluded: ``Comparisons of grouped and individual State \ndata confirm that the rise in the minimum wage increased teenagers' \nwages. There is no evidence of corresponding losses in teenage \nemployment.''\n\n  Another study by Lawrence Katz of Harvard and Alan Krueger of \nPrinceton examined an increase on the minimum wage on the fast-food \nindustry in Texas and found that the employment effects, if anything, \nwere positive.\n  Mr. President, let us not be fooled by diversionary arguments that \nmuddy the waters. There's no correlation between increases in the \nminimum wage and job loss, and that argument should be put to rest once \nand for all.\n  Harvard labor economist Richard Freeman, in the International Journal \nof Manpower, in November 1994, said it best. He said: ``at the level of \nthe minimum wage in the 1980s, moderate legislated increases did not \nreduce employment and were, if anything, associated with higher \nemployment in some locales.''\n  He said, ``Studies based on employment across economic units such as \nStates and counties yield more disparate results. Most studies, \nhowever, reject the notion that the late 1980's and early 1990's \nincreases had adverse employment effects, and the studies that find \nadverse effects prior to those increases obtain small elasticities--\nmeaning small employment effects--which confirm the effectiveness of \nthe minimum in redistributing wage income.\n  He concluded: ``That moderate increases in the minimum wage \ntransferred income to the lower paid without any apparent adverse \neffect on employment at the turn of the 1990's is no mean achievement \nfor a policy tool in an era when the real earnings of the less skilled \nfell sharply.''\n  Freeman also observed that any net reduction in employment from a \nhigher minimum wage that might occur among teenagers would be mitigated \nby the extremely high turnover rates of these workers. So even if a \nhigher minimum wage means that it will take some low-wage workers a \nlittle longer to find jobs, once they do find a job they will benefit \nfrom the higher wages.\n  Do you know what this vote comes down to, Mr. President? It comes \ndown to whether or not to put $2,000 more in the pockets of workers. In \nthese times, is that a difficult choice? That, $2,000 more for every \nminimum wage worker in local economies. My Republican friends rail \nagainst welfare, but when it comes to being fair, mark them absent.\n  So what are we arguing about. What are my Republican colleagues \ntrying to tell us. What straws are they grasping at to create an \nargument about job loss, and teenage employment--or about the imagine \nhobgoblins that would appear if we were to give more money to the \npeople who need it most.\n  Mr. President, the truth is that raising the minimum wage to $5.15 an \nhour, according to everyone, would make up slightly more than half of \nthe ground that was lost to inflation during the 1980's. In fact, after \nadjusting for inflation, the studies show that even if we raised the \nminimum wage to $5.15 an hour it would still be 13 percent below its \naverage purchasing power during the 1970's. To have the same purchasing \npower that it had in 1996 it would have to be raised to $5.93 and we \ncertainly would not get a vote on $5.93 when we can't get one on $5.15.\n\n[[Page S3093]]\n\n  Mr. President, the purchasing power of the minimum wage is now at its \nsecond lowest level in four decades. After adjusting for inflation, the \nvalue of the minimum wage is below its level for every year--except \n1989--going all the way back to 1955.\n  To put this in perspective: as real wages for the middle-class have \nbeen stagnant, the real wages of people at the bottom end have dropped. \nAnd so the dramatic shift in wealth and obvious wage inequities in \nAmerica are contributing to an extraordinary change in worker morale.\n  To put it simply: the dreams and hopes of millions of hard-working \nAmerican families who or on the job and off the dole are at stake here. \nThis is about whether or not we understand what people are going \nthrough in this country.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about the working poor. In 1993 more \nthan half of the poor, some 22 million people, lived in households with \nsomeone who went to work everyday--8 hours a day--7 days a week. Some \n4.2 million workers in America paid by the hour in 1993 had earnings at \nor below the minimum wage. This was 6.6 percent of hourly workers. An \nadditional 9.2 million hourly workers had earnings just above the \nminimum wage.\n\n  Mr. President, these are not teenagers. These are not minorities. \nThey are, to large extent, women. Less than one-in-three, 31 percent, \nwere teenagers. About one-in-five, 22 percent, were 20 to 24 years old. \nNearly half were aged 25 and older.\n  And almost 62 percent of them were women.\n  Mr. President, who are the real losers in today's economy? Not the \ncorporate executives. Not the Republican leadership in the Senate that \nis looking to give them a massive tax cut, and reward these same \ncorporations with huge giveaways. No. The ones being left further and \nfurther behind--are working women.\n  They represent 46 percent of the paid work force, but 60 percent of \nthose working for the minimum wage. These working women cannot make \nends meet on $4.25 an hour. A single working woman with two children \ncannot pay for daycare, health care, housing, and food on subpoverty \nwages. For that family of three, the Federal poverty level is $12,500. \nAt the minimum wage that family earns only $8,500, $4,000 below the \npoverty level. Times have changed since the 1960's and 1970's when the \nminimum wage was enough to raise families up to the poverty line.\n  That imbalance is an unacceptable inequity in America. Yet, \nRepublicans in Congress are quibbling over raising the minimum to \n$5.15--even though, since 1979, the minimum wage has lost 25 percent of \nits value--while at the same time they favor a tax cut for the \nwealthiest Americans, and wonder why women who take home less than $132 \na week are forced to choose welfare over work.\n  While it may be easy for some to moralize about values and the \ndignity of work while they earn a congressional salary that is 10 times \nthe poverty level for a family of three, common sense and common \ndecency require that we look at what a single mother with a child and \n$148 a week faces in real terms, everyday. She has to hope that her \nemployer provides or subsidizes the cost of daycare. But daycare \nprograms at work are rare, particularly for minimum wage earners. \nNationally only 5 percent of employers pay for or subsidize daycare \ncosts for full time employees, and, if a mother is offered a second- or \nthird-shift job, daycare is simply not an option.\n  The Republicans response is not only to say no to increasing the \nminimum wage, but to cut food stamps, cut school lunches, and cut \nnutritional programs for underprivileged children. Yet, they ask single \nworking mothers to work hard, stay off of welfare, pay for daycare, get \na decent apartment, feed the children, pay for health care, save for \nthe future, have a good time, and make ends meet.\n  Times have, indeed, changed in the 57 years since Congress first set \nthe minimum wage at 25 cents an hour in 1938. But what has not changed \nis our pride and our spirit and our sense of hope. There are millions \nand millions of young, hard-working Americans in the vanguard of a new \nlabor movement that is no longer fighting against ruthless employers \nfor child labor laws, fair labor practices, health and safety \nstandards, decent working conditions, or an 8-hour day. I hope we have \nput those fights behind us because those labor wars were fought over \nthe most fundamental rights of people trying to work for a living and \nsurvive the unregulated power of ruthless employers.\n  Now, there is a new labor force struggling against downsizing and \ntechnology and a global economy. For them, an increase in the minimum \nwage is not too much to ask. The last time we voted to increase it, in \n1989, a Republican President and a Democratic Congress did it together. \nAnd there were none of these arguments that we are hearing today.\n  We worked together then to raise the minimum from $3.35 an hour to \n$4.25 an hour, and I was proud to have voted for it. The House passed \nit by a vote of 382 to 37 with 135 Republicans voting for the increase. \nIt passed the Senate by a vote of 89 to 8 with 36 Republicans on the \nside of common sense. We can do it again together, if common sense and \nfairness are still bipartisan virtues in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts, has 5 minutes \n50 seconds remaining on his side. There are still 15 minutes remaining \non the other side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am sorry I was distracted. I think \nthe Senator from Massachusetts suggested time run over here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was inquiring what the allocation of time was that \nremained.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, the committee that brought the Presidio \nlegislation to the floor, I want to make some very brief comments at \nthis time. I think we are all very much aware that minimum-wage \nlegislation has absolutely nothing to do with the parks package that \nincluded the Presidio, the Utah wilderness, Sterling Forest, and \nnumerous other titles. As a matter of fact, we had some 35 titles in \nthe bill that affected some 26 States.\n  It is no secret that, unfortunately, the parks package coincides with \nthe national convention of the AFL-CIO, or at least their Washington \nmeeting, and it is unfortunate for this legislation that the timing and \nthe announcement by the group that they were going to raise some $35 \nmillion to put into the campaign effort against Republicans who were up \nfor reelection. The announcement that they were clearly endorsing the \nClinton administration, provided Members on the other side the \nopportunity to put the minimum wage, which is one of labor's criteria, \non something that might move. Unfortunately, the parks package, the \nPresidio, all the 35-some odd titles, are affected.\n  The point is, Mr. President, minimum wage legislation has nothing to \ndo with this package of bills before the Senate. It has really no \nbusiness being offered or even debated while there is one of the most \nimportant environmental and conservation legislative packages before \nthe 104th Congress. Yet, they have seen fit to take advantage of this \nopportunity. They are well within their rights, but, in the opinion of \nthe Senator from Alaska, this is simply politically motivated and it is \npolitical grandstanding. We all know it, even if the media refuses to \nreport it that way.\n  It is rather interesting to see the media's comments with regard to \nthe bill and the support base concerning the adequacy of wilderness in \nUtah. Not too many people are aware of just how much a million acres of \nwilderness is in size. It is about three times the size of the State of \nRhode Island. Two million acres is about half the size of the State of \nNew Jersey. It is a pretty big hunk of real estate. In any event, in \nthis legislation, there was a provision that would have put 2 million \nadditional acres into a wilderness classification in Utah.\n  There are those who suggest that the legislation prevents the Federal \nGovernment and the Congress from making a determination that additional \nwilderness might be created. That is absolutely false, Mr. President. \nAnyone\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nwho studied the legislation, anyone who looked at the bill, and \nparticularly the media, should recognize that Congress can create more \nwilderness any time they see fit, as is evidenced by the creation of 56 \nmillion acres of wilderness in my State of Alaska.\n  So, the point I want to make at this time, Mr. President, is, as we \nlook at the status of this bill and the package in the context of its \nsignificance, this package of park-related issues constitutes the most \nsignificant single environmental package before the Senate in this \nCongress.\n  Those who criticize the package process have a responsibility for two \nthings.\n  One, ask the question why is the package needed? The answer to that \nquestion is simple. As these individual bills came before the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and were reported out, had their \nhearings, and so forth, a hold was put on virtually every one of these \n50 plus bills now found within the 35 titles of this legislation. The \nSenator from New Jersey who saw fit to hold up the entire collection of \nreported bills to negotiate his particular interests relative to the \nState of New York and the State of New Jersey. That issue was Sterling \nForest.\n  We have no problem with that, but it did force us to package all of \nthe individual bills into a single piece of legislation. Some are now \nsuggesting we take it apart. Yet we all know it will not prevail in the \nHouse if one goes and the others do not.\n  Mr. President this process has been going on for a year. Mr. \nPresident, the other interesting thing is that hundreds of thousands of \ndollars have been expended criticizing this package by unnamed, \nmotivated elitists. They do not have to report where the money comes \nfrom. They simply write full-page ads in some of the Nation's major \nnewspapers.\n  I think that is a bit irresponsible, Mr. President, they are \nresponsible to no one. They are well-financed groups that are single \nfocused.\n  They are not the people of Utah. They are not the legislature of \nUtah. They are not the delegation from Utah. They are an elitist group \nthat wants to dictate the terms and conditions under which they can \nrecreate in Utah or any other Western State.\n  I advise my colleagues that perhaps it is time to put a little \nwilderness in all of our States. We have six States that have no \nwilderness. Is there justification for that?\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I urge my colleagues to show some \nrestraint in their enthusiasm to get 5 seconds on the evening news \ntonight. Let us move forward with the most important conservation \nmeasure to come before this body. We have an opportunity to preserve \nthat magnificent Presidio, provide the necessary authority for the \nBureau of Land Management to set aside 2 million acres of new \nwilderness, and provide critical protection for other areas.\n  Mr. President this bill affects almost every single State, let us \nmove forward on this important environmental bill and leave this \nspecific amendment for the Labor Committee.\n  We need to pass the Presidio bill, Mr. President. The minimum wage \nhas no business even being on this bill. We all know it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 7 minutes and 32 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue before us is straightforward. It \nis about whether or not we are truly committed to helping working \npeople earn a livable wage.\n  Recently, we have begun to hear more concern expressed about jobs and \nwages for the working family in America. Some have newly discovered the \nproblems that working families face today: the declining purchasing \npower of their wages, increasing health care costs, and the high cost \nof child care are among those most important. But, for some of us, and \nfor the American people, this is not a new issue.\n  Unfortunately, too little has been done to address these concerns. \nToday, we have the opportunity to take an important step in the right \ndirection, by making sure that those hard-working Americans at the \nbottom of the wage ladder get closer to a fair living wage.\n  Many workers in our society work for low wages and few benefits. They \nhave virtually no bargaining power in their workplaces and any attempt \nto negotiate for higher wages is futile. For these workers, the \ngovernment has historically provided protection in the form of a \nminimum wage.\n  The Rand Corp. a highly respected think tank, recently reported what \nthey called a double dose of bad news: economic inequality is growing \nand living standards for millions are getting worse.\n  The last time we gave minimum wage workers a raise was 5 years ago \nApril 1. The current minimum wage is $4.25. In the last 5 years, \nbecause of inflation, the buying power of that wage has fallen 50 \ncents. The minimum wage is now 29 percent lower in purchasing power \nthan it was in 1979--17 years ago.\n  With this amendment, the hourly minimum wage would rise to $4.70 this \nyear and to $5.15 next year. Close to 12 million American workers would \ntake a step forward toward a more equitable living wage.\n  Remarkably, there are some in this Congress who not only would not \nincrease this wage to a fair level, but would eliminate the wage \ncompletely. But, I think that they comprise a minority. The last \nincrease had overwhelming bipartisan support. On November 8, 1989, the \nSenate passed the increase by a vote of 89 to 8. Supporting that \nincrease were the current majority and minority leaders. In the House, \nthis bill passed by a vote of 382 to 37. Voting yes were the current \nSpeaker of the House and the minority leader. Of course, the bill was \nsigned into law by President George Bush.\n  The results of Rand's study demonstrate once again that the economic \nsqueeze is real. Discounting inflation, the study shows that the median \nincome of families fell more than $2,700 over 4 years to about $27,000 \nin 1993. People at the lower rungs of the economic ladder have had it \nthe worst.\n  These figures illustrate that although our economy is growing and \nunemployment is relatively low, working families are confronting \ndifficult and uncertain times. This amendment would provide a modest \nboost in earnings for many of these households.\n  A higher minimum wage could help reverse the growing wage inequality \nthat has occurred since the seventies. A raise in the minimum wage is \nnot only good for workers, but it is also good for business.\n  The minimum wage is now at a lower level in terms of purchasing power \nthan it has been in three or four decades. That means minimum wage \nworkers buy less. More money in the pockets of workers means more \ndollars circulating in the local economy.\n  While some claim a moderate increase in the minimum wage will cost \njobs, leading economists find little evidence of loss of employment. \nInstead, they find that a ripple effect could expand the impact beyond \nthe immediate minimum wage workforce. Some workers in low-wage jobs who \ncurrently earn more than the minimum wage may see an increase in their \nearnings as minimum wages rise.\n  As the richest nation on Earth, our minimum wage should be a living \nwage, and it is not. When a father or mother works full-time, 40 hours \na week, year-round, they should be able to lift their family out of \npoverty. Sadly, even the proposed $5.15 an hour will not do that. But, \nour proposal makes an important stride toward assuring that work is \nmore profitable than welfare.\n  A minimum wage hike rewards work and lessens the burden of \ndependency. The current minimum wage is actually about $2 an hour less \nthan what a family of four needs to live above the poverty line. At \n$4.25 an hour, you earn $680 a month, gross. That's $8,160 per year. \nThe poverty line for a family of four is $15,600 per year.\n  Adults who support their families would be the prime beneficiaries of \nour proposal to raise the minimum wage. Nearly two-thirds of minimum \nwage earners are adults and more than one-third are the sole \nbreadwinners. Nearly 60 percent of the full-time minimum wage earners \nare women. Often these are women bringing home the family's only \npaycheck.\n  We must puncture the myth that a minimum wage hike would only help \nteens holding down part-time jobs after school. An increase in the \nminimum wage would improve the standard of\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nliving for many working Americans who live paycheck to paycheck, trying \nto get a foothold on the American dream. In reality, almost half of \nminimum wage earners work full-time while only one-fifth work less than \nhalf time. Only a quarter are teenagers.\n  In 32 States, including Michigan, over 10 percent of the workforce \nwould benefit directly from an increase in the minimum wage. Workers \nwho now earn less than $5.15 per hour stand to gain immediately. An \nanalysis by the Economic Policy Institute finds 10.5 percent of all \nMichigan voters, more than 420,000 workers, are in this group.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is work should pay, and the current \nminimum wage is not enough to live on. The minimum wage is a floor \nbeneath which no one should fall. But we should make sure that standing \non that floor, a person can reach the table. A full-time minimum wage \njob should provide a minimum standard of living in addition to giving \nworkers the dignity that comes with a paycheck. Hard-working Americans \ndeserve a fair deal.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity today to clarify \nmy position on the pending Kennedy amendment to increase the minimum \nwage. As with any debate that takes place in this Chamber, we debate \nboth the merits of a particular legislative initiative as well as, and \nequally important, the procedures and timing of bringing a legislative \ninitiative to the floor for debate.\n  Mr. President, last year during debate on S. 1357, the Balanced \nBudget Act adopted by this Congress, I supported a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution to debate and vote on the merits of increasing the minimum \nwage. While I have been supportive of past minimum wage increases, I \ndon't believe H.R. 1296, the Presidio Act, the underlying bill \ncurrently being considered, provides a proper vehicle to increase the \ncurrent minimum wage. This bill, and the fact that the pending \namendment prevents further consideration of this bill, is not conducive \nto properly address some of its more contentious issues regarding a \nminimum wage increase.\n  For example, just as minimum wage opponents may believe the highest \nproportion of low-wage workers to be young people, proponents of a \nhigher minimum wage often portray the minimum wage work force as \nlargely adult and, therefore, much more in need of an increase. \nHowever, we must recognize that this debate hinges upon how one defines \nyouth. If, for example, one defines a youth as between 16 and 19 years \nof age, then about 36 percent of workers, paid hourly at the minimum \nwage, are youths and 64 percent adults. However, if one adopts a \ndefinition of youth as one between 16 and 24 years of age, then about \n60 percent of the work force at the Federal minimum wage are youths and \nonly 40 percent are adults. Indeed, this discrepancy alone warrants \nfurther debate.\n  Mr. President, this brings me to the second, and equally important \nissue, that of the procedure and timing of this discussion. I believe \nthis debate on the minimum wage deserves to be debated as a vehicle \nunto itself, and not as a proposal to be attached to each and every \nlegislative initiative that comes up on the floor in this Chamber, in \nthis case H.R. 1296, the Presidio legislation.\n  The procedure of appending the minimum wage initiative to H.R. 1296, \nin my view Mr. President, is to attach a nongermane element to a bill \nthat deserves to be debated on its own merits. In this case, it is a \nbill that has several elements that are important to my State of \nColorado.\n  As a small business owner and former minimum wage laborer, I can \ntruly understand where both sides of this debate are coming from. While \na compromise increase of 45 cents over 2 years is something I would \nconsider, Congress should approach this issue with full deliberation; \nover 80 million workers are covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act's \nminimum wage, and its impacts would undoubtedly be far reaching.\n  Therefore, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this issue \nin the future, and I am hopeful a more suitable legislative vehicle \nwill be found in which we can properly address the issue of raising the \nFederal minimum wage.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \namendment on behalf of American workers and American families.\n  Here in Washington, and on the campaign trail we hear a lot of talk \nabout corporate downsizing, stagnant wages, and worker anxiety. \nThroughout this country, American workers and their families are \nfrustrated and anxious of what the future might bring.\n  And, if we're going to do more than pay lip service to these issues, \nif we're going to be serious about helping those Americans that work \nhard and play by the rules then this amendment should pass by a \nunanimous vote.\n  Today, with this measure we have a genuine opportunity, on behalf of \nmillions of American workers, to turn the minimum wage into a true \nliving wage.\n  Today, the real value of the minimum wage is at its second lowest \npoint in 40 years--$4.25 an hour.\n  Now, I want every person in this room to consider living on $4.25 a \nhour; or, living on $36 a day. That's an annual income of $8,500 a \nyear--well below the poverty level for a family of three, which is \n$12,500.\n  How can any American expect to bring themselves out of poverty or \npull themselves up by their bootstraps when they're expected to raise a \nfamily on $8,500 a year?\n  Over the past year I've heard a lot of talk from the other side of \nthe aisle about encouraging responsibility and a strong work ethic \namong our Nation's welfare recipients. I think it's something we can \nall agree upon.\n  But, it is utter hypocrisy to talk about encouraging self-sufficiency \nand responsibility while we ask our Nation's poorest citizens to live \non a meager wage of $36 a day.\n  Let us be clear, the people affected by the minimum wage aren't high-\nschool kids flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. I can see why people \nwould like to believe that: it certainly makes it easier to oppose this \namendment.\n  We're talking about child care workers, waiters and waitresses, \ntelemarketers, custodians, salesclerks, and the list goes on and on.\n\n  The fact is, more than 73 percent of those affected by the minimum \nwage are adults. More than 47 percent are full-time workers. Four in \nten are the sole earner for their families and nearly one in five \ncurrently lives in poverty.\n  What's more, nearly 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women, \nmore than three-quarters of whom are adults. That's 5.2 million adult \nwomen, many of whom are also busy raising children who would be \ndirectly affected if we pass this amendment.\n  These figures represent millions of American workers who are just \nable to keep their heads above water, who are barely subsisting at \nthree-fourths the level of poverty.\n  For them this amendment isn't about politics or partisan games--this \nis about economic survival.\n  Now, my colleagues from across the aisle often use the argument that \nraising the minimum wage will cost jobs. But study after study has \nshown that this is a fallacious argument.\n  Studies done after the minimum wage was raised in 1990 demonstrate \nthat not only did it have a negligible effect on job loss, but in some \nlocales it actually brought higher employment.\n  The fact is, a higher minimum wage is not only a stronger incentive \nto work, but it reduces turnover, increases productivity, and lowers \ncost for retraining and recruiting.\n  And, the fact is we're not even talking about an enormous increase--\nonly 90 cents an hour. And, while 90 cents may not seem like a lot to \nmost people, it represents $1,800 in potential income for American \nworkers.\n  For a family struggling to make ends meet, a simple 90-cent-an-hour \nincrease in the minimum wage would pay for 7 months of groceries, or 1 \nyear of health care costs, or more than a year's tuition at a 2-year \ncollege.\n  And if you don't believe me, listen to the experts. According to a \nrecent study by economists William Spriggs and John Schmitt: ``The \noverwhelming weight of recent evidence supports the view that low-wage \nworkers will benefit overwhelmingly from a higher Federal minimum \nwage.''\n  And that's the choice we have before us today: To raise the minimum \nwage and make a real difference in the lives of close to 12 million \nAmerican workers.\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\n  If we want to be serious about moving welfare recipients to work, if \nwe want to calm the fears of anxious workers, if we want to provide \neconomic opportunity for every American we have a solemn commitment to \npass this amendment and raise the minimum wage for American workers.\n  In the past, this body has, in a bipartisan manner, overwhelmingly \nsupported increasing the minimum wage. The last time we raised it in \n1989, the Senate voted 89 to 8.\n  Indeed, Senator Dole, who I often hear talking about the importance \nof working families on the campaign trail, was a key supporter of \nraising the minimum wage in 1989.\n  Well, I hope Senator Dole and all my colleagues continue the \nbipartisan tradition of supporting the minimum wage and join me in \nbacking this critically important amendment for American workers.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kennedy amendment \nto raise the minimum wage.\n  This amendment presents the Senate with a unique opportunity to \naddress one of the most pressing anxieties for America's lower and \nmiddle-class workers--stagnant wages. By passing this amendment, \nCongress can take a small step to help reverse the shrinking purchasing \npower and suppressed living standards of America's lowest paid workers.\n  The amendment before us would allow some of the hardest working \nAmerican's to make a better life for themselves and their families. It \nwould increase the minimum wage from the current level of $4.25 to \n$5.15 over 2 years. Granting a 90 cent wage increase over 2 year's will \nnot solve the economic problems of the working class nor will it break \nthe bank; but it will help working families.\n  Mr. President, over 12 million workers would directly benefit from an \nincrease in the minimum wage--over 210,000 of those workers live in \nWisconsin.\n  Contrary to assertions of minimum wage opponents, this amendment \nwould not wreak havoc on job availability. In fact, a large group of \nprominent economists, including three Nobel prize winners, recently \nendorsed a minimum wage increase. These economists assert that the \nmoderate Federal minimum wage increase will not significantly \njeopardize employment opportunities. The Kennedy amendment represents \nsuch a moderate increase.\n  Mr. President, the plight of the American worker has received more \nattention in speeches during recent political primaries than through \nthe policy decisions of the 104th Congress. During the first session of \nthe 104th Congress, we have seen proposals to cut education, job \ntraining, and workplace safety programs. Perhaps most inexcusable are \nthe severe cuts proposed in the earned income tax credit for low paid \nworking Americans. These are the same workers who are held down by the \nartificially low minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, the economy appears healthy, unemployment is down and \nmillions of jobs have been created over the past 3 years. Yet the \naverage American worker remains uneasy. Real wages have become stagnant \nand many Americans have discovered that their standard of living has \ndecreased over the years.\n  It has been almost 5 years since the minimum wage has been increased. \nStudies indicate that after the minimum wage was increased in 1991, the \nreal value of the wage has fallen by nearly 50 cents. Furthermore, the \nreal value of the minimum wage is 29 percent lower than it was in 1979. \nIf this trend continues, the value of the minimum wage will plummet to \na 40-year low by 1997.\n  The importance of increasing the minimum wage looms even larger today \nas Congress attempts to balance the budget and cut spending for \nwelfare, worker education and training, the earned income tax credit, \nchild care and other resources that families use to stay afloat \neconomically. To deny America's lowest paid workers a sustaining wage \nduring a time of substantial budget cuts simply represents misguided \npriorities. This is precisely the time when we need to reward the \npeople who work. If we are going to cut funding for education and \ntraining, we must provide individuals with the economic tools necessary \nto get ahead.\n  The last minimum wage increase under President Bush enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to undertake a \nsimilar bipartisan effort today and demonstrate their commitment to \nworking families by restoring the fair value of the minimum wage. It is \ntime for Congress to remove this issue from Presidential politics and \ntake real legislative action to address the economic problems facing \nthe American worker.\n  Raising the minimum wage will not solve all of the problems of low-\nwage workers, but it will go far in demonstrating that Congress can act \nto help those on the lowest rung of the economic ladder. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture and pass the minimum wage increase.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support raising the minimum wage \nover the next 2 years, from its current $4.25 per hour to $5.15 per \nhour, because I believe in the American dream and I believe in family \nvalues.\n  If a person works hard and diligently, he or she should succeed. This \nis a deeply held belief in this country and one which I share--this is \nthe American dream. And if a person works hard and diligently, he or \nshe should be able to care for family--this is family values.\n  Today, 12 million Americans earn the minimum wage. In my State alone, \nover 10 percent of the workforce earns the minimum wage--545,647 \nIllinoisans earn $4.25 an hour. This means that an Illinoisan, working \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns only $8,840.\n  These workers are not just young people working at their first job--\nalthough young people often contribute to their family's income. The \nmajority of the people earning minimum wage--73 percent--are adults. \nMany of these are parents raising families on under $9,000 a year--\nstill eligible for food stamps. It is a travesty that a mother or \nfather working full-time-- 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--cannot \nsupport a family.\n  As we continue to purge the welfare roles of children and their \nmothers, we should remember that close to 60 percent of those earning \nminimum wage are women. These are women who are taking responsibility \nfor themselves and their children. These are women who are trying to \nmake it on their own. These are women who go to work every single day. \nAnd still, minimum wage does not provide them with a living wage for \ntheir family.\n  This legislation would not overcompensate workers. It has been almost \n5 years since the minimum wage was last increased. Prices have \nincreased over the last 5 years, as I'm sure anybody who has bought a \ncarton of milk or a dozen eggs lately can tell you.\n  In this country, we increasingly face a declining standard of living \nfor working people. In the 1980's, 80 percent of Americans did not \nimprove their standard of living. While the average wage increased 67 \npercent, the average price of a home increased by 100 percent, the \naverage price of a car increased 125 percent, and the cost of a year in \ncollege increased by 130 percent. And the minimum wage increased by \nonly 23 percent.\n  If a 90-cent increase in minimum wage had been part of the Contract \nWith America, by today, a full-time worker earning the minimum wage \nwould have earned an additional $2,000. That money could pay more than \n7 months of groceries, rent or mortgage for 4 months, a full year of \nhealth care costs, or 9 months of utility bills. The money would make a \nworld of difference to a family--and it is money that the employee \nearned.\n  And paying a living wage does not mean that jobs will be lost as \nopponents of increasing the minimum wage claim. Last year a group of \nrespected economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, concluded \nthat an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour will have \npositive effects on the labor market, workers, and the economy.\n  Workers are our greatest resource. The American worker is what has \nmade this country great. We should recognize the contributions of our \nworkers and reward those who work long and hard to earn a living. And \nwe must make certain that parents working full-time can support their \nfamilies. If a parent working full-time cannot keep a family above \npoverty, a child will learn about the American nightmare, not the \nAmerican dream.\n  Let us today show that America rewards work, that Americans who try\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\nhard can succeed, that America's families are important to us. A living \nminimum wage is a sign of a just and decent society. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for cloture and for this modest increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this one is real simple. If you raise the \nminimum wage, you provide working people with a higher salary and a \nbetter standard of living. And so I come here in very strong support \nfor the minority leader's effort to give working people a raise by \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n\n\n                             BUTTE SAFEWAY\n\n  Over the years, Butte, MT, has seen more than its share of hard \ntimes. When the mines closed, a lot of people said it was curtains for \nButte. But those people had obviously not spent much time in Butte.\n  Through a lot of hard work, resourcefulness, and community spirit, \nthe folks in Butte fought to rebuild their economy. And they did it. \nThe economic success story that is Butte today is a great example of \nwhat can happen when people come together, play by the rules, and work \nhard.\n  A few weeks ago, I was in Butte. I spent some time at the Safeway \nstore just listening to people. And I was struck by what a young woman \nnamed Rhonda had to say. She was in her early 20's; friendly, \nenergetic, and bright. And like most people that age, she was also \nanxious to build a better future for herself. But she told me, ``Max, I \nam having a hard time making ends meet on minimum wage. I work hard, \nbut it's just not enough.''\n  A whole lot of Montanans feel just the same. They see their wages \nincreasing too slowly to keep up with the cost of living. They find it \nharder and harder to save money to send their children to college.\n  In fact, according to a recent study, over 52,000 Montana workers--\nmore than the entire population of Lewis and Clark County, Montana's \nsixth largest county--would find it a little easier to make ends meet \nif we raised the minimum wage to just $5.15 per hour.\n\n\n                      FALLING WAGES, RISING COSTS\n\n  The experts confirm this. A recent Paine-Webber analysis shows that \nreal wages in America have declined from $7.55 per hour in 1990 to \n$7.40 in 1995.\n  We're getting the worst of it in Montana. Our wage growth has been \nslower than virtually any other State in the Nation. Let me point to a \nfew startling Montana statistics to prove my point:\n  The purchasing power of the average Montana family has actually \nfallen by $700 over the last 10 years;\n  In 1980, Montana's average personal income ranked 33 in the Nation. \nBut today we've slipped to 41;\n  And the cost of living continues to climb--particularly when it comes \nto housing costs. Just 5 years ago, the average price of a Montana home \nwas about $48,000. But today that figure has increased by 30 percent to \n$68,500.\n\n\n                     NEED THE RIGHT KIND OF CHANGES\n\n  The people who suffer most from this wage stagnation are the middle \nclass--the backbone of America. People who work hard. Pay taxes. \nVolunteer in their communities. When they suffer, the whole country \nsuffers. Because if our middle class cannot afford homes, or cars, or \ncollege educations for the children--ultimately American businesses and \nAmerica itself will be weaker.\n  Congress is not going to solve these problems all by itself. But \nthere are some things Congress can do to help.\n  We need to cut the tax burden on working families. Not by giving new \ntax breaks to corporations that are already profitable, but by giving a \ntax deduction for college expenses, so more families can afford college \nand more children can qualify for high-paying jobs in demanding fields.\n  We need to make sure family businesses can stay in the family, by \nreducing the estate and gift tax substantially.\n  We need to balance the budget, in the right way. Not by threatening \nretirement and health security. Not by threatening the next \ngeneration's prosperity by cutting college loans and vocational \neducation. But by a more serious effort to attack fraud and abuse in \nGovernment health care programs, by sticking to the Defense \nDepartment's recommendations on security rather than tacking on pork \nprograms, and by resisting the temptation to create new loopholes and \ndeductions for profitable companies.\n\n\n                         RECORD OF THE CONGRESS\n\n  So these are the people Congress is here to help. And I think it's \nfair to say that at the beginning of 1995, a lot of Montanans felt this \nCongress might help. There was a lot of new blood and some new ideas, \nand people had some high hopes.\n\n  But those hopes have vanished in the mess of bumbling revolutionary \nexperiments and Government shutdowns which the leadership in the House \nhas created. Rather than make people a little more prosperous and \nsecure, the Congress seems to have deliberately done just the opposite.\n  When Speaker Gingrich, for example, was angry about his seating \nassignment on Air Force One a few months back, he shut down Yellowstone \nand Glacier National Park, along with most of the rest of the \nGovernment, to take revenge. That drove small businesses in the gateway \ncommunities to the edge of bankruptcy. And it threatened to put Park \nService employees and Government research scientists on welfare.\n\n\n                            A SECOND CHANCE\n\n  So the leadership in this 104th Congress has let our State down \npretty badly. All too often, rather than do something good and positive \nfor the people, it has done something irrational and destructive.\n  But we are here today to offer the folks in charge a second chance.\n  By adopting this amendment, we will give hard-working people a raise. \nPlain and simple. A 90-cent-an-hour raise in the minimum wage, from \n$4.25 an hour to $5.15 an hour. That is something concrete for people \nlike Rhonda. People who are working hard and finding they can't make \nit.\n  For a young woman working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage, this \namendment means a raise of 90 cents per hour. That means almost $2,000 \nmore in the pocket every year. And it means a bump along the wage scale \nthat will give some help to Rhonda's co-workers with a bit more \nseniority--the men and women struggling to provide for their families \non $6 or $7 an hour.\n\n\n                  OPPOSITION TO MINIMUM WAGE MISGUIDED\n\n  I know some around here don't like the idea. But if they'll step back \nand look again, they'll find that the opposition to a minimum wage \nincrease boils down to one idea: higher wages are bad for the country.\n  I simply can't accept that. America cannot prosper by keeping a lid \non the prosperity of most of our families. That doesn't make sense.\n  So by putting party ideology aside, the majority here can rebuild \nsome of the credit it has squandered in the past year and a half. It \ncan do some good for honest, deserving working people like Rhonda. And \nthat is what we ought to do.\n  This minimum wage increase is a chance for Congress to show some \ncommon sense. Some independence from elitist supply-side ideologs. The \ncourage to do what we all know is right.\n  Let's agree to this amendment and give America a raise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to vote for cloture and end this \nunconscionable Republican filibuster against the minimum wage. Senate \nDole is leading this filibuster. He is the one who can end it. It is \nhis decision.\n  Thumbs up, and 13 million wage earners get their first pay raise in 5 \nyears. Thumbs down, and 13 million minimum wage workers go on living in \npoverty, because the minimum wage is not a living wage. A hard day's \nwork deserves a fair day's pay. No one who works for a living should \nhave to live in poverty.\n  Senator Dole locks up the nomination, and the first thing he does is \nlock out the 13 million Americans who are only asking for the fair \nminimum wage they deserve. Stock prices are going right up through the \nroof, and the minimum wage is falling through the basement. That is not \nfair. It is not acceptable.\n  Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole make a remarkable couple. It is \nlike Bonnie and Clyde writing the Republican platform. Newt Gingrich \nwants to repeal the ban on assault weapons,\n\n[[Page S3098]]\n\nand Bob Dole wants to block any increases in the minimum wage. \nDemocrats do not share those appalling priorities and neither do the \nvast majority of the American people.\n  Who are the minimum wage workers? The vast majority are not \nteenagers. More than two-thirds are adults, 59 percent are women. \nMinimum wage workers are nurses aides caring for patients, child-care \nworkers caring for young children, garment workers, retail clerks, \njanitors cleaning office buildings.\n  Last year, we heard the story of Tonya Outlaw. She had been teaching \nat a child care center in Windsor, NC, for 4 years making the minimum \nwage. She left a high-paying job because she could not afford the child \ncare for her own two daughters. Earning only $4.25 an hour, she cannot \nafford medicine for her family. She lives with her uncle and sister. \nEvery bill is a struggle. Why are the Republicans filibustering against \ngiving the raise that she deserves?\n  David Dow was 23 years old when I met him last year working for a \npizza chain, in Southfork, PA, working for the minimum wage, struggling \nto support his 2-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. His wife works \nfor telemarketing, just above the minimum wage. They have no health \ninsurance, are repaying college loans, and cannot afford child care. \nThey work different shifts and see each other for an hour or two a day, \nexcept on weekends.\n  This is America in 1996. Who are the Republicans kidding? David Dow \nneeds the pay raise the Republicans are filibustering.\n  The question is, whose side are you on? You cannot have it both ways. \nWe cannot be for working Americans and their families and against \nmaking the minimum wage a decent wage. You cannot be concerned about \ndeclining living standards for American families and the widening \nincome gap between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else, and then \ndeny a fair increase in the minimum wage.\n  Congress has not voted to raise the minimum wage in 5 years. At least \nthree times since that last increase, the Senate has given themselves a \npay increase. We take care of the privileged. Surely it is time to take \ncare of those at bottom of the economic ladder.\n  It is shocking that the longstanding bipartisan support for raising \nthe minimum wage has disappeared. The last vote in the Senate in 1989 \nwas 89-8 in favor of a 90-cent increase in the minimum wage.\n  The economy is healthier in 1996 than it was in 1989. Inflation and \nunemployment are lower. Corporate profits and the stock market are at \nrecord highs.\n  Bob Dole and all but a handful of Republican Senators were in the \nmainstream in 1989 and voted to make the minimum wage a fair wage. The \nquestion now is, why have they changed?\n  I withhold the balance of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on \nthis side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes and thirty-two seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield my remaining time to the Senator from \nOklahoma after I make a few remarks.\n  Mr. President, I think it is interesting to reflect that the attack \nnow is being made on the majority leader as a consequence of the fact \nthat he is the designee, Republican nominee for President.\n  The comment has been made that there is a filibuster going on. I do \nnot know that there is a filibuster going on. We voted yesterday on \ncloture. We will vote today on cloture, but, instead, the attack is on \nthe majority leader. I resent that.\n  Mr. President, the amendment today being offered would raise the \nminimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15, a 20-percent increase over 2 years. \nNow, our Democratic friends suggest that this would be very meritorious \nand everybody would be a winner. They are accommodating, obviously, the \ninterests of the unions. Of course, those members are virtually all in \nthe unions, receiving a wage much higher than the minimum wage. But \nlook at what they are not addressing and the consequences associated \nwith that.\n  That is why I oppose the amendment, because of the danger that it is \ngoing to foreclose job opportunities precisely for those who we want to \nhelp. They do not mention that. Increasing the minimum wage will raise \nthe lower rung of the economic ladder and leave behind those just \ntrying to get a foothold with their first job. They will not be hired \nand we all know it.\n  The amendment, though well-intentioned, will cause a loss of entry-\nlevel jobs. It will limit job opportunities for low-skilled workers. \nThis will not help raise the standard of living for the poor. They do \nnot even want to address that in the discussion.\n  The U.S. Senate cannot repeal the law of supply and demand. Common \nsense tells us we cannot make it more expensive to hire new workers and \nthen expect employers to hire the same number of workers. Experience \nhas shown when we raise the minimum wage, employers hire fewer workers \nand substitute new machinery and new technology in place of those \nworkers. That is why we pump our own gas today. That is why we pay with \na credit card rather than have a gas attendant do the job, wash our \nwindows. It is why we bus our own trays in the fast food restaurants.\n  Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, this is not a win-win-win. \nAs a consequence, the appropriateness of putting this on the parks \nbill, the most significant environmental measure to come before this \nbody, is simply unconscionable. It is political opportunism at its \nworst. The fact that it is directed at the majority leader is \nabsolutely uncalled for.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, for, one, his statement, but also for maybe \none of the most important things he said: This amendment has nothing to \ndo with the national parks. It does not belong on this bill.\n  You might say, well, why is it on this bill? Why was it offered by my \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts to put on this bill? I will \ntell you. In my opinion, it is all about politics. It is not about \nincreasing minimum wage. If my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwanted to increase the minimum wage, they controlled this body in 1993, \nin 1994. They controlled the White House. They could have done it at \nthat time. They had that right. They had the votes. The majority leader \ncould have called it up any time. They did not do it.\n  Why did they do it now? Well, Presidential politics. Plus, I noticed \nan article in the paper that says the AFL-CIO endorses Clinton and \napproves a $35 million political program. They want to run a lot of \nindependent expenditures, all against Republicans. It is all about \npolitics. It does not belong on this bill. We should reject this \namendment.\n  What is the substance of the amendment? The substance of the \namendment is, it says if you make less than $5.15 an hour, you should \nnot have a job. Not only should you not have a job, you cannot have a \njob. An increase in the minimum wage says it is against the Federal law \nfor you to have a job if you make less than $5.15. You cannot have a \njob.\n\n  I do not care if my friends from the States of Massachusetts, New \nYork, or North Dakota want to increase the minimum wage to $10 an hour \nin their States; let them do it. I do not think they should do it in my \nState because they are going to put some people out of work. I heard \nthem say that it has no adverse economic impact and maybe it will \nincrease jobs. If that is the case, let us increase minimum wage to $10 \nan hour. I do not want everybody to make just $5 an hour; I want \neverybody to make more than $5 an hour. Why not $10 or $20 an hour? If \nwe can repeal the law of economics, if it makes no difference \nwhatsoever economically, let us make it more because I want people to \nmake a lot more money. I am not against people getting a raise. I want \nthat.\n  But I do not want to raise the minimum wage and say it is against the \nlaw for you to have a job if the best thing\n\n[[Page S3099]]\n\nyou can get is $4.50 or $4.75. I have kids that make that amount of \nmoney. We are going to pass a law that says they cannot have a job if \nit does not pay $5.15. If the infinite wisdom of Washington, DC, says, \n``If you do not have a job that pays at least $5.15 an hour, you should \nnot have a job,'' and that person cannot get a job and they are idle, \nthen what are they doing? A lot of times they end up involved in crime \nor involved in mischief. That is ridiculous. And they do not learn a \ntrade or a new skill.\n  I worked for minimum wage. I do not make any bones about it. I worked \nfor minimum wage after my wife and I were married, 27\\1/2\\ years ago. \nWe made $1.60 an hour. I needed more, but it was enough. I quit that \njob and started my own janitor service. I learned a trade, and I hired \na lot of people, and they all made more than minimum wage. Why in the \nworld should we set an arbitrary level, a higher level, and say, ``If \nyou do not meet this level, you cannot have a job? Uncle Sam says we \nwould rather have you be idle if you cannot meet at least this \nstandard.'' I think that is ridiculous.\n  I think the Senator's amendment is wrong in its substance. It is \nnothing but a political act of appeasement or trying to make organized \nlabor leaders happy. Thank you very much for your $35 million. You are \ngoing to get a great program. We are going to try to embarrass Bob Dole \nand see if we cannot come up with a great program to thank you for your \nmoney. I think that is blatant political abuse and should be rejected. \nI hope it is rejected.\n  My colleagues on the other side know this amendment is not going to \nbecome law. They hope to score some political points, and I hope they \nwill not be successful.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 12 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 12 seconds.\n  Bob Dole, March 28, 1974:\n\n       I am pleased to support the conference report on the \n     minimum wage bill. A living wage for a fair day's work is a \n     hallmark of the American economic philosophy.\n\n  May 17, 1989, Bob Dole on the floor of the Senate:\n\n       I have said, as a Republican, I am not going to stand here \n     and say you can live on $3.25 an hour, or $4.55 an hour.\n\n  Bob Dole on the Senate floor, April 11, 1989:\n\n       To be sure, I am all for helping the working poor. I have \n     spent most of my public life supporting causes on behalf of \n     the working poor, and no one would deny that the working poor \n     are the ones who most deserve a wage increase.\n\n  Mr. President, where is that Bob Dole? Where is that Bob Dole? I hear \nfrom my colleagues that they resent the fact that this is being offered \non this particular bill. I want to tell you that it does not make a \ndifference whether any Senator resents it in here. The people who \nresent us not doing this have a right to, and they are the men and \nwomen not getting it. They are the ones who ought to feel the \nresentment by our failure to provide a decent wage, a livable wage, for \nworking 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be very unfortunate if someone cast \nthis as anything other than what it is--unless we act soon, we will be \nat the lowest point in terms of purchasing power that we have been in \nour Nation's history when it comes to the minimum wage. That is a fact.\n  This is not an effort to encumber an environmental bill, as troubling \nas one aspect of that bill is. It has nothing to do with Presidential \npolitics, it has nothing to do with labor unions. It has everything to \ndo with the fact that the economic foundation for working families in \nthis country has been, is now, and will continue to be the minimum \nwage. That is a fact. A fair minimum wage is an economic foundation for \nworking families, period.\n  Seventy-three percent of those who would benefit from this minimum \nwage increase are adults. Almost three out of every four people; not \njust those getting started in life, or just out of high school or \ncollege. They are people struggling to make ends meet with a family. \nAnd 40 percent of those on minimum wage today are the sole \nbreadwinners.\n  Let us put an end to the stereotype of the teenager flipping \nhamburgers so he can buy a car, or somehow get started right out of \nschool. The face of a typical minimum wage worker is a woman working \nfull time or part time to support her family, a single mother working \n40 hours a week, and concluding at the end of every week or month when \nshe tries to pay the bills that she is still living in poverty. A \nminimum wage increase could help, at long last, after 5 years, pull her \nat least a little bit out of the depths of concern that she has about \nthe economic and financial problems she is facing. A 90-cent increase, \nwhich is what this bill would do, provides $1,800 more in a year's \ntime. And 45 cents does not sound like a whole lot, but when you \ncombine 45 cents this year and next, over a period of time you find \nthat it buys more than 7 months worth of groceries, 1 year of health \ncare, including insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and other out-\nof-pocket costs.\n  This increase will buy 4 months rent or mortgage payments. This \nincrease pays 9 months of utility bills. So do not let anybody mislead \nyou. This is not just a minuscule amount for a lot of people. This is \nwhether people can eat or have the ability to pay their bills. That is \nwhat we are talking about here.\n  The increase in the minimum wage is obviously just a piece of it. The \nearned-income tax credit is also a very important part. We have faced, \nthroughout this last 14 months, efforts by many of our Republican \ncolleagues to cut the earned-income tax credit. They tell us that they \nought to go out and find a job, they do not need the EITC, they ought \nto rely on the marketplace to find, somehow, an increase in wages \nthere. If we are going to rely upon the marketplace, we better have a \nliving wage to do that. The minimum wage can only be the beginning for \nmany of these working families.\n  Republicans often tell us they want to move people off welfare and on \nto work, and we share that view, that desire, that goal. What do you \ntell people who work 40 hours a week and are still below the legal \nlevel of poverty in this country? How is that an encouragement to tell \npeople to get off welfare? Restoring the minimum wage to a working wage \nis one of the best ways you get people off of welfare.\n  Five years, Mr. President, is a long time. In that 5 years, we have \nhad increases in our wages. Just about every CEO in this country has \nseen dramatic increases in their wages. I do not deny them that. In \nmany cases, they truly deserve it. On April 1, we will see the fifth \nanniversary of the last increase in the minimum wage. We have seen a \n20-year period of wage stagnation, and the gap between the richest and \npoorest in this country has never been wider. The stratification in \nthis country has to be something this Senate addresses.\n  A higher minimum wage is the least we can do to begin dealing \neffectively with that stratification. The real value of the minimum \nwage has fallen by nearly 50 cents since 1991, and by 29 percent since \n1979. If we do not act right now, the real value will be at a 40-year \nlow by January 1997.\n  This is not just a matter affecting a few people, Mr. President; 12 \nmillion working people will benefit directly by what we are going to \ndecide this afternoon. In 32 States, it is over 10 percent of the work \nforce. In study after study, in spite of all the denials you hear from \nour Republican friends--nearly two dozen in all, not one or two--have \nshown that a moderate increase in the minimum wage can be achieved \nwithout costing jobs. That is not our assertion. That is not something \nwe just postulate about. This is something that actually has been \nexamined in case after case after case, and in every single case it has \nbeen reported that you can raise the minimum wage at a moderate level \nand not cost jobs.\n  In fact, we see a positive effect on both business and workers. A \nhigher minimum wage reduces turnover, raises productivity, and lowers \nrecruitment and training costs. When workers are paid better, when they \nget a better living wage, then there is more demand for the products \nthey make.\n\n[[Page S3100]]\n\n  There are all kinds of advantages in doing this in a proper way. We \nknow that. Apparently, a lot of Republican colleagues share that view \nbecause the last time we voted in 1989, 89 Senators supported the \nincrease in the minimum wage. A Republican President signed it into law \nindicating that he endorsed the principle of a guaranteed and fair \nminimum wage.\n  The time has come to show that same bipartisanship and to do it \nagain. A recent Gallup poll said that 77 percent of the American people \nthink that we ought to do it again. Sixty-three percent of Republicans \nthink that we ought to do it again.\n  This is not a ``new mandate.'' This is not something that we have \njust dreamed up. This is something we have been doing for decades and \ndecades with the realization you have to start somewhere. The U.S. \nConference of Mayors just sent us all a letter that makes it very clear \nthat they endorse an increase in the minimum wage. These are government \nleaders at the most local level telling us that they see what this \ndoes; they know that if we get people off welfare, they can reduce the \ncost of government. The way to do it is with a minimum wage that works.\n  So, Mr. President, there are those who say we are somehow encumbering \nthe process. So be it. If there is no other way to ensure that we get a \nvote on the minimum wage, we have no other choice but to do it this \nway.\n  We have all agreed that we will hold off on offering this as an \namendment to any other piece of legislation if we can simply get a \ntimeframe within which this can be debated, when we can consider it in \na way that gives us a commitment to vote on a minimum wage.\n  The ultimate irony is that the majority is asking people making $4.25 \nan hour to wait until the majority figures out a way to cut their \nMedicare benefits before they allow them a 45-cent increase. \nRepublicans--at least some of them--are prepared to wage a war on \nworking families.\n  Two days ago, we saw that they are willing to go to any length to \navoid a vote and to face a choice. We saw a 4-hour quorum call, a \nmotion to recommit, a recess in one of the biggest weeks of the year, \nand talk of an unfunded mandates points of order.\n  Mr. President, never have so few done so much to deny so little to so \nmany.\n  Working Americans are not going to be fooled. Our Republican \ncolleagues cannot have it both ways. They express newfound concern for \nworkers in a campaign but then manufacture reasons to oppose them when \nit is real.\n  If you oppose the minimum wage, as the House majority leader does, \nthen vote against this. But if you believe that 12 million people--many \nthe sole earners for their families--deserve an increase, then vote for \nit.\n  The time to face up to that choice is what this is all about. It is \nwhat we were elected to do. Let us do it this afternoon.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I have time available, I will be happy to yield for a \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask the Democrat leader. Is it not so that 51 Senators have already \ngone on record in favor of raising the minimum wage?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. We have seen a number of \nRepublicans as well as Democrats--in fact, almost unanimously the \nDemocrats and many Republicans have indicated their support in votes \ntaken earlier last year.\n  So clearly we have a majority vote in the Senate in support of an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will my leader agree that these \nparliamentary maneuvers are really meant to delay, put off, postpone, \nblock an up-or-down vote even though the majority of Senators support \nsuch an increase?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the minority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield, if I have any time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask the Senator from South Dakota, correct me if I am \nwrong, but when the Democrats were in control of the Senate and the \nHouse in 1993 and 1994 and you had Bill Clinton in the White House, if \nthis is so urgent, why did not you bring it to the floor any time \nduring those 2 years? Is there any reason why it was not brought to the \nfloor at that time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The answer is very simple. Obviously, if we could put \nsome sort of cost of living adjustment in the minimum wage we would do \nso. We would do so today. We would do so any time. Obviously that is \nnot possible. So we have to revisit the issue from time to time. The \naverage length of time between increases of the minimum wage is 6 or 7 \nyears. You cannot do it the first couple of years. We know that. As \nmuch as we would like to, we recognize the limitations of increasing \nthe minimum wage. But over a period of time, you finally have to come \nto the conclusion that, if you cannot do it in 2 years, if you cannot \ndo it in 3 years, at least you have to do it in 5 years.\n  That is really what this is all about--a recognition that we could \nnot do it before but we ought to do it now--now that we have reached a \npurchasing power level that approaches the lowest in history.\n  So certainly the Senator from Oklahoma recognizes, as all of us do, \nthat this is the time to face up to the facts and adjust this minimum \nwage as we know we must.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. My time has expired.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of the President.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we have just witnessed a \npreview of the course of the Senate action from here on until the \nelections. It is going to be crass political attacks against the \nRepublican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole. Nothing meaningful is going \nto get done in this body, and that is simply too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today in the Washington Post, and \nyesterday in the Congress Daily, there were some articles suggesting \nthat Senator McConnell, Chair of the Senate Ethics Committee, was \ntalking about a blanket exemption on the gift ban--and there may be \nchanges to this, and I hope so--for the upcoming political conventions \nin San Diego and in Chicago.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak very briefly--and I suspect that I \nspeak on behalf of other colleagues, Senator McCain from Arizona, \nSenator Feingold from Wisconsin, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Levin--\nafter more than 2\\1/2\\ years of negotiations and several hard-fought \nbattles, just as the ink is drying, for a major change like this to be \nproposed, I think would be a serious breach of faith with the people in \nour country.\n  Mr. President, a friend and former Senator, Eugene McCarthy, who, by \nthe way, will be 80 this weekend, has joked with me about being a \n``Calvinist'' on congressional gift rules, but the reason many of us \nSenators worked very hard on this reform is that we want people to have \nmore confidence and more trust and more faith in the political process. \nI just want to say that I really think if there is any kind of blanket \nexemption here, it would be a terrible mistake.\n  I can see the headlines now: ``Members of Congress Take a Holiday \nfrom New Ethics Rule;'' or ``Pressed By Special Interests, Members \nBackslide to Provide Access;'' or another headline, ``Safe Harbor From \nEthics Rules Members Let Their Hair Down at the Conventions.''\n  Mr. President, I just want to make it clear to colleagues that we \nwould be making a terrible mistake. It is one thing if there are \nspecific issues that have to be resolved, specific problems where maybe \nthere could be minor clarifications. I say just maybe because I think \nthis gift ban legislation is very reasonable.\n  But, quite frankly, people do not want to see us go into these \nconventions and having special interests pay for our hotels or having \nthem pay for various kinds of outings or having them pay for fancy \ndinners. It is just simply out of the question, Mr. President.\n  We have a $50 limit on a gift. You can take one up to $50. I say if \nsomebody is thinking about eating more than $50 worth of shrimp at a \ngathering, this is becoming more a health care issue, not an issue of \ngift reform.\n  I do not mean to be just talking about this with a twinkle in my eye, \nbut I want to say to colleagues, I do not know what was intended by \nthese comments, but those who worked very hard on this certainly would \nbe out on the floor. If there was any broad or blanket exemption, we \nwould oppose it with all our might. And, more importantly, people in \nthis country would not stand for it.\n  Mr. President, let me just say one more time: The ink is barely dried \non these new gift rules, and some are now proposing to relax them. All \nof a sudden we hear about possible exemptions from the gift rules while \nMembers are at the conventions. For Democrats and Republicans alike--\nlet me be bipartisan--it would be a huge mistake to go\n\n[[Page S3102]]\n\nback on the very reform law that we passed a few months ago. We must \nnot do it.\n  There should not be any broad exemptions for these political \nconventions. We ought to live up to the law of the land that we passed. \nWe ought to live up to this reform. We all ought to go by very high \nstandards. I think people want us to.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3101-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3102-S3104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. HELMS. Now, Mr. President, will the Chair review for me the \nunanimous consent in terms of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement is 2 hours under the control of \nthe Senator from North Carolina, Senator Helms, or his designee; 2 \nhours under the control of Senator Kerry or his designee; 2 hours under \nthe control of Senator Nunn; 3 hours under the control of Senator \nJohnston; and 1 hour under the control of Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. HELMS. That makes 2 hours on our side. That is a total of 10 \nhours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten hours.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now has before it the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 1561, which, of course, is the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1996 and 1997.\n  This bill authorizes $6.5 billion for the operation of the Department \nof State, the U.S. Information Agency, and the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency for 1996 and 1997. That represents a $500 million \ncut from fiscal year 1995 spending.\n  After 1996, the bill authorizes funding for the State Department and \nrequires the President to abolish at least one of the three \nanachronistic foreign affairs agencies: Either the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency, the U.S. Agency for International Development, or \nthe U.S. Information Agency.\n  During the course of this debate, some may attempt to portray this \nlegislation as isolationist. I hear that all the time. But you better \nnot go out and ask the taxpayers of America what they think of it, \nbecause they do not agree with these people who cry isolationism.\n  These people who oppose this bill and have opposed it will not ever, \nof course, mention that the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, \nhimself proposed the abolishment of not one but all three of these \nagencies. The fact is likely to be ignored, as well, that such \nprominent isolationists as Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Larry \nEagleburger, General Al Haig, and Jim Baker, all five being former \nSecretaries of State, support this, testified on behalf of it, and \nurged that we pare back these anachronistic, bloated foreign affair \nagencies. Of course, the media did not say much about that. They never \ndo.\n  This bill, of course, does not cut the muscle out of our foreign \naffairs apparatus. What it does do is cut the fat--a little bit of it--\nby making deep and necessary reductions in the current bloated and \nunwieldy Federal bureaucracy that says it is dedicated to foreign \naffairs.\n  This bill cuts $500 million from the 1995 spending level. I have \nalready said that. I do not think that is isolationism. If it is \nisolationism, Mr. President, let us make the most of it, because if I \ncould have my full way, we would cut even more deeply across the board \nand save the taxpayers billions upon billions of dollars, not only in \nterms of the State Department but all across this bloated Federal \nbureaucracy.\n  This bill is simply a recognition that the U.S. Government wants too \nmuch money and desperately needs to reduce the $5 trillion Federal debt \nthat has been piled up and will be dumped on the backs of young people. \nSimply put, the State Department can and must do more with less, and \nthe greatest advocates of that have been the present Secretary of \nState, before he was instructed to take a hike, and five former \nSecretaries of State, who stood up and said, ``This needs to be done.''\n  Most important, in agreeing to this conference report, the Senate has \nan opportunity to send to the President of the United States a bill to \ndisestablish at least one anachronistic Federal agency and, thereby, \nsave the American taxpayers $1.7 billion. It was my intent, when I \nembarked on this legislation, to do far better than that, but the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows what happened all of last year, \nand for most of this year--it was filibustered. There were instructions \nfrom the White House to delay and obfuscate and not to let this bill \npass because it will cost some bureaucrats their jobs. So they \nfilibustered. And only when the Senator from North Carolina said, ``All \nright, if you are going to filibuster this bill, you are not going to \nget any more ambassadors, and you can tell your President that.'' \nPretty soon, they said, ``Let's make a deal.'' When they made a deal, \nthey got the ambassadors. But if they had not made a deal, at least to \nhave a vote on this legislation, those ambassadors would still be \nsitting twiddling their thumbs.\n  Let me remind all involved that Republicans were elected in 1994, in \nthe majority of both the House and Senate, to cut the size of the \nFederal Government and to eliminate waste by the Federal Government. \nAnd this is the first piece of legislation to be sent to the President \nof the United States which will result in one agency--one anachronistic \nFederal agency--being abolished.\n  I sat at home the night that the President delivered his State of the \nUnion Address. I would rather be with Dot Helms than go to any State of \nthe Union Address. She is a lot better company. I heard the President \nsay over and over again--it was a great show, by the way--``The era of \nbig Government is over.'' Do you remember him saying that? Some people \ncheered, including the few conservatives who were sitting down there. \nWell, the President will soon have the opportunity to prove that he \nmeant that. But, already, the White House is sending word that the \nPresident is going to veto this bill, minimal as it may be.\n  Mr. President, after months of foot-dragging and calculated delays, \nour friends on the other side grudgingly allowed our reform efforts to \nbe voted on in the Senate and went into a conference committee with the \nHouse of Representatives. Mr. President, I have participated, during my \nnearly 24 years in the Senate, in a lot of conferences. But this \nconference was one of the most peculiar I have ever seen or heard \nabout, let alone participated in. Prior to the convening of the \nconference between the House and the Senate, the Democrat Senators made \nthree demands, and I believe the majority made every possible good-\nfaith effort to meet those demands. First was on the question of \nfunding levels. This conference report is consistent with the Commerce, \nState, Justice appropriations bill on nearly every account. The funding \nlevels contained in this bill are the best that the President of the \nUnited States is going to get from a Republican Congress.\n\n  Second, despite receiving no input whatsoever--not a syllable--a \nbipartisan attempt was made to work out an acceptable compromise on \npopulation funding. That not being possible, the entire issue was then \nset aside for later consideration.\n  Finally, the Democrats demanded that no more aid provisions be \nincluded in the final conference agreement. Again, the majority agreed \nand obliged. Except for the Peace Corps and some antinarcotics funding, \nthere are no foreign aid authorizations in this bill. Important \nprovisions necessary to bring peace in Ireland and to end the embargo \nof Armenia are included. What do you know? Despite all of these \nconcessions that we made, when the conference began, not one Senate \nDemocratic conferee--except for John Kerry of Massachusetts, with one \nbrief visit by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator \nPell--attended any meeting of the conference. Senator Pell just visited \nbriefly one time, and John Kerry was there for a while.\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\n  Now, the conference met on five separate occasions over a period of 2 \nweeks, and never did any other Democratic member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee even set foot in the room.\n  Mr. President, the Office of Management and Budget recommends that \nthe President veto this bill when it is presented to him. According to \nan OMB statement, one reason the President should veto the bill is \nbecause ``it fails to remedy the severe limitation on U.S. population \nassistance programs placed in the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations \nbill.''\n  Do not be deceived by the words ``population assistance program.'' It \nhas nothing to do with assisting the population. It has everything to \ndo with unborn babies that the Federal Government wants to finance to \nbe killed.\n\n  Now, I suggest, however, that if the President agrees with OMB, then \nhe should not have signed the foreign operations bill if he did not \napprove of the abortion-related provision in that because it is strange \nindeed that the President would veto this bill because it does not fix \na problem that he, himself, the President, created when he signed the \nappropriations bill. So that is the inconsistency that we have run into \nall along.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished occupant of the Oval Office \napparently wants to have his cake and eat it, too. Further, the Office \nof Management and Budget recommended to the President that he veto the \nbill because it terminates the Agency for International Development's \nhousing guarantee program. Now, what OMB kept secret, though, was the \nfact that this program is the international equivalent to the U.S. \nsavings and loan bailout just a few years ago. The General Accounting \nOffice, when recommending the termination of this program reported: \n``We estimate that the cost to the U.S. Government of future loan \ndefault from the existing portfolio of loans is likely to be an \nadditional $600 million.''\n  That is on top of the $400 million already lost, Mr. President. Yet, \nAID and others in this administration, have been struggling for more \nthan a year to keep this sorry program alive. I suspect that when the \nAmerican people learn--if the media will dare let them know about it--\nthat Congress has passed and the President has vetoed a bill that would \nsave $1.7 billion and abolish one of those temporary Federal agencies \ncreated in 1950--in the 1950's, at least-- I think the American people \nare going to have a definite reaction. By the way, Ronald Reagan used \nto say, ``There is nothing as close to eternal life as a temporary \nFederal agency.'' He was right about that. We are trying to do away \nwith one of them. We are not get getting anywhere much. But we will \nsee.\n\n  Let me take a moment to recognize the valuable work that has been \nperformed by other of my colleagues on this side of the aisle who \nserved as conferees on this bill-- Senator Hank Brown, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Ashcroft. Most important, I want to pay my respects \nto the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, who chaired the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee and who has worked faithfully \nside by side with me and others to move this bill forward as best we \ncould in the face of a total blockade by the other side. Senator Snowe \nis most knowledgeable about the intricacies of the State Department and \nthe international operations budget.\n  Well, Mr. President, here we are. We are now at the point, as the \nsaying goes, where ``the rubber meets the road.'' A vote against this \nconference report is a reaffirmation of the status quo which has \ncontributed so much to the $5 trillion Federal debt that has been run \nup by the Congress of the United States. Do not blame any President, \nDemocrat or Republican. The damage was done right here and in the House \nof Representatives. This is where that $5 trillion debt was run up \nbecause we could have stopped it.\n  Those of us over the period of the last 23 years and 3 months, as far \nas I am concerned, who tried to hold down the spending were described \nby the liberal media as being tight-fisted and ultraconservative. But I \nthink the young people, when they realize what the Congress of the \nUnited States has done in dumping this $5 trillion debt on the American \npeople, are going to have a small revolution of their own. I hope it \nwill start in November among those who are 18 or older.\n  By the way, Mr. President, back in February 1992, I realized that \nnobody was paying much attention to the Federal debt which at that time \nstood at about, as I recall, $3.5 trillion. I think it was February 22 \nor 23 that I decided to begin making a daily report to the Senate on \nthe Federal debt as of the close of business the previous day. On \nMondays the report, of course, was for the close of business the \nprevious Friday.\n  One day I went into the Cloakroom where Senators were awaiting a \nrollcall vote that had been scheduled by unanimous consent. I got to \nthinking about how big $1 trillion is. I went in, and I said, \n``Fellows, how many million are there in a trillion?'' I had all sorts \nof guesses. These are the folks, myself included, who have been here \nwhen this debt has been run up. Only one of them, as I recall, had the \nvaguest notion of how many million there are in a trillion. Finally one \nof them got out a piece of paper and scribbled it down. He said, \n``There are a million million in a trillion.'' What do you know about \nthat? Now we owe 5 million million dollars--``we'' being the coming \ngeneration, in the main.\n\n  I think that is a criminal act on the part of the Congress of the \nUnited States--to run up that debt for these young people to pay.\n  In any case, a vote in favor of this pending conference report will \nbe a vote to cut Federal spending by $1.7 billion for the American \ntaxpayers while shutting down at least one anachronistic, wasteful, \nbloated, antiquated agency.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, since last year we have been working hard to \nreform the foreign policy bureaucracy--to save the taxpayers nearly $2 \nbillion and to get our foreign policy machinery working smoothly. This \nbill takes a big leap forward in that direction.\n  And, this bill does even more. It supports numerous U.S. foreign \npolicy goals--from Europe to Asia--at a time when our interests are \nbeing challenged around the globe.\n  In addition to State Department reorganization, this bill has many \nother important provisions including:\n  The Humanitarian Aid Corridors Act, which prohibits U.S. aid to other \ngovernments does not block U.S. assistance to needy populations;\n  Full funding of the administration's request for assistance to \nIsrael;\n  Funding for the International Fund for Ireland and provisions to \nencourage recipients to use business practices consistent with the so-\ncalled MacBride Principles;\n  A mandate for the establishment of Radio Free Asia and the beginning \nof broadcasts into China and other Communist countries in Asia;\n  Prior notice of Security Council votes on U.N. peacekeeping \nactivities and a limitation of the U.S. assessment percentage for U.N. \npeacekeeping to 25 percent;\n  Authorization for the Bosnia and Herzegovina and self-defense fund to \nprovide $100 million to arm and train Bosnian Federation Forces.\n  The list goes on and on. The Point is that no matter how hard the \nadministration tries to muddy the waters with its long list of \nobjections--no matter how much rhetoric administration officials spew \nforth--it is clear that the Clinton administration is more interested \nin protecting the foreign policy bureaucracy and promoting the status \nquo, than protecting and promoting American interests.\n  We've heard the administration's objections, but let's look at the \nfacts. This bill is silent on abortion. With respect to Vietnam, the \nCongress is only requiring that the President certify that his own \nstated criteria have been met before relations with Vietnam are \nupgraded. This legislation supports U.S. foreign policy interests and \nonly limits bureaucratic redundancy and inefficiency. This bill allows \nour limited foreign aid dollars to go further.\n  Mr. President, to threaten to veto this bill is irresponsible. To \nactually veto this bill is inexcusable.\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the establishment of Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania from March 18 to March 24, and about a \nmeeting of a number of people at Central High School in Philadelphia on \nFriday, March 15, at 3 p.m. where a group of educators, ministers, \nstudents, and I spoke briefly about this subject.\n  There is enormous controversy on the subject of pro-choice, pro-life, \nbut there is a consensus that there ought to be the maximum effort made \ntoward prevention of teen pregnancy and that, to the extent possible, \ninformation should be distributed and there ought to be positive peer \npressure on teens on the subject of abstinence.\n  The birth rate among teenagers remains at a surprisingly and \nalarmingly high level compared to those of nearly all other developed \ncountries. In Pennsylvania, the pregnancy rate is 58.3 per 1,000 \nfemales aged 15 to 25.\n  A proclamation was adopted which I ask unanimous consent to be \nprinted at the conclusion of these remarks on Teen Pregnancy Prevention \nWeek.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this is in line with efforts which are \nnow being made by the Appropriations Subcommittee which I chair, Labor, \nHealth, Human Services and Education, to allocate more funding for \nTitle XX on abstinence. This is a funding issue which I have been \nactive in at the specific request of our colleague, Senator Jeremiah \nDenton, who was a major spokesman for this issue prior to his departure \nfrom the Senate back in 1987.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to introduce legislation to \nincrease funding and authorization on the abstinence issue and, also, \nlegislation to promote adoption with tax breaks. My staff and I are \ncurrently in the process of securing cosponsors for that legislation, \nwhich I anticipate introducing sometime in the latter portion of April.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the full \ntext of the proclamation be printed in the Record together with the \nlist of the speakers who spoke at the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week \npress conference back on March 15, 1996, together with a copy of the \n``Dear Colleague'' letter which I am circulating with the request that \nany of my colleagues who wish to support this legislation let me know \nso they may be added as cosponsors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Philadelphia Family Policy Council,\n\n                                 Philadelphia, PA, March 14, 1996.\n\n     Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week Press Conference Speakers List\n\n       1.

The first bill does just that.\n       Where tax breaks for adoption would encourage carrying to \n     term, we should act on that as well. The second bill does \n     just that.\n       The following describes the essence of the two bills:\n       Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of \n     1996.--Reauthorizes the Adolescent Family Life (Title XX) \n     program, which funds demonstration projects focusing on \n     abstinence, adolescent sexuality, adoption alternatives, \n     pregnancy and parenting. This program had bipartisan support \n     when originally enacted in 1981 and when it was reauthorized \n     in 1984. Authority for Title XX expired in 1985 and since \n     then, the program has been operating under funding provided \n     in the annual Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations bill. \n     For FY 1996, the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations \n     Subcommittee, which I chair, has provided $7.7 million for \n     the Adolescent Family Life program. Congress should \n     reauthorize Title XX to demonstrate our commitment to \n     abstinence education and the physical and emotional health of \n     adolescents.\n       The Adoption Promotion Act of 1996.--Provides tax \n     incentives to encourage adoption, a policy which serves as a \n     compassionate response to children whose own parents are \n     unable or unwilling to care for them. This is particularly \n     important in an era when so many teenagers are having babies \n     and are unable to care for them. This proposal is based \n     substantially on the provisions contained in the balanced \n     budget legislation which Congress passed in 1995 but was \n     vetoed by the President.\n       I hope you will cosponsor one or both of these bills. If \n     you are interested, please contact me or have your staff \n     contact Dan Renberg at 224-4254.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n       P.S. A more detailed statement of the bills is enclosed. My \n     office and I would be glad to provide additional information \n     upon request.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Whereas, In the United States, birth rates among teenagers \n     remain at alarmingly high levels compared to those of nearly \n     all other developed countries and in Pennsylvania, the \n     pregnancy rate is 58.3 per 1,000 females ages 15-19; and\n       Whereas, the negative effects of early parenthood on the \n     lifelong health, educational status, and financial condition \n     of adolescents are well documented and babies born to teenage \n     mothers are more prone to low birthweight and to have medical \n     and developmental problems, teenage pregnancy is a public \n     health issue of serious concern. Still, it is just one \n     symptom of the greater problem of teenage sexual activity \n     which carries many additional risk; and\n       Whereas, sexually transmitted diseases (STD's) some of \n     which can be easily cured but others of which can cause \n     permanent damage, infertility, death or harm to an unborn \n     child, continue to affect 3 million teenagers per year, a \n     solution that offers complete protection from these diseases \n     is needed; and,\n       Whereas, The emotional consequences of early sexual \n     activity can include anxiety, regret, decreased self-esteem, \n     confusion about intimacy and shattered dreams; and\n       Whereas, ``Safe sex'' is at best a relative concept since \n     even consistent, correct use of condoms can not guarantee \n     freedom from STD's or pregnancy and offers no protection from \n     the emotional consequences of intimacy without commitment; \n     and\n       Whereas, studies indicate a decrease in sexual activity \n     among teenagers in recent years, a recent study indicated \n     that 9 out 10 youths want help in saying ``no'' to sexual \n     pressure, and, abstinence programs designed for pre-teens and \n     teenagers record a clear reduction both in teen pregnancy \n     rates and teen sexual activity at large; and.\n       Whereas, the people of the state of Pennsylvania are \n     interested in the health and well being of youth, I recognize \n     that young people must be taught the risks of pre-marital \n     sexual activity, the benefits of abstinence prior to \n     marriage, and how to build healthy relationships on a solid \n     foundation. This indicates my belief in the strength and \n     character of the young people of this fine state.\n       Now, therefore, I Arlen Specter, United States Senator From \n     Pennsylvania, do hereby proclaim the week of March 18 to 24, \n     1996 to be Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week. I urge all \n     citizens to take part in activities and observances designed \n     to increase understanding of abstinence as the positive \n     solution to the problems of teenage pregnancy and its related \n     issues. This message is not one of mere prevention, but a \n     message of hope. At the local, state, and national levels, I \n     uphold and support the message of abstinence prior to \n     marriage as the healthy alternative for all Pennsylvanians.\n       In witness thereof, I have hereunto set my hand.\n\n\n[[Page S3105]]\n\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on the basis that I mentioned earlier, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3104-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3105-S3114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1996 and 1997--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this conference report that we are now \nconsidering on H.R. 1561 is not a traditional nuts-and-bolts \nauthorization bill for the Departments of State, USIA, and ACDA. It is, \nregrettably, a nonbipartisan and controversial bill in its current \nform.\n  This bill seeks to reorganize the foreign affairs agencies of the \nexecutive branch by forcing on the President a consolidation of one \nAgency, USIA, AID, or ACDA, even though the administration has made it \nvery, very clear that is unacceptable to them. So, for that reason \nalone, this particular bill is subject to veto by the President. He has \nsaid that he will, indeed, veto it on that basis. I think it is \nregrettable we are going to take the time of the Senate to go through \nthe process of sending the President something that he has already said \nhe is going to veto, but that is what we are going to do.\n  But there are other implications in here. If a President of the \nUnited States asserts constitutional authority with respect to \nparticular prerogatives within the formulation of the conduct of \nAmerican foreign policy, it seems to me we ought to be careful to at \nleast examine, if not respect at face value, those assertions with \nrespect to that constitutional authority. And I think that there are \nlegitimate questions here about whether or not it is appropriate, if \nthe President says that is a prerogative and he does not want to be \nforced into that position, whether or not we should not respect that \nand create a different formulation by which we end up with the same \nresult.\n  We did offer a different formulation by which we would end up with \nthe same result during the course of the conference. That was rejected. \nSpecifically, we offered the same amount of savings that we will \nachieve under the numbers in this bill--actually, a slightly lower \naggregate amount of savings--but we recommended that we only hold out \nthe threat of closure of these agencies if the President refused to \nreturn to us a sufficient plan with respect to the reorganization of \nour foreign policy agencies, and we had the right to determine whether \nor not we thought that was a sufficient plan. If we did not, we could \nreject it and start again.\n  In addition to that, there are a series of policy issues attached to \nwhat should, in normal circumstances, be a nuts-and-bolts \nreauthorization. Those policy decisions, each and every one of them, \npresent their own set of problems. One such policy issue is the very, \nvery significant alteration of our relationship with China, it might be \nsaid, literally shaking the foundations of that relationship at a very \nprecarious time in our dealings with both China and Taiwan. I will have \nmore to say about that subsequently, as will other colleagues.\n  In addition to that, it undermines the President's July 1995 decision \nwith respect to normalization with Vietnam, and puts language into the \nauthorizing process that, in effect, sets back our accountability \nprocess on the POW/MIA's.\n  Furthermore, it fails to meet the administration's budget requests \nfor fiscal year 1997, particularly for the critical account of \npeacekeeping. The United States is engaged, as we all know, in most \ncritical peacekeeping efforts in the world, most recently in Bosnia. To \nsuggest the Congress is going to be unwilling to meet what we know are \nthe agreed-upon figures and responsibilities for those peacekeeping \nefforts is simply irresponsible. Moreover, it sends a very, very \ndangerous, damaging message to our relationships with our allies.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of having a meeting with our \nAmbassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Albright, whom I think \nmost would agree has been really doing an outstanding job on our behalf \nin New York at the United Nations. She relates that, literally in every \ndebate, in every single effort, now, to try to bring our allies along \non some particular effort, she meets with not just resistance, but a \nlevel of cynicism and scorn with respect to the United States' \narrearages and the United States' slowness in paying with respect to \npeacekeeping.\n  Even in Bosnia, we are $200 million shy of a $200 million commitment. \nAnd the on-the-ground effort which the European representative, Carl \nBildt, is trying to implement on our behalf and the European's behalf, \nis significantly restrained by virtue of the perception that we are not \nserious, we are not there, we are not going to really leverage this and \ntry to guarantee that the on-the-ground civilian component can be as \nsuccessful as the on-the-ground military component has been to date.\n\n  In addition to that, the United States-assessed contributions to the \nUnited Nations and its related agencies, as well as ACDA and the \nInternational Exchange Programs, are all significantly underfunded for \nthe 1997 year.\n  I know, as my colleagues know, there is no easier whipping boy in the \nUnited States today than foreign policy and the United Nations. If you \nwant to get applause at a local meeting at home, if you want to get \npeople to kind of vent some of their anger at the waste of Washington, \nall you have to do is say to them, ``By God, I think the money ought to \nbe going here to X, Y, or Z town instead of to these foreign efforts.'' \nAnd most people will automatically cheer and say you are absolutely \ncorrect.\n  When you ask most Americans how much money they think is going into \nour foreign policy effort, it is really amazing how far off most \nAmericans are. I go to town meeting after town meeting; when the issue \ncomes up, I say, ``How much do you think we are paying for foreign \nassistance, foreign aid? Do you think it is 20 percent of the budget?'' \nAnd a number of hands go up. ``Do you think it is 15 percent of the \nbudget?'' Quite a few hands go up. ``Do you think it is 10, 9, 8 \npercent of the budget?'' A lot of hands go up, the vast majority. ``Is \nit 5 percent of the budget?'' And you get the remainder of the hands \nwith the exception of a few.\n  Then, when you finally get down and say, ``Is it 1 percent or less of \nthe budget,'' I usually have one or two hands go up. That is what it \nis. That is what it is. It is 1 percent or less. It is less than 1 \npercent of the budget of the United States that we commit to all of our \ninterests in terms of peacekeeping, AID, efforts to leverage peace in \nthe Middle East. And most of the money, as we know, is contained \nwithin, almost, two items, Egypt and Israel, but significant portions \nare spread around with respect to some of the development programs and \nother efforts to curb drugs, narcotics, money laundering, immigration--\na whole lot of things that we try to do in that field, including, I \nmight add, one of the most important of all today: our economic \nenterprises.\n  We are shortchanging ourselves in places like Hong Kong, Singapore, \nthe Far East, with respect to our Foreign Commercial Service, where we \nare losing countless job opportunities for Americans, countless \nmanufacturing opportunities in this country, because we do not have the \npeople on the ground sufficient to marry those opportunities with the \nopportunities in this country. That is extraordinarily shortsighted, \nbecause we could pay their salaries many times over in a matter of \nmonths, and I think that has been proven many times over.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the current level of funding is a very significant \nissue to the administration, and the administration has appropriately, \nin my judgment, suggested that those numbers are sufficiently low that \nthat is a reason to veto this bill.\n  In addition to that, there still is no satisfactory solution to the \nquestion of family planning, and it is ultimately a bill that, in my \njudgment, is deficient.\n  I think many of my colleagues know that Senator Helms and I have been \ngrappling in good faith with the central and perhaps most controversial\n\n[[Page S3106]]\n\nissue in this bill, and that was the reorganization of the foreign \naffairs agencies.\n  At the start of the year, I was excited about the proposition, and I \nstill remain excited about the proposition, that we could consolidate, \nwe might even merge, we need to reduce the size. I applaud the Senator \nfrom North Carolina in his efforts to try to press that. It is very \nlegitimate. There does need to be a savings. There can be some savings, \nbut I think there is an equally legitimate question about whether or \nnot, at first instance, we should make an executive department decision \nregarding reorganization.\n  I think if we were to create the framework, if we were to hold a very \nheavy sword over the head of the administration, suggesting that if \nthey do not do it sufficiently, they will pay a price, I think that \nwould have been a very appropriate approach and it is one which we \noffered. In the absence of the administration being willing to accept a \nforced agency numbered closure, it is very difficult, obviously, to \npass a bill.\n  I appreciate the fact--and I want the chairman to know it--I \nappreciate the fact that this conference report does contain a \ncompromise on reorganization, and I think that did reflect a \nwillingness of the House Republican conferees to move away from the \nHouse-passed bill's requirement that all three agencies be abolished. I \nwant to respect the fact that they did move and say it on the record, \nand it would have been my hope that we might have been able to come to \na final agreement on this.\n  But regrettably, the compromise does not meet the veto proof test, \nbecause it denies the President that executive department right of how \nto reorganize and, therefore, it is not just the fact of reorganization \nthat is being asserted here, it is the principle of Presidential \nprerogative which, as we know, is not unimportant in the context of \nforeign policy.\n  Moreover, there is a very serious question, which I am confident the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], who is on the floor, will share with \nme, that it is really inappropriate for this conference effort to \nprohibit the President from following through on an Executive \ndetermination and an Executive right with respect to diplomatic \nrelations with another country. Having determined, as a matter of that \nPresidential right, that we will establish diplomatic relations, for \nthe Congress to then not fund the requisites of that diplomatic \nprocess; that is, an embassy, is to come in through the back door to, \nagain, deny the President the prerogatives of Presidential authority in \nthe conduct of foreign affairs.\n\n  So, again, that is a problem with respect to this particular issue.\n  Mr. President, let me say further that one of the most damaging \ncomponents of this conference report, which I know the Senator from \nLouisiana is going to talk about and I know Senator Nunn of Georgia is \ngoing to talk about, is the very provocative and, in my judgment, ill-\nadvised initiatives with respect to Taiwan and China.\n  I do not want to suggest that Taiwan should not be considered at some \npoint for membership in GATT or the United Nations. It may well be that \nin the context of further marching down the road of one China and two \nsystems and of bringing a sufficient dialog together between China and \nTaiwan, it will be possible to work those details out. But it is \nclearly on its face ill-advised in the context of the current \ndifficulties for the U.S. Congress to step in and make extraordinarily \nimportant and provocative statements about that relationship that can \nonly lend further fears to a Beijing that is so significantly caught up \nin, convoluted by, constrained by the transition process today, the \nleadership transition process.\n  Any of us has to understand that there are certain limits as to what \nthe center of China, the Beijing regime can do at a time when there is \na leadership transition in the shadows and perhaps sometimes not even \nso much in the shadows. For us to step in and alter in a unilateral way \nthe Shanghai communique and the Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 \nfurther communique would be to disrupt and, in fact, make more \ndangerous an already fragile and difficult situation.\n  There is no question but that the President of the United States on \nthose items alone--just on the question of President Lee Teng-hui's \nvisit to the United States, GATT and U.N. membership, and on the \nquestion of the relationship of the Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 \ncommunique--those items alone, each and every one of them individually, \nlet alone in the aggregate, ought to be grounds for a veto.\n\n  I think it is important for us to understand that while all of us \nhere share a deep-rooted belief that the words of the communique are \ncritical with respect to peaceful transition in Taiwan and that the \nwords of the communique are critical with respect to our commitment to \nthe Taiwanese not to ever be subjected to an invasion or to takeover by \nforce or to a subversion of the democracy they are increasingly \nchoosing and practicing, it would be equally wrong for us to just move \naway from the policy track that has guided our movements in that region \nfor so long.\n  I think it is fair to say that if we were serious about establishing \nthat as a policy of the United States Congress, it would be fair to \nunderstand that China would interpret that as an extraordinarily \nbelligerent, provocative move that would elicit nothing but a hard-line \nresponse and wind up having exactly the opposite effect of what we are \ntrying to achieve in the long run and make the world a far more \ndangerous place.\n  I believe that we can continue to back the principles of the \ncommunique and Taiwan Relations Act without resorting to those \nmeasures. We will still sell weapons to Taiwan as they need it for \ndefense, and we will still abide by the guarantees of the two systems \nand of a peaceful transition. But what a terrible mistake it would be \nto start to assert a sort of ``435-person House and 100-person \nSecretary of State policy'' from the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, finally, let me just say, turning to the funding \nlevels, I want to speak for a quick moment about not just the \npeacekeeping money, but the relationship with the United Nations itself \nand our arrearages.\n  Ambassador Albright has made it very, very clear, and I think all of \nus need to really think about this--I encourage colleagues to go to New \nYork and meet with representatives of various countries, find people \nwho they respect in the process as observers and truly inquire \nindependently of an advocate of the administration--whether or not our \narrearages are creating a legitimate problem in our ability to achieve \nthe very reforms that we are seeking at the United Nations.\n  In the context of this conference process, Congressman Hamilton and I \noffered a proposal that would have allowed for continued leverage to \nget reform from the United Nations. We proposed that we not pay the \narrearages back in one lump sum so that we lose leverage and control, \nbut rather that we agree to pay them back, that we make it clear that \nwe are going to do that, while simultaneously over a 5-year period \nachieving a fixed set of reforms within the U.N. itself, as well as \nachieving from the U.N. commitments with respect to changing the \nformula for contributions in and of itself.\n  I believe the contribution formula ought to change. The world has \nchanged since the formula was set up. The gross domestic products of \nour partners have grown, and, on a relative basis, ours is shrinking \ncompared to theirs. So it is appropriate for us to look to the United \nNations and to our allies for fair contribution, for burden sharing and \nfor a more fair distribution of that effort.\n  But right now, as a consequence of our unilateral decision not to \npay, our allies are paying more than 100 percent. I will tell you, our \nallies, ranging from the British, the Canadians, French and others, are \nlooking at us askance and wondering and increasingly feeling a sense of \nthe inappropriateness of our unilateral actions. I know that our envoys \nare hearing about this on a regular basis, and it is diminishing our \nability, Mr. President, to be able to achieve the very goals we are \ntrying to achieve.\n  Let me say, finally, that this bill is an improvement over the House-\npassed bill on a number of different questions. It is my hope that \nafter the President has vetoed this bill, that we might be able to \nquickly meet and resolve these particular issues. It was my feeling, \nhad we embraced a couple of these concepts in the course of the \nconference\n\n[[Page S3107]]\n\nrather than simply shunting them aside, we might still have been able \nto have the consensus and bipartisanship necessary to pass this.\n  Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 1561, which we are now \nconsidering, is not just a traditional nuts-and-bolts authorization \nbill for the Department of State, USIA, and ACDA. It is a controversial \nbill with far-reaching provisions.\n  This bill seeks to reorganize the foreign affairs agencies in the \nexecutive branch by forcing the President to abolish one agency--USIA, \nAID or ACDA--even though the administration has made it clear from day \none that it will not accept any forced consolidation of agencies. It \nundermines the President's July 1995 decision to normalize relations \nwith Vietnam and threatens to set back the POW/MIA accounting process \nthat we have worked so hard to put in place. It shakes the foundations \nof United States relations with China and tilts the balance toward \nTaiwan at a precarious time in the relations between Taiwan and China. \nIt is a bill which fails to meet the administration's anticipated \nbudget requests for fiscal year 1997, particularly for critical \naccounts such as peacekeeping, U.S.-assessed contributions to the \nUnited Nations and related agencies, ACDA, and international exchange \nprograms. It lacks a satisfactory solution to the family planning \nissue. In short, it is a bill that I cannot support and that the \nPresident has indicated that he will veto.\n  I think all of my colleagues know that Senator Helms and I have been \ngrappling with the central, and perhaps most controversial issue in \nthis bill--the reorganization of the foreign affairs agencies--for over \na year. As I indicated from the start, I am sympathetic to the idea of \nconsolidation, and I believe that Senator Helms provided the committee \nwith a thought-provoking plan for reorganizing the foreign affairs \nagencies. Personally, I can envision ways in which functions of the \nState Department and one or more of the three other foreign affairs \nagencies could be merged. In fact, as the chairman knows, I offered an \namendment in committee to abolish one agency and consolidate its \nfunctions into the State Department. However, this proposal--like the \nchairman's proposal to abolish all three agencies, AID, USIA, and \nACDA--was rejected by the administration.\n  The fact of the matter is that the administration does not now, and \nhas never, supported the forced consolidation of agencies. That is why \nI worked with the chairman to forge a compromise in the Senate that \nwould force consolidation through savings rather than through the \nmandatory abolition of agencies, and at the same time allow the Senate \nto act on S. 908. It was clear then, as it is clear now, that the \nSenate-passed version of consolidation was the only version that could \npossibly gain the support of Democrats in this body and of the \nadministration.\n  I appreciate the fact that this conference report contains a \ncompromise on reorganization which reflects the willingness of the \nHouse Republican conferees to move away from the House-passed bill's \nrequirement that all three agencies be abolished. However, this \ncompromise does not meet the veto-proof test because it denies the \nPresident the right to determine how to reorganize the foreign affairs \nagencies under his control. I believe this is a right that any \nPresident, Democrat or Republican, would assert.\n  Section 1214 of this conference report essentially prohibits the \nPresident from establishing an American embassy in Vietnam unless he \ncertifies that Vietnam is fully cooperating on the POW/MIA issue in the \nfour areas set forth by President Clinton. The Senate-passed bill \ncontained nothing on this issue. The House bill contained weaker, sense \nof the Congress language. Unfortunately, the Republican conferees \ndecided to up the ante by including the language now in section 1214--\nlanguage which was in the fiscal year 1996 Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations conference report that President Clinton vetoed. He \nindicated his opposition to this provision in that veto statement and \nhe has cited it as one of the provisions that will provoke a veto of \nthis conference report.\n  On the face of it, section 1214 might look like a harmless provision. \nBut the fact of the matter is, this is a veiled attempt to go \nbackwards--to nullify the decision made by President Clinton last July \nto normalize our relations with Vietnam.\n  That decision was the culmination of a process begun several years \nago by President Bush, when he laid out a road map for improvement in \nrelations between the United States and Vietnam. Under the road map, \nwhich the Clinton administration has embraced, genuine progress on the \nPOW/MIA issue would result in the establishment of full diplomatic \nrelations.\n  Genuine progress has been made. Through the efforts of people like \nGen. John Vessey and the often heroic work by our own joint task force \npersonnel and their Vietnamese counterparts in the field, we have a \nprocess in place that is producing that accounting.\n  Of the 2,154 Americans technically classified as MIA's in all of \nSoutheast Asia, we have only 50 in Vietnam whose fate has yet to be \nconfirmed. That means we have confirmed the fates of 146 of the 196 \npriority discrepancy cases. We have determined that 567 Americans were \nlost over water or in other circumstances where survival was doubtful \nand where the recovery of remains is a very difficult. We have \nrecovered 520 remains from Vietnam, 170 of which have already been \npositively identified as American. The remainder are pending \nidentification by our scientists at CILHI. We have investigated all \nunresolved live sighting reports and received over 27,000 materials \nincluding photos and other archival materials. It is clear that Vietnam \nis working diligently to help us resolve outstanding POW/MIA cases.\n  Last November, the Defense Department's POW/MIA office released its \ncomprehensive review of individual cases of Americans unaccounted for \nin Southeast Asia. In testimony on the report before the Military \nPersonnel Subcommittee of the House Committee on National Security, \nDeputy Assistant Secretary of Defense James W. Wold stated the bottom \nline. He said, ``We have no evidence that information is being \ndeliberately withheld.'' In addition, all of our United States military \npersonnel involved in the POW/MIA accounting process, from the \nCommander in Chief of United States Forces in the Pacific to the \nprivate first class excavating a crash site have confirmed that \nVietnam's cooperation has been extraordinarily extensive and represents \na genuine effort on the part of the Government and people of Vietnam to \nresolve this issue once and for all.\n  The United States under Presidents Bush and Clinton made a commitment \nto Vietnam that the bilateral relationship would move forward as their \ncooperation on the POW/MIA issue improved. Vietnam is doing its part. \nThe United States must fulfill its commitment in turn. The language in \nsection 1214 of this bill puts that commitment in question and, in so \ndoing, threatens to undermine the successful accounting process that we \nhave put in place.\n  Apart from the damaging section on Vietnam, this conference report \ncontains several provisions on China-Taiwan issues which are \npotentially damaging to our bilateral relations with Beijing. For \nexample, section 1708 expresses the Sense of Congress that Taiwanese \nPresident Li should be allowed to visit the United States in 1996. \nSection 1709 advocates Taiwan's admission into GATT and the WTO. Most \ndamaging of all, section 1601 subordinates the 1982 Joint Communique \nbetween the United States and China to the Taiwan Relations Act, in \norder to enable the United States to provide more weapons to Taiwan. \nThis provision unilaterally repudiates a fundamental and longstanding \nelement in the bilateral relationship between the United States and \nChina. The administration has made it clear that this provision is a \nveto item.\n  Taken together, these provisions are a provocation to China. They \nraise the specter of a United States that is tilting toward Taiwan, \nencouraging Taiwan's apparent quest for independence, and positioning \nitself to enhance Taiwan's military capabilities in contravention of \nthe fundamental nature of the United States-China relationship. To \nadopt these provisions now, when China and Taiwan are reaching out to \neach other to defuse the tensions between them, would be a mistake.\n  Turning to funding levels, this bill fails to meet the \nadministration's likely budget request for fiscal year 1997,\n\n[[Page S3108]]\n\nparticularly, as I said earlier, in key accounts such as peacekeeping, \nassessed U.S. contributions to the U.N. international exchanges, and \nACDA. I understand that the Republican conferees wanted to stay within \nthe caps set by the budget resolution for function 150, the \ninternational affairs function. All of us, including President Clinton, \nunderstand that economies must be achieved if the budget is going to be \nbalanced. However, the glide path in the existing budget resolution for \nfunction 150 is too steep--as it is for other functions--and if we \nstick to this glide path, our ability to promote and protect our \nnational interests and to conduct diplomacy will be greatly \njeopardized.\n  For example, we are not going to be able to use our leverage \neffectively at the United Nations to secure management reforms and \nrevisions in our assessed contributions if we continue to be the \ndeadbeat debtor. This conference report prevents us from paying not \nonly through inadequate authorization levels but also by withholding \nhigh percentages of our peacekeeping contributions and our \ncontributions to the regular budget until the President can certify \nthat various reforms have been achieved. There is no disagreement over \nthe need for reform at the United Nations but there is real \ndisagreement among us over how to achieve it. The money card can only \nwork so long and I think its effectiveness has run out. Few, if any, at \nthe United Nations believe we are going to pay and as long as they do \nnot believe it, we have no leverage to promote reform.\n  This conference report also includes some foreign aid provisions. Of \nthese, the most problematic--and one cited by the administration as a \nreason for Presidential veto--is section 1111 which effectively \nterminates the housing guarantee program in several countries such as \nthose in Eastern Europe and South Africa.\n  Finally, I should point out that this bill is an improvement over the \nHouse-passed bill on the question of family planning because it does \nnot contain the objectionable provisions on Mexico City and \nprohibitions on funding for UNFPA. However, in an effort to avoid a \nfight over this issue--on which the House and Senate are so divided--\nthe Republican conferees decided to remain silent on the family \nplanning issue. In so doing they missed the opportunity to release \nfunds for population assistance that have been held up under the fiscal \nyear 1996 foreign operations appropriations bill. The restrictions in \nthat bill cut family planning aid by 35 percent below last year's \nlevels, and prohibit using any of the 1996 funds until July. \nIronically, such restrictions could actually serve to increase the \nnumber of abortions and maternal deaths in developing countries, since \nthey mean fewer couples will have access to contraceptives, health \nservices and information. Therefore, the administration strongly \nopposes these restrictions and has cited the failure of this conference \nreport to resolve the family planning issue as another reason for a \nveto.\n  Mr. President, this conference report represents a radical departure, \nnot only from the traditional bipartisanship that has marked American \nforeign policy for so long, but also from the traditional \nbipartisanship that has enabled the foreign affairs committees of the \nSenate and the House to fulfill their authorizing responsibilities for \nthe State Department and related foreign affairs agencies. Some will \nargue this is just politics, but they are wrong. The gulf between us is \nrooted in policy and the policy in this bill is not in our national \ninterests. That is why I am going to vote against this conference \nreport and why the President is going to veto it.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time at this point in time, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, let me spend just 2 or 3 minutes in \nrespectful response to my friend from Massachusetts. His statement that \nthe Taiwan Relations Act, which is a public law passed by the Congress \nof the United States, supersedes an Executive order, that is a matter \nof fact. The United States Congress was clear in its intent to support \nTaiwan's defense needs when this Taiwan Relations Act was passed.\n  The 1982 Executive order, referring to the ability of the United \nStates to sell arms to Taiwan, seems to contradict certain terms of the \nTaiwan Relations Act. Now then, section 1601 does not--does not--\nrepudiate the 1982 Executive order, though I confess that I wish it \ndid. It does, however, clarify that in those instances in which the \nTaiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Executive order seem to contradict \none another, the Taiwan Relations Act is, after all, United States law, \ntherefore, stipulates the policy to which the United States should and \nmust adhere.\n  Not once--this is the point, Mr. President--not once during the \ncourse of the conference between the House and the Senate did a single \nMember of the House or a single Member of the Senate raise this \nprovision as a problem. As a matter of fact, I think it is worthy of \nnote that when the staff met preliminarily, the staff of the Senate and \nthe staff of the House, Democrats and Republicans, the Democrats' staff \nmembers made it clear that they were not there to participate; they \nwere only to take notes. They refused to take any action or any part in \nthe proceedings. So that is a little bit like the fellow who killed his \nmother and father and asked for mercy in the court because he was an \norphan. They did not participate when we wanted them to, when we were \nbegging them to.\n  With that said, I remind my colleagues that this provision was \nadopted by both Houses of Congress. Therefore, it was in both the House \nand the Senate bills. I also remind my distinguished colleague and \nfriend from Massachusetts that he, himself, voted in support of this \nexact language during the committee consideration of the State \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for a long time now many critics of the \nadministration's Russia policy have been voicing our deep concern that \nthat policy is structured to serve a variety of interests, few of which \ncould be defined as America's national security interests.\n  Let me just mention two of the more obvious administration positions \nwhich manifest a greater concern for Russia's interests than our own. \nThe administration's persistent reluctance to seize the present \nopportunity to expand NATO has been maintained out of deference to the \npolitical sensibilities of current Russian leaders who wish to take \npolitical advantage from Russian nostalgia for empire.\n  The administration's opposition to lifting the unjust arms embargo \nimposed on the Government of Bosnia, a position which eventually \nrequired the United States to deploy our military forces to that \ncountry, was partially a consequence of the administration's fear of \noffending Russia's fraternal regard for the Serbian aggressors in \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, over the last 2 days we have learned that the \nadministration's Russia policy is intended to serve the interests of at \nleast one American, the President's, to the extent that the President \ndefines his interests as being reelected to office.\n  The Washington Times reported yesterday and today that at the \nterrorism summit earlier this month, President Clinton privately \npledged to maintain positive relations with President Yeltsin, as both \nmen seek reelection this year, and President Clinton helpfully \nidentified to President Yeltsin one issue of an extraordinary national \nsecurity value to the United States that the Russian President could \nhelp him with--U.S. sales of chickens to Russia.\n  Mr. President, in the Washington Post today there is an article \nentitled: ``White House Asks for Probe in Leak of Clinton-Yeltsin Talk \nMemo.'' Mr. McCurry, that erudite observer of national security issues \nsays in the article:\n\n       The President feels like he ought to be able to sit down \n     with the President of Russia and have a private conversation.\n\n  I agree with Mr. McCurry:\n\n       State Department officials said that the Talbott memorandum \n     was circulated fairly widely . . ..\n\n  Incidentally, I would like to say I am proud to have opposed Mr. \nTalbott's nomination on two occasions.\n  The article goes on:\n\n\n[[Page S3109]]\n\n\n       The memo, as quoted in the Times, said President Clinton \n     pledged to work with Yeltsin to maintain positive relations \n     with the United States, as both men seek reelection this \n     year. One way to do this, the memo quoted President Clinton \n     as saying, is for Yeltsin to stop restricting poultry \n     imports.\n\n  President Clinton said--and I quote:\n\n       ``This is a big issue, especially since 40 percent of U.S. \n     poultry is produced in Arkansas,'' the memo said.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Washington Post and \nan another article from the Washington Times on the issue be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    White House Asks for Probe in Leak of Clinton-Yeltsin Talk Memo\n\n                          (By John F. Harris)\n\n       The White House yesterday asked the Justice Department to \n     investigate the leak of a classified State Department memo \n     detailing a recent conversation between President Clinton and \n     Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\n       Clinton was ``concerned'' by a report in yesterday's \n     Washington Times based on a memo written by Deputy Secretary \n     of State Strobe Talbott, according to White House press \n     secretary Michael McCurry. It recounted talks between Clinton \n     and Yeltsin earlier this month when both leaders attended an \n     anti-terrorism summit in Egypt.\n       National security adviser Anthony Lake instructed an aide \n     to call the Justice Department to encourage the FBI to \n     investigate an apparent ``violation of federal law,'' the \n     spokesman said.\n       At a news briefing yesterday, McCurry said ``the Washington \n     Times appears to be illegally in possession of a classified \n     document,'' but in a later interview he said that comment had \n     been ``inartful.'' The White House believes the illegality \n     was committed by someone in the government who leaked the \n     information, not by the newspaper in taking the document or \n     publishing it, McCurry explained.\n       Asked for comment on the investigation yesterday, Times \n     editor-in-chief Wesley Pruden said, ``I always wish the FBI \n     well in whatever endeavors they undertake.''\n       McCurry said Clinton and Lake considered the leak to be far \n     more sensitive than the typical anonymous disclosure that \n     is commonplace in Washington journalism. ``The president \n     feels like he ought to be able to sit down with the \n     president of Russia and have a private conversation,'' \n     McCurry said.\n       State Department officials said that the Talbott memorandum \n     was circulated fairly widely within the administration, and \n     would have been seen by senior officials in other government \n     departments, in addition to the State Department.\n       The memo, as quoted in the Times, said Clinton pledged to \n     work with Yeltsin to maintain ``positive'' relations with the \n     United States as both men seek reelection this year. One way \n     to do this, the memo quoted Clinton as saying, is for Yeltsin \n     to stop restricting poultry imports. Clinton said ``this is a \n     big issue, especially since 40 percent of U.S. poultry is \n     produced in Arkansas,'' the memo said.\n       Lake, according to White House and Justice Department \n     officials, instructed the National Security Council lawyer \n     yesterday to initiate a criminal investigation. Justice \n     officials said yesterday that they had not yet turned the \n     matter over to the FBI but expected to do so soon.\n       McCurry said administration officials have been concerned \n     about other disclosures published in the Times under reporter \n     Bill Gertz's byline, and hinted that law enforcement officers \n     earlier had been called in to track down his sources.\n       Lake, he said, wanted the FBI to ``add this to any ongoing \n     inquiry that they have going.''\n       Gertz, a national security reporter, in recent months has \n     written other articles based on classified documents \n     concerning arms control and missile defense.\n       The White House has brought on troubles for itself by \n     encouraging the FBI to launch investigations. When White \n     House travel office staff members were fired in 1993, \n     administration officials called in the FBI to investigate the \n     employees. Congressional critics said that was an attempt by \n     the White House to use the agency for political ends.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Clinton Vows Help for Yeltsin Campaign\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       President Clinton, in a private meeting at the recent anti-\n     terrorism summit, promised Boris Yeltsin he would back the \n     Russian president's re-election bid with ``positive'' U.S. \n     policies toward Russia.\n       In exchange, Mr. Clinton asked for Mr. Yeltsin's help in \n     clearing up ``negative'' issues such as the poultry dispute \n     between the two countries, according to a classified State \n     Department record of the meeting obtained by The Washington \n     Times.\n       Mr. Clinton told Mr. Yeltsin that ``this is a big issue, \n     especially since about 40 percent of U.S. poultry is produced \n     in Arkansas. An effort should be made to keep such things \n     from getting out of hand,'' the memo said.\n       White House and State Department spokesmen confirmed the \n     authenticity of the memo but declined to comment on what they \n     acknowledged was an extremely sensitive exchange between the \n     two leaders.\n       The memorandum on the March 13 talks in Sharm el-Sheikh, \n     Egypt, does not quote the two presidents directly but \n     paraphrases in detail their conversation.\n       According to the classified memorandum, Mr. Yeltsin said \n     ``a leader of international stature such as President Clinton \n     should support Russia and that meant supporting Yeltsin. \n     Thought should be given to how to do that wisely.''\n       The president replied that Secretary of State Warren \n     Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov \n     ``would talk about that'' at a meeting in Moscow. The meeting \n     ended last week.\n       Mr. Clinton told Mr. Yeltsin ``there was not much time'' \n     before the Russian elections and ``he wanted to make sure \n     that everything the United States did would have a positive \n     impact, and nothing should have a negative impact,'' the memo \n     said.\n       ``The main thing is that the two sides not do anything that \n     would harm the other,'' Mr. Clinton said to Mr. Yeltsin. \n     ``Things could come up between now and the elections in \n     Russia or the United States which could cause conflicts.''\n       The memorandum, contained in a cable sent Friday by Deputy \n     Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, was marked \n     ``confidential'' and was intended for the ``eyes only'' of \n     Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, and James F. \n     Collins, the State Department's senior diplomat for the \n     former Soviet Union.\n       The memo said Mr. Clinton suggested that the chicken \n     dispute and others like it could be made part of talks \n     between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Prime Minister \n     Victor Chernomyrdin.\n       Mr. Gore announced Monday that Russia has lifted the ban on \n     U.S. chicken imports that had been imposed out of concern \n     that the chicken was tainted with bacteria.\n       The Washington Times reported March 8 that Mr. Clinton \n     intervened personally in the poultry dispute late last month.\n       The president's directives to his staff to solve the \n     problem right away benefited powerful Arkansas poultry \n     concerns. Among them is the nation's leading producer, Tyson \n     Foods Inc., whose owner, Don Tyson, has long been a major \n     contributor to Mr. Clinton's campaigns.\n       U.S. poultry exports make up one-third of all U.S. exports \n     to Russia and are expected to total $700 million this year.\n       Asked about the memo on the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting, White \n     House Press Secretary Michael McCurry said yesterday that it \n     is ``inaccurate'' to say Mr. Clinton promised to orient U.S. \n     policy toward helping the Russian leader's political \n     fortunes. Rather, he said, the president wanted to make sure \n     that issues in the two countries do not hamper good \n     relations. The poultry issue was raised in that context only, \n     the press secretary said.\n       Mr. McCurry, who said he was present at the meeting, also \n     said the president was referring to ``positive relations'' \n     between the two countries and not political campaigns.\n       Those present at the meeting included Mr. Christopher, CIA \n     Director John Deutch, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake \n     and, besides Mr. Yeltsin, four Russian officials, including \n     Mr. Primakov and Mikhail Barsukov, director of the Federal \n     Security Service.\n       During the discussion, Mr. Yeltsin outlined his political \n     strategy for winning the June presidential elections and said \n     he still had doubts about running as late as last month.\n       ``But after he saw the Communist platform, he decided to \n     run,'' the memo said, ``The Communists would destroy reform, \n     do away with privatization, nationalize production, \n     confiscate land and homes. They would even execute people. \n     This was in their blood.''\n       Mr. Yeltsin said he will begin his campaign early next \n     month, traveling throughout Russia for two months to ``get \n     his message to every apartment, house and person'' about his \n     plan to strengthen democracy and reforms.\n       ``The aim of Yeltsin and his supporters would be to \n     convince the candidates one by one to withdraw from the race \n     and to throw their support behind Yeltsin,'' the memo said.\n       Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov is ``the \n     one candidate who would not do this'' because he is ``a die-\n     hard communist,'' and Mr. Yeltsin noted that he ``would need \n     to do battle with him.''\n       Mr. Yeltsin dismissed former Soviet President Mikhail \n     Gorbachev as ``not a serious candidate.''\n       ``He had awoken one morning and decided to run and would \n     wake up another morning and decide to withdraw his \n     candidacy,'' Mr. Yeltsin said of his predecessor. ``This \n     would be better for him because he now had some standing and \n     if he participated in the elections, he would lose any \n     reputation he had left.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, give me a break. What kind of foreign \npolicy is that? Does President Clinton know that he is President of the \nUnited States now and not Governor of Arkansas? Since when is poultry \nsales a big issue to be discussed between two Presidents? What happened \nto NATO expansion, Bosnia, proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, recent allusions in Russia to the restoration of the \nSoviet Union, and a host of other genuine big issues? But what does \nthis\n\n[[Page S3110]]\n\nPresident do? He calls a big issue the fact that 40 percent of U.S. \npoultry is produced in Arkansas, so it is a big issue between himself \nand President Yeltsin.\n  Mr. President, that is unacceptable conduct and shows again that on-\nthe-job training has failed as the domestic policy; President puts his \ntoe in the water on foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, I do not want to diminish the importance of selling \nchickens to Russia where sales were restricted until now. Poultry sales \nare a legitimate industry in the United States and surely deserve some \nconsideration. Neither would I begrudge the President's concern for his \nown home State of Arkansas, which happens to produce about 40 percent \nof the poultry in the United States. But I would like to think that \nwhen the President of the United States sits down with the President of \nRussia to discuss big issues with him, areas of real security concern \nto the United States, there would be something somewhat higher on the \nagenda than chicken sales. I would also like to think that President \nClinton would regard United States national security interests to be \nthe priorities of United States policy with Russia, not anyone's \nreelection.\n  I assure the President, the satisfactory resolution of outstanding \ndifferences with Russia on the questions I have identified will do a \nlot more to restore the President's credibility as a statesman, and \nconsequently enhance his reelection prospects, than will his efforts to \nboost chicken sales abroad.\n  What does the priority given by the President's Russian policy to \nnarrow parochial interests say about his position on other questions \nwhich should concern us in Russia? It may say a great deal. The \nPresident encourages the IMF to approve one of the biggest loans in its \nhistory to Russia. Was this part of the President's plan for his and \nMr. Yeltsin's reelection? Is our muted reaction to Moscow's brutality \ntoward Chechnya a consequence of the bilateral Presidential campaign?\n  As we all read today, the leaked memo by Deputy Secretary of State \nStrobe Talbott, which referred to this Presidential discussion and \nPresident Clinton's intention to conduct our relations in a way that \nwould have only a positive impact on President Yeltsin's reelection \nprospects, thereby reaffirming once again the administration's \npersonality based Russian policy, has caused the administration to \ninitiate an FBI investigation to determine the identity of the leaker. \nThat endeavor, I am confident, will prove to be a colossal waste of the \nFBI's time.\n  What the classified memo really indicates is not some official's \nindiscretion, but the administration's abuse of the tool of security \nclassification. Chicken sales and the reelection desires of President \nYeltsin and President Clinton are not--I repeat, not--state secrets. \nIndeed, I believe it is very important for the American people to \ndiscover at last what interest the administration's policy to Russia, \nthis most critically strategic of relationships, are intended to serve. \nToday, we have our answer: It is the same interests which most of the \nadministration's policies are intended to serve--President Clinton's \nreelection.\n  Mr. President, let me say again, I strongly condemn the use of \nimportant U.S. diplomacy, which should be reserved for our most vital \nnational security interests, to serve anyone's campaign interest, much \nless the President of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I got to the floor to speak about China, \nbut first a word about chickens.\n  Mr. President, chickens may be an important industry in Arkansas, and \nthey are, but the reason I think it is entirely legitimate--in fact, \nentirely important--for this President to speak to President Yeltsin \nabout chickens is because Russia was denying entry into the Russian \nmarket of American chickens, perhaps grown in Arkansas, but grown in \nAmerica by Americans, for the wrong reasons. That is, they were not \npermitting these chickens to come in because they did not want the \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, this President, any President, has a great interest in \nopen markets, particularly with a country which we are doing a lot to \nhelp and who we are encouraging to have open markets. I applaud this \nPresident for seeking to do away with those barriers to open markets in \nRussia.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I yield for a question, yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, the President's efforts, it would seem to me, \nare part of a strategy to try to bring Russia into the international \neconomic system as a legitimate player like other countries that are \nplaying by the rules of trade. Would that not be correct?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. That is precisely right. One of the problems with \nRussia now is that they do not have open markets. We are trying to \nencourage that. It so happens that chickens are a huge business in \nRussia, and the American chicken is more economically produced, is a \nbetter quality, and is preferred by Russians.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It could have been any product, for that matter, but \nthe basic point is that we are trying to move Russia toward a market \neconomy, something that the former Soviet Union did not do. That was a \ncommand economy.\n\n  Everyone says Russia ought to become a market economy, and obviously \nthe United States and other countries in the West have a role to play \nin that. It seems to me this effort of the President was part and \nparcel of trying to move Russia in the direction of becoming a free \nmarket system and of participating in the global economy.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. This is not the only item of interest and not the only \nthing that the President discusses with President Yeltsin, but it \ncertainly is a legitimate one.\n  I can say if those were Louisiana chickens, I would be calling him up \nand saying, ``Mr. President, don't stand for this. Speak to your \nfriend, President Yeltsin, about it.''\n  Now, Mr. President, this time last week we had a very dangerous world \nsituation where two American carrier battle groups were steaming in the \nvicinity of the Strait of Taiwan and where the People's Republic of \nChina, the largest country in the world, was engaging in live-fire \ntests, close to Taiwan. It is not an understatement to say that the \nworld was in real danger of a conflagration at that time, not because \nanyone desired war but because the close proximity of these forces \ninvolving live fire made the possibility of a misstep, of a bump in the \nnight between two ships, of a misspent or misfired rocket or shell, a \nvery great danger.\n  Today, Mr. President, we all breathe easier as the crisis has passed. \nMr. President, the problem remains. The potential for a huge crisis \nremains.\n  I would like to speak to what I regard as a very fateful decision. \nThat is, the pending legislation; the pending legislation, Mr. \nPresident, would move this country, in my view, from a policy of \nengagement with the largest country in the world to a policy of \ncontainment of the largest country in the world, and containment \nequals--make no mistake about it--a new cold war. I can assure my \ncolleagues that if I know anything about China, they will not be \ncontained, and you can get ready for a new cold war if this bill should \npass and become law.\n  Now, this bill, Mr. President, in my view, is potentially the most \ninsidious bill that has been passed by either House in my 24 years in \nthe U.S. Senate. I believe it has the significance, if passed and \nsigned into law, of the Tonkin Gulf resolution. I think Senator Nunn \nhas called it a declaration of war. The President has promised to veto \nit.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake, it is a very serious step for the \nU.S. Congress to be considering. I believe the Senate should sober up \nbefore this ill-conceived policy takes root.\n  Now, just what is this bill, and why do I call it so insidious and \npotentially--potentially--a Gulf of Tonkin resolution? First, it says \nthat the Taiwan Relations Act supersedes the Shanghai communique. Of \ncourse, the Taiwan Relations Act deals with the defense of Taiwan; the \nShanghai communique deals principally with a one-China policy. What do \nwe mean by one-China policy? One China, two systems, peaceful \nreunification. The three points of the triangle which have been \nrepeated by everyone: one China, two systems, peaceful reunification.\n\n[[Page S3111]]\n\n  To say that the Taiwan Relations Act supersedes the Shanghai \ncommunique is not simply to say, as my dear friend from North Carolina, \nSenator Helms, says, simply to state the obvious--that is, that an act \nof Congress supersedes an executive agreement. We know that. What it is \nsaying is that, in effect, it nullifies, it subsumes, it cancels out \nthe Shanghai communique and that the United States Congress, in this \ncase, because it is a sense-of-the-Congress provision, that the United \nStates Congress is abandoning the Shanghai communique. That, Mr. \nPresident, is very serious.\n  It also encourages the Taiwanese to move toward independence. We also \nrename and upgrade the Taipei representative office. In itself, this \ndoes not constitute a move toward independence. But taken together, \nparticularly with an invitation to President Li Teng-hui to visit the \nUnited States ``with all appropriate courtesies,'' these three elements \ntaken together, Mr. President, are unmistakable. They are abandonment \nof the one-China policy, a move for independence for Taiwan.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, the House, apparently sensing the seriousness of \nthe step they were taking, adds a further element not contained therein \nthat it is our intention to assist in the defense of Taiwan, which, \nindeed, might be necessary should we enact this ill-conceived piece of \nlegislation--a fateful, fateful decision, Mr. President.\n  One thing is absolutely clear: The unilateral declaration of \nindependence by Taiwan is unacceptable to the People's Republic of \nChina and will be resisted. Now, up until last year, things were going \nalong swimmingly. The United States, the People's Republic of China, \nand Taiwan were all reading off the same song book. We were all saying \none China, two systems, peaceful reunification and, indeed, we have \nreinforced, many times over, the Taiwan Relations Act, which was not at \nall inconsistent with one China, two systems, peaceful reunification. \nThat is what the Taiwanese were saying, what the PRC was saying, and \nthat is what President Nixon said in the Shanghai communique; that is \nwhat President Carter said in the joint communique of 1979; that is \nwhat President Reagan said in the joint communique of 1982; that is \nwhat President Bush said, and that is what President Clinton is saying. \nAll were saying the same thing.\n  Things were going along very well. There were 1\\1/2\\ million \nTaiwanese who visited the People's Republic of China. There were tens \nof billions of dollars of investment by Taiwan in China. Talks were \ngoing on between the leaders of the two countries, or two areas. And \nthen what happens? Well, we had what the Congress regarded as a very \ninnocent invitation by Cornell University to have their distinguished \nalumni, President Li Teng-hui, come back and make a speech. We, in the \nCongress--or at least almost everyone in the Congress said, ``Look, \nthis is not a State visit, there is no significance to this. This is \nsimply a homecoming to the old university, the old school.'' Well, Mr. \nPresident, we may have thought that in the Congress--but, I did not \nshare that view, and I was the only Member of the Senate who voted \nagainst that visit--but I can tell you that the world, and certainly \nthe People's Republic of China, and certainly Taiwan, did not regard it \nas such an innocent visit. On the visit, he brought along government \nleaders from Taiwan. He promised no press conferences, but said, ``I \nwill be available if you stand behind this bush when I am walking on \nthe Ellipse. You can ask your question and I will give you an answer.'' \nAnd that happened.\n  He was met by Members of Congress. It had all the trappings, Mr. \nPresident, of a State visit, and it was clearly regarded by the \nPeople's Republic of China as being something more than a homecoming to \nthe old university. And that, in turn, Mr. President, has been \naccompanied by a whole barrage of acts and initiatives designed to move \nin the direction of independence.\n  Why does a province of China--if that is what Taiwan is, as the \nChinese claim--need membership in the United Nations? That upsets the \nPRC. We put that kind of language, also, in our resolutions, and, Mr. \nPresident, it constitutes still another act of this Congress moving \ntoward unilateral independence of Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, just a few days ago, Deputy Foreign Minister Liu was \nmeeting with us down in S-211, a stone's throw from where we stand. Ten \nSenators were there. We had an in-depth discussion with Deputy Foreign \nMinister Liu. He reiterated the peaceful unification theme. He \nreiterated the indelible, irrevocable friendship between the United \nStates and the People's Republic of China. But he said, ``The United \nStates, of all countries, should understand our attitude in the \nPeople's Republic of China about Taiwan.'' He said, ``You fought a \ncivil war, the bloodiest war in the history of your country, about the \nquestion of unification, and about the question of unilateral \ndeclarations of independence. So you, America, ought to understand our \nfeeling, because our feeling was just like President Lincoln's feeling \nabout the American Civil War.'' He said, ``The issue is sovereignty. We \nregard a declaration of independence by Taiwan as a matter of \nsovereignty, which we will safeguard.'' He said--and I took down these \nnotes--``It is an overriding task. There is no other choice.'' He \nquoted Deng Xiaoping as saying this was an ``explosive issue, as big as \nthe universe; compared to it, all other issues are easy.''\n\n  Mr. President, you can take solace from that in the repetition of the \npeaceful reunification. You can take solace from the fact that it is a \none China, two systems, peaceful reunification system, which he \nrepeated. You can take solace from the fact that he repeated the \nfriendship of the People's Republic of China with the United States. \nBut it is unmistakable--unmistakable--that a unilateral declaration of \nindependence by Taiwan and moves by the United States Government to \nencourage that are unacceptable and are going to lead to trouble.\n  Now, if that is what we are going to do, Mr. President, as a nation, \nas a State Department, as an administration, as a Congress, I, for one, \nwant this Congress to have its eyes wide open about what the \nimplications are of that fateful move. This is not a series of moves to \ninvite people back to universities for the old alumni to get together \nand give the old college yell. It is not about that. It is about war \nand peace, about the stability of Asia, and it is about the future of \nthis country.\n  Now, Mr. President, one of the most important questions I think you \ncan ask is: What is the defining international event of this era? What \nis the defining international event of this era? Is it the war in \nBosnia? Is it peace in the Middle East and all that that portends and \nall of its implications? Is it the demise of the Soviet Union and the \nrise of Russia and privatization, and all of the problems that are \nhappening in Russia? I do not believe so. Mr. President, Sareed \nZakaria, the managing editor of Foreign Affairs, stated in the New York \nTimes of February 18 that, ``The defining international event of this \nera is the rise of China to world power.'' It is happening so fast, its \nimplications are so vast that it is an event that is being missed. And, \ncertainly, the implications of the event are being missed by the vast \nproportion of Americans, and I submit, by most Members of this \nCongress. Indeed, I, myself, really missed the significance of what is \nhappening.\n  I first went to China with a number of my colleagues in 1976. At that \ntime, China was backward and poor and oppressive. It was depressing. \nEverybody dressed the same. No food. No travel. No automobiles. No \njobs. No nothing. I remember the one particular riveting sight I saw \nwas the cabbages piled on the street--and this was in November--for the \nwinter. There was just a big mound of cabbages to be used by the people \nto eat. They were piled on the street, and they would come and grab a \ncabbage when they needed it. And you could go to the markets, which we \ndid, and there was nothing there.\n  So, Mr. President, as I read about progress and growth in China, as \nthe years passed since that trip in 1976, I intellectually could \nbelieve it. But I just did not really realize it until 1992 when I went \nto a conference where Larry Summers, who at that time was the chief \neconomist of the World Bank, was making a speech. He said that China \nwould be the largest economy in the world shortly after the turn of the \ncentury. These words rang in my head like an unbelievable statement--\nthe largest economy in the world, that backward country that I saw, was \nimpossible I thought.\n\n[[Page S3112]]\n\n  So I made arrangements within a month to go to China. Mr. President, \nI was blown away. It was astonishing. It is one vast construction site \nin China. It is already the second or the ninth largest economy in the \nworld depending on how you calculate those things, what figures you \nuse. But it is arguably the second largest economy in the world. There \nare traffic jams. There is abundant food. There is colorful and even \nstylish clothing. Forty percent of the people have color televisions. \nTwelve percent of the people in China had VCR's. You have CNN, you have \nfive-star hotels, and as I mentioned, you have traffic jams.\n  In 1976, when we landed in Shanghai, they did not even have \nautomobiles. They had to bring the automobiles down from Beijing on \nrailroad cars. Now when you go to China there are traffic jams. On my \ntrip last year, going back to Beijing from where we were should have \ntaken about 2\\1/2\\ hours. It took 7 hours because of the traffic jams.\n  The growth is so vast. Kwangtung Province, where I arrived, is larger \nthan any country in the European Community, other than reunited \nGermany. They have had in the previous 10 years a cumulative growth of \n440 percent--440 percent in 10 years. It is a growth rate today of \nthree to four times the growth in the United States. We are very proud \nof our growth rate here. They continue to project a growth rate of 8 to \n9 percent.\n  Mr. President, it is astonishing what is going on. I urge my \ncolleagues, every Member of the Senate, to get over there and see. See \nfor yourself, not just the growth, but make your own opinion about what \nkind of country this is and what kind of future they have.\n  In my view, Mr. President, 20 years from now our country will be \njudged by its success in foreign policy, in its stability, in the \nprosperity of its citizens, in the job rate, and in the growth rate, \nall of those things, but also by how successfully we deal with China \nand these other rapidly growing countries on the Pacific rim.\n  This is one area where we make or break, in my judgment, the future \nof this country.\n  So just what are the implications then of having a policy--of \nchanging from a commitment to engagement to a policy of containment \ntoward this rapidly growing country? I can tell you, this, Mr. \nPresident, a policy of containment, I believe, leads to cold war. Here \nis what I think is possible. A hot war is possible--not probable, but \nit is possible. The destabilization of Asia is an expected event.\n  What is Japan going to do when the area becomes destabilized? I can \ntell you what Japan is going to do. They are either going to insist \nthat the United States come in with our nuclear umbrella in vastly \ngreater numbers, or they are going to want to rearm. It is tit for tat. \nWhen Japan begins to rearm, the People's Republic of China is going to \nwant to rearm that much more. What do they do in Indonesia? They will \nwant to rearm. What about Vietnam, which has been a traditional enemy \nof the People's Republic of China? They are going to rearm. Pretty soon \nyou have a real donnybrook of a cold war.\n  Mischief in Korea? Look at the People's Republic of China. They have \nplayed a very salutary and peacemaking role with the United States in \ntrying to moderate North Korean policy. Believe me. Everybody knows \nthat. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I can tell you that \neverybody knows that. You can read it in the paper. But if they are \nsuddenly our adversary, what is their role going to be with respect to \nKorea? Arms proliferation? Oh, I know, it has been prominently printed \nthat they have violated the MTCR, the Missile Treaty Control Regime, by \nshipping M-11 rockets to Pakistan and that they are shipping magnets \nwhich can be used for uranium enrichment also to Pakistan.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of evidence printed in the paper about \nthese things. I must tell you that, while I clearly do not countenance \nwhat they have done or what they have alleged to have done, these are \nhardly the kind of violations that rise to the level of what is \npossible. These enrichment magnets that they talk about can be used for \nuranium enrichment, no doubt. But they do not find themselves on the \nschedule of things that were prohibited. That is their argument at \nleast; it is for uranium enrichment and not for making bombs. On the \nMTCR violations, they are not alleged to have shipped anything lately. \nNone of that has appeared in the newspapers.\n  The administration, faced with the information, did not see fit to \nput sanctions for that reason. But whatever their present conduct is \nwith respect to proliferation, it is nothing, compared to what they \ncould possibly do. Do not forget what their capabilities would be on \nproliferation. They have the capacity to vastly increase their military \nspending. They are being criticized for increasing it way too much \nright now. But it is less than 12 percent of what we spend.\n  Mr. President, they have the capacity. If we want to provoke them, if \nwe want to challenge China's pride and national feeling, believe me, \nthey can increase way beyond 11.8 percent of what the United States \nspends.\n  What kind of damage would this do to the U.S. economy? Well, you can \ncount on inflation because I guess we, along with all of this new cold \nwar, revoke MFN. And all of these products which we import from them, \nwe pay more for those. How much tax would we pay for this new cold war, \nfor this new military buildup that would come? How many lost jobs in \nAmerica? Most important, Mr. President, could we be successful? If we \nset out to contain China, could we be successful? I can tell you this, \nMr. President. We successfully contained the Soviet Union, but it took \nus trillions of dollars, it took us 40 years, and it took the unified \nsupport of all of the countries of Western Europe all working together, \nall joining together in NATO.\n  Who is coming to the defense of the United States saying, ``Yes, \nUnited States, let us contain China.'' Who is doing that? Name for me \none country that is doing that outside of Taiwan. Do the Germans? No. \nLook, Helmut Kohl has been to the PRC--over there at least twice \nseeking commercial contracts. They have invited Li Peng to come to \nGermany. The British? Oh, no. They may disagree a little bit about Hong \nKong, but, Mr. President, the British are not trying to contain the \nPeople's Republic of China. The French? No. The French are selling \nnuclear reactors to China and beefing up in contracts all the time.\n  Nobody would support a policy of containment. It is a cold war that \nwe would have to sustain ourselves. So, if we are going to try to \ncontain and have a new cold war with the People's Republic of China, we \nare going to have to do it alone, and it is going to be a very, very \nexpensive endeavor.\n  We are not going to pass this kind of legislation on the cheap. It is \ngoing to be very expensive--not just in the dollars we put into \ndefense, not just in the jobs lost in America, but what it does to the \neconomy of this country.\n  To abandon one China, to abandon a policy of containment, to make \nChina our adversary would constitute perhaps the greatest diplomatic \nfailure in United States history.\n  The fault of all of this is that we are presented with two choices. \nThey say it is either appeasement or it is containment. It is either \nyou are weak or you are strong. You have no other choice in between.\n  Those are the wrong choices. We are told that if we are weak, you \nencourage and you reward misconduct. If you do not stand up and tell \nthem exactly what to do on human rights, then you are countenancing all \nthese violations. And there are violations of human rights, to be sure. \nAnd the same thing is true of trade and Taiwan and proliferation; you \nhave to stand up and be strong, they say. And if you are strong, we can \nchange it all. We have absolute power, so Americans think, or some \nAmericans think, to change China. All we have to do is tell them what \nto do and they will do it.\n  As Orville Schell said in the New Yorker--Orville Schell is a great \nauthor. You remember he wrote that book about nuclear winter, so he \ncertainly knows about the dangers of international conflicts. But just \nlast week he said in effect: Mao taught his comrades in arms to respect \nreal power.\n  The idea that, if you are strong, stand up and it will happen. Or \nCharles Krauthammer said, ``We ought to revoke MFN. Send the fleet into \nthe Taiwan Strait,'' said Krauthammer, and\n\n[[Page S3113]]\n\n ``After all,'' he says, ``if you wait for war, you invite war.''\n  I am not sure what he meant by that. I took it to mean that you ought \nto go ahead and risk war right now and let us have it sooner rather \nthan later.\n  Mr. President, this kind of talk--be tough, challenge them, tell them \nexactly what to do--in my view are not the choices facing this country. \nAppeasement or containment are not the proper choices.\n  The faults of China are very well-known. I really believe that the \npress, to some degree, has done a job of demonizing China. Part of that \nis China's fault because reporters go to China and they are treated \nbadly. They treat reporters in China like a lot of politicians in \nAmerica would like to treat reporters if they thought they could get \naway with it. But we know better and so we smile all the while. How do \nyou think George Bush would have treated reporters if he thought he \ncould have gotten away with it, or Bill Clinton, how do you think he \nfeels about some of these reporters who write about Whitewater? But the \nChinese treat them that way and they get terrible press.\n  Look, China is not a democracy. They do not have a Bill of Rights. \nThey have all kinds of human rights violations. Ask Wei Jen Sheng about \nthat. No question about that. Trade abuses? Yes. Intellectual property \nabuses? Yes. Live fire was a provocative thing in the Strait of Taiwan. \nProliferation, MTCR, all of these things are faults of China which have \nbeen publicly and widely chronicled all over the United States, so we \nknow they have plenty of faults.\n  Mr. President, if they have faults, they are not nearly as bad as \ntheir harshest critics would indicate. This is not a hostile regime. \nThis is not a regime that is threatening its neighbors. It is not \nthreatening to invade Taiwan. It is certainly not threatening any of \ntheir other neighbors. They never have, Mr. President. They have \ncommitted themselves over and over again to what they called \nnonhegemony in the region. They are proceeding toward Westernization at \nan astonishing pace. Privatization.\n  It may not be a democracy, Mr. President, but it is certainly not \ncommunism. Their market is about half-and-half--half free open market \nand about half State controlled, and the proportion that is free is \ngrowing all the time. I remind my colleagues that this country does not \nhave a 100-percent free market. There are vast areas such as the post \noffice, such as the Government which are not free in the United States. \nBut theirs is about 50-50. The products produced are free.\n  The difference between China in 1976 when I was first there and now \nis mind-boggling. There is travel now. Just to give you one example is \nthe unit system they used to have in 1976. A block captain would give \nout the job, the ration stamps, and the housing of every person. They \nwere tethered to and controlled by their block and their block captain. \nThey could not travel. They would not have had the money to travel. \nThere was no job to be had elsewhere.\n  Indeed, in 1989, Tiananmen Square was more of a revolt against the \nassignment of jobs, I believe, than it was about democratization. \nToday, the block system does not exist in vast areas of China. There \nare hundreds of millions of Chinese who travel and have traveled and \ntake jobs on their own without permission of the block captain.\n  You want to know what real freedom is, Mr. President, or what real \noppression is. It is the inability to travel and get a job and work \nwhere you wish. But now there is this freedom to get jobs and jobs in \nWestern-controlled companies where they are absorbing Western culture, \nWestern ways, and Western freedom.\n  We hear that there are widespread death penalties in China. According \nto the New York Times, in the first 6 months of 1995 there were 1,865 \ndeath penalties meted out in China. That is not disproportionate to the \namount of death penalties meted out in this country for those whose \nconduct merits the death penalty. I happen to be a supporter of the \ndeath penalty properly acquired. You may still disagree with 1,865 \ndeath penalties meted out in China in the first 6 months, but this is \nhardly Nazi Germany during their worst times.\n  The National People's Congress, Mr. President, is acquiring more and \nmore power all the time. Indeed, there are some China watchers who say \nthat Choa Zhenwei, who is the head of the National People's Congress, \nis a competitor with Jiang Zemin for power. I do not give that as my \nown view, but it is clear that the National People's Congress is \ngetting additional power and is making a step, a real step in the \ndirection of some kind of democracy. In fact, they fairly recently \nenacted measures which provide that you cannot be held for more than 30 \ndays without charges being filed, a presumption of innocence.\n  That sounds fundamental, and it is, but they did not have it in China \nand they now have it and the National People's Congress gave it to us. \nYou now have lawsuits in China about the environment, about zoning, \nconsumer lawsuits. These did not exist a few years ago. They did not \nexist, indeed, at the time of Tiananmen Square in 1989.\n  Now, all of these things which I am telling you may not help Wei Jen \nSheng, who is probably the most prominent of the dissidents at this \ntime. But it is progress. And the point is, this is not a rogue regime. \nIt may not be a saintly regime. It is neither. Just as the economy is \nnot a Communist economy, it is not a total free market either. It is \nabout 50-50. And you have to engage China as an emerging country, as a \nchanging country.\n  What I believe this country needs is to determine what kind of China \nwe want and devise a policy that has some possibility of getting us \nthere. What do we want from China? Most important, we want a \nresponsible member of the international community. We want a country \nthat respects the rule of law--certainly in trade--and in human rights \nand in commerce and in every way that we can urge them to do so, a \nresponsible member of the international community. We want them, I \nbelieve, to be a prosperous China. With 1.2 billion citizens and all \nthat power, a country which is declining, which is not prosperous, is a \ndangerous country for all of Asia and all the world. Most of all, we \nwant a friendly China.\n  It is clear, to get there, that China does not respond to a list of \ndemands. I wish that it were true. I wish that we could give them our \nlist and tack it on the church door and expect that these things would \nbe done, but they have shown time and time again that public pressure \nand hectoring of the Chinese is counterproductive.\n  I would say the degree of success, of what we are able to extract \nfrom the Chinese in terms of our demands, is inversely proportionate to \nthe amount of publicity that we give to those set of demands. Why is it \nthat they are so inordinately sensitive, unreasonably sensitive to the \ndemands of the United States? Very simple. They have one of the most \nsearing histories of humiliation, certainly of a great power, that \nexists on the face of the Earth. In the last 150 years, they have been \ndominated at least four times by foreign powers. The opium wars in the \n19th century--do you know, Mr. President, in the opium wars, the \nBritish invaded and subjugated China because they were trying to \nrestrict their market of opium? Can you imagine anything less \nreasonable, less civilized, more to be criticized than that? That is \nwhat the British did.\n  The Japanese did not just attack China. You had the rape of Nanking.\n  When the British controlled Shanghai, as the great commercial \ncenter--and they had these clubs; they would not even admit Chinese in \nthe clubs in their own city of Shanghai.\n  Mr. President, it is a series of humiliations, historically, that \nhave been seared into the consciousness of the Chinese. The 1949 \nrevolution was as much about nationalism as it was about communism, and \nI can tell you there are strong strands of nationalism that bind the \nChinese, all 1.2 billion of them, in the strongest kind of way.\n  Add to the sensitivity that comes from that historical humiliation \nthe fact that this country is a country in transition. Add to that the \nexplosive growth. In that same article in the New York Times by Sareed \nZakaria, the managing editor of foreign affairs, he says, ``Nowhere in \nhistory has a country grown as fast as China without political and \nsocial upheaval.''\n  So here you have a China that is in a power transition, with human \ngrowth almost double digits, and you have this\n\n[[Page S3114]]\n\nsensitivity. So it requires, on our part, the most enormous amount of \nsophistication and sensitivity that we are capable of giving.\n  So, what, then, should we do? Mr. President, we ought to get a clear \nand consistent China policy and articulate it. I wish the President of \nthe United States would make a statement of where we stand. Yes, he has \nstated that we continue to adhere to the Shanghai communique, but he \nneeds to make that clear. We need to understand that Taiwan is central \nto this issue of engagement of the largest country in the world in \npopulation and soon perhaps to be the largest economy of the world. And \nwhat does that mean? It means we need to reassure the People's Republic \nof China that we will not be a party to unilateral declarations of \nindependence, that the Shanghai communique, that the Nixon doctrine, \nthat the Reagan communique, that the Carter communique are still our \npolicy and are not subsumed and superseded by, but are consistent with, \nthe Taiwan Relations Act.\n  At the same time, we should continue to reassure Taiwan that we will \nstand behind them when it comes to any threat of invasion; that \nunification needs to be peaceful. But that is what we have said all \nalong. That is what China has said all along: One country, two systems, \npeaceful reunification. Now, what is wrong with that? And why can we \nnot articulate that clearly?\n  We need to treat their leaders with respect and dignity. As I say, \nthey are enormously sensitive and we frequently fail to recognize that \nthis country, the Middle Kingdom, as it has been historically called, \nhas not, in fact, been treated with the proper respect and dignity.\n  I do not believe that most Americans know what is going on in China \nin terms of the huge--not just huge growth, but huge strides forward \nthat they are making. We need to recognize the limitations that there \nare on human rights. We just cannot give a list of demands, as much as \nwe want to do so. We have to recognize those limitations. That does not \nmean we do not continue in the strongest way possible, that can be \neffective, to stand up for human rights and dignity all over the world, \nbut it means that we do so in a way that is likely to be effective.\n  Mr. President, if we do those things, then it will allow us to be \nmore firm on the missile treaty control regime. It will allow us to be \nmore firm on trade. The problem is, when you have two carrier battle \ngroups steaming in the Strait of Taiwan, then to invoke sanctions on \ntrade looks like a further step toward containment and cold war and \nmakes it inappropriate to take the kind of steps on trade or MTCR that \nyou ought to do.\n  So that, in effect, by dealing with Taiwan in a traditional way that \nwe should, that is to reassure all parties, one China, two systems, \npeaceful reunification--to reassure all parties that our policy allows \nus, then, to be more firm in areas that are likely to make it \neffective.\n  We have surely made our point. The Chinese, I submit, have made their \npoint, that is, they are not going to stand for a unilateral \ndeclaration of independence. We have made our point with not one but \ntwo carrier groups--not one but two carrier battle groups. We have made \nthat point strongly. We have stood up for Taiwan, our friend.\n  Now it is time for us to be more patient, to lower our voices, to \nhave a greater engagement with the People's Republic of China, to have \nhigh level discussions and, most of all, to kill this very ill-\nconsidered piece of legislation.\n  This piece of legislation, at this sensitive time, could do more than \nanything I know to put us at odds and put us in a position of \ncontainment and cold war with the largest nation on Earth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today the Senate considers H.R. 3136, a bill \nto increase the public debt limit to $5.5 trillion. The bill would also \nincrease the earnings limit for all Social Security recipients as well \nas provide regulatory relief for small businesses. The regulatory \nrelief package mirrors S. 942, which passed the Senate earlier this \nmonth by a vote of 100 to 0. As of last night, some details of that \npackage were still being finalized. Senator Bond, chairman of the Small \nBusiness Committee, will explain that portion of this bill. I will \nfocus my remarks on the Senior Citizens' Right to Work Act of 1996. \nHowever, before I do that, let me spend a few moments on the need for \nthe debt-limit increase.\n  Earlier this year, we passed two bills, H.R. 2924 and H.R. 3021, to \nprovide for temporary relief from the current debt limit. These two \nbills created new legal borrowing authority not subject to the debt \nlimit for a short period of time. Today we will act on the long-term \nextension. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this increase \nshould be sufficient through the end of fiscal year 1997.\n  Over the past decade, many have argued against raising the debt \nlimit, however, let me remind my colleagues that last fall we passed a \nbudget that would have achieved balance in 7 years. That legislation \nwould have gone a long way to reduce the amount of debt limit increases \nwhich are always so painful to enact. Unfortunately, as we all know, \nPresident Clinton decided to veto the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  If we fail to concur in the action of the House, or if President \nClinton were to veto this bill, we would find ourselves in a fiscal and \nfinancial crisis. The Government could not borrow and bills would only \nbe paid out of current receipts, leading to defaults on interest \npayments and payments to contractors as well as an inability to make \nall required benefit payments. These defaults would also lead to higher \ninterest rates.\n  Congress has raised the debt limit 33 times between 1980 and 1995. \nMany of these increases were short-term temporary extensions. It is \nimportant to remember that the increase of $600 billion included in \nthis bill is the third largest increase. The largest increase was in \nthe 1990 budget deal and the second largest was in the 1993 Clinton \ntax-increase bill.\n  I hope that the Senate expeditiously enacts this critically important \npiece of legislation to preserve the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  Now let me turn to title I of this bill. The Senior Citizens' Right \nto Work Act is a big step toward providing greater economic opportunity \nand security for America's senior citizens.\n  Under current law, millions of men and women between the ages of 65 \nand 69 are discouraged from working because they face a loss of their \nSocial Security benefits. If a senior citizen earns more than a certain \namount--the so-called earnings limit--he or she loses $1 in Social \nSecurity benefits for every $3 earned. The current earnings limit is a \nvery low amount--only $11,520.\n  Mr. President, this earnings limit is unfair to seniors and is a \nbarrier to a prosperous economic future of all Americans.\n  For today's seniors, the earnings limit can add up to a whopping tax \nbite. According to both the Congressional Research Service and the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, seniors who have wages above the earnings \nlimit can face marginal tax rates over 90 percent, when one factors in \nFederal and State taxes.\n\n  Mr. President, that is not right.\n\n[[Page S3115]]\n\n  But as unfair as the earnings test is today, it will be an even \nbigger problem in the future, a future that is rapidly approaching.\n  We all know the statistics concerning the aging of America. In the \nsame way, we realize more and more that much of our future economic \ngrowth will depend on the ability of older Americans to remain working.\n  Mr. President, why do we even have this earnings limit? Back in 1935, \nwhen the Social Security system was designed, it was widely believed \nthat the economy could support only a limited number of workers. \nPerhaps this belief was understandable 60 years ago--when we were in \nthe middle of the Great Depression. But today, few, if any, economists \nhold such a belief. In fact, most believe quite the opposite.\n  Mr. President, I also believe this bill will improve public \nconfidence in the Social Security system.\n  Social Security is a contract with the American people. Everyone \nworking today knows the taxes the Federal Government takes from them \neach payday will be returned by the Social Security program when they \nretire. For parents working to support a family, this sizable tax can \nbe--and often is--overwhelming.\n  But what too many seniors find out, Mr. President, is that the \nGovernment can exact a high price when they reach 65. If they continue \nto work, seniors are allowed to earn very little before the Government \nstarts taking back benefits. As I noted earlier, for every dollar a \nsenior earns over the earnings limit--currently only $11,530--he or she \nloses 33 cents in benefits.\n  Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate would raise the \nearnings limit for seniors aged 65 to 69 to $12,500 this year, and to \n$30,000 by 2002. This legislation is entirely paid for with real \nsavings, not gimmicks.\n  But we are not just spending money. This bill also provides $1.8 \nbillion of deficit reduction over 7 years.\n  Even better, according to the Social Security Administration, title I \nof this bill actually improves the long-range health of the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a memorandum from the \nOffice of the Actuary of the Social Security Administration that makes \nthis point be printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we all know the Social Security trust fund \nhas a long-range solvency problem. Beginning in 2013, payroll taxes \nwill no longer be enough to cover benefits, and by 2031 the trust fund \nsurplus will be depleted.\n  Although this bill is in no way a complete solution to that problem, \nevery little bit helps.\n  Lastly, let me note that title I contains two other provisions \nimportant to the health of the Social Security system.\n  First, the bill provides funding for continuing disability reviews. \nThese reviews are supposed to be done periodically to determine if \nindividuals receiving disability benefits under Social Security or SSI \ncontinue to be disabled. Historically, this important program integrity \nactivity has not been well funded, and the Social Security \nAdministration has a backlog of over 1 million reviews waiting to be \ndone. Social Security itself admits that billions of dollars have been \nlost from not doing these reviews, and even more money will be lost in \nthe future.\n  This bill will help fix that urgent problem.\n  Incidentally, the continuing disability review provision is supported \nby the Administration, and a very similar proposal is continued in the \nPresident's 1997 budget.\n  Second, title I of this bill contains a provision to protect the \nSocial Security and Medicare trust funds from underinvestment or \ndisinvestment--which has been endorsed by the Treasury Department.\n  Title I of this bill was reported out of the Finance Committee \nunanimously and a similar measure passed the House by the \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 411 to 4.\n  I am grateful to Senators Dole and McCain, both champions of raising \nthe earnings limit, for their tireless efforts on this issue. I am \nproud to join them in this effort.\n  Raising the earnings limit is also strongly supported by AARP.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from AARP be \nprinted in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, in closing on the earnings limit, let me \nquote two distinguished experts from the Urban Institute, Eugene \nSteuerle and Jon Bakija. These experts have stated, ``The simple fact \nis that the earnings test is a tattered remnant of a bygone era.''\n  Mr. President, let us act now, and send the message to America's \nseniors that we value their experience and skills.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                   March 22, 1996.\n     From: Stephen C. Goss, Deputy Chief Actuary.\n     Subject: Estimated, long-range OASDI financial effects of the \n         Senior Citizens' Right to Work Act of 1966--Information.\n     To: Harry C. Ballantyne, Chief Actuary.\n       Enacting the ``Senior Citizens' Right to Work Act of 1996'' \n     (Title II of H.R. 3136) would increase (improve) the long-\n     range OASDI actuarial balance by a total amount estimated at \n     0.03 percent of taxable payroll. The long-range solvency of \n     the OASDI program would thus be improved by reducing the \n     long-range deficit from 2.17 percent of taxable payroll to \n     2.14 percent of taxable payroll. These estimates are based on \n     the intermediate (alternative II) assumptions of the 1995 \n     Trustees Report. The balance of this memorandum describes the \n     long-range financial effects of the individual provisions of \n     the title.\n       Sections 204 and 205 of this act would each increase \n     (improve) the long-range OASDI actuarial balance by an \n     estimated 0.01 percent of taxable payroll. Section 204 would \n     require one-half support from a stepparent at time of filing \n     for a stepchild to receive benefits on the stepparent's \n     account, and terminate benefits to stepchildren upon the \n     divorce of the stepparent and the natural parent. Section 205 \n     would prohibit eligibility to DI (and SSI) disability \n     benefits based on drug addiction or alcohol abuse, \n     respectively. Section 202, which would raise the earnings \n     test exempt amount for beneficiaries at or above the normal \n     retirement age to $30,000 by 2002, would result in negligible \n     (estimated at less than 0.005 percent of taxable payroll) \n     changes in the long-range OASDI actuarial balance. Sections \n     206 (pilot study on information for OASDI beneficiaries), 207 \n     (protection of the trust funds), and 208 (professional staff \n     for the Social Security Advisory Board) would also result in \n     negligible effects on the long-range actuarial balance.\n       Section 203 authorizes the appropriation of specific \n     amounts to be made available for fiscal years 1996 through \n     2002 for continuing disability reviews. This provision will \n     have the effect of increasing the number of continuing \n     disability reviews through 2002, with the result that total \n     costs of the DI program will be lower for the long-range \n     period and that the solvency of the OASDI program will be \n     improved throughout the long-range period. Additional savings \n     will occur if continuing disability reviews continue at the \n     same level beyond 2002 as is provided for in this provision \n     through the year 2002. The effect of this provision, assuming \n     the appropriation of the specified amounts through 2002, is \n     estimated to be an additional increase (improvement) in the \n     long-range actuarial balance estimated at 0.01 percent of \n     taxable payroll.\n                                                  Stephen C. Goss.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: The American Association of Retired \n     Persons supports the Senior Citizens Right to Work Act--the \n     proposed increase in the Social Security earnings limit--on \n     the pending debt limit bill. We should be encouraging, not \n     penalizing, those who continue to work and contribute to the \n     economy.\n       AARP has long supported an increase in the earnings limit. \n     The current level of $11,520 penalizes beneficiaries age 65 \n     through 69 who desire to continue in the workforce. Your \n     proposal, which would increase the limit to $30,000 over a 7-\n     year period, is a fiscally responsible way of enabling many \n     moderate and middle-income beneficiaries to improve their \n     economic situation. AARP commends you and your committee for \n     your leadership in the effort to finally address this long-\n     overdue reform.\n       AARP believes that the earnings limit increase should be \n     financed in an appropriate manner in order to maintain the \n     integrity of the Social Security trust funds. While trade-\n     offs within the program are necessary, such financing is the \n     responsible course. Towards this end, the Association notes \n     that the Social Security actuaries have projected that your \n     proposal would result in an improvement in the long range \n     actuarial balance of the Social Security trust funds.\n\n[[Page S3116]]\n\n       The proposed increase in the earnings limit would also send \n     a strong signal to working beneficiaries that their skills, \n     expertise and enthusiasm are welcome in the workplace. The \n     public policy of this nation should be to encourage older \n     workers to remain in the workforce. Your proposal would \n     further that goal.\n       The Association remains committed to increasing the \n     earnings limit, and we are pleased that Congress and the \n     Administration have agreed to raise the earnings limit in the \n     104th Congress. Again, we thank you for your leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I express the appreciation and relief of \nall Members of this body and Americans everywhere that we shall, in \nvery short order, under this agreement extend the debt ceiling to $5.5 \ntrillion. That will take us through this fiscal year and past the next \nelection to about September 30, 1997. This particular drop-dead date is \nout of our way. We can have a good national debate on other issues.\n  I make the point, Mr. President, that while, again, we have to extend \nthe debt ceiling, for the first time since the 1960's, the United \nStates has a primary surplus in its budget, which is to say that the \nrevenues from taxes and other activities exceed the costs of the \noperations of the Federal Government.\n  Debt service makes for a continuing deficit, but it is coming down. \nThe total deficit this fiscal year will be approximately 2 percent of \ngross domestic product. It was 5.7 percent just a few years ago. This \nis a good development. It is a bipartisan one. The vote was bipartisan \nin the House. It is responsible behavior. I thank all concerned.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I particularly want to thank my colleague, \nthe chairman of the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. President, my friend and distinguished associate, Senator Jeff \nBingaman, has some very laudable concerns to raise the earnings limit \nfor the blind so that in future years it will increase in parallel with \nthe increase for retirees under Social Security, a provision included \nin this bill.\n  In that regard, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \nSenator McCain for his thoughtfulness in pressing a matter of concern \nto him. The earnings limitation is an obsolete provision from the \n1930's. We are gradually going to get rid of it now. Senator McCain \ndeserves great credit for that, and I would like to so express my \nappreciation.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank the managers of this \nlegislation for allowing us to interrupt. Otherwise, it was default by \nmidnight--well, midnight tomorrow. Even so, we have averted that, and \nwe can go on to the proper business of the Senate. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I certainly thank our colleague from \nNew York for his cordial management of this very important issue that \nhad to be resolved.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I had hoped to offer an amendment to the \ndebt limit bill that would have rectified an unjust situation in the \nlegislation concerning the Social Security earnings limit increase for \nretirees. My amendment would have reestablished the linkage between \nearnings limit increases for retirees and the blind, a linkage that has \nexisted since 1977. Unfortunately the bill we are considering ends that \nlinkage which I believe is unfair and not supported by adequate policy \nconsiderations. However, Mr. President, I understand that passage of \nthis amendment would have potentially damaged completion of the debt \nlimit bill, a bill that has too long been delayed by extremist \npolitics, so therefore I do not feel that now is an appropriate time to \npursue my amendment.\n  However, Mr. President, it is my understanding that the ranking \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Moynihan, has given me his \ncommitment to support my efforts in the Finance Committee and on the \nfloor of the Senate, if necessary, to support an amendment that \nreestablishes some linkage between the blind and retirees on the next \nbill reported out of the Finance Committee that amends the Social \nSecurity Act. Am I correct in that understanding?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from New Mexico is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I also understand that my friend and colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, will work with me to develop appropriate offsets that will \ninsure that this amendment will not violate the provisions of the \nBudget Act when the amendment comes before the Senate during this \nCongress. Am I correct in that understanding?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, the Senator from New Mexico is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill to increase \nthe public debt limit.\n  Twice last year, Congress passed legislation that properly coupled a \ndebt limit increase with the steps necessary to balance the budget and \nthus preclude the need for additional debt limit increases in the \nfuture. Twice, the President vetoed the bills.\n  Let us be clear. If there is any possibility that the Federal \nGovernment will default on its obligations, it is a result of the \nPresident's insatiable appetite to spend the taxpayers' money.\n  President Clinton opposed the Balanced Budget Amendment last year. He \nvetoed the Balanced Budget Act--the first balanced budget to have \npassed the Congress in 26 years. He vetoed appropriations bills that \ncomply with the strict budget limits for the current fiscal year.\n  It is the President's spending plan that, more than anything else, \nthreatens to bankrupt the Nation and condemn future generations to a \nforever declining standard of living.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing in this bill that will ensure \nprogress toward a balanced budget. The only reason the debt limit \nincrease is going to pass is that it has been coupled with an increase \nin the Social Security earnings limitation and regulatory reform for \nsmall businesses.\n  Senior citizens and small businesses should not be held hostage to a \ndebt limit increase. We should not have to vote to lead the Nation down \nthe road to bankruptcy in order to ensure that seniors can keep more of \ntheir hard-earned income or to relieve small businesses of the \nregulatory burden that is hindering them.\n  My constituents know where I stand on the earnings limitation. I have \ncosponsored legislation in the past to repeal it. I voted four times \nlast year on proposals relating to the repeal or raising of the \nearnings test, most recently on November 2, 1995.\n  No American should be discouraged from working, yet that is what the \nearnings limitation is specifically designed to do. The policy violates \nthe very principles of self-reliance and personal responsibility on \nwhich America was founded. It is wrong. Not only does the earnings \nlimit deny seniors the opportunity to work and supplement their \nretirement incomes, it denies American businesses a lifetime of \nexpertise that many seniors bring to their work. The earnings \nlimitation ought to be repealed.\n  The regulatory relief provisions of this bill passed the Senate just \nlast week by a vote of 100 to 0. The vote was unanimous. It was \nunanimous for a reason: small businesses are being overwhelmed by \nfederal rules and regulations.\n  Obviously, the regulatory relief measure could stand on its own \nmerit. The only reason to include it here is that it will help win \nvotes for the passage of the debt limit increase.\n  Mr. President, senior citizens, and small businessmen and women \ndeserve better than to be made scapegoats for another debt limit \nincrease. The earnings limit and regulatory reform provisions should be \nstripped from this bill and passed on their own merit. We should not, \nhowever, agree to any further increase in the debt limit until we first \nput the budget on a path to balance, and obviate the need for future \ndebt limit increases.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again we are debating whether or not \nto raise the Social Security earnings limit. The debt limit increase \nbill before the Senate contains what is basically the text of S. 1470, \nthe Senior Citizens Right to Work Act.\n  I have discussed this issue many times on the Senate floor and I do \nnot want to force my colleagues to listen to the same arguments that I \nhave\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\nmade here for the last 8 years. Therefore, I will be brief.\n  Passage of this bill will change a depression-era law that is \ndesigned to keep seniors out of the workplace. It is long overdue that \nwe take this action.\n  Mr. President, this bill would raise the Social Security earnings \nlimit from today's level of $11,280 per year to $30,000 per year over a \n7-year period. Currently, if a senior citizen earns over the $11,280 \nearnings limit, the senior loses 1 of every $3 he or she earns. By \nraising the limit to $30,000, seniors who need to work would be allowed \nto do so without facing this onerous penalty.\n  Let me emphasize, this bill does not repeal the earnings limit. \nAlthough I would like to see the limit repealed in its entirety, this \nbill does not do that. It merely raises the limit to $30,000. And, Mr. \nPresident, I don't think anyone here in the Senate believes that \n$30,000 per year is much money.\n  Rich seniors--those who live of lucrative investments, stock benefit, \ntrust accounts--are not effected by the earnings limit. Their income is \nsafe and sound. The earnings limit only effects seniors who are forced \nto survive from earned income. Therefore, this bill has no effect on \nwell-off seniors.\n  On the other hand, a working senior--one who works at McDonalds, or \nDisney or anywhere just to make ends meet--will benefit greatly by \npassage of this bill. And the 1.4 million seniors who are burdened by \nthis onerous earnings test will be able to use the money they save due \nto its change to make their lives a little better.\n  Again, Mr. President, I don't want to belabor my colleagues with a \nlong dissertation on this matter. They have all heard the arguments \nagain and again. And I believe, if one is to believe the lofty \nstatements that sometimes appear in the Record, that virtually every \nMember of this Senate supports taking action on this matter.\n  But year after year there have been one reason or another for Members \nto defeat this bill. There is always some excuse. Well, Mr. President, \nthe time for excuses is over.\n  The bill before the Senate is not perfect. Many have concerns over \ntechnical aspects of it. But, Mr. President, now is the time to pass \nthis measure. If any Members object to a pay for in this bill, then let \nthem suggest an alternative. The sponsors of this bill are open to \nsuggestions. But let me make the record completely clear, any Member \nwho comes to the floor and argues on some technical parliamentary issue \nis working to defeat this bill.\n  Unlike the last time this bill was brought before the Senate, we pay \nfor this bill without touching discretionary spending.\n  This bill is paid for. It is paid for 10 years. It is paid for out of \nmandatory spending. And specifically, it is paid for out of Social \nSecurity.\n  This bill is paid for by the following changes I will outline:\n  This bill pays for the increase in the earnings limit through two \nmajor changes in present law.\n  First, the bill ends entitlement to SSDI and SSI disability benefits \nif drug addiction or alcoholism are the contributing factors material \nto the determination of disability. Those individuals with drug \naddiction or alcoholism who have another severe disabling condition \nwill still be able to qualify for benefits based on that disability. So \nthe only individuals who will lose benefits are those whose sole \ndisabling condition is drug addiction or alcoholism.\n  In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, $50 million of the savings from this \nchange will be added to the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment \nBlock Grant, providing additional funds for treatment services. This \napproach recognizes that while drug addicts and alcoholics need \ntreatment, they are not in fact helped by cash benefits which can be \nused to pay for their addiction or drinking.\n  I would like to emphasize that those individuals with a drug \naddiction or alcoholism condition who have another severe disabling \ncondition will still be able to qualify for benefits based on that \ndisability. In these cases, the bill requires that benefits be paid to \na representative payee if the Commissioner of Social Security finds \nthat this would serve the interest of the individual. In addition, the \nbill requires that individuals whose benefits are paid to a \nrepresentative payee be referred to the appropriate State agency for \nsubstance abuse treatment services. This approach recognizes that such \nindividuals not only need substance abuse treatment but often need the \nassistance of others to ensure that their cash benefits are not used to \nsustain their addiction. Over a 5-year period, this change will save \napproximately $3.5 billion.\n\n  Second, the bill makes several changes in the entitlement of \nstepchildren to Social Security benefits. For a stepchild to receive \nbenefits on the stepparent's account, the bill requires that a \nstepparent provide at least 50 percent of the stepchild's support, and \nfor stepchildren to receive survivor's benefits, the bill requires that \nthe stepparent provided at least 50 percent of the child's support \nimmediately prior to death. In addition, a stepchild's Social Security \nbenefits are terminated following the divorce of natural parent and the \nstepparent. These changes will ensure that benefits are only paid to \nstepchildren who are truly dependent on the stepparent for their \nsupport, and only as long as the natural parent and stepparent are \nmarried. Over a 5-year period, these changes will save approximately \n$870 million.\n  Taken together, these two changes will not only offset the cost of \nraising the earnings test limit, but will also improve the long term \nsolvency of the Social Security system. In addition, the bill permits \nadjustments to the discretionary spending caps, so that spending for \nContinuing Disability Reviews [CDR's] can be increased. If these cap \nadjustments are fully used and the additional reviews are conducted, an \nadditional savings of approximately $3.5 billion could result. Although \nthese savings are not needed to pay for the increase in the earnings \ntest limit, they would also increase the long term solvency of the \nSocial Security System.\n  Mr. President, current law applies such an onerous and unfair tax to \nworking seniors that they are effectively forced to stop working. This \nis unconscionable and it must be changed. Basically, passage of this \nbill will allow seniors who do not have enough in savings or pensions \nto work to make ends meet.\n  It does not help rich seniors who have stocks and bonds. Money \nderived from those sources is currently exempt from the earnings limit. \nThis limit only affects earned income--money earned by seniors who go \nto work everyday for an hourly wage.\n  Mr. President, this bill would raise the Social Security earnings \nlimit from today's level of $11,280 per year to $30,000 per year over a \n7 year period.\n  I strongly believe this reform will result in a change in the \nbehavior of our Nation's seniors. When we raise the earnings limit, \nseniors will work more, and thus pay more in taxes. I hope that all my \ncolleagues understand this point. This bill will benefit working \nseniors--those most in need of our help.\n  Unfortunately, under a static scoring model--one used by the \nCongressional Budget Office--this amendment would be scored at costing \njust over $7 billion dollars.\n  And once again, I want to repeat, this bill is fully paid for without \ntouching discretionary spending.\n  Mr. President, the Social Security earnings test was created during \nthe depression era when senior citizens were being discouraged from \nworking. This may have been appropriate then when 50 percent of \nAmericans were out of work, but it is certainly not appropriate today. \nIt is not appropriate today when seniors are struggling to get ahead \nand survive on limited incomes. Many of these seniors are working to \nsurvive and make it day to day.\n  Most people are amazed to find that older Americans are actually \npenalized by the Social Security earnings test for their productivity. \nFor every $3 earned by a retiree over the $11,280 limit, they lose $1 \nin Social Security benefits. Due to this cap on earnings, our senior \ncitizens, many of whom are existing on low incomes, are effectively \nburdened with a 33.3 percent tax on their earned income. Combined with \nFederal, State, and other Social Security taxes, it will amount to a \nshocking 55- to 65-percent tax bite, and sometimes even more--Federal \ntax--15 percent, FICA--7.65 percent, earnings test penalty--33.3 \npercent, State and local tax--5 percent. Obviously, this earnings cap \nis punitive, and serves as a tremendous disincentive to work. No one \nwho is struggling along at $11,000 a year should\n\n[[Page S3118]]\n\nhave to face an effective marginal tax rate which exceeds 55 percent.\n  This is an issue of fairness. Why are we forcing people not to work? \nWhy are we punishing people for trying to ``make it.'' No American \nshould be discouraged from working. Unfortunately, as a result of the \nearnings test, Americans over the age of 65 are being punished for \nattempting to be productive. The earnings test doesn't take into \naccount an individual's desire or ability to contribute to society. It \narbitrarily mandates that a person retire at age 65 or suffer the \nconsequences.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the earnings cap is a serious threat to the \nwelfare of low-income senior citizens. Once the earnings cap has been \nreached, a person with a job providing just $5 an hour would find that \nthe after tax value of that wage drops to less than $3. A person with \nno private pension or liquid investments--which, by the way, are not \ncounted as ``earnings''--from his or her working years may need to work \nin order to meet the most basic expenses, such as shelter, food and \nhealth-care costs.\n  There is also a myth that repeal of the earnings test would only \nbenefit the rich. Nothing could be further from the truth. The highest \neffective marginal rates are imposed on the middle income elderly who \nmust work to supplement their income. Plus these middle income seniors \nare precisely the group that was hit hardest by the 85-percent tax \nincrease included in President Clinton's Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993. This tax increase hits hardest those seniors who were frugal \nduring their working lives in order to save toward their retirement \nsince the tax affects both their Social Security and their savings. The \n85 percent increase has hit a group of seniors who are far from rich \nwith a triple whammy and is a further disincentive to these seniors who \ncould further contribute to our economic growth by working.\n\n  We have a massive Federal deficit. Studies have found that repealing \nthe earnings test could net $140 million in extra Federal revenue. \nFurthermore, the earnings test is costing us $15 billion a year in \nreduced production. Taxes on that lost production would go a long way \ntoward reducing the budget deficit. Nor, as it continues to become \ntougher to compete globally, can America afford to pursue any policy \nthat adversely affects production or effectively prevents our citizens \nfrom working.\n  Mr. President, let me also note that changes to the earnings test \nwill in no way jeopardize the solvency of the Social Security trust \nfunds. Let me clarify for the record that the Social Security system \nwill in no way be at risk if we alter the status quo in regards to the \nearnings test. To claim it would is a red herring and is unfortunately \nnothing more than a cruel scare tactic.\n  Let me also point out that one very disturbing consequence of the \nPresident's tax increase on Social Security is that it continues to \npunish those seniors who do work--what little they can due to the \nearnings test--in order to make ends meet. They are hit with both the \ntax on their benefits and the Social Security earnings test penalty. \nThis is completely unfair.\n  It is certainly true that our Nation's seniors--as a group --are \nbetter off today that they were when Social Security was created in \n1935. It is also true that many other groups in our society are \nsuffering from declining standards of living. Deficit reduction and \neconomic growth are of paramount concern for this Nation. But \nincreasing the taxation of Social Security benefits is neither an \nappropriate nor effective way to achieve these goals.\n  Finally, it is simply outrageous to continue two separate policies \nthat both keep people out of the work force who are experienced and \nwant to work. We have been warned to expect a labor shortage. Why \nshould we discourage our senior citizens from meeting that challenge? \nAs the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which strongly supports this \nlegislation, has pointed out, ``retraining older workers already is a \npriority in labor intensive industries, and will become even more \ncritical as we approach the year 2000.''\n  A number of our Nation's prominent senior organizations are lining up \nin favor of repealing both of these measures. Among these groups are \nthe National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the \nSeniors Coalition.\n  Mr. President, before I finish, I want to discuss the issue of \ndelinking the blind. Let me clarify for the record that I support what \nmy colleague from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman had wanted to accomplish. \nThe Social Security earnings limit effects more than just the elderly, \nit also effects the earnings of blind individuals who receive \nGovernment benefits. Unfortunately, the provisions of S. 1470 which \nwere added to the debt ceiling bill breaks the link between the blind \nand the earnings limit.\n  Now we must act on the debt ceiling, which we must soon pass in order \nto ensure that the Government is not forced to close. There is not time \nto amend this bill and call a conference committee. We must send the \ndebt ceiling to the White House as soon as possible. I was not pleased \nthat the rule in the House did not allow for this issue to be fully \naddressed. But the House has acted and we are now limited by such \naction. This leaves us with few options.\n  I would hope, Mr. President, that perhaps the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, and myself could agree on some \ndate certain for the Finance Committee to address this issue. We could \ngive our assurances to the blind community that the Finance Committee \nwould act and that if they did not, then Mr. Bingaman and I would offer \nthis amendment to another bill.\n  I would hope that we could take that path.\n  I know it is not the perfect solution. But I am doubtful that we will \nbe able to solve this problem today.\n  Further, the Senator from New Mexico's amendment would not have fully \nrelinked the blind to the earnings limit. The provisions of the Senior \nCitizens Freedom to Work Act raises the earnings limit from \napproximately $11,000 to $30,000 over a 7 year period. The Bingaman \namendment would only raise the earnings limit for the blind from \n$11,000 to $14,000. Although this amendment offers the blind some \nrelief, it does not offer full linkage.\n  I would hope that we could fully re-link the blind to the earnings \nlimit at the appropriate time.\n  I want all my friends in the blind community to know that I will work \nwith them to see to it that this issue is properly addressed. I know \nthat all of my colleagues are keenly aware of the problems associated \nwith employment for the blind. But as I noted, we must pass this debt \nceiling bill now. We cannot wait. We cannot risk closing the \nGovernment.\n  And I again, give every assurance I can to the blind community that \nwe will address this issue and we will do it very soon.\n  Mr. President, in closing, America cannot afford to continue to \npursue two separate policies that adversely effect production and are \nunfairly burdensome to one particular segment of society. Our Nation \nwould be better served if we eliminate the burdensome earnings test and \nthe grossly unfair tax increase and provide freedom, opportunity and \nfairness for our Nation's senior citizens.\n  For 8 long years I have fought to relax the Social Security earnings \ntest. When the President signs this bill tonight or tomorrow, the \nbattle will have been won and America's seniors have a right to \nrejoice.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, today, we are considering legislation which \nwill extend the current $4.9 trillion debt ceiling to $5.5 trillion. I \nam pleased that the administration and the leadership on both sides \nwere able to come together to take permanent action on this issue. \nHowever, I want to focus my comments on another important change \nincluded in this bill: Senator McCain's proposal to raise the Social \nSecurity earnings limit.\n  This has been a priority for many years because of the earning \nlimit's detrimental impact on retirees with low and moderate incomes \nwho have to work out of necessity to maintain a decent standard of \nliving. I hope that raising the limit will help these senior citizens \nwho are just barely getting by with a Social Security check and \nwhatever other income they can scrape together.\n  It is also clear that more and more retirees will need to work in the \nfuture. Retirement forecasters report that baby boomers did not get an \nearly\n\n[[Page S3119]]\n\nstart on saving for retirement, so even more senior citizens will find \nit necessary to supplement their retirement savings and benefits with \nwork to maintain a decent standard of living in the future.\n  To minimize the impact on the financial health of the trust fund that \nwill occur when the limit is raised, we have had to accept tradeoffs. \nWe will eliminate drug addiction and alcoholism as a basis for \ndisability under the Supplemental Security Income Program and the \nDisability Insurance Program. This change is estimated to save about \n$5.5 billion in spending.\n  The operation of these two programs has a direct effect on the \nstability of Social Security. The public's positive perception of \nSocial Security as our most successful Federal program is being \nthreatened--not only because of the risk of insolvency--but also \nbecause of fraud and program inefficiencies in the Federal disability \nprograms.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that we are already shifting payroll \ntaxes away from the retirement side of Social Security to shore up the \ndisability insurance trust fund. This reallocation has represented a \nshift of more than $38 billion in the last 2 years. By 2004, more than \n$190 billion will be transferred to the Disability Insurance Program. \nWe must continue to guard against the abuse of these Federal benefits, \nparticularly when we are taking funds out of retirement and putting \nfunds into a program that is deeply troubled.\n  A blatant example of how our Federal disability programs have gone \nhaywire came to light more than 2 years ago in an investigation of SSI \nand SSDI benefits being paid to drug addicts and alcoholics. The \ninvestigation was conducted by my staff on the Special Committee on \nAging with the General Accounting Office.\n  We found that the word on the street is that SSI benefits are an easy \nsource of cash for drugs and alcohol. The message of the disability \nprograms had been: ``If you are an addict or an alcoholic, the money \nwill keep flowing as long as you stay addicted. If you get off the \naddiction, the money stops.''\n  Rather than encouraging rehabilitation and treatment, the disability \nprograms' cash payments have perpetuated and enabled drug addiction and \ndependency.\n  At a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging I chaired, we \nheard from Bob Cote, the director of a homeless shelter in Denver. Mr \nCote told the committee in riveting testimony that he personally knew \n46 drug addicts who had died from drug overdoses from the drugs they \nbought with SSI checks. Mr. Cote went on to testify that a liquor store \ndown the street from his shelter was the representative payee for over \n$200,000 in SSI checks, and a bar just two doors down from his shelter \nwas the representative payee for $160,000 in SSI checks.\n  Taxpayers were outraged to learn that situations like these have been \ngoing on for years with almost no oversight by the Social Security \nAdministration on how these tax dollars and trust fund moneys have been \nused.\n\n  Congress took steps to place better protections on the disability \npayments made to addicts and alcoholics. We mandated that all persons \nreceiving disability benefits due to alcohol or drug abuse must receive \ntreatment, imposed a 3-year cutoff for benefits for addicts and \nalcoholics, and toughened the representative payee rules in order to \nget cash out of the hands of addicts.\n  These reforms are now in effect and early examination suggests that \nthis carrot and stick approach has worked to stem abuses in the \ndisability program. The referral and monitoring system which was \noverhauled in 1994 more than pays for itself and will save the Federal \nGovernment more than $25 million in 1996.\n  The legislation before us today allows the Commissioner of the Social \nSecurity Administration to continue to refer drug addicts and \nalcoholics to treatment. Eliminating drug addiction and alcoholism as a \ndisability will result in only 25 percent of recipients diagnosed as \ndrug addicts or alcoholics actually leaving the program. A substantial \nportion will stay on the rolls, continuing to receive checks without \nreceiving treatment. It is very important that the treatment money be \nmade available to the States to rehabilitate substance abusers.\n  The legislation continues to require the use of responsible \nrepresentative payees who will ensure that the Federal checks are being \nused for living expenses--not drugs and not alcohol.\n  The legislation also takes the necessary step to allocate funding to \nconduct continuing disability reviews [CDR's]. Until now, our hands \nhave been tied because of the appropriations caps on discretionary \nspending. I commend Senator McCain's acknowledgment that it is short-\nsighted to ignore the need to provide more resources to SSA to comply \nwith the mandate to perform CDR's. In the SSDI program, the agency is \nexperiencing a backlog rate of more than 1.4 million cases. With that \ntype of backlog, getting on disability means a lifetime of benefits, \neven for persons who could return to work. A recent HHS Inspector \nGeneral report concluded that $1.4 billion could be saved if we could \nperform CDR's just on those backlogged cases.\n  Finally, we need to turn our attention to the current return to work \npolicies in these two programs. Last year, the Senate Aging Committee \nbegan to review the record of SSA to promote rehabilitation for people \nwith disabilities. Appallingly, only about 1 in every 1,000 persons on \nthe disability rolls gets off the program through the SSA's \nrehabilitation efforts. The Federal disability programs have failed to \nkeep pace with a more accessible workplace being created through the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act and advances in medical technology.\n  More must be done to ensure that people with disabilities who can and \nwant to return to the work force are given some assistance. There are a \nsignificant number of disabled recipients who want to work. \nUnfortunately, the program now discourages recipients from even trying \nto work, because they fail to take into consideration how recipients \ncan be retrained and rehabilitated to eventually leave the rolls. I \nbelieve that we must pursue a policy which will put a greater emphasis \non rehabilitation and return to work. At the same time we are \nacknowledging the benefits of allowing senior citizens to retain more \nof their earnings--a work incentive--we need to be open to the same \nideas for people with disabilities.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is important that my colleagues \nrecognize two very important aspects of the legislation we are \nconsidering today.\n  First, this legislation increases spending on Social Security and \noffsets that spending, in part, by using savings that had been \nidentified as necessary to bring about a balanced budget. The language \nwas changed at the last minute so that a point of order against using \nnon-Social Security savings to pay for Social Security spending could \nbe avoided. But I do think my colleagues should be aware that this \nlegislation uses savings that had been identified for reducing the \ndeficit.\n  Second, the savings in this legislation exceeds the level that is \nneeded to pay for the spending increase. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this legislation achieves $3.5 billion in on-budget \nsavings, and $1.8 billion in net savings over 7 years.\n  The impact of these provisions on the deficit would actually be \nhigher than the CBO numbers indicate. This is because the bill would \nallow the discretionary spending caps to be increased in order to \nconduct more continuing disability reviews. These reviews are conducted \nto verify that beneficiaries are still entitled to disability benefits. \nBecause of budgetary pressures, and competing priorities, the Social \nSecurity Administration has not been able to conduct as many CDRs as \nthey would like. CBO estimates that, if fully utilized, this provision \ncould result in net savings of $800 million dollars by the year 2002.\n  Finally, the savings are understated because CBO does not take into \nconsideration the fact that raising the earnings limit means that \nbeneficiaries who work will receive higher Social Security benefits. \nUnder current law, if their income is high enough, they will be \nobligated to pay higher taxes. Actuaries at the Social Security \nadministration estimate the impact to be $726 million over the 7-year \nbudget window.\n  In sum, Mr. President, the net impact of the legislation we are \nadopting today is, in effect, to make a down payment on deficit \nreduction of more than $3 billion over 7 years.\n\n[[Page S3120]]\n\n                   senior citizens' right to work act\n\n  Mr. Graham. Mr. President, in this Congress, we have talked a lot \nabout reforming welfare, about empowering people to help themselves, \nabout removing disincentives to work for able-bodied citizens. Well, \nMr. President, here is our chance.\n  Here are citizens who are not looking for hand-outs, who are not \nlooking for favors, who are not even looking for help. These people are \nnot looking for anything but the right to contribute--as working, tax-\npaying citizens--to their country. Are we going to continue to say, no, \nyou cannot work. No, you cannot contribute. No, you cannot be \nconsidered a valuable part of our Nation's workforce?\n  Mr. President, I submit to you that our senior citizens can be a \nvaluable part of our workforce. They have the experience, the maturity, \nand the desire to contribute to the workforce. And many of them are \nable to work and contribute significantly.\n  Mr. President, the Social Security earnings test may be our Nation's \nbiggest disincentive to allowing those who want to work, who have asked \nto work, to continue to contribute meaningfully. Isn't it ironic that \nwe have been talking about removing disincentives to work for those who \nare on welfare, yet preventing our Nation's seniors from contributing \nin any meaningful way?\n  These seniors are not on welfare; rather, they have spent a lifetime \ncontributing to the Social Security Program--they have earned their \nbenefits. We should not use the reduction of these benefits to prevent \nour seniors from working.\n  For every $3 that seniors aged 65 to 69 earn over $11,520 this year, \nthe Federal Government takes away $1 in Social Security benefits. \nAccording to the Social Security Administration, about 930,000 seniors \nin this age group are affected by the earnings cap. But let me bring \nthis policy issue away from the statistics.\n  Each month, I take a different job to stay in touch with the people I \nrepresent. In 1991, I took a job bagging groceries at the Winn-Dixie \nsupermarket in Pace, FL, which is near Pensacola. I worked with a man \nby the name of Jim Young, who is a father of three and grandfather of \ntwo. And Jim needs to work. Like many Americans, Jim is looking ahead \nto the legal age of retirement with full benefits, but without a big \nretirement savings account. Listen to Jim Young explain this issue: ``I \ndon't have retirement savings, and there are a lot of other people who \ndon't either.''\n  Jim Young would like to work past the age of 65. He needs to work \npast the age of 65. And by current law, if Jim makes $18,000 when he \nturns 65--just $18,000, he will lose $1200 of his Social Security \nbenefits. To people like Jim Young, to most older Americans, that's a \nlot of money. Why should the Government put up a barrier to block Jim \nYoung from working, from supporting his family?\n  Some opponents of this legislation may make the argument that reform \nisn't needed because older Americans are well-off and therefore, don't \nneed to work. To those people, I say: Talk to Jim Young, who now works \nin the produce department at Winn-Dixie. Talk to Winn-Dixie and find \nout whether employers want to hire the talents of older Americans like \nJim Young.\n  True, when the Social Security earnings test was designed, it may \nhave made sense to discourage older Americans from working, under the \nrationale that keeping seniors out of the job market would free up jobs \nfor younger people who needed work.\n  But times have changed. The declining birth rate after the post-World \nWar II baby boomer generation means that fewer teens are in the job \nmarket. Many employers are looking for seniors to fill jobs. And people \nlike Jim Young are ready to work. They need to work. And to these \npeople, we should say, ``Go ahead. Support your family. Help yourself \nto improve your quality of life. We won't stand in your way.''\n  Social Security was not designed to be the sole support of our senior \ncitizens, but now, many seniors--like Jim Young--have little savings to \nsupplement their benefits. And we have been saying to those seniors who \ncan work, to those senior who want to work, that we want to penalize \nthem for their efforts? This policy is unfair to our seniors. And even \nworse, it doesn't make sense.\n  Without the earnings cap, more seniors would likely choose to \ncontinue working. Additional revenue would be generated through Social \nSecurity and income taxes paid on their wages. This would substantially \noffset the increase in benefit payments.\n  In addition, we have been struggling to find ways to improve the \nlong-term solvency of the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance \nProgram. The Social Security Administration estimates that the offsets \nin this legislation would pay for the increase in the earnings limit. \nBut the offsets would also improve the long-term solvency of the OASDI \nprogram by about 0.03 percent. That's not a lot, but it's a step in the \nright direction.\n  So you see, Mr. President, we cannot afford to discourage our older \npopulation from working. We need their experience. We need their \nskills. And we need to allow them to provide for their families.\n  When I go home to Florida and I see Jim Young and all of the other \nJim Youngs who are working to support themselves and their loved ones, \nI want to say, we are proud of your efforts. We salute your efforts. \nAnd we thank you for your valuable contributions to this great Nation \nof ours.\n  So as we continue to talk about welfare reform and look for ways to \nhelp able-bodied people get back to work, I say: Let us take this issue \nout of the welfare arena and apply it to those who are not on welfare, \nto those who simply want to receive the benefits they have earned while \ncontinuing to be a part of the workforce. Let us look to our mothers, \nour fathers, our grandparents. Let us look to Jim Young.\n  Mr. President, approving this legislation to allow our seniors to \nwork is good policy. It is fiscally sound. And it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, clearly, the American people believe that \nWashington has too much control over their everyday lives. They \nattribute much of this to a Federal bureaucracy that has grown out of \ncontrol over the last several decades. Today, the Senate will take a \nmajor step toward holding regulatory agencies accountable for the \nrulemakings they issue. In an effort to return common sense to Federal \nregulations, we are sending to the President legislation which will \nprovide a formal Congressional review process of regulations issued by \nFederal agencies.\n  The Congressional Review Act before us is similar to S. 219, the \nRegulatory Transition Act that passed the Senate 100-0 a year ago this \nweek. I fully concur with changes made by the House to the Senate bill \nand believe this represents a workable consensus agreement.\n  It is estimated that the direct cost to the public and private \nsectors complying with Federal regulations was $668 billion in 1995. \nThis translates into a cost of $6,000 annually for the average American \nhousehold. This means higher prices for the cars we drive, the houses \nwe live in, and the food we consume. It also means diminished wages, \nincreased taxes, and reduced government services.\n  The Congressional Review Act provides for a 60-day review period \nfollowing the issuance of any Federal agency final rule during which \nthe Congress may enact a joint resolution of disapproval, under a fast-\ntrack procedure in the Senate. If the joint resolution passes both \nHouses, it must be presented to the President for his action.\n  As in the Senate-passed version, the Congressional Review Act \nprovides for a formal congressional review procedure following the \nissuance of any final rule by a Federal agency, during which the \nCongress has an opportunity to review the rule and, if it chooses, \nenact a joint resolution of disapproval. An expedited review procedure \nis provided in the Senate for 60 session days beginning on the later of \nthe date Congress receives the agency's report on the rule, or the date \nthe final rule is published in the Federal Register.\n  Upon issuing a final rule, a Federal agency must send to Congress and \nGAO a report containing a copy of the rule and also send to GAO or if \nrequested, to Congress, the complete cost-benefit analysis, if any, \nprepared for the rule and the agency's analyses required by the \nRegulatory Flexibility and Unfunded Mandates Acts.\n\n[[Page S3121]]\n\n  For major final rules, GAO shall provide within 15 days to the \nappropriate committee an assessment of the agency's compliance with the \nregulatory flexibility, unfunded mandates, and cost-benefit analyses \nperformed by the agency.\n  Any Senator or Representative may introduce a resolution of \ndisapproval of an agency final rule. The joint resolution of \ndisapproval, which declares that the rule has no force or effect, will \nbe referred to the committees of jurisdiction.\n  As provided in the Senate version the agreement contains the look-\nback provision provided to permit congressional review of major final \nrules issued between March 1, 1996, and the date of enactment.\n  With regard to concerns raised about unnecessary legal challenges to \nrules, this act, as in the Senate-passed version, provides that ``no \ndetermination, finding, action, or omission under this title shall be \nsubject to judicial review.''\n  The agreement does not provide for expedited procedures in the House, \nbut terminates the use of the Senate procedures on the 60th session \nday, instead of the 45-calendar-day review that was provided in the \nSenate version.\n  The Senate expedited procedures can be used to consider a resolution \nof disapproval that may be introduced with respect to most Federal \nagency final rules. All final rules that are published less than 60 \nsession days before a session of Congress adjourns sine die, or that \nare published during sine die adjournment, shall be eligible for review \nand for fast-track disapproval procedures in the Senate for 60 session \ndays beginning on the 15th session day following the date the new \nsession of Congress convenes.\n  If the Senate committees of jurisdiction have not reported the \nresolution of disapproval within 20 calendar days from the date \nCongress receives the agency's report on the rule, or on the date the \nfinal rule is published in the Federal Register, whichever is later, a \npetition signed by 30 Senators may discharge the committee from further \nconsideration and place the resolution of disapproval directly on the \ncalendar.\n  Under the Senate procedures, the motion to proceed to the joint \nresolution is privileged and is not debatable. Once the Senate has \nmoved to proceed to the resolution of disapproval, debate on the \nresolution is limited to 10 hours, equally divided, with no motions--\nother than a motion to further limit debate--or amendments in order. If \nthe resolution passes one body, it is eligible for immediate \nconsideration on the floor of the other body.\n  As provided in the Senate version, the Congressional Review Act \ndeclares that no court or agency shall infer any intent of the Congress \nfrom any action or inaction of the Congress with regard to a rule \nunless the Congress enacts a joint resolution of disapproval regarding \nthat rule. As all of my colleagues are well aware, the Congress at any \ntime can review and change, or decide not to change, rules or their \nunderlying statutes. Accordingly, it is my belief that the courts \nshould not treat the mere introduction of a joint resolution of \ndisapproval as grounds for granting a stay to any greater or lesser \nextent than the courts now take cognizance of any other bills that are \nintroduced.\n  Major final rules, which the Congressional Review Act defines as \nfinal rules that meet the criteria for ``major rules'' set forth in the \nReagan Administration's Executive Order 12291, may not take effect \nuntil at least 60 calendar days after the rule is published. However, \nmajor final rules addressing imminent threats to health and safety, or \nother emergencies, criminal law enforcement, matters of national \nsecurity, or issued pursuant to any statute implementing an \ninternational trade agreement may be exempted by Executive Order from \nthe 60-day minimum delay in the effective date. The decision by the \nPresident to exempt any major final rule from the delay is not subject \nto judicial review.\n  Major final rules would not go into effect after the 60-day period if \nthe joint resolution of disapproval has passed both Houses within that \ntime. If the joint resolution of disapproval is vetoed, the effective \ndate of the final rule will continue to be postponed until 30 session \ndays have passed after the veto, or the date on which either House \nfails to override the veto, whichever is earlier.\n  To address statutory or judicial deadlines that apply to disapproved \nrules, these deadlines are extended for one year after the date of \nenactment of the joint resolution.\n  Currently, Congress must approve tax increases, and thanks to the \nUnfunded Mandates Act passed last year must also focus its attention on \nany major unfunded mandate. But Congress has virtually no formal role, \nother than oversight, over the promulgation of a Federal regulation, \neven if its impact on the economy is measured in billions of dollars. \nThere may have been a time in our Nation's history where congressional \nreview wasn't important. But agencies are now very large, with broad \nauthorities and individual agendas. This new act will help Congress \ncarry out its responsibility to the American people to ensure that \nFederal regulatory agencies are carrying out congressional intent.\n  Finally, I wish to extend my sincere appreciation to Senator Harry \nReid who has worked tirelessly on this issue since its inception.\n\n\n mia's in north korea--section 1607--united states-north korea agreed \n                               framework\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we prepare to vote on the conference \nreport on H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995, \nI would like to direct my colleagues' attention to one provision of the \nact that relates to what, I believe, is an often-overlooked issue. That \nissue is the fate of more than 8,100 American servicemen from the \nKorean war.\n  We have always demanded the fullest possible accounting in Vietnam \nfor those listed as missing in action, and the question that I think \nmust be asked is, why not North Korea as well?\n  Of the 8,100 servicemen not accounted for after the Korean war, at \nleast 5,433 of these were lost north of the 38th parallel. In Vietnam, \nby contrast, the number of unresolved cases is 2,168, and Vietnam has \ncooperated in 39 joint field activities.\n  The United States Government recently announced plans to contribute \n$2 million through United Nations agencies to relieve starvation in \nNorth Korea. The donation was consistent with other instances where the \nUnited States seeks to relieve human suffering, despite disagreements \nwith the government of the receiving country.\n  What is inconsistent with United States policy is our failure to \nensure that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea addresses the \nhumanitarian issue of greatest concern to the American people--the \nresolution of the fate of servicemen missing in action since the end of \nthe Korean war.\n  I think the families of the servicemen see that same inconsistency. I \nwould refer my colleagues to a March 26, 1996, front page story in the \nWashington Post, ``The Other MIAs, Americans Seek Relatives Lost in \nKorea.'' In that story, the President of the Korean/Cold War Family \nAssociation of the Missing was quoted as saying: ``North Korea wants \nhumanitarian assistance, yet they won't give it themselves. Our \nfamilies are starving to know what happened to their loved ones. We \nwant an accounting for these men. They deserve an accounting. It's \ngrossly dishonorable to walk away from them.'' I could not say it \nbetter.\n  I remind my colleagues that relations between the United States and \nVietnam did not even begin to thaw until the Government of Vietnam \nagreed to joint field operations with the United States military to \nsearch for missing servicemen. The pace and scope of normalization was \ncommensurate with Vietnam's cooperation on the MIA issue and other \nhumanitarian concerns. In every discussion between United States \nGovernment officials and their Vietnamese counterparts, the MIA issue \nwar paramount. The Vietnamese received very clear signals that progress \nin normalizing relations with the United States would come only after \nprogress was made on the MIA issue.\n  In contrast to our Vietnam policy, United States policy toward North \nKorea lacks this focus. The recent announcement regarding food aid did \nnot mention our interest in the MIA issue. The agreed framework between \nthe United States and the DPRK does not talk about cooperation on \nMIA's--even though the framework commits the United States to give the \nDPRK free\n\n[[Page S3122]]\n\noil and supply two highly advanced light-water reactors; a total \npackage that exceeds $5 billion--$4 billion for the reactors and $500 \nmillion for the oil, not counting potential future aid for the grid \nsystem to distribute the power that the reactors will produce. The \nagreed framework also envisions the United States lifting trade \nrestrictions and normalizing relations--regardless of any movement on \nthe MIA issue.\n  The most obvious difference between Vietnam and North Korea is North \nKorea's nuclear program. The United States has an overriding national \nsecurity interest in stopping the North Korea nuclear program. \nNevertheless, I do not believe we should have ignored the MIA issue. \nThat is why I have introduced legislation (S. 1293) that would prevent \nestablishing full diplomatic relations or lifting the trade embargo \nuntil the DPRK has agreed to joint field operations.\n  The conference report before us is consistent with S. 1293. Section \n1607 states the sense of the Congress that:\n\n       the President should not take further steps toward \n     upgrading diplomatic relations with North Korea beyond \n     opening liaison offices or relaxing trade and investment \n     barriers imposed against North Korea without . . . obtaining \n     positive and productive cooperation from North Korea on the \n     recovery of remains of Americans missing in action from the \n     Korean war without consenting to exorbitant demands by North \n     Korea for financial compensation.\n\n  I urge the Clinton administration to pursue the policy that is laid \nout in section 1607.\n  I recently had the opportunity to sit down with our dedicated armed \nservices personnel in Hawaii who are responsible for negotiating with \nthe North Koreans on the MIA issue. It was clear from that briefing \nthat joint field operations would have a high probability of \nconsiderable success because, unlike Vietnam, the United States has \nconcrete evidence of the sites of mass U.N. burial grounds and \nprisoner-of-war camp locations. But United States personnel have no \naccess in North Korea to these sites. The only thing preventing our \npersonnel from going in and making these identifications is the North \nKoreans.\n  The North Koreans have been unilaterally turning over some remains. \nUnfortunately, the North Koreans, without training in the proper \nhandling of remains, have turned over excavated remains that have not \nbeen properly handled, making identification vastly more difficult, if \nnot impossible. Of the 208 sets of remains turned over since 1990, only \n5 sets have been identified.\n  Despite United States aid flowing to North Korea, the Koreans have \nrepeatedly attempted to link progress on the remains issue to separate \ncompensation--amounts of money seemingly far in excess of reimbursement \ncosts for recovery, storage, and transportation of remains. The U.S. \nGovernment must stand by its policy not to buy remains--this would \ndegrade the honor of those who died in combat. Instead, the United \nStates has offered to reimburse North Korea for reasonable expenses, as \nwe do in Southeast Asia. Talks to try to move the MIA remains \nrepatriation issue forward at this moment appear stalled.\n  While the United States has been careful not to link the nuclear \nissues with other policy concerns in North Korea, it is not \nunreasonable for the United States to consider North Korea's behavior \non other issues, such as the MIA issue, when considering whether to \nprovide humanitarian aid to the closed nation. For the families of the \n5,433 soldiers and airmen still missing more than 40 years after the \nend of the conflict there is no more humane action that North Korea \ncould take than to let America have sufficient access to try to resolve \nas many of these cases as possible.\n  We have demanded fullest accountability from the Government of \nVietnam on the MIA issue. We should demand the same of the Government \nof North Korea.\n\n\n    congressional review and small business regulatory fairness bill\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it has been 17 years that I have fought for \nand supported a mechanism for congressional review of agency rules \nbefore they take effect. Believe it or not I ran for the Senate in 1978 \non the need for legislative veto. That's what we called the right of \nCongress to review important regulations and stop the ones that don't \nmake sense before they take effect. After the Chadha case, we changed \nthe name from legislative veto to legislative review since the Supreme \nCourt ruled that legislative vetoes--involving only one or two houses \nof Congress without the President--were unconstitutional. This bill \nuses a joint resolution of disapproval which is a constitutional \nmechanism and which was the cornerstone of a bill I introduced with \nSenator David Boren from Oklahoma back in the early 1980's.\n  My proposal was adopted with respect to the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It was passed by the \nSenate, with respect to all Federal agencies, on the omnibus regulatory \nreform bill, S. 1080, in the 96th Congress. But it didn't become law \nthen, and despite repeated efforts over the year, it hadn't become law \nuntil this time.\n  As a longtime member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I have \nworked on various regulatory reform proposals, but none has been as \nsignificant to me as legislative veto or legislative review. That's \nbecause it, alone, puts important regulatory decisions in the hands of \nthe politically accountable, only directly elected branch of the \nGovernment, and that is the Congress. And that's where I think these \nimportant public policy decisions belong.\n  The provision we are adopting today, which is similar to the proposal \nwe passed on S. 219 last year, is not exactly what I would have chosen \nto support, but it's close enough. I think it would have been wiser to \nhave the legislative review apply only to major rules and not every \nrule issued by Federal agencies. We want to concentrate our energies--\nat least in the beginning--on the rules that have the greatest impact \nand not be overwhelmed with requests to review hundreds of rules at the \nsame time. It's been estimated that over 4,000 rules are issued in any \n1 year. That amount could simply overtake our ability to be effective \nwith respect to any one rule. That is why I think it would be \npreferable to have this legislation apply to only major rules--that is, \nrules that have an economic impact of over $100 million of costs in any \n1 year.\n  I am also concerned about the requirement that each agency physically \nsend to each house of Congress and to the GAO a copy of the final rule, \na description of the rule, and notice of the effective date. That is a \nlarge and unnecessary paperwork burden that must be met before any rule \ncan take effect. That means for even a small, routine rule, the agency \nwill have to send us the rule and required description. Almost all \nrules are already published in the Federal Register and we can read \nthat as readily as the public can. I think this will prove to be an \nunnecessary requirement that needlessly generates paper, and takes \nprecious staff time at both the agencies and in the office of the \nSecretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House.\n\n  I am also concerned about the change the House made with respect to \ncounting days as calendar days. The bill we have before us would allow \na major rule to take effect within 60 calendar days, but would allow \nthe expedited procedure for congressional review to occur within 60 \nlegislative or session days. That's a very big difference in time. At \nthe end of a session of Congress, that could mean we would have the \nopportunity to disapprove a rule possibly 6 months after it took \neffect. I think that opens the rulemaking process to unintended and \nunnecessary mischief. The rule would be in effect, the regulated \ncommunity would be expected to comply with the rule, and then Congress \ncould come along, using expedited procedures, and repeal the rule. That \nwill create a great deal of uncertainty for businesses and governments \nalike.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the fact that Congress retains the legal \nright, using expedited procedures, to overturn a rule should not be \nused by a court to stay the effective date of a rule or to allow a \nregulated person to delay compliance. That would violate the intent of \nthis legislation. We are very clear in this legislation that major \nrules take effect within 60 calendar days and nonmajor rules take \neffect in after the rule is sent to Congress and in accordance with the \nagency's normal procedures. There is no basis in this legislation for \ndelaying the effective date or\n\n[[Page S3123]]\n\nthe requirements for compliance with a rule other than what I just \ndescribed. So a court would not have any basis for delaying compliance \nbased on the longer period for expedited procedures.\n  The expedited procedures are Congress' internal mechanism for prompt \nconsideration of a joint resolution to disapprove a rule. We could \ndisapprove rules now, by using a joint resolution of disapproval. But \nbeing aware of that possibility does not permit a court to waive \ncompliance or delay the effective date of a rule and it shouldn't just \nbecause we've added expedited procedures.\n  I expect we will monitor the implementation of these requirements \ncarefully and make the necessary changes as we identify real-life \nproblems. That will certainly be my intention.\n  These procedural problems aside, though, Mr. President, I am pleased \nwith this legislation. No longer will be able to tell our constituents \nwho complain about regulations that do not make sense, ``talk to the \nagency,'' or ``your only recourse is the courts.'' Now we are in a \nposition to do something ourselves. If an agency is proposing a rule \nthat just does not make sense from a cost perspective it will be easier \nfor us to stop it. If a rule doesn't make sense based on practical \nimplementation, we can stop it. If a rule goes too far afield from the \nintent of Congress in passing the statute in the first place, we can \nstop it. That's a new day, and one a long time in coming.\n  How much time these new responsibilities will take and how often the \nresolution of disapproval will be exercised, no one can predict. We may \nbe surprised in either direction. But as we work with this process and \nlearn from this process, we can make the necessary adjustments in the \nlaw. The important thing is that we get this review authority in place \nand I am very pleased that we are going to be able to do that in this \nlegislation.\n  I'd like to comment on title III of this bill as well. As a member of \nboth the Small Business Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I am particularly familiar with and interested in the small \nbusiness regulatory fairness provisions. I support adding judicial \nreview to the Regulatory Flexibility Act and, like legislative review \nit's been a long time in coming. It will be the stick that forces the \nregulatory agencies to pay attention to their responsibilities with \nrespect to small governments and small businesses\n  I have previously commented on my concerns about the provision \nestablishing the SBA Enforcement Ombudsman. While I can support this \nprovision, I do not think it goes far enough in using the traditional \nrole of ombudsman to resolve enforcement disputes, and I will be \npursuing legislation in the vein in the Governmental Affairs Committee. \nI am relieved, however, that we have made it clear that while a \nresponsibility of the ombudsman is to evaluate and rate agencies based \non their responsiveness to small business in the area of enforcement, \nit is not the responsibility of the ombudsman to rate individual \npersonnel of those agencies. This is an important issue because, while \nwe certainly want to promote and ensure fair treatment of small \nbusiness with respect to regulatory enforcement, we do not want to \nweaken or intimidate our enforcement personnel so they fail to do the \njob we require of them. Senator Bond made those assurances in a \ncolloquy we had when this bill initially passed the Senate.\n  I also want to note that the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Board \ncreated by this legislation is subject to the requirements of the \nFederal Advisory Committee Act. This ensures that the business \nconducted by this panel is open to the public and that any potential \nconflicts of interest are known. Obviously, since the bill limits \nmembership, the requirements of FACA for balanced membership would not \napply. But to the extent the requirements of FACA can apply, they are \nexpected to apply, and that is why this provision is acceptable.\n\n  The provision granting the small business advocacy review panel the \nopportunity to see a proposed rule before it is published in the \nFederal Register is a novel step. While the panel is comprised of \nFederal employees, the panel is directed to obtain comments and input \nfrom small entities. The purpose of this comment and review is to \nassess whether the agency lived up to its responsibilities under the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act. It is my understanding that the panel is \nnot permitted or expected to share a copy of the draft proposed rule \nwith the small entities with whom it confers, but rather to field \ncomments and concerns about the nature of the rulemaking and its \npossible effects on small entities. This is an important limitation \nbecause to allow otherwise would be to give a unique advantage to one \ngroup that is not permitted to other persons affected by the proposed \nrule.\n  Mr. President, because this bill is attached to the debt ceiling \nbill, some of these provisions will take effect immediately. There will \nbe start-up problems with some of these provisions, in particular the \ncongressional review process, because there is no preparation time. We \nshould recognize the reality of these problems and work diligently to \nmitigate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3114-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3123-S3124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nneed. I see several Senators who are waiting to give remarks. I alert \nthem that I will not be long. I simply must make a remark or two about \nthe statements that have been addressed before the Senate by my \ncolleague from Louisiana.\n  He, obviously, is very much a student of the issues of China and \nTaiwan and the United States. He speaks with great sincerity and \nknowledge. I think he raises a significant dilemma. While we all \nacknowledge the scope of new China, the People's Republic of China, its \nsize, its military prowess, its emerging economy, it almost reminds you \nof the Gold Rush, the oil booms, but given that, bigness in size and \npower alone cannot be the stanchions upon which we, or the rest of the \nworld, establish our relationship with the People's Republic of China.\n  Yes, those are critical ingredients. They cannot stand apart from \neverything else. The 20 million people who live in the Republic of \nChina Taiwan also have long claim to one-China policy, but it does not \naccept dictatorship or oppression or many others of the grievous \npolicies of the People's Republic of China.\n  From the time Chiang Kai-shek retreated to that island in 1949, that \nwas a conquest, in a sense, of Taiwan. The native Taiwanese, who \noutnumbered those who retreated, have long harbored the independent or \nnationalistic movement. I think a reality of contemporary review of \nthis situation has to acknowledge that that movement is likely to grow, \nand a reality of this democratic election that just occurred was that \nPresident Li was faced, as we are, with contemporary issues in our own \ncountry, with the nationalistic spirit that is emerging there.\n  The one-China policy cannot, with the flick of a light, turn that \nway, even though it is much larger, much more powerful. It just cannot \nobviate this nationalistic movement, and I do not think we can ignore \nit.\n  I do not believe that the People's Republic of China--and I heard Dr. \nKissinger when he appeared before the Foreign Relations Committee. He \nbasically slapped the wrist of the United States and Taiwan and the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  But for the People's Republic of China to come to the point where, \nbecause of their size and because of their prowess, they are going \ndictate to the United States who can visit here--I mean, what is a \nvisit is not an abrogation of the one-China policy. Their leaders visit \nhere, too. I think that does need to be confronted, or addressed; maybe \nthat is a better word.\n  So, I think the Senator is right that it is not just appeasement and \nnot just confrontation. But that projects appeasement as well as \nconfrontation. In the tone of the remarks, I felt it was somewhat of an \napology for our endeavoring to struggle with the People's Republic of \nChina and we should accept their edicts because of their size and their \npower. I personally would reject that. I do not think that is what the \nSenator meant, but in the tone of it, the excusing of the sale of \npowerful weapons, human rights violations--that is still a rogue \ngovernment. It is still a dictatorship.\n\n[[Page S3124]]\n\n  While I think it is a delicate issue for us to struggle with, I do \nnot accept appeasement because of their size nor because of their \neconomy. I do not mean to dwell on that long, but I did want to \ncomment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. If the Senator would yield, I was not suggesting--and I \ntried to make it clear--I was not countenancing any violations of the \nmissile treaty control regime, which, by the way, I do not. If they \nviolate it--my own opinion is they did. That violation was, what, 3, 4 \nyears ago. I forget exactly when. They have the capacity to continue to \nviolate it further, but are not at this time.\n  I do not excuse that. But I say that really what we ought to do is \nreassure Taiwan, as we have, that the law of the land is the Taiwan \nRelations Act, that we will not countenance any invasion of Taiwan, but \nthat our policy ought to encourage peaceful reunification, one China, \npeaceful reunification, two regimes, which six Presidents have signed \non to, and we should not change that--that is what I am saying--and \nreassure both parties.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. But if I might, six Presidents have reaffirmed that. \nThat is a long time. As the Senator has said, the burgeoning economy of \nChina has gotten to a place that even the Senator had missed, and the \nSenator has revisited and seen it. That is a massive change during this \ncourse of time. The point I am trying to make is, there are equally \nimportant changes that are occurring in Taiwan.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Exactly.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Among them, that cannot be undone, is there is a \ngrowing movement that it is a democracy. That is a democracy. The \nPeople's Republic of China is not. They are miles apart in that. There \nis a growing and emerging spirit within this island that they should be \nfree and they should never be intimidated into the kind of government \nthat the People's Republic of China still is, and they have empirical \nevidence of the way that government would operate by watching even the \nsituation in Hong Kong today, which is a very disruptive situation, as \nyou know, and very controversial.\n  So they have reason to be deeply concerned about their own freedom \nwhich they now own. That is a change in the flow of events among them.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Is the Senator saying that we should encourage a \nunilateral declaration?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No, I am not. That phenomenon is as real and different \nas some of the changes the Senator pointed to that have occurred in the \nPeople's Republic of China. It cannot be ignored.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Would my friend find at fault this formulation, that \nthe United States should make it clear to both sides that \nreunification, if it occurs, is a bilateral decision of the two \ncountries, to be taken peacefully, and that the United States step \naside, step out of the arena, having reassured both sides--Taiwan that \nwe do not countenance any invasion, and the PRC, that we are not \nencouraging a unilateral declaration of independence--and let those two \nparties make their decision?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think one of the things that the Senator said in his \ninitial remarks, that would be my answer to that--and it goes back to \nthe point I just made about massive changes occurring in the People's \nRepublic of China and in Taiwan--would be that when you call upon the \nPresident to maybe articulate, as much of what all of us say are \ncaptured by views and attitudes that perhaps were obsolete.\n\n  So I do not know that I would specifically accept or embrace the \npoint the Senator made just now, but I would acknowledge that there are \nmajor changes occurring in the geography of the area and it does \nrequire all of our attention. I admire the effort that the Senator has \ngiven to the subject, but I just wanted to remind us that there are two \nsets of phenomena and changes that are occurring. I do not believe \nPresident Li had any option but to acknowledge the winds of change and \nattitudes on his own island.\n  Mr. President, I was going to make some remarks about the drug \npolicy, but I am going to defer that. I see the manager of the bill has \nreturned to the floor. I know the Senator from California----\n  Mr. THOMAS. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I certainly would.\n  Mr. THOMAS. With regard to the discussion that we are having, I \nwonder if the gentleman would agree that what we are talking about here \nbasically is the bill before us, and some of the discussion has been \nabout several of the components of that bill which I find do not place \nus on the side of being opposed to the one-China policy, and they do \nnot place us on the side of being particularly supportive of one or the \nother of these parties, but rather indicate that we expect to stick \nwith the agreements that are made on both sides.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would agree.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I was a little surprised that the suggestion was that all \nof the problems were because President Li came here. There are some \nproblems on the other side, agreements that have not been lived up to. \nI wonder if the gentleman would agree that that is what this bill is \nabout, is to have agreements with both of these sides and to expect \nthat they be lived up to?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I do agree. I appreciate the remarks by the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. I mentioned, in the colloquy between myself and the \nSenator from Louisiana, that, indeed, I do not find the visit by \nPresident Li as a reprehensible act. It seemed to me to be a rather \nnormal exchange. I concede the sensitivities, but I do not believe the \nPeople's Republic of China should be carrying their concerns and \nsensitivities to the point that they are telling us who we might have \nvisit the United States.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. When the statute says we should invite President Li, \nthey should come with all appropriate courtesies, that is just not a \ncasual visit, as if by a foreign tourist. ``All appropriate \ncourtesies'' means, in effect, we ought to invite a head of state and \nhave this, in effect, as a state visit. Is that not what the plain \nlanguage means?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I think you expand the interpretation of the language. \nThat may be interpreted in the eye of the beholder, but it would \ncertainly be viewed by President Li one way and the People's Republic \nof China another. But we extended appropriate courtesies to the leaders \nof the People's Republic of China that visited our country.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I know. But when it says we should seek a visit with \n``all appropriate courtesies,'' what does ``all appropriate \ncourtesies'' mean?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As I just said, it could be interpreted in many ways. \nBut I would remind the Senator that that is nothing more than a sense \nof the Congress, and not law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield--how much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator. But before \nhe begins, Mr. President, I have a little housekeeping task to do for \nthe leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3123-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3124-S3125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                WAIVING CERTAIN ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non H.R. 1561, the State Department Reorganization Act, and of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I do not need to reiterate for my colleagues the tortuous route that \nthis bill has followed to make it to the floor today; I believe we are \nall aware of it. Let me just note why I feel this bill is important.\n  This legislation was the first authorization measure to reach the \nfloor of the Senate within budget targets, fulfilling the mandate the \nAmerican people gave us last November. This bill is a promise kept: \nmoney is saved, redundant bureaucracies eliminated, and the ability of \nour Nation to conduct foreign policy enhanced.\n  We will hear all sorts of arguments against this legislation. Let me \njust address a few that fall within the jurisdiction of my Subcommittee \non East Asia. Several of my Democrat colleagues circulated a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter last week on the China-specific provisions of the \nconference report. In it, they expressed concern that ``[s]everal \nprovisions in this report are unnecessarily provocative to China and \nprecipitate continuing destabilization of U.S.-Sino relations.''\n  Let me say here that I am a great supporter of improving relations \nwith the People's Republic of China; I am supportive of the one-China \npolicy. But I have examined the sections with which they were \nconcerned, and find them essentially to be strawman arguments, without \nimpact on our adherence to the one-China policy. Let me go through them \none by one.\n  First, they are concerned with section 1601, which declares that the \nprovision of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3301 et \nseq.) supersede provisions of the United States-China joint communique \nof August 17, 1992.\n  Frankly, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific \nAffairs, I don't share their opposition to this particular provision. \nThe Taiwan Relations Act, which governs our relationship with Taiwan, \nis a statute and as such is the law of the land. The only thing which \ncould supersede it would be a treaty. The communique, however, is not a \ntreaty; it was never presented to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent. Rather, it is simply an official announcement of the \nintentions of the respective parties. Consequently, it is not binding \non either party, and has no force of law in the United States.\n  Section 1601 is therefore simply a restatement of legal fact. As \nsuch, I am at a loss to understand why it would be objectionable to the \nChinese, objectionable to my colleagues, or a source of encouragement \nto pro-independence elements on Taiwan.\n  Second, they fault section 1708 which supports the admission of the \nPresident of Taiwan with all appropriate courtesies. Mr. President, \nwhile I myself am not a fan of this section, I would note first that \nthe section does not mandate the admission of President Li. Second, I \nwould note that just this week President Lee said we would not seek to \nmake such a visit.\n  Third, they fault section 1606 which would according to them, and I \nquote, ``impose unnecessary new reporting requirements on the State \nDepartment to provide detailed information and political judgments on \nthe implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong \nKong''.\n  I find this the least compelling of their concerns. We regularly \nrequire the State Department to make these reports all the time; the \nDepartment probably prepares such a report on almost every country in \nthe world save some of the smaller ones.\n  We have a real interest in assuring that the People's Republic of \nChina lives up to their agreements, and such a report would be \nextremely important that they do so in relation to their promise to \nprotect democracy there after 1997. An annual report would be \nespecially helpful to this body in following developments there.\n  Their next complaint is that section 1603 would change the name of \nTaiwan's office here from Taiwan Economic and Cultural Representative \nOffice to Taiwan Representative Office. I fail to see how this simple \nname change can cause so much consternation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, they oppose section 1303, regarding Tibet. I \nwould note, however, that this section simply authorizes the President \nto appoint a special envoy; it does not require him to do so. If he \nfinds the idea so objectionable, then he does not have to make the \nappointment.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, what I meant is sort of a precipitating \nevent that caused this tit-for-tat thing, and the Chinese are clearly \ngreatly to be criticized for all of those things that my colleague \nsaid, but I really meant the precipitating events. You can point to \nthat as the events that started it all, and that has led from that \npoint on.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the comments. I do not think there is any \nquestion that we should understand how important that is to the \nPeople's Republic of China. It probably means more to them than it does \nto us and we need to recognize that.\n  So my colleagues can see that these five sections, taken \nindependently, are of little if any import. Some of my colleagues have \nsaid that, while that may be the case, taken together they are \nalarming. Well, Mr. President, if separately these sections equal zero, \nthen they still equal zero when added together.\n  I take exception to the argument of the Senator from Louisiana that \nUnited States-China relations were going along fine until we decided to \nadmit President Li to the United States, and that these sections will \nsimply make matters worse. Frankly, that's a statement I would expect \nto hear from the Chinese Ambassador here. What about their nuclear \ntransfers to Pakistan? What about their failure to live to the \nintellectual property rights agreement? What about their pretensions in \nthe Spratly Islands? What about human rights violations? What about \ntheir back-sliding regarding Hong Kong?\n  Mr. President, the present state of affairs is hardly the sole fault \nof the United States. And these give sections are hardly going to cause \na precipitous downturn in those relations. As the Chinese say, it takes \ntwo hands to clap.\n  So again Mr. President, I rise in support of this proposal. I think \nit is one of the things that the voters said to us in 1994. They said \nwe need to make some changes in the way the Federal Government \noperates; that the Government is too big, it spends too much, and that \nwe should find better ways to deliver services, that we should find \nmore efficient ways to use tax dollars.\n  This bill is the way to do that. Mr. President, every other sector of \nour Government is facing difficult cuts and reorganization; the foreign \npolicy sector should have to bear the same burden as any other. This is \nnot about isolationism, though many Democrats would have the public \nbelieve otherwise in a hope to obscure the issue, not about usurping \nthe role of the executive branch, nor is it about a vendetta aimed at a \nparticular set of bureaucrats.\n  I cannot commend Chairman Helms enough on his hard work and \npersistence on this legislation; I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3124-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEBT LIMIT INCREASE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It \nbegan with the markup of a bill that the Democrats on the Foreign \nRelations Committee had no part in drafting, and that many felt \ncontained an excessively far-reaching plan to eliminate three foreign \naffairs agencies: The Agency for International Development, the Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency, and the U.S. Information Agency.\n  When that bill reached the floor, Republicans were unable to invoke \ncloture on it. Meanwhile, the Senate was prevented from taking action \nto confirm 18 ambassadors, several hundred Foreign Service officer \npromotions, and to consider two critical arms control treaties--START \nII and the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  Finally, last December, after several arduous weeks of negotiating, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nHelms, and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, \nreached a compromise version of the consolidation plan that allowed the \nbill to be voted out to conference.\n  This, in turn, resulted in the Senate immediately confirming the \nambassadorial nominations that had been on hold, and taking action soon \nthereafter to ratify the START II treaty. In addition, hearings are now \nunderway that will lead to a vote by the full Senate on ratification of \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention by April 30. For that I am grateful.\n  I was among those who voted for S. 908 last December, in part because \nI felt the compromise consolidation plan reached by Senators Helms and \nKerry was a reasonable plan. However, my major motivation was to get it \nto conference so that we could take action on the ambassadors and \ntreaties that were before the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that has come back from conference has many, \nmany problems. First of all, the consolidation plan that came back from \nconference has moved considerably from the fairly reasonable compromise \nreached by Senator Helms and Senator Kerry. The conference report \nversion requires the elimination of three agencies: USAID, ACDA, and \nUSIA, two of which the President can later choose to preserve. This \nprovision differs sharply from the preconference version which gave the \nPresident full discretion over whether or not to eliminate an agency. \nThe new report also requires $1.7 billion in savings over 4 years, \nrather than over 5 years, as was in the Senate-passed bill.\n  Now, philosophically, Mr. President, it is my very strong belief that \na President, any President, must and should be able to organize or \nreorganize the foreign affairs agencies of the United States as he or \nshe sees fit.\n  I basically believe that foreign policy should be bipartisan, that we \nshould work out our difficulties and speak as one Nation, as \nrepresented by our President. But I believe the President must be in \ncharge of foreign policy. I came to that belief, Mr. President, \nironically when I was a mayor. I was visited by the Chancellor of \nGermany, Helmut Schmidt. I saw, when I visited with him at the Fairmont \nHotel, that he was chain smoking and was very upset. I said, ``What is \nwrong?'' He said to me an interesting thing. He said, ``You know, you \nAmericans have no idea what you do when you reinvent the wheel of \nforeign policy every 4 years. You have no idea what it does to your \nallies.'' He went home and, 2 weeks later, he resigned.\n  I thought that was very interesting, and I never forgot what he said. \nSo I began to watch American foreign policy a little differently. I saw \nwhere it is very difficult for many countries to really understand with \nwhat voice this Nation really speaks. I understand the separation of \npowers. I understand the balance of powers. And yet, we must, as a \nnation, speak to other nations with one voice and with clearly defined \npolicies. I am finding that becomes more and more difficult.\n  So, consolidation is not the issue. Many of us support consolidation, \nbut we can only support it if it is done in such a way that we provide \nour President, whether he be Republican or Democrat, with flexibility \nin the organization of the foreign affairs agencies. Unlike the \ncompromise version that passed the Senate, this conference report \nreturns to a coercive approach that forces the President to eliminate \nat least one agency over his objections. I simply cannot support a \nconsolidation plan structured in this manner.\n  Second, this conference report does nothing to address the \nunprecedented restrictions that were placed on U.S. international \npopulation and family planning assistance in the fiscal year 1996 \nforeign operations bill.\n  After months of stalemate on that bill, a conference report was sent \nto the President, which has the effect of cutting U.S. international \npopulation and family planning programs by some 85 percent. These \nrestrictions will have a seriously negative effect on women and \nfamilies around the world. Family planning assistance, which helps \nwomen plan and space their pregnancies, has proven to be a major factor \nin curbing poverty and starvation and overpopulation, and providing the \nopportunity for a decent way of life in many parts of the world that \nare badly overcrowded with children, starving by the thousands because \nof lack of food.\n  Ironically, the restrictions in the foreign operations bill are \nadvocated by those who oppose abortion and argue for a so-called pro-\nfamily agenda. But U.S. law already forbids the use of any U.S. foreign \nassistance for the provision of abortions.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who is \na proud opponent of abortion, has pointed out time and time again, \ndepriving millions of poor women of access to voluntary family planning \nservices will only result in more unwanted pregnancies and more \nabortions. This bill fails to address these misguided restrictions.\n  Third, this bill prohibits any funds from being used to open, expand, \nor operate diplomatic or consular posts in Vietnam, unless the \nPresident certifies that the Vietnamese Government is fully cooperating \nwith the U.S. in a number of areas related to the search for POW's and \nMIA's--a worthy statement. The problem is that these areas are \neffectively uncertifiable. In addition, failure to expand our new \nrelationship with Vietnam could actually jeopardize the significant \nprogress that has been made on the POW/MIA issue.\n  Furthermore, this provision unduly restricts the President's ability \nto conduct foreign relations according to his understanding of U.S. \nnational interests. And by this I mean that it places conditions on \nwhether or not the President can open an embassy.\n  Finally, at the time of the vote on S. 908, I made it very clear that \nthere was an entire category of provisions in the bill, wholly separate \nfrom the consolidation aspect, that I found deeply troubling. These \nprovisions related in various ways to the United States' relationship \nwith the People's Republic of China, the largest country on Earth, and \nthe most dynamically growing country in the world today.\n  At that time, I expressed the hope that these provisions would be \nameliorated or removed in conference. In fact, I said that the \nresolution of these matters would be critical to my consideration of \nwhether or not to support the conference report.\n  Unfortunately, virtually every one of these provisions remains in the \nbill. Some are in a slightly modified form, but they remain \nobjectionable. There are even some new provisions on China in this \nconference report that were not in the original bill. Let me first list \nthe provisions in this bill relating to China and then explain why they \nwill result in my voting against this conference report.\n  Section 1601 declares that the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act \nsupersede provisions of the United States-China joint communique of \nAugust 17, 1982.\n  Section 1603 allows the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative \nOffice, TECRO, to change its name to the Taipei Representative Office.\n  Section 1606 imposes unnecessary new reporting requirements on the \nDepartment of State to provide detailed information and political \njudgments on the implementation of the Sino-British Joint Declaration \non Hong Kong.\n  New in the bill, section 1702 imposes excessive reporting \nrequirements on the President with respect to human\n\n[[Page S3127]]\n\nrights in China, beyond those already required in the annual Human \nRights Report, which I have just read. It is a detailed report, and I \nbelieve very strongly that it was inaccurately reported in the press. \nSection 1702 expresses the sense of Congress that the President should \nimpose human rights-related preconditions on a possible future visit to \nChina.\n  Section 1708 supports the admission of the President of Taiwan to the \nUnited States for a visit in 1996 ``with all appropriate courtesies''.\n  A new section, section 1709, supports the United States pushing for \nTaiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization [WTO], without \nrespect to the status of China's application to join the WTO.\n  Section 1303 authorizes the President to appoint a special envoy for \nTibet, and such a person would have to carry the rank of Ambassador.\n  Another new section in the bill, section 1701, provides that the \nPresident should condemn a prison system in China and, in essence, \ndemand that China dismantle the prisons. What nation has ever told us \nto dismantle a prison? Would we listen to that, and would we be \naffected by it if they did that? I think not.\n  The simple fact of these eight provisions, and others, suggests \nsomething about this bill: It is excessively preoccupied with China. No \nother country receives half the attention China receives in this bill.\n  But far more serious than the preoccupation with China is the very \nserious damage that these provisions could do to our increasingly \nimportant and, I must say, increasingly strained relationship with \nChina. I happen to believe strongly in the importance of the proper \ndevelopment of a relationship with the People's Republic of China, \nwhich is the most overlooked and most significant bilateral \nrelationship in the world today.\n  I also happen to believe that there are those in China and in this \ncountry who would like to see it became an adversarial relationship. \nYes. Would they like to see a return to the dangerous, pivotal, bipolar \nsuperpower arrangements that existed all during the cold war? That is \nwhat is understood by their actions. Nations then line up. They are \neither in one camp or the other. It is good for weapons sales. I do not \nwant to see that happen. This relationship is too important to peace \nand stability in Asia. And, yes, it is too important to the prevention \nof major misunderstanding which could lead to a potential and \ndevastating third world war.\n  As my colleagues know, the past few weeks have seen tensions in the \ntriangular United States-China-Taiwan relationship reach new heights. \nAs Taiwan's first fully democratic presidential election approached, \nChina felt compelled to vent its displeasure over what it has perceived \nas a pro-independence policy in Taiwan by conducting missile tests and \nlive-ammunition military exercises in the Taiwan Strait. These tests \nand exercises by China were unnecessary, dangerous, and provocative. \nAnd I have said as much directly to the highest-level Chinese \nofficials.\n  The administration responded prudently by expressing its deep \nconcern, by sending the U.S.S. Nimitz carrier group to join the U.S.S. \nIndependence carrier group in the region to monitor events there, and \nby making it clear to the Chinese that any attack on Taiwan would have \nvery grave consequences. This is in anyone's book strong and definitive \naction.\n  Under these tense circumstances Congress, I believe, must be very \ncareful right now, post-Taiwanese election, not to take any action that \nwould make a potentially difficult situation worse. There is a real \nwindow of opportunity. There is a calling for the first democratically \nelected President of Taiwan to take some steps to clarify Taiwanese \npolicy, to indicate the willingness to reinstitute the across-the-\nstrait dialog, and to clarify once and for all--perhaps jointly with \nChina--a One-China policy.\n  I believe, as far as the United States is concerned, that we do not \nneed legislation to further inflame the situation. The point has been \nmade. The election has been held. The Taiwanese President has been \nreelected. Now we need to play the pivotal role of encouraging the \nparties to get together and discuss a peaceful resolution of their \ndifficulties.\n  Without firm United States adherence to the principle of one China we \nwould be unable to conduct any kind of normal relations with Beijing. \nThis is an undeniable fact of life, no matter what anybody in this body \nsays.\n  If there is not a One-China policy, we drive the People's Republic of \nChina into the adversarial Soviet Union-type of response and a cold \nwar. I do not believe this is desirable United States policy. And that \nis the impact. That is the practical, as I would say, ``on the \nstreets'' impact of this bill.\n  I do not believe that the United States is going to retreat on a One-\nChina policy. But to amend the Taiwan Relations Act to explicitly \nsupersede the 1982 joint communique is to give substance and \ncredibility to China's fears. That is what they suspect we are up to. \nWhy would we take that provocative step at this time? For what reason \nother than to enable ourselves to become incendiary? From the Chinese \nprospective, it would be tantamount to a declaration that we were about \nto send a new round of arms sales to Taiwan, that we no longer \nsubscribe to the One-China policy, and that we are meddling deeply in \ntheir internal affairs.\n  Not only would passing this provision be foolhardy; it is also \nunnecessary. The Taiwan Relations Act is the law of the land. And, like \nany law, it carries greater weight than any diplomatic agreement, other \nthan a treaty.\n  But to amend the act to explicitly state that it supersedes the 1982 \njoint communique would be seen by China as an outright repudiation of a \ncritical and stabilizing element of our longstanding policy toward \nChina subscribed to by six United States Presidents.\n  I want to commend the administration for listing this provision \nprominently among the principal reasons the President will veto this \nbill when it lands on his desk.\n  Elsewhere in this conference report Congress expresses its support \nfor a visit to the United States by the President of Taiwan in 1996 \n``with all appropriate courtesies''. I must ask my colleagues: How \nshort are our memories? For over 10 months our relationship with China \nhas been in crisis. Here is a country--Taiwan--that says it is in \nopposition to independence, that says as late as March 5 in a written \ndirective by the Taiwanese premier, that ``We are in opposition to \nindependence.'' Why then would we ask a leader who is not representing \nan independent country to make an official visit? It does not make \nsense.\n  Li Teng-hui's visit to Cornell was the event that sparked the \nincendiary nature of the last few months. And remember, that visit was \nbilled as a private one; an unofficial one. One can only assume by \nusing the phrase ``with all appropriate courtesies\" the authors of this \nprovision mean to imply some kind of an official visit despite \nAmerica's commitment--we made a commitment--to maintain only economic, \ncultural, and unofficial relations with Taiwan. That is our commitment. \nIf our relationship with China has suffered that much over an \nunofficial visit, one can scarcely imagine the damage it would suffer \nin the wake of an official one.\n  I think we face a similar problem with the proposed name change of \nthe Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. It was only a \nyear ago that the Taiwanese reached an agreement with the \nadministration to change the office's name from the Coordinating \nCommittee for North American Affairs to its current title. Now some are \nadvocating a change to the Taipei Representative Office. I have asked \nthe Taiwanese if they asked for this change. They said no, they did \nnot. Then why are we doing it? Only to tweak China? Is this really \nnecessary? Is this how we want to make foreign policy, a tweak here and \na tweak there? ``We know your Achilles' heel, China, and now we are \ngoing to press on it a little bit.'' Oh, my goodness.\n  The current title of the office accurately reflects the unofficial \nnature of our relationship with Taiwan based primarily on economic and \ncultural relations. There is no need to create a new title that is not \ndesired, that implies some kind of broader recognition, other than to \ntweak China.\n  The people of Taiwan are to be congratulated for the democratic \nelections they have recently held. They can be justifiably proud. But \nthe crux of our\n\n[[Page S3128]]\n\ndifficulties with China is China's concern that we are in some way \negging Taiwan on toward a declaration of independence.\n  That should not be the message we send.\n  These provisions give credible substance to China's fear. They \nsuggest we are not satisfied with Taiwan's status and will undertake \nunilateral actions to nudge it in the direction of independence.\n  As I said, that is not our role. Our role as a friend of China and a \nfriend of Taiwan is to encourage the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan \nissue by negotiation and mutual decision. The United States has no \nright to take actions that could lead to either a nonpeaceful outcome \nor a non-negotiated outcome. Unilateral actions by any party in this \nmatter are not acceptable.\n  There are other provisions which will be irritants of our \nrelationship with China at best and counterproductive to our own goals \nat worst. For example, I am aware that the backers of the provision \nauthorizing a special envoy for Tibet have only the best of \nintentions--to see life improved for the Tibetan people. However, I can \nassure my colleagues that the appointment of a special envoy for Tibet \nwith the rank of Ambassador would be seen by the Chinese, once again, \nas an attempt to advocate for independence of an area they consider \nwithin their territorial boundaries. Even if this person never set foot \nin Lhasa--and we know that with the rank of Ambassador the Chinese \nwould never let him set foot in Lhasa--we know the Chinese will view \nsuch a special envoy as interfering in their internal affairs.\n  Now, I am as committed as any Member of this body to improving the \nlives of the Tibetan people. My husband and I both regard his Holiness, \nthe Dalai Lama, as a personal friend. I first met him in Dharmsala in \n1978 and have spent many hours with him and his representatives \ndiscussing ways to help Tibet and Tibetans. In January, in Hong Kong, I \nmet with his older brother, Gyalo Thondup, who has been his \nrepresentative in many negotiations with the Chinese, and had an \nextensive discussion.\n  In 1991, I carried a letter from his Holiness, the Dalai Lama, to \nPresident Jiang Zemin asking for negotiations between the two sides. As \nmayor of San Francisco in 1979, I was the first public official to \ninvite the Dalai Lama to visit a city in the United States--San \nFrancisco, an official visit to my city. And since then I have been \ntrying to find ways to bring the two sides together and to encourage \nChina to understand that it is to China's great advantage to see that \nthe culture and religion of the Tibetan people are protected and that \nhuman rights for the Tibetan people are improved.\n  I recite this background merely to make the point that I am well \nacquainted with the issue of Tibet and have spent many years working on \nit. In my view, the appointment of a special envoy by the United States \nwould be counterproductive. It would result in the Chinese being \nunwilling to talk with us or anyone else about ameliorating conditions \nfor the Tibetan people.\n  What we need to do instead, through intense, continuing, low-key \ndiplomacy, is to convince the Chinese that it is to their advantage to \nengage in talks with the Dalai Lama in which all issues other than \nTibetan independence would be on the table. This I believe is an \nachievable goal but only if we avoid somehow injecting ourselves in the \nissue in such a way that the Chinese see us as advocates for Tibetan \nindependence. You cannot have a special envoy with the rank of \nAmbassador and not create the impression that what we are trying to do \nis see Tibet as independent. Therefore, the Chinese will fight any \nimprovements all the way. That is why I think this is not well thought \nout.\n  There has already been at least one missed opportunity to advance the \ncause of Tibet. After the last Panchen Lama died, the Chinese \nauthorities invited the Dalai Lama to come to Beijing for a memorial \nservice, but he declined the invitation. I believe that was a mistake \nbecause it would have given a new generation of Chinese leadership an \nopportunity to get to know the Dalai Lama as the fine person he truly \nis, as a caring, loving person, and a devout Buddhist.\n  By all means, we should continue to explore ways to achieve cultural \nand religious autonomy for Tibet and hopefully 1 day the return of the \nDalai Lama and Tibetans in exile to their native soil. And in the words \nof an ancient Chinese proverb, When water flows, there will be a \nchannel. I am hopeful that the water of negotiations will flow before \ntoo long.\n\n  In my discussions with Chinese leaders over the last year, they have \nrepeatedly raised their concern that the United States is pursuing a \npolicy of containment with respect to China, perhaps in the guise of \nsomething else. I do not believe we have such a policy, and I have said \nso. However, when I look at a bill like this one, full of provisions \nthat deal almost patronizingly with an independent nation, China, I \nmust say it seems that some, for whatever reason, do genuinely want to \npursue a policy of containment. One certainly could not blame a Chinese \nobserver for drawing that conclusion.\n  I think we have discussed at length in the past why a containment \npolicy is unworkable and unwise. China is a nation of 1.2 billion \npeople. It is a nuclear power. It is a permanent member of the U.N. \nSecurity Council and one of the fastest growing and most dynamic \neconomies in the world. China is not going to be contained. What we \nneed to do is set a long-term strategic and conceptual, goal-oriented \nrelationship with certain priorities in our policies, areas where we \ncan work together, and a methodology for areas where there is a \ndifference of opinion to be able to sit down over the long term at the \ntable and make progress on those issues that divide us. I believe this \nis possible. We have enormous national interests in developing a \npeaceful and cooperative relationship with China, and we cannot do so \nby setting them apart, by making them the adversary that they do not \nwant to be and that we do not want them to become.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider the wisdom of legislating in \nthis area so excessively in the future.\n  Mr. President, for all of the problems contained in this bill, I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose the conference report. If the bill is passed, I \nwish to commend the President for pledging to veto this legislation, \nand I look forward to congratulating him when he does.\n  I thank the Chair. I reserve the remainder of my time\n  Mr. SIMON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am assuming that Senator Kerry will \nyield. Would the Chair recognize that assumption?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized on the \ntime of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  Mr. SIMON. I thank the Chair, and I will try not to impose on the \ntime of Senator Kerry. I am going to vote against this, though I differ \nsomewhat with my colleague from California, as I will explain very \nshortly.\n  I think the bill as a whole does harm to what we are trying to do in \nthe area of foreign relations, and I say this with great respect for my \nfriend from North Carolina, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee, \nand who is my neighbor in the Dirksen Building and a friend.\n  We cut back on foreign aid. I know there is popularity to that. But \nwhen at town meetings people say, ``Why don't we cut back on foreign \naid and help the people in our country?''--as the Presiding Officer \nknows, I have been voting to help people in our country. Then I ask \nthem, ``What percentage of our budget do you think goes for foreign \naid?'' They usually guess 10 percent, 15 percent, 25 percent. And I \nsay, ``Less than 1 percent.''\n\n  They are startled. We spend less, as a percentage of our budget, on \nforeign aid than any of the Western European countries and Japan. If \nyou put all the Western European countries and Japan together, we spend \nless than any of them. It does not make sense.\n  We are authorizing $6.5 billion for fiscal year 1996-97. That is a \n$500 million cut, while at the same time, this year, we have given the \nPentagon $7 billion more than they requested. U.S. security would be \nhelped immensely if we were to give the Pentagon what they requested \nand use a portion of this for foreign aid.\n\n[[Page S3129]]\n\n  For example, the housing guarantee programs in South Africa and \nEastern Europe are totally eliminated. I know a little bit about South \nAfrica. I do not know that much about Eastern Europe, but I think the \nsituations are somewhat similar. In South Africa, it is vitally \nimportant for that country to show the people of that country that they \nare going to make some progress. Nelson Mandela is immensely popular \ntoday, both in the white and black community in South Africa. Public \nopinion polls are almost identical for whites and blacks there. But the \nreality is, he has to show that he can deliver for people who have been \noppressed, and the housing program is an inexpensive way for the United \nStates to help. Mr. President, 28 million poor people have been helped \nby our housing program in Eastern Europe and South Africa--and we want \nto eliminate that.\n  Regarding limitations on U.S. assistance on population, if you do not \nhave population assistance, let me tell you, the abortion rates go up \nand other problems arise. It is very interesting. If you look at Japan, \nfor example, where they have programs to tell people about \ncontraception and other things, you have a very low abortion rate. You \nalso have less than 1 percent of children born out of wedlock. If you \nhave assistance on planned parenthood and that sort of thing, we reduce \nthe abortion rates.\n  We also reduce the problem--it depends on whose estimates you \nbelieve, but the world population is going to grow. It will roughly \ndouble in the next 45 to 60 years. The most conservative estimates are \n45 years; the more optimistic are 60 years. We ought to be helping out.\n  The United Nations--and here I applaud my colleague who is the \nPresiding Officer for being very responsible in this area--the United \nNations, we now owe them $1.4 billion. The budget for the United \nNations, for New York, Geneva, and the six commissions, not counting \npeacekeeping, is $1.2 billion for a year. In other words, we owe more \nthan a year's expenses for running the United Nations. Running the \nUnited Nations takes $500 million less than running the New York City \npolice department. The No. 1 deadbeat in the world is the United \nStates.\n  Do not kid yourself that we are not hurting ourselves. Here is \ntoday's newspaper, an Associated Press story, ``World Bank Arrears \nDisqualify United States. American contractors can't bid on $2.1 \nbillion in projects.'' Why? Because the World Bank has a rule, if you \nget too far back in what you owe, that country cannot bid on projects. \nSo, contractors in Illinois and Arkansas and North Carolina and Vermont \nare hurt by our being a deadbeat here. I hope we will do better.\n  Then I would like to comment on the China situation a little bit. \nReal candidly, if I were to write the language in this resolution, I \nwould write it differently. But I have to say, I do not think we should \nquake every time China growls. I share with the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee a feeling that we should let Taiwan know that a \nfreely elected government is regarded as a friend of the United States.\n  Perhaps inviting President Li officially here right now may not be \nthe right thing while China's leadership is going through this turmoil, \nbut to turn a cold shoulder constantly to Taiwan, when they have a free \npress, multiparty system, free elections--they are the seventh biggest \ntrading partner of the United States, they are second only to Japan in \nthe foreign reserves they have--to pretend there are not two countries \nthere is just a mistake.\n  I heard my colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, for whom I \nhave high regard, I heard her talking about the Shanghai communique \nand, while we have said as a nation we recognize one China, frankly I \nthink that was a mistake. We cannot reverse that overnight. But that \nwas done at a time when we were worried about the Soviet Union and we \nwere trying to keep China and the Soviet Union apart. But the reality \nis, we ought to treat China and Taiwan as we did West Germany and East \nGermany. Both East Germany and West Germany did not like it that we \nrecognized the other side, but that did not prevent the two of them \nfrom eventually coming together again. But we said the reality is there \nare two governments and that is the reality today.\n  I think we have to be sensitive to the Chinese situation. I do not \nthink, to use Senator Feinstein's language, we should just be tweaking \nChina whenever we can. I think we ought to be firm, solid, and let them \nknow that military aggression is not going to be tolerated. We have not \nbeen as firm as we should be.\n  Senator Feinstein is right when she says our policy has been one of \nzigzagging. Without going to the Presidential level, I frankly think we \nought to have cabinet members from both sides appearing in each other's \ncountry. When I was in Taiwan, I do not know, 3 years ago or so, the \nForeign Minister had a luncheon honoring me, but our representative in \nTaiwan--we do not even have the courage to call him an ambassador--our \nrepresentative in Taiwan could not come because the luncheon was in a \ngovernment building. He is not allowed to go into a government \nbuilding.\n  That is just ridiculous. We have to recognize reality. When we face a \nchoice of cuddling up to democracies or dictatorships, the United \nStates of America should not have a difficult time. We ought to be \nsiding with democracies rather than dictatorships.\n  I think we ought to say to China, ``We want you to be our friend.'' \nBut we also ought to say, just as firmly, ``We are for democracies.'' \nAnd I hope gradually we will recognize that there are, in fact, two \ngovernments over there. To pretend anything else invites possible \ntrouble.\n  Let me just add this. I heard Tibet mentioned. That is history now, \nnot good history, but I am afraid that is done. But if we do not say \nvery clearly ``you cannot invade Taiwan or send missiles there,'' \ndictatorships are never satisfied with just one piece of property.\n  The reality is, if China takes Tibet, it will not be too long and \nthey are going to go up and take Mongolia. Look at some of those \nChinese maps. They already have Mongolia as part of China, and who \nknows where it goes next. We should learn the lessons from history, and \nwe should side with democracies while we maintain reasonable relations \nwith dictatorships.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, what we are doing is alternating this side \nand that side. I suggest it is appropriate now for the Chair to \nrecognize the distinguished Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman, and I want to \nthank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal years 1996 and \n1997. As chair of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on International \nOperations, we have jurisdiction over these issues contained in this \nlegislation, and I am very pleased with the report that the conference \ncommittee issued with respect to this important bill.\n  I commend the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Chairman \nHelms. I know this has been a long and difficult road to bring this \nauthorization bill to this point. Regrettably, we did not have enough \nassistance from the administration or the State Department to work out \nthe differences that developed between the committee and this \nadministration and the State Department. But regardless, I think the \nbill that has come before the Senate and has come before the House is a \nbill that certainly should be accepted by both sides.\n  Frankly, as one who has been involved in this process as the ranking \nmember of the similar subcommittee in the House for almost 10 years, I \nam somewhat surprised at the way in which the State Department or the \nPresident has refused to negotiate the differences on some of the \nissues that have been at the forefront of this authorization bill for \nmore than 1 year.\n  I have never been in a situation in being responsible for this \nauthorization bill in which the President has never submitted an \nauthorization request. We have not yet to date ever received\n\n[[Page S3130]]\n\na State Department authorization bill for the issues before us \nreferring to the State Department authorization and the other related \nagencies, such as international broadcasting activities, international \nexchanges, as well as international organizations and our contributions \nto the United Nations as well.\n  We have never yet in this entire process received a bill from the \nadministration with respect to any one of these issues. And, as I said, \nthis is the first time in all of the years in which I have had the \nresponsibility of addressing the State Department authorization bill \nthat a President has failed to submit a legislative authorization bill.\n  But be that as it may, we worked it through the process, as Chairman \nHelms indicated. It was a difficult process, to say the least. But here \nin the Senate in December, the bill passed by a margin of 82 to 16. It \nreceived tremendous bipartisan support. So I would expect that this \nconference report should receive the same bipartisan support. If \nanything, this conference report is even stronger than the bill that \npassed the Senate back in December.\n  But I think it is important to review what occurred over this last \nyear to have reached this point and to demonstrate that the conference \nreport that is before this body reconciled the differences, in fact, \ncame a long way to accommodate the differences that the minority had in \nthe committee or here on the floor or that the President had or that \nthe State Department had, but every time we reconciled those \ndifferences, they moved the goal posts. They were unwilling to resolve \nand to reconcile the issues that are before us today.\n  But I think it is important to review exactly how much we have \naccommodated the administration's concern, as well as the minority.\n  First of all, when you are looking at the consolidation issue, it is \nimportant to remember that back in January of 1995, Secretary \nChristopher himself acknowledged that consolidation was possible. He, \nin fact, proposed to the administration that the consolidation of three \nagencies into the State Department was a realistic approach.\n  The Vice President recommended that we could achieve savings in the \nState Department and related agencies of approximately $5 billion over \n4 years. So that is the point at which we started this whole \nproposition.\n  So the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, with Chairman Helms, \nrecommended that we consolidate three agencies with a savings of $3 \nbillion.\n  We started working through the differences. The minority members of \nthe committee said, ``No, we don't want to support consolidating any \nagencies.'' But they did, in fact, agree to consolidating one agency \nwith a savings of $2 billion over 4 years. The majority in the \ncommittee said we will consolidate three agencies with $3 billion over \n4 years.\n  So here we are at this point with a conference committee report, and \nwhat do we have? We have a conference committee report that says we \nhave to reconcile the differences between the Senate and the House. And \nso the Senate position going into conference was no agency \nconsolidation but a mandate requiring $1.7 billion over the next 4 \nyears.\n  The House, on the other hand, had a position of consolidating three \nagencies over the next 5 years, with no specified savings. So what did \nwe do? We came out of the conference committee with one agency, a \nsavings of $1.7 billion. That is very close to the position that was \nsupported by the Senate back in December with a vote of 82 to 16.\n  I guess it is hard to understand why anybody would suggest that this \nis an unrealistic or unachievable consolidation proposal. We have come \nfrom the Vice President's proposal of $5 billion down to $1.7 billion, \nand even the minority on the committee supported $2 billion worth of \nsavings, and in the conference report we have $1.7 billion in savings, \nso even less than what even they supported. They supported one \nconsolidation, one agency to be consolidated in the State Department. \nThat is what came out of the conference committee. We got one agency \nrequirement for consolidation or merging into the State Department. So \nwe have come a long way to reconcile those differences.\n  It is really hard to understand why there has been so much resistance \nto this effort and to make some accommodation to bridge the \ndifferences. We have certainly gone a long ways to reconciling those \ndifferences, not only within this body, but with the House as well.\n  Then we had the issue of the international family planning proposals. \nWell, again, the House bill contains some very restrictive language \nwith respect to UNFPA and Mexico City policy provisions that, in fact, \nthose are the same provisions that endangered the foreign operations \nappropriations bill last year. But we were able to remove those onerous \nprovisions from the conference report. We removed all of them. But yet \nat the same time, again, we had objections from the other side, because \nthey said, ``Well, that's not enough. It is not enough that you took \nthose provisions out. You should also have language in this conference \nreport that overturns the restrictions and the reductions in \ninternational family planning programs in the appropriations bill.''\n\n  That is an interesting recommendation considering the fact that the \nminority did not want to have any development assistance proposals in \nthe State Department bill, and that is why almost all of the foreign \naid language was removed, rightfully so, because the Senate never had \nthat opportunity to consider that legislation. So it was removed. We \ntook out all the international family planning restrictions and all the \ndevelopment assistance legislation. But yet at the same time, they are \nsaying, ``It is not enough because we think we should overturn the \nappropriations language.''\n  Well, that process is occurring right now, hopefully, in the \nconference committee on the omnibus appropriations bill. But certainly \nthe conference report is not the vehicle to do it, since we have taken \nout all the other foreign aid components.\n  I should say that the language that is in the current continuing \nresolution with respect to the international family planning programs \nare the very same programs in the very same continuing resolution that \nthe President signed into law and was supported by Members of this \nbody.\n  The appropriate vehicle for resolving the appropriation differences \non international family planning funding is in the conference committee \non the omnibus appropriations. That is where that debate should occur, \nnot here in this conference report.\n  Our goal was to remove the restrictive language on international \nfamily planning and Mexico City provisions that would have set us back \nin those areas. We did that. That was a major accomplishment. There are \nimportant issues in this legislation that ought to be supported by all \nMembers of this body.\n  This legislation contains several important policy initiatives, such \nas the McBride Principles. This would codify the McBride Principles and \nplace them in permanent law.\n  The McBride Principles would establish a standard of \nnondiscrimination for any project or enterprise in Northern Ireland \nfunded through our contributions to the International Fund for Ireland. \nThis is a very important principle to uphold. I think this would be the \nfirst time that will provide an opportunity for all Members of this \nSenate to vote on the McBride Principles and to support codifying them \ninto Federal law.\n  Another important policy initiative that this bill would place into \npermanent law is the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act. This provision, \nfirst enacted on a 1-year basis in the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, would require that recipients of American aid not \nblock the delivery of any humanitarian aid to any neighboring country. \nWhile drafted generically, it is intended to send a strong signal to \nTurkey, which in the past has frequently attempted to block the \ndelivery of desperately needed humanitarian assistance to the people of \nArmenia.\n  A third major legislative initiative in this conference report is the \nTerrorist Exclusion Act, which I first introduced in the last Congress. \nThis would restore the President's authority to exclude the entry into \nthe United States of any individual who is a member of a violent \nterrorist organization. This is basically to restore the law prior to \n1990.\n\n[[Page S3131]]\n\n  So, I guess it is hard again, going back to the administration's \nposition, to understand why the President and the State Department have \ngone on record in opposition to this legislation, because the agency \nreorganization is essential, even by the Secretary of State's own \nadmission, even by the Vice President's own recommendations to save $5 \nbillion.\n  I cannot imagine that anybody would suggest that we cannot merge one \nagency into the State Department, that we cannot merge the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency. It is a modest agency of 250 people, that in \nthis day and age when we need a new world order, when it comes to our \nown State Department and related agencies, we have to reorganize. It is \nimportant to have a unified, singular voice when it comes to delivering \nour foreign policy. That was the basic intent of this agency \nconsolidation. But we have met resistance at every step of the way by \nthe administration, even though at some point in time the \nadministration or Members on the other side have indicated that they \nsupport such consolidation.\n\n  Let us talk about the funding levels. The authorization level in this \nconference report represents probably a high point in funding levels \nfor these agencies. In fact, it is in conformance with the budget \nresolution. The reductions in funding are modest, no more than $500 \nmillion under the 1995 funding level.\n  The President has argued for cuts in domestic programs, but this is \nthe one area in which he is recommending an increase. In fact, the \nPresident recommended a $1 billion increase in the foreign aid \naccounts. I think it is interesting that the President would recommend \ncuts in so many domestic discretionary programs in order to achieve a \nbalanced budget, but insist on continued growth in foreign spending. \nBut that is exactly the case, because in the statement that was issued \nby the administration, they objected to the funding levels that were \nincorporated in this conference report.\n  There has been opposition by some because of the provision that \naddresses the International Housing Guarantee Program. This program is \nroutinely criticized as one of AID's most ineffective and wasteful \nprograms. In fact, GAO has conducted a study of this program which \nsubsidized housing for citizens of other countries. The GAO found that \nthis program is well on its way to wasting $1 billion in U.S. \ntaxpayers' money--$1 billion.\n  I cannot believe that the administration again is objecting to this \nprovision to remove this program when it has already been demonstrated \nto lose for the taxpayers more than $1 billion. The overall program \nrepresents a 40 percent loss to the American taxpayers with respect to \nthe inefficiency and the ineffectiveness of this program. Yet, again, \nthe administration states as one of its objections the fact that it \ncuts this International Housing Guarantee Program.\n  We come to the issue of Vietnam. The bill simply requires the \nPresident to certify that Vietnam is fully cooperating on the POW/MIA \naccounting prior to establishing even closer relations with Vietnam. \nNow, how can anyone find this objectionable? The President has already \ntaken every opportunity to state his belief that Vietnam is fully \ncooperating.\n\n  I may disagree with the President on that assertion, but be that as \nit may, if the President certifies that they are fully cooperating--\nthat is his own prerogative and initiative as described in this \nprovision--then he can move forward to establish even broader \ndiplomatic relations. So I cannot understand why the President would \nobject to this language.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long process with respect to this \nconference report. As I said earlier, again, I think it is important to \nremind Members of this body that we had no guidance, no counsel, from \nthis administration. The fact is, in the process during the conference \ncommittee and prior to the meeting of the conference committee, members \nof the State Department, representing the administration and the \nDepartment, refused to offer language or to cooperate in the process \nthroughout the month-long effort.\n  I think we could have reached a consensus at some point. It is hard \nto believe they could not support this conference report, because I \ncannot imagine being more accommodating on all of the issues that were \nof concern to them originally in terms of how many agencies would be \nrequired to be merged into the State Department, or how much savings we \nwould realize as a result.\n  I mean, we basically went from three to one agency, and we went from \n$3 billion to $1.7 billion worth of savings as a result of agency \nconsolidation and reorganization. From my estimation, I think that is a \npretty reasonable compromise. I want to further remind this body again \nthe Vice President said that we could achieve $5 billion worth of \nsavings, the Secretary of State said and recommended to the \nadministration that we ought to be able to consolidate three agencies \ninto the State Department. But we are only talking about one here now. \nWe are only talking about saving $1.7 billion.\n  We have had no legislative recommendations from this administration \nwith respect to this State Department authorization. Again, as I said \nearlier, for more than a decade that I have been working on this very \nissue, I have never had an administration not submit a legislative \nproposal with respect to authorization for the State Department and \nrelated agencies.\n  The President, of course, can veto this legislation and has indicated \nhe will. I hope that he will not because I do believe this conference \nreport does strike a compromise between the House and the Senate. It \naccommodates the concerns and the views of the administration. I think \nit is unfortunate if the President moves forward with a veto because he \nwill have failed to seize an opportunity to move forward in this \nconsolidation process and to reorganize our foreign policy structure.\n\n  It will be the President who vetoes that consolidation, and it will \nbe the President who vetoes the savings in this bill. It will be the \nPresident who vetoes the McBride Principles and the codification of the \nHumanitarian Aid Corridor Act. It will be the President who denies \nhimself the authority he needs to prevent members of terrorist \norganizations from entering the United States and endangering the lives \nof American people. That is the bottom line here with respect to this \nconference report.\n  I hope that Members will give this very serious consideration and \nadopt this conference report because it is, I think, a step towards the \nkind of goals we want to accomplish for our foreign policy structure, \nnot only for the short term but for the long term.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes on the time of the Senator from Massachusetts, to be followed \nby Senator Pryor, who has some time coming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I was sitting in my office earlier this \nafternoon and the senior Senator from Arizona came to the floor and \nchastised President Clinton for apparently discussing on the telephone \nwith President Yeltsin the poultry embargo that the Russians had \nimposed against all American poultry. The Senator suggested that he \nhoped that the President had much greater things to discuss with the \nPresident of Russia.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not know what they talked about, but I \npersonally applaud President Clinton for bringing up that very \ndifficult issue. The Russians import $2.1 billion worth of all products \nin the United States every year, a little over $2 billion, and one-\nthird of that, over $700 million of that, is poultry. Not just my \nState--it is North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona acted as though there were something \nsmall or childish about the President talking to President Yeltsin \nabout that embargo, which has now been solved. The President did \nexactly what I would expect him to do.\n  I know that the Senator from Arizona is not speaking for Senator \nDole. Would he say the same thing if they embargoed rice or wheat? \nWould we have heard that same speech if President Clinton had called \nPresident Yeltsin about a wheat embargo? I do not think so. I know that \nif Senator Dole ever became President and we\n\n[[Page S3132]]\n\nhad that kind of an embargo, in my opinion, he would not hesitate to \npick up the phone and call the President of Russia about it.\n  I am just amazed. Here is a big trade issue, and trade is about all \nwe talk about here anymore and about the so-called 301 retaliatory \nmeasures. I suspect, frankly, that President Clinton's intervention on \nthat helped resolve it, and the people of my State are working today, \nthe people in North Carolina, Alabama, and Texas are working today \nbecause the President called the President of Russia and said, ``This \nis a funny issue. Why don't you let up?'' I think that is what solved \nthe problem.\n  I applaud President Clinton for his intervention. I deplore people \ntrying to treat that in such a cavalier, simplistic manner.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from \nAlaska be recognized for 8 minutes, and after the Senator from Alaska \nfinishes, I be recognized for a 10-minute period. I ask that the time \nthat I use be charged to Senator Kerry of Massachusetts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And the time of the Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe Senator Helms indicated a willingness to \nyield time.\n  Mr. HELMS. The Senator from Alaska, as far as I am concerned, can \nspeak as long as he likes, but he has stipulated 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with the floor manager. Senator Pryor was \nkind enough to allow me to go out of turn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes is charged to Senator Helms. The \ntime of the Senator from Arkansas is charged to Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is it possible to continue the sequence of speakers, or \ndoes the chairman not wish to do that?\n  Mr. PRYOR. If I may respond, what we are doing is continuing the \nsequencing, because Senator Bumpers, after finishing his presentation, \nwe have asked that Senator Murkowski on the other side be recognized, \nand then I would be recognized. I guess I would be recognized after \nSenator Murkowski.\n  Mr. HELMS. In the natural course of things, Senator Sarbanes would be \nrecognized if time is yielded to him. I am sure that he can get that by \nunanimous consent, to be charged to Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. SARBANES. After Senator Pryor?\n  Mr. HELMS. No, no, go back and forth. The Senator from Alaska is \ngoing to speak only 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we prepare to vote on the conference \nreport on H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995, \nI rise to express my specific concerns that the statement of \nadministration policy indicates that the President appears to be going \nto veto this bill based at least in part on section 1601, which \nreaffirms the primacy of the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of the provision claim we are nullifying \nthe joint communique. I totally disagree with this interpretation. Let \nme refer to the definition of the specific word ``supersede'' as used \nin section 1601. The Oxford dictionary say ``supersede'' means \noverride. I was an original author of this language so I know a little \nabout its legislative intent, and that is that the Taiwan Relations Act \noverrides the provisions of the communique only if the two are in \nconflict.\n  Now, section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act commits the United States \nto sell Taiwan whatever defense articles it needs for self-defense and \nthat the executive branch and the Congress will jointly determine what \nthose needs might be.\n  In 1982, President Reagan pledged in a joint communique with China to \ndecrease arm sales to Taiwan. That was the so-called bucket.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act was ratified by Congress and is the law of \nthe land. Make no mistake about it. The 1982 communique is an executive \nagreement never ratified by the Congress.\n  Now, all that the provision in the conference report says is that the \nlaw of the land--the law of the land, Mr. President--the Taiwan \nRelations Act, will supersede the provisions of the joint communique if \nthe two are in conflict. They have to be in conflict, Mr. President. \nThat is the difference. This is simply a matter of legal precedence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reference from the \nOxford dictionary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Supersede: To desist from, discontinue (a procedure, an \n     attempt, etc.); not to proceed with -1750. b. intr. \n     To desist, forbear, refrain -1850. 2.

Captain \n     Nisbet in the Bonne Citoyenne Nelson.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. For example, if the threat to Taiwan is increasing, \ndefensive arm sales should go up. They should not be arbitrarily \nlimited by the bucket. Prior administrations have followed this \nprinciple in practice, such as selling F-16's to Taiwan, even though \nthey were outside the dollar limits of the bucket.\n  It was a matter of convenience. We wanted to do it, so we found a way \nto do it. I do not see why the administration is objecting to this \nprovision, because it is consistent with current practice. I would also \nremind my colleagues that the identical language passed out of the \nForeign Relations Committee in 1994 on a 20-0 vote when I was a member \nof that committee.\n  Mr. President, I again find it incredible that the administration \nwould issue this veto threat over a provision that was intended merely \nto restate reality: The law of the land takes precedence over a \nstatement of policy. I do not think you could find one constitutional \nscholar who would disagree with that proposition.\n  Secretary of State Christopher, in correspondence with me in 1994, \nacknowledged that it was the administration's position, as it was of \nprevious administrations, that the Taiwan Relations Act as a public law \ntakes legal precedence over the 1982 joint United States-China \ncommunique, an Executive communication that was never, as I said, \nratified by Congress. Mr. President, I have that letter from Secretary \nof State Christopher. When the letter was given to me, I told the \nSecretary, at his request, that I would not release the letter. But I \nthink that the State Department should look up that letter and find out \nwhat the Secretary said because I think what he said then is as \napplicable today, March 28, 1996, as it was April 22, 1994. So I \nsuggest that the State Department do a little backtracking.\n  It is important to remember that the 1982 communique was based on the \npremise that the future of Taiwan would be settled solely--this is \nimportant--by peaceful means and was signed at a time when decreased \ntensions between China and Taiwan meant that Taiwan's self-defensive \nneeds were not increasing.\n  The Senate voted 97-0 last week to reaffirm the commitments made in \nthe Taiwan Relations Act. One of the commitments is that the President, \nin consultation with the Congress, will review whether the capabilities \nand intentions of the People's Republic of China have increased the \nthreat to Taiwan. If so, defensive arms sales to Taiwan, obviously, \nshould be adjusted upward accordingly, if indeed that is the case.\n  Well, we have seen, in recent weeks, the heightened tensions. I do \nnot have to go into the significance of what the M-9 missile message \nwas. It was that China can indeed launch a missile from the mainland, \nand it can indeed go to Taiwan. Indeed it has a payload of about 1,200 \npounds, and it drops its locomotion in entry, and, as a consequence, it \nis very difficult to pick up.\n\n[[Page S3133]]\n\n I am not sure that the technology is available to counter that missile \nthreat.\n  As we look at some of the other missile threats to the United States, \nincluding to my State of Alaska and to Hawaii, we find we are in the \nrange of some of those, which the rest of the United States is not in \nthe range of. I do not think Hawaii and Alaska are expendable, although \nsome of my colleagues may differ from time to time.\n  Since 1994, China has mounted a series of military exercises near \nTaiwan. In September and October 1994, the People's Liberation Army \nconducted combined air, land, and sea exercises on Chou Shan Island, \nabout 60 miles south of Quemoy. At that time, Assistant Secretary of \nState Winston Lord described these exercises as ``the most expansive * \n* * that China has conducted in 40 or 50 years.'' In June and July of \nlast year, the PLA conducted more exercises, including firing four \nmedium range M-9 missiles--the first time China had used missiles to \nthreaten an opponent. Right before the Legislative Yuan elections in \nNovember, China conducted large-scale com- \nbined-arms, amphibious and airborne assault exercises designed to \nsimulate an invasion of Taiwan.\n  Then, on the eve of the first direct democratic presidential election \nin Taiwan, China began a series of three more tests. First, China fired \nfour more M-9 missiles into closures within 25 to 35 miles of the two \nprincipal northern and southern ports of Taiwan. China followed the \nmissile tests with live ammunition war games in a 2,390-square-mile \narea in the southern Taiwan Strait, followed by another live ammunition \nexercise between the Taiwan islands of Matsu and Wuchu.\n  China may not yet have the capability to invade and conquer the \nRepublic of China on Taiwan, but it does have the capability to do \nsignificant harm by mining ports, undertaking a limited blockade with \nits 5 nuclear-powered and 45 conventional-powered attack submarines, \nand conducting a terror campaign with missiles capable of carrying \nnuclear or chemical warheads. Taiwan lacks a reliable missile defense \nand has only two modern conventional submarines.\n  I do not consider myself an expert on defense matters, but it appears \nthat Taiwan needs additional deterrence capability, especially with \nregard to missile defenses. I commend the Clinton administration for \nsending our carriers into the area of the Taiwan Strait recently to \nmonitor China's war exercises. This exercise should put the Defense \nDepartment in a very good position to evaluate the threat to Taiwan \nfrom China in determining the level of future arms sales.\n  Mr. President, I only hope that the diplomats in the State Department \ndo not ignore the military reality in making decisions about future \narms sales to Taiwan because of a fear of China's reaction. But, \nunfortunately, that is what I believe is the driving force behind the \nveto threat. The administration states that section 1601 ``would be \nseen as a repudiation of a critical and stabilizing element of \nlongstanding U.S. policy toward China, increasing risks at a time of \nheightened tensions.''\n  Mr. President, the most critical element in U.S. policy toward China \nis the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future. If China, by force, \nrepudiates that element, then the basis of the United States' one-China \npolicy is simply stripped away.\n  We should recognize that that provision in the Foreign Relations \nAuthorization Act does not repudiate U.S. policy, it reaffirms it. I \ncall on the administration to drop this veto threat and implement the \nlaw as required.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful to my good friend from Arkansas, who has \naccommodated me and my schedule. I thank the floor manager.\n  Mr. PRYOR addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3125-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3133-S3134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE DEBT CEILING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I am going to revert \nback to a measure that we just passed in the Senate, I think, less than \nan hour ago, which is the debt ceiling legislation.\n  On that legislation, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, had included an amendment he had long fought for, and I support \nthat amendment very strongly, Mr. President. That was an amendment \nrelative to the social security earnings test. It was on that \nparticular amendment that I had told the leadership in times past that \nshould that amendment come to the floor, I was going to attempt to \namend that particular provision with a measure that would basically \nclear up, once and forever more, a mistake we made in the GATT Treaty \nlegislation that we passed last year in the U.S. Senate.\n  In other words, Mr. President, I was going to use that as a vehicle \nto amend this provision, which allows one particular drug company--\nGlaxo, for example--to absolutely continue taking advantage of not only \nthe taxpayer, but also the consumer, the aging American, taking this \nparticular drug called Zantac, and prohibiting, precluding generic \ncompetition from coming into the marketplace.\n  Mr. President, on December 13, 1995, I received a letter from my \nfriend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. In the letter it says, ``Please be assured that I intend to \nhonor my commitment. I will begin a hearing on pharmaceutical patent \nissues February 27, 1996, and I plan to hold a markup by the end of \nMarch.''\n  Well, Mr. President, our friend and colleague, the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, did in fact hold a \nhearing on February 27, 1996. However, the markup on this particular \nmatter, the Glaxo issue, has not been scheduled. It has not been \nscheduled for any time in March. To the best of my knowledge, it has \nnot been scheduled for April, May, and who knows--I just hope it will \nbe scheduled someday.\n  But what is at issue is this fact: Every day we refuse in the Senate \nand in the House of Representatives, the other body, to correct this \nmistake that we made through this system, in not clearing up the issue \nof the patent extension for this particular drug company, and about six \nother drug companies, every day that we refuse, every day that we \ndelay, Mr. President, we are fattening their pocketbooks to the extent \nof $5 million a day. That is $5 million each day that is being paid for \nby the consumer, the taxpayer, the Veterans Administration, the HMO's, \nright on down the line--any consumers that buy Zantac. We have been \ntold that a generic that is ready to go into the marketplace \nimmediately could absolutely walk into that marketplace today, begin \ncompetition with Zantac at one-half of the price of this prescription \ndrug. But, Mr. President, we have refused to do it. We have had a vote \nin December, and we failed by two votes to get enough votes in this \nbody to close this loophole and to state that we are no longer going to \ncontinue this very major windfall for one or two or three drug \ncompanies.\n  We made a mistake. We extended all patents from 17 to 20 years in \nGATT, and we said that a generic company could market their product on \nthe 17-year expiration date, if they already made a substantial \ninvestment and were willing to pay a royalty.\n  We think that is a fair balance of interest. The other thing we did \nin GATT was that we said we are going to allow every human, every \ncompany, every product to have the same extension of their patent \nrights. However, we set out a perfectly illegitimate reason to give to \na few drug companies a unique opportunity to not be included in the \nGATT legislation. So, therefore, we excluded a few pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers, and we said to them that you are going to have an extra \n3 years on your patent. You are not going to have any competition \nwhatsoever in this particular drug marketing and in the sales of the \nparticular drug.\n  During the February hearing held by Senator Hatch, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee, we had the evidence, we had the testimony of \nour U.S. Trade Ambassador, Ambassador Kantor, we had the Patent Office, \nand we had everyone representing this administration that we could \nthink of say that this was never intended to be a part of the GATT \nTreaty. The negotiators never intended to carve out a special reason, \nor a special status, for a very few--if I might say, a handful--of drug \nmanufacturers.\n  Mr. President, during that testimony that day in late February of \n1996, during all of the discussions that we have\n\n[[Page S3134]]\n\nheld on the floor of the U.S. Senate, during the committee meetings \nthat have been addressing this issue, including the Finance Committee, \nthere is not one scintilla of evidence--not one--that one individual \nhas ever maintained that this was a deliberate act by the negotiators, \nthat this was a deliberate act by the Congress of the United States to \ncarve out this special exemption for a handful of drug manufacturers.\n  We have competition ready to come to the marketplace. We have cheaper \nprices ready to be able to come into the marketplace to provide quality \ndrugs at competitive prices--more than competitive prices. For us to \nbelieve that we can continue this great windfall, I think is very wrong \nindeed.\n  I urge the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to proceed forthwith \nwith a markup for this particular issue. He knows what the issues are.\n  Mr. President, I further state that at the proper time on the proper \nlegislative vehicle, I will offer to the Senate once again the \nopportunity to correct the record, once again the opportunity to set \nthings right, because every day that we delay is another $5 million in \nprofits to the pharmaceutical companies that make Zantac and these \nother drugs. We are delaying now about another 15 to 20 days at least \nbecause we are leaving on a 2-week recess tomorrow. That is another $75 \nmillion to $80 million for these drug companies in extra profits for \nthem at this time.\n  We had a vote in December, and we have seen since that time and since \nthat vote another $450 million of profits being given to them in a \nwindfall nature.\n  I think the American people certainly are calling on us to be \nresponsible to set the record straight and to admit that we made a \nmistake.\n  I am going to give the Senate--and hopefully the other body--an \nopportunity to correct that mistake in the very near future. I will be \noffering that on the first legislative vehicle that I see the \nopportunity to attach it to after we return from our Easter break.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was dismayed to hear the comments our \ncolleague, Senator Pryor, just made with reference to the Judiciary \nCommittee's deliberations on the GATT/pharmaceutical patent issue.\n  My colleague was correct in stating that I wrote him a letter in \nDecember indicating the committee would hold a hearing and a markup on \nthis issue.\n  In fact, we held a hearing on February 27 on the specific issue he \nraised, and 1 week later, March 5, held another hearing on the more \ngeneral issue of pharmaceutical patent life at which the GATT issue was \nalso commented upon by a number of individuals.\n  Perhaps my colleague was not aware, that, on Tuesday, I notified the \ncommittee that this would be a possible agenda item for markup this \nweek. However, it was not possible to forecast the arduous, time-\nconsuming immigration markup, which extended much longer than any of us \nhad anticipated. In addition, Senator Kennedy, the ranking member of \nthe Labor Committee and a top member of Judiciary, expressed concerns \nabout how the Judiciary Committee's agenda was conflicting with the FDA \nreform markup this week in Labor. Accordingly, at the outset of the \nJudiciary Committee's deliberations on the immigration bill this \nmorning, I made the following statement:\n\n       Finally, let me say a few words the Committee's \n     consideration of how certain GATT transition rules should \n     apply to the generic drug industry--this is the so-called \n     GATT patent issue.\n       This was the subject of a lengthy floor debate on December \n     7th and a Committee hearing on February 27th.\n       As I have stated on a number of occasions, my preference is \n     to achieve some sort of compromise on the issue. But this is \n     a very complex issue that involves the confluence of three \n     interrelated statutes: the GATT implementing law, the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and the patent code.\n       I am aware that there are discussions taking place in an \n     attempt to fashion a compromise proposal. I have directed my \n     staff to continue to facilitate these discussions.\n       Frankly, the Immigration Bill has taken longer that any of \n     us would have liked or could have planned for. It became \n     apparent earlier this week that we would not have time to \n     complete a GATT mark-up before Friday.\n       We still have many amendments to dispose of on the \n     Immigration Bill. I also know that Chairman Kassebaum's Labor \n     Committee is in the middle of the FDA reform mark-up and that \n     Senator Kennedy wanted to closely coordinate our schedules \n     today. Other members have scheduling conflicts as well.\n       For these reasons, I am announcing my intent to schedule \n     mark-up on the GATT issue when we return from recess. I would \n     like to consider a compromise that most of us can support. I \n     don't think the Pryor bill meets that test. I hope we will \n     continue working toward an agreement over the recess.\n\n  I wish to make amply clear for the record that Senator Pryor's staff \nhad informed me that he did not anticipate, nor wish for, a markup on \nthis issue in Judiciary, but rather he wished to pursue a dialogue on \nthe floor. Thus, I was heartened to hear his remarks just now in which \nhe stated he wanted the Judiciary Committee to mark up a bill.\n  Before closing, I would like to address one specific comment Senator \nPryor made. Those who advocate change in the law argue that the \nCongress clearly intended to achieve the results of the Pryor/Chafee/\nBrown amendment when we originally passed the Uruguay Round Agreements \nAct (URAA). They continue to argue to this day that it was merely a \n``technical oversight'' which led to this ``unfair'' outcome.\n  I find it strange that not one person has come forward, that there \nhas been not one shred of evidence, not one memo, nor paragraph of a \nmemo, nor even a sentence in any document supporting Senator Pryor's \ncontention.\n  In fact, the Court of Appeals for the Federal circuit, a completely \ndisinterested party, could find no definitive evidence on this issue at \nall. In the November, 1995 Royce decision, the Federal circuit stated:\n\n       The parties have not pointed to, and we have not \n     discovered, any legislative history on the intent of \n     Congress, at the time of passage of the URAA, regarding the \n     interplay between the URAA and the Hatch-Waxman Act.''\n\n  I do not wish to rehash the arguments related to the GATT at this \ntime. It is an extraordinarily complex issue, and is not as simple as \nit might appear to some. It is no secret to this body that I am not \nsupportive of the Pryor amendment as drafted in December.\n  What I do want to emphasize is that a fair resolution of this issue \nremains my priority and, as I said at the markup this morning, I am \nhopeful we can fashion a compromise that is acceptable to the majority \nof Senators. I hope that my colleagues Senators Pryor, Brown and \nChafee, will be willing to work with us in that regard and I look \nforward to their suggestions for areas in which a resolution can be \ncrafted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3133-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3134-S3144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1996 AND 1997--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I was one of the first Members of the \nSenate to support Senator Helms' efforts to consolidate U.S. foreign \npolicy agencies. This bill does not go as far as I or many of my \ncolleagues on the Foreign Relations Committee had hoped it would in \nthis respect. I, and I know the chairman, had envisioned a \nconsolidation which would require the dismantlement of three agencies--\nUSAID, USIA, and ACDA. But just getting the bill into and out of the \nconference committee was a major accomplishment and I commend the \nchairman for it.\n  I support the bill and I will vote for it. A savings of $1.7 billion \nover 4 years and the merging into the State Department of at least one \nforeign policy agency is a proposition simply too good to pass up.\n  However, I do want to register my steadfast opposition to one \nparticular provision in the bill. The conference report conditions \nfunding for any expansion in United States diplomatic relations with \nVietnam on Presidential certifications in a number of areas related to \nmissing United States servicemen. The Senate wisely refrained from \nincluding similar language in its bill, and despite its several efforts \nto address the issue in previous legislation, the House included only \nsense-of-the-Congress language.\n  Given that neither House decided to legislate in this area, I was \nquite dismayed to find out that somehow during the proceedings of the \nconference committee, the conferees actually decided to make the House \nlanguage tougher. One reasonably expects--and common\n\n[[Page S3135]]\n\nsense would indicate--that a compromise develops midway between two \npositions. But in this case, compromise involved not only caving to the \nHouse position, but giving House conferees something for their trouble.\n  This is the third time that I have come to the floor to register my \nopposition to the same language in different conference reports. I know \nthat conferees often have a difficult time dealing with this issue. On \none side of the debate are those who seek to block the President's \ndecision to normalize relations with Vietnam at every opportunity. They \nare extraordinarily focused and unrelenting. In contrast, those on the \nother side of the debate either have an understandable predominate \ninterest in reaching a real compromise, or truly see no harm in forcing \nthe President's hand.\n  As was the case with the CJS conference report, the balance of \nsentiments on this issue in this conference has contributed to the \ncertainty of a Presidential veto. I know that the President would have \nlikely vetoed the bill anyway. He has fought the idea of State \nDepartment reorganization since Secretary Christopher first proposed \nit. However, I think we have complicated the case for consolidation \nwith this provision on Vietnam. In short, we have given the President \none more reason to veto the bill. And unlike some of his reasons, to my \nmind, this one is legitimate.\n  When the bill returns to the Senate for a possible veto override, I \nhope the conference will revisit the issue of United States-Vietnam \nrelations and approve language which reflects the will of at least one \nHouse of Congress. Consistent with his constitutional powers, the \nPresident last year made a decision to normalize relations with \nVietnam. As I have pointed out to my colleagues a number of times, this \nis a fact. The President should not be constrained in his efforts to \ncarry out his decision. If we cannot respect President Clinton's \ndecision on its merits, we ought to at least respect the power his \noffice entitles him to exercise.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I oppose H.R. 1561. I do so for many \nreasons.\n  I believe that this bill is not only myopic, but it is dangerous. \nH.R. 1561 calls upon the President to eliminate one of three foreign \npolicy agencies and includes authorization levels that would force the \nUnited States to withdraw from some international organizations. It \noverlooks the successful efforts the administration has already \nundertaken to reduce its expenditures. Mr. President, the United States \nis unquestionably the strongest Nation in the world. These foreign \naffairs agencies are essential to U.S. leadership. H.R. 1561 undermines \nour strength and leadership in the world.\n  In addition to objection to the general direction the bill takes us, \nthere are also specific provisions that are seriously flawed. \nSpecifically, look at how this bill treats relations with Vietnam. \nSection 1214 makes funding for a U.S. Embassy in Vietnam dependent upon \na Presidential certification that Vietnam is fully cooperating on the \nPOW/MIA issue. Most certainly we all want to resolve any outstanding \nPOW/MIA cases. However, this provision isn't likely to facilitate that \nend. This provision, if enacted, could threaten the progress that has \nalready been made on the POW/MIA issue. Moreover, it could restrict the \nPresident's ability to pursue our national interests in Vietnam and put \nUnited States firms at a competitive disadvantage.\n  Second, it terms of U.S. participation in the United Nations, this \nbill provides inadequate funding levels for fiscal years 1996 and 1997. \nThe United States is already $1.2 billion in arrears to the United \nNations. Besides being irresponsible, this outstanding obligation \nthwarts our influence in the United Nations and impedes our diplomatic \nefforts to reform the institution. Even Namibia, one of the poorest \ncountries in the world with a GDP 86 times less than the United States, \nhas paid up. That, Mr. President, is shameful.\n  Third, H.R. 1561 fails to resolve the limitations on U.S. population \nassistance programs placed in the fiscal year 1996 foreign operations \nappropriations legislation. Such restriction will have a serious, \ndetrimental impact on women and families in the developing world. These \nrestrictions will cause an estimated 7 million couples in developing \ncountries to be without access to safe, voluntary family planning \nservices. And what will the result be? Millions of unwanted pregnancies \nand abortions. Mr. President, I am sure that none of my colleagues want \nto see this happen.\n  Mr. President, I conclude my statement by reiterating that H.R. 1561 \nis shortsighted, dangerous, and that I vigorously oppose it. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me in voting against the conference \nreport.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today, we have before us significant \nlegislation which, if it becomes law, will restructure the principal \ninstitutions used to conduct America's foreign policy. The process \nleading to this point may have been less bipartisan and less open than \nsome of us would have desired. But I want to commend the chairman of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, for his determination \nin shepherding this difficult bill through the legislative process.\n  The heart of this bill is its reorganization of our Nation's foreign \npolicy bureaucracy. While I still have reservations about the continued \ndeep cuts in our foreign affairs spending--an account that already has \nsustained deep cuts since the late 1980s--that is not the issue here. \nCongress made the decision to continue cutting our foreign affairs \nspending when we passed the budget resolution last year. The purpose of \nthis authorizing legislation is to try to shape those cuts in a manner \nthat will best protect our ability to carry out the Nation's foreign \npolicy.\n  I believe this conference report's approach to streamlining and \nconsolidation--an approach dramatically different from the original \nversions introduced a year ago in both Houses--is reasonable. In \nessence, this legislation would require the abolition of one of our \nfour principal foreign policy agencies and would require a savings of \n$1.8 billion over 4 years. It wisely vests in the President, however, \nthe maximum possible flexibility to determine the details of \nreorganization.\n  Because the reorganization provisions are, in my judgment, \nreasonable, I intend to vote for this legislation. However, I very much \nregret that the legislation also contains many foreign policy \nprovisions which have been less scrutinized and which, in my view, \nwould have been better omitted. Let me outline my specific concerns \nwith the legislation:\n  First, the bill contains a number of provisions that may further \nirritate our relations with China. Most important among these is the \nprovision asserting that the Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over \nthe 1982 Sino-United States joint communique. The triangular \nrelationship between Washington, Beijing and Taipei is a delicate \ndiplomatic balance in each of its legs, and in this legislation \nCongress is needlessly seeking to strengthen one leg--the leg between \nWashington and Taipei--without regard for the effect on the other two.\n  Second, the bill unwisely reopens the difficult debate about our \nrelations with Vietnam. In 1994, after weighing the arguments on both \nsides, Congress concluded that normalizing relations with Vietnam best \nserves America's national interests in that region. I do not believe we \nshould roll back that decision today.\n  Third, the bill creates a new category of political asylum for \npersons fleeing coercive population practices. I have opposed this \nprovision from its inception because I believe it may open a floodgate \nof false claims for immigrants from certain countries not otherwise \nable to enter the United States.\n  Fourth, the conference report restores several provisions that \nrequire withholding of U.S. contributions to the United Nations--\nprovisions that were struck from the Senate bill at my request. I \nbelieve that we have reached the limits of this nickel-and-dime \napproach to reforming the United Nations and that these narrow \nwithholding requirements have become counterproductive. What is needed, \nin my view, is a broader approach to reform. Unfortunately, a provision \nthat I added to the Senate bill to require the administration to submit \nto Congress an overall proposal for reforming the United Nations \nconsistent with several specific objectives has been dropped from the \nconference report.\n  Fifth, this legislation has cherry picked the foreign aid \nauthorization\n\n[[Page S3136]]\n\nbill, incorporating a small handful of its most politically popular \nprovisions into the broader State Department Authorization bill. This \napproach ensures that no other foreign aid authorization will be \nenacted this year. I worry we are creating a situation in which no \nforeign aid program other than the few in this bill will be authorized \nand, as a result, funding for any others may be blocked.\n  Sixth, this authorization legislation does not deal with the \ndifficult population issue of international family planning, despite \nthe compromise reached in the Foreign Operations Appropriations debate \nstipulating that the matter would be handled in this bill.\n  Seventh, the legislation ends the United States housing guarantee \nprogram, with an exception for our program in South Africa. I tend to \nbelieve this is an important program that should not be banned by \nstatute.\n  Mr. President, this is a long list of objections. To weigh them \nagainst the strengths of the bill's reorganization provisions was no \neasy task. I concluded, however, that the bill on balance is \nworthwhile--largely because its reorganization provisions will bring an \norder to the inevitable downsizing of these agencies that otherwise \nmight not exist. I also want to support the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee. However, I understand the President has reached a \ndifferent conclusion and intends to veto this legislation. If that \noccurs, I cannot give assurances that I would vote to override his \nveto.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my friend from North \nCarolina for moving forward a proposal to reduce the size of government \nthat was opposed by the Administration and those on the other side of \nthe aisle. I think through his persistence we have a bill that may not \ngo as far as most of us in the Senate would like to see, but at least \nit is a step in the right direction.\n  I do think, however, that the debate on this bill helps to magnify \nthe fundamental differences between those on this side of the aisle and \nthose on the other side of the aisle.\n  When this bill was originally proposed it would have eliminated three \ngovernment agencies, The Agency for International Development [AID], \nThe Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [ACDA] and The United States \nInformation Agency [USIA] and folded these functions back into the \nState Department. By doing this, the American taxpayer would have saved \n$3.66 billion during the next four years.\n  Now we have a bill that calls for the elimination of these three \nagencies, but the bill allows the President to issue a waiver for the \nelimination of two of these three agencies. The result is that the \nAmerican taxpayer will only realize about half of the $3.66 billion in \nsavings as originally proposed.\n  I want to remind my colleagues how we got from the original version \nof the bill to the Conference Report. This is especially enlightening \nbecause when the bill was originally proposed, it was hailed as the \nHelms-Christopher plan because the bill mirrored a plan outlined by \nSecretary of State Warren Christopher to eliminate these agencies.\n  This is what the January 12, 1995 edition of the Washington Times had \nto say about this bill:\n\n       If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Deputy Secretary of \n     State Strobe Talbott ought to be basking in the glow of \n     admiration beaming upon them from Capitol Hill. Jesse Helms \n     and Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairmen of the Senate and House \n     Foreign Affairs Committees, recently unveiled their plan for \n     the re-invention of the U.S. State Department and--Ta-da--it \n     bore more than a passing resemblance to the plan produced by \n     Messrs. Christopher and Talbott.\n\n  However, when Vice-President Gore and his re-inventing government \nstaff got a hold of Secretary Christoper's plan it was fundamentally \naltered. Instead of adopting it, the Vice-President decided to \nstreamline these agencies. And since then, according to the August 5, \n1995 edition of Congressional Quarterly, ``the administration . . . has \nmounted a furious effort to kill the Helms bill.''\n  Once again, I want to compliment my friend from North Carolina for \ncontinuing to move this plan as originally proposed forward in the face \nof opposition. He moved the bill through his committee, but when the \nbill got to the floor of the Senate, the Democrats here carried the \nadministration's torch and frustrated efforts to eliminate these \nagencies.\n  Twice the Senate tried to cut-off debate, and twice, along party \nlines, the Senate was prevented from moving forward on the bill.\n  I wish to remind my friends on the other side of the aisle and the \nAmerican people, that the bill does not eliminate the functions of The \nAgency for International Development [AID], The Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency [ACDA] and The United States Information Agency \n[USIA]. Some have argued that the bill in its original form would have \neliminated important government functions. I ask how? The bill \ntransfers the functions of these agencies to the State Department and \neliminates the bureaucracy created by these independent agencies.\n  I wish to point out again for my colleagues in the Senate, that the \nfirst bill of the 104th Congress that would have eliminated three \ngovernment agencies faced vigorous opposition by the Democrats in its \noriginal form. And the watered down version, which we are about to pass \nwhich would eliminate only one government agency, faces a certain veto \nby the President. This despite the fact that in his state of the union \naddress the President said ``the era of the big government is over.''\n  I don't think the American people could get a more clear picture of \nwho is doing what about the size of government.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, much of the debate today has addressed \nissues that are important but peripheral to the focus of this bill, \nwhich is the size and organization of the State Department and \nassociated foreign policy agencies.\n  Going back to the Nixon administration, numerous reviews have been \nconducted by the Foreign Relations Committee, its House counterpart, \nand many executive branch-appointed groups to determine how best to \nstreamline the array of foreign policy agencies that exist. My staff at \nthe Oversight of Government Management has studied this issue, as well. \nA common theme of these reviews has been that more efficiencies can be \nachieved, and this probably should include the merging of some existing \nagencies. The conference report now before the Senate directs, in \nessence, the elimination of at least one of three agencies--the Agency \nfor International Development [AID], the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency [ACDA], or the U.S. Information Agency [USIA]--with primary \nfocus on AID and ACDA.\n  The 1989 House Foreign Affairs Committee report coauthored by \nCongressmen Hamilton and Gilman called for AID's elimination. A 1992 \nreport by a bipartisan group appointed by AID, itself, called for AID's \nmerger into the State Department.\n  A decade ago, I cochaired with Harold Brown a study group at the \nJohns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. We commissioned \na paper on why ACDA should not be merged into the State Department. \nQuite frankly, despite the best efforts of the author who was an \nadvocate of ACDA, the resulting paper produced only weak arguments for \nkeeping ACDA as an independent agency.\n  Three years ago, Lynn Davis, a protege of Secretary Browns, was \nappointed by the Clinton administration to be Under Secretary of State. \nOne of her first initiatives was to push to merge ACDA into the State \nDepartment, but her effort failed in the face of congressional \nopposition.\n  Last year, Secretary Christopher, himself, proposed merging these \nthree agencies into the State Department, but his proposal was not \naccepted.\n  So the concept of merging ACDA, at least, into the State Department \nis hardly radical. And few would argue that, in after the \n``reinvention'' initiatives undertaken by the current administrator, \nmore must be done to reduce the size and improve the effectiveness of \nAID.\n  This bill makes clear the desire of Congress to see genuine \nstreamlining, talked about for so many years, finally and effectively \nimplemented.\n  At the same time, legitimate questions have been raised as to whether \nthe specific mechanism in the conference report is the best way to go \nabout it. Throughout the Reagan and\n\n[[Page S3137]]\n\nBush administrations, Republicans criticized congressional micromanage- \nment of the President's foreign policy. Some will ask why now, in 1996, \nwe seem to be shifting direction and trying to impose restrictions on \nthe President. Even more than in the case of the reorganization \nprovisions of the conference report, this is true for many of the \nconference report's policy provisions.\n  In this regard, I would highlight sections dealing with the Housing \nInvestment Guarantee Program, Vietnamese migrants, and China. Besides \nbeing unrelated to the core function of this bill, many such provisions \ncontain unwise policy prescriptions.\n  We should encourage, for example, aid programs that leverage private \ninternational investment, not terminate such programs as the conference \nreport would do. We should encourage enhanced dialogue between United \nStates and Chinese officials, rather than discourage it as the \nconference report would do.\n  Despite these deficiencies, however, the bill does make progress on \nthe decades-old project of streamlining the various foreign policy \nagencies, and so I intend to vote for it.\n  If the President does veto the conference report, I hope that we can \nact promptly to rework it into a bill that can be enacted by deleting \nor modifying these objectionable provisions.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the \ntime to be charged proportionately.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The time will be charged proportionately, and the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina, managing the \nbill, was seeking recognition.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Let us be fair about this thing. This is two Democratic \nSenators. The Senator from Maryland has been waiting around to speak, \nand I want to be sure that he is agreeable to being preceded.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in the case of the Senator from Maryland, \nwill the Chair deem that he has been yielded time by Senator Kerry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding. The Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. HELMS. Very well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. How much time \nis still available to Senator Kerry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 67 minutes and 45 seconds.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 10 minutes of Senator Kerry's time. I am \nauthorized to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report. I \nregret that should be the case, because I really do think we should \nmake a very strong effort here to develop a bipartisan approach toward \nour foreign policy. But this bill takes us in so many of the wrong \ndirections that I simply cannot support it.\n  First of all, we must understand that we are in a new period with \nrespect to foreign policy. Now that the cold war is over, in my \njudgment the United States needs to bolster its diplomatic, economic, \nand political capacities to influence events around the world. We need \nto anticipate and prevent conflicts through mediation and negotiation. \nWe need to promote sustainable development and support human rights in \norder to avoid conflicts, which would then lead to even larger economic \nand human costs. We need to protect our citizens--indeed, all of the \nworld's citizens--from disease, environmental degradation, exhaustion \nof natural resources, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nterrorism, and trafficking in narcotics.\n  These are all issues that transcend national borders. They are \nsapping the vitality and strength of societies all across the world. \nAnd as the focus shifts to economic matters, we need to expand markets \nfor U.S. goods and services and to create a level international playing \nfield for American workers.\n  Frankly, I think that these things often can be accomplished more \nsafely, more effectively, and at lesser cost through carefully designed \nforeign assistance programs and skillful diplomatic engagement than by \nretreat back to our shores, to a new form of isolationism, or by \nresorting routinely to unilateral military intervention. The reliance \non military force is, of course, our ultimate protection. But many of \nthe problems we are now dealing with are amenable to resolution or \nsubject to influence well short of that. This is a major change from \nthe cold war.\n  This legislation undertakes, in effect, to impose on the executive \nbranch a reorganization of the foreign policy functions of the \nGovernment. I am very frank to tell you that I think if the political \nsituation were reversed and there were a Democratic Congress trying to \nimpose this upon a Republican President, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle would be protesting very loudly that this was an \ninappropriate intrusion into the functions of the Chief Executive, an \nimproper effort to limit the executive's ability to determine the \norganization of the foreign policy agencies.\n  Unfortunately, there is not a shared approach on this bill. It was \nreported out of the committee on a straight party-line vote. It \nconfronted a similar situation on the floor until some concessions were \nmade. Unfortunately, when we got to conference, most of those \nconcessions were abandoned. So the bill now before us is markedly \ndifferent than the bill that passed the Senate.\n  I did not support the bill that passed the Senate, and since it has \nworsened in conference, by definition I would not support the \nconference report. But for those who did support the Senate bill, I \nwant to underscore the fact that the bill now before us is markedly \ndifferent from what moved out of the Senate. Moreover, in my judgment, \nin virtually every instance it is different in the wrong direction. In \nother words, there is even less reason to support this legislation, and \nmore reason to oppose it.\n  There are many troubling provisions in this legislation. Let me just \ntouch on some of them. I am not going to try to cover them all. I know \nthe hour is late, and others wish to speak.\n  I have talked about the reorganization proposal that provides for \nmandatory elimination of at least one of the foreign policy agencies. I \nhappen to think that these agencies are doing a good job, particularly \nunder the restructuring efforts that are taking place internally, and \nin that regard I particularly cite for commendation the efforts at AID. \nUnder the able leadership of the Administrator, Brian Atwood, that \nagency has been streamlined and energized in order to do its job more \neffectively.\n  Secondly, this authorization bill would have the effect of providing \ncaps on appropriations--in other words, of setting ceilings on \nspending--which are far below the levels necessary to conduct foreign \npolicy and to sustain our interests overseas. I think we are going to \nface important challenges in the coming years. I do not think we ought \nto hamstring the ability of the Executive to deal with them. I simply \noffer to my colleagues on the other side the proposition that they have \none of their own now seeking to be the Chief Executive, and they ought \nto stop and think twice whether they would want him hobbled and \nhamstrung, as I believe this legislation would do.\n  This legislation imposes very severe cuts in terms of U.S. \nparticipation at the United Nations. I know for many people, the United \nNations is not the most popular agency, but let me simply submit to \nyou, if we did not have the U.N., we would have to invent it. In many \ninstances, the United Nations helps us to achieve important U.S. \nforeign policy objectives. Often when a situation breaks out around the \nworld, the first reaction everyone has is, ``Well, the United Nations \nought to do something about it,'' and, in many instances, the U.N. has \ndone something about it very successfully.\n\n[[Page S3138]]\n\n  We are now the largest deadbeat at the U.N. in terms of meeting our \ndues and assessments. I think for a Nation which constantly asserts \nthat it is the world's leader, this is a sorry state of affairs. \nUnfortunately, the conference report before us would only exacerbate \nthis situation.\n  Furthermore, this legislation makes such drastic changes with respect \nto AID that I doubt very much that that agency would be able to \ncontinue to function in any meaningful manner.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from 20 \nreligious and faith-based organizations be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is a letter from 20 religious and \nfaith-based organizations urging opposition to H.R. 1561.\n  Let me quote from that letter urging this opposition to the \nconference report:\n\n       . . . The bill would eviscerate further the U.S. commitment \n     to self-help development for poor people in the developing \n     world.\n       We are particularly troubled by the bill's proposal to \n     abolish the Agency for International Development.\n\n  They then go on to say that this would be a misordering of U.S. \npriorities; that support for poverty eradication and self-help \ndevelopment should be a primary objective of U.S. foreign aid and that \nit should be administered by an independent agency.\n  They then discuss other matters in the legislation about which they \nare very concerned. I think this is a very thoughtful letter, and I \nhope my colleagues will examine it very closely.\n  Mr. President, the administration has indicated that they will veto \nthis legislation, as I think they should. I have not discussed some of \nthe particular regional matters. A number of my colleagues have \ndiscussed the Taiwan Relations Act and the impact that this has on the \nUnited States relationship with Taiwan and on our relationship with the \nPeople's Republic of China. I do not think the provisions that are in \nthis legislation have been carefully thought through, and if they were \nadopted we could run a high risk of destabilizing the situation and \ncontributing to heightened tensions in the region.\n  Others, I know, have talked also about the family planning \nimplications of this legislation and the fact that it misses an \nopportunity to correct appropriations restrictions that are having a \ndeleterious impact on women and families in the developing world. This \nis voluntary family planning services that we are talking about. It is \nnot the abortion issue. I am talking about programs that are designed \nto make family planning information and services safe and accessible, \nprograms that have had a positive impact around the world. In fact, \nU.S. foreign assistance does not provide funding for abortion. What we \nare talking about here are international family planning programs which \nhave been in place for many, many years and traditionally are strongly \nsupported on both sides of the aisle.\n  So, in summary, Mr. President, I think this legislation falls well \nshort of what we should be enacting into law. I very much regret that \nthe end product is, in my view, essentially a partisan affair. We ought \nnot to be formulating our foreign policy that way, but that is what has \nhappened here.\n  I would also like to commend Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, who has \nmade a yeoman's effort to reach out in an inclusive way and to try to \nshape reasonable legislation. I very much regret that that was not \nachieved, and I urge my colleagues to vote against the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  20 Religious and Faith-based Organizations Urge Opposition to H.R. \n         1561, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act of 1995\n\n       Dear Senator: We strongly urge your opposition to the \n     conference report on H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations \n     Revitalization Act of 1995, when it is considered by the full \n     Senate. The bill would eviscerate further the U.S. commitment \n     to self-help development for poor people in the developing \n     world.\n       We are particularly troubled by the bill's proposal to \n     abolish the Agency for International Development. The harm \n     posed by such a proposal is not undone by the provision \n     allowing a presidential waiver of the requirement to abolish \n     two foreign policy agencies. While we support the reform of \n     AID, we do not believe that transferring its functions to the \n     State Department would accomplish such reform. To the \n     contrary, we believe strongly that U.S. assistance for \n     development should be administered by an agency separate from \n     the State Department so that the long-term needs for \n     sustainable development are not sacrificed for short-term \n     political objectives. Assistance in support of political \n     objectives already accounts for the majority of U.S. foreign \n     aid. This, in our view, represents a serious misordering of \n     the priorities that should govern U.S. foreign assistance. We \n     believe that support for poverty eradication and self-help \n     development should be the primary objective of U.S. foreign \n     aid and that it should be administered by an independent \n     agency.\n       We are also concerned about the funding levels for a number \n     of programs as authorized in the legislation. We believe that \n     funding for U.S. contributions to international \n     organizations, including the general budget of the United \n     Nations, is inadequate. We also believe that funding for U.N. \n     peacekeeping activities for FY 97 is insufficient. We believe \n     that it is imperative that funding be approved that, at a \n     minimum, will not increase the arrearages in U.S. \n     contributions to the U.N., including peacekeeping activities. \n     Continued U.S. disregard for treaty obligations related to \n     assessed contributions will further undermine U.S. leadership \n     in the world.\n       We oppose the militarization of the international narcotics \n     control program and are especially concerned that funding \n     would nearly double in FY 97 to $213 million. The program has \n     proven largely ineffective in reducing the volume of illicit \n     drugs entering the U.S. At the same time it has strengthened \n     foreign militaries that have engaged in serious and \n     systematic human rights violations.\n       The bill contains a number of constructive refugee and \n     migration policy provisions that deserve support. We regret \n     that these provisions may not be enacted because of \n     objectionable provisions throughout the rest of the bill.\n       We are encouraged by the Administration's statement that \n     the President will veto the bill if it is presented to him in \n     its current form. We hope that there will be sufficient \n     opposition in the Senate to defeat the measure, making such a \n     veto unnecessary. We urge you to oppose the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n         David Bechmann, President, Bread for the World; Mark \n           Brown, Associate Director for Advocacy, Lutheran Office \n           for Governmental Affairs, Evangelical Lutheran Church \n           in America; Imani Countess, Executive Director, \n           Washington Office on Africa; Michael Dodd, Director, \n           Columban Fathers Justice and Peace Office; Bill Dyer, \n           Justice and Peace Officer, Missionaries of Africa; \n           Richelle Friedman, Lobbyist, NETWORK, A national \n           Catholic Social Justice Lobby; Jaydee R.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself up to 6 minutes off the \ntime Senator Kerry has reserved.\n  Mr. President, I also oppose the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act \nof 1995. In my view, it is wrongheaded legislation and, if enacted, it \nwill undermine our national interests. The legislation, in fact, does \nundermine the President's constitutional mandate to conduct the foreign \naffairs of the Nation. By passing a bill such as this, we would be \ntrying to run America's foreign policy out of this Chamber rather than \nallowing the Executive to conduct the Nation's foreign policy.\n  Among my concerns about this act is the forced consolidation of \nagencies. By passing the act, we would tell the\n\n[[Page S3139]]\n\nPresident that he is required to eliminate at least one foreign affairs \nagency, either the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the U.S. \nInformation Agency, or the Agency for International Development. When \nthe goal becomes putting the Government out of business and wrecking \ndepartments and agencies in some haphazard approach without carefully \nconsidering the consequences that a particular agency's termination \nmight have, then something has gone very wrong.\n  Furthermore, the authorization levels that are provided in the bill \nwill force other organizations to retreat further from engagement in \nworld affairs.\n  America needs to pursue its interests vigorously in international \naffairs and to assure that the interests of American citizens are \npromoted. Withdrawing from the world will only help to make our \ncitizens victims of emerging problems to which we will be ill-equipped \nto respond if this bill becomes law.\n  The legislation sets authorization ceilings in fiscal years 1996 and \n1997 that are far below the levels necessary to conduct the President's \nforeign policy and to properly maintain U.S. interests abroad in such \nareas as overseas posts, foreign affairs agencies, arms control and \nnonproliferation activities, international organizations and \npeacekeeping, public diplomacy and sustainable development.\n  In this bill, the Congress is recklessly venturing into an already \nstressful set of complex problems between the People's Republic of \nChina and Taiwan. By amending the Taiwan Relations Act to state that \nthe act supersedes the provisions of the 1982 joint communique between \nthe United States and China, as the bill instructs, we are certain to \npour oil on a smoldering flame. Many commentators and scholars argue \nthat this would be seen as a repudiation of a critical and stabilizing \nelement of the longstanding United States policy toward China.\n  This bill also expresses the sense of Congress that the President of \nTaiwan should be admitted to the United States for a visit this year \nwith all appropriate courtesies. We have already gone down that road \nonce. It seems clear to me that it is foolish, if not dangerous, for us \nto do so once again.\n  My list of concerns continues in that that bill prohibits any funds \nfrom being used to open, expand or operate a diplomatic or consular \npost in Vietnam unless a number of compliance items are met by Vietnam.\n  I am not going to debate whether those compliance guidelines are \nimportant. I believe that they are probably valid things to pursue, but \nnot as a condition to establishing an embassy or getting it operating. \nThis is cold war legislation that does not appear to recognize that the \ncold war is over and that the world has moved on. It is not appropriate \nfor this Chamber to micromanage the President's foreign affairs \ninitiatives in this manner.\n  On other fronts, the Foreign Relations Revitalization Act compels the \nUnited States to downgrade its participation in the United Nations, \nsignificantly restricts our country's ability to coordinate \npeacekeeping efforts and intelligence activities, when global stability \nissues are at stake. Our role in the United Nations is something that \ncertainly deserves national discussion and debate, but this bill \npresupposes the answer to that discussion.\n  Mr. President, this act should be rejected. It clearly does not \nfurther the best interests of the American public. I urge my colleagues \nto vote against its passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NUNN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 117 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I will not need all that time. But could I inquire of the \nChair what happened to my 3 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There were three quorum calls, equally \ndivided. Each one took 1 minute.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. I thank the Chair. I can assure my colleagues I will not \nneed all of my time.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the conference report \non H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal years \n1996 and 1997. Although I have a number of problems with the conference \nreport, Senator Bingaman from New Mexico and others have identified a \nnumber of problems that I will identify myself with. I would like to \nfocus my remarks on the provisions relating to China.\n  Mr. President, I am relieved that tensions in the Taiwan Strait \nappear to be easing in the aftermath of Democratic elections in Taipei. \nWe are already very proud of what occurred in Taipei and proud of the \npeople in Taiwan for carrying out their democratic elections under \ngreat pressure from the mainland.\n  I am pleased that the Governments of the People's Republic of China \nand Taiwan are now making conciliatory statements. I hope a high level \nof dialogue between these two Governments can take place in the near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, it would be truly ironic if China and Taiwan begin \nmoving down the road to improving their relations while we take actions \nin the U.S. Congress that will further the deterioration in the \nrelations between the United States and China. I would find that very \nironic. But I am afraid that that is what this act will do.\n  Before I discuss the specific provisions of this conference report, I \nwould note that the Senate passed a concurrent resolution last Thursday \nexpressing the Sense of Congress regarding missile tests and military \nexercises by China. As I noted in my floor speech on that concurrent \nresolution, which had bipartisan support and passed by a vote of 97 to \n0, it was ``well-reasoned and responsible and * * * designed to make a \nconstructive contribution to the situation.''\n  The concurrent resolution reviewed the history of the three joint \ncommuniques under three different Presidents, noted the adherence to a \none-China policy by the administrations of Presidents Nixon, Ford, \nCarter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, and ``deplored'' China's missile \ntests and military exercises as ``potentially serious threats to the \npeace, security, and stability of Taiwan, and not in the spirit of the \nthree United States-China Joint Communiques.''\n  The concurrent resolution went on to cite provisions of the Taiwan \nRelations Act and ended by stating that--\n\n       The Government of Taiwan should remain committed to the \n     peaceful resolution of its future relations with the People's \n     Republic of China by mutual decision.\n\n  Mr. President, the concurrent resolution the Senate passed last week \nwas responsible and was designed to make a constructive contribution to \nthe situation. Unfortunately, the China provisions of the conference \nreport are, in my view, not responsible and not constructive.\n  I will just go into detail on a couple of the most troublesome \nprovisions. Section 1601 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act now \npending would amend the Taiwan Relations Act to provide that the Act \nsupersedes the provisions of the 1982 Joint Communique issued under \nPresident Reagan.\n  Mr. President, if it is a matter of law, and it is, that the Taiwan \nRelations Act supersedes the communique, then that already happened \nwithout any declaration of the Senate. Less than a week after the \nSenate, without one dissenting vote, specifically pointed to the three \nUnited States-China Joint Communiques, this act, if it becomes law, \ncould be interpreted as nullifying the validity of one of those joint \ncommuniques.\n  Just to go into details of the 1982 Reagan Joint Communique, it \nstated in part that--\n\n       The Chinese Government reiterates that the question of \n     Taiwan is China's internal affair. The message to compatriots \n     in Taiwan, issued by China on January 1, 1979, promulgated \n     a fundamental policy of striving for peaceful \n     reunification of the motherland. The Nine-Point Proposal \n     put forward by China on September 30, 1981, represented a \n     further major effort under this fundamental policy to \n     strive for a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan question.\n\n  Then section 5:\n\n       The United States Government attaches great importance to \n     its relations with China, and reiterates that it has no \n     intention of infringing on Chinese sovereignty and \n     territorial integrity, or interfering in China's internal \n     affairs, or pursuing a policy of ``two Chinas'' or ``one \n     China, one Taiwan.''\n\n  Then section 6:\n\n       Having in mind the foregoing statements of both sides, the \n     United States Government states that it does not seek to \n     carry out a long-term policy of arms sales to Taiwan,\n\n[[Page S3140]]\n\n     that its arm sales to Taiwan will not exceed either in \n     qualitative or quantitative terms, the level of those \n     supplied in recent years since the establishment of \n     diplomatic relations between the United States and China, and \n     that it intends to reduce gradually the sales and arms to \n     Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a final resolution. \n     In so stating, the United States acknowledges China's \n     consistent position regarding the thorough settlement of this \n     issue.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe it is instructive and very important for the \nSenate, because this is an important vote--I do not know whether people \nare listening. I do not know whether people have studied this act. I do \nnot know whether people understand the far-reaching implications of \nthis, but this is one of the most important votes we will make this \nyear.\n  I believe it is instructive, particularly for colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle, to note that President Reagan issued a \nstatement in conjunction with the 1982 Joint Communique, which was \nprepared by the Reagan administration.\n  In that statement President Reagan stated that--I am quoting--\n\n       Regarding future U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, our policy, set \n     forth clearly in the communique, is fully consistent with the \n     Taiwan Relations Act.\n\n  Mr. President, if President Reagan was right in that carefully \ncrafted statement--this was not a speech off the cuff or a remark he \nmade on television or anything of that nature. This was a very \ncarefully crafted statement by President Reagan in 1982, that went \nalong with the communique with China.\n  Again, I want to point out the most important sentence that he said \nin that statement that relates to this act tonight. He states:\n\n       Regarding future U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, our policy, set \n     forth clearly in the communique, is fully consistent with the \n     Taiwan Relations Act.\n\n  Mr. President, the pending legislation strongly implies that \nPresident Reagan was wrong in this carefully crafted statement in 1982. \nIf the Taiwan Relations Act is inconsistent with the 1982 Joint \nCommunique, President Reagan was wrong, and this act would be viewed as \ncreating a new interpretation of United States-China policy.\n  Make no mistake about it: If President Reagan was right in his \nstatement, then there is absolutely no need for this act to refer to \nany kind of superseding of the joint communique--if he was correct. If \nhe was wrong, all these years under both President Reagan, President \nBush and under President Clinton, then we have had a communique which \nthe State Department, our policy, our three Presidents, have felt was \nconsistent with the Taiwan Relations Act and which we have been \nfollowing regarding arm sales and so forth, that, in effect, is now \nbeing implicitly overruled.\n  Do we really want to implicitly take a step tonight that could be \nviewed and certainly will be viewed by China and by others in the world \nas creating a new interpretation of United States-China policy by law? \nAre we prepared to do that? That is what this legislation does. If that \nis what the Senate wants to do tonight, people can go right ahead and \nvote for it. It will pass, and the President will have to decide what \nto do.\n  I do not believe the Senate of the United States is focused on this, \nand I do not believe my colleagues thoroughly understand the very \nprofound implications of this, in effect, declaration, or implied \ndeclaration, that the Taiwan Relations Act is inconsistent with \nPresident Reagan's joint communique with China of 1992.\n  To continue quoting President Reagan in the statement he made after \nthe joint communique, not part of the joint communique: ``Arms sales \nwill continue in accordance with the Act and with the full expectation \nthat the approach of the Chinese Government to the resolution of the \nTaiwan issue will continue to be peaceful.''\n  Do we want to implicitly overrule that sentence? Do we want to \nimplicitly overrule the first sentence that I have already read twice, \nbut will read again, ``Regarding future United States arms sales to \nTaiwan, our policy, set forth clear in the communique, is fully \nconsistent with the Taiwan Relations Act''? Which of those sentences do \nwe want to implicitly state has been superseded by the Taiwan Relations \nAct?\n  ``Arms sales will continue in accordance with the Act and with the \nfull expectation that the approach of the Chinese Government to the \nresolution of the Taiwan issue will continue to be peaceful.'' Is that \nstatement wrong? Is the first statement wrong? That seems to be what we \nare saying.\n  ``We attach great significance,'' again, President Reagan's \nstatement, ``We attach great significance to the Chinese statement in \nthe communique regarding China's `fundamental' policy; and it is clear \nfrom our statements that our future actions will be conducted with this \npeaceful policy fully in mind.''\n  Continuing from President Reagan, ``The position of the United States \nGovernment has always been clear and consistent in this regard. The \nTaiwan question is a matter for the Chinese people, on both sides of \nthe Taiwan Strait to resolve. We will not interfere in this matter or \nprejudice the free choice of, or put pressure on, the people of Taiwan \nin this matter. At the same time, we have an abiding interest and \nconcern that any resolution be peaceful. I shall never waiver from this \nfundamental position.''\n  Mr. President, this legislation, in effect, says that President \nReagan did not know what he was doing when he made that statement, that \nthe Taiwan Relations Act itself superseded the joint communique, \nbecause it was inconsistent with it. There is no reason for it to \nsupersede the joint communique unless there is an inconsistency. If \nthere is no inconsistency, there is no reason to say it supersedes it, \nbecause the consistent joint communique would not be overruled by a \nconsistent United States law, which the Taiwan Relations Act is--it is \nlaw. There is no doubt about that.\n  President Reagan made it clear in his Presidential statement that the \nreduction in arms sales to Taiwan is based upon the premise, as \nexpressed in the joint communique, that the Taiwan question will be \nsettled peacefully.\n  Mr. President, China believes that Taiwan has acted in ways that are \ninconsistent with the one-China policy. No question but that is what \nChina believes and is the basis of a lot of their action. Taiwan \ncontends it does not seek independence. President Li has said that. \nPresident Li has also restated his desire for peaceful reunification \nwith the mainland.\n\n  China, in my view, has greatly overreacted to its perceptions by \nconducting missile launches and military exercises which I believe are \ninconsistent with the other fundamental principle of settling the \nTaiwan question peacefully. I happen to believe that what China has \ndone in recent weeks is counterproductive to its own purpose, which is, \nas stated, eventual peaceful reunification.\n  The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 was enacted at the time of the \nestablishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and \nChina, a diplomatic act which established the principle of one China. \nThe Taiwan Relations Act was needed to create a foundation for dealing \nwith Taiwan in the aftermath of the end of diplomatic relations with \nthe Republic of China. It did not, nor did it need to, refer to the \none-China principle, because it focused instead on ensuring that the \nTaiwan question was settled peacefully by ensuring that Taiwan had the \nmeans to defend itself.\n  Enactment of section 1601 of this act pending before us now, which is \nthe pending conference report, could be interpreted--and I say would be \ninterpreted by many--to say that the Taiwan Relations Act is \ninconsistent and even supersedes the principle of one China. I do not \nbelieve that is what the authors intended to do here. Perhaps they can \nclarify that.\n  I am fearful that a number of people in the world, including China \nitself, could very well interpret this legislation as superseding the \nprinciple of one China. This is a complex, complicated area where words \nreally do matter. I think we should be very careful this evening.\n  Mr. President, I believe China's provocative military actions have \nbeen dangerous and counterproductive to China's interest and certainly \nto the interest of stability in that area of the world. I believe that \nChina has greatly overreacted on the subject of Taiwan. The enactment \nof this conference report will make the situation worse because it \nwould undercut one of the two\n\n[[Page S3141]]\n\nmain principles of our relationship with China and could give the \nChinese--probably would give the Chinese--the impression that the \nUnited States was no longer willing to live up to its commitments as \nset out in the three joint communiques by President Nixon, President \nCarter, and President Reagan, and followed by the other Presidents, \nincluding President Bush and President Clinton.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation, if it passed and became \nlaw, would be a very, very serious mistake, one of the most profound \nmistakes this Congress has made and probably any Congress has made in \nrecent years. I think it would take our troubled relations with China \nand turn them into a real downward spiral of additional trouble.\n  Mr. President, I also would like to call the Senate's attention to \nsection 1702 of the act, the Declaration of Congress Regarding U.S. \nGovernment Human Rights Policy Toward China. Within this section, it is \nexpressed in the sense of the Congress that ``The President should \ndecline the invitation to visit China until and unless there is a \ndramatic overall progress on human rights in China and Tibet and \ncommunicate to the Government of China that such a visit cannot take \nplace without such progress.''\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what we have done in this country \nunder two Presidents, President Bush and President Clinton, for the \nlast 7 years. It does not appear to be working very well. This is \nbasically a freezing, if we took the sense of the Congress seriously--\nif the President did--a freezing of the status quo.\n  Mr. President, while I believe it is counterproductive to our own \ngoals to make human rights in China the centerpiece and the be-all and \nend-all of United States-Chinese relations, I do not think we further \nour goals when we do that, including our human rights goals. The United \nStates has a strong interest in seeing respect for human rights improve \nin China and, indeed, all over the world. The enactment of this \nprovision or any provision similar to it would run counter to the very \nactions the United States must take in order to address and help \nconstructively resolve the differences between the United States and \nChina, including, but not limited to, progress on human rights.\n  Mr. President, I think a lot of people forget that the United States \nhas 38,000 troops in Korea. We have the most isolated regime in the \nworld, North Korea, that is not only on a quest--or has been up until \nthe last year--to become a nuclear power, but also has, according to \nreports, increasing problems with starvation, including predictions by \nmost organizations that the problems are going to get worse in the next \n3 or 4 months.\n  Mr. President, one of the things that people do not recognize is that \nChina has been very, very constructive in terms of the United States' \nposition on the Korean Peninsula, both in terms of encouraging North \nKorea to behave in the nuclear area and also encouraging the parties \nthere to resolve their differences with dialogue and without a war.\n  This is a dangerous situation in Korea. We have 38,000 troops there. \nIn our relationship with China, we appear to forget altogether about \nthe connection between China and the situation in Korea.\n  I do not see how we can do that and keep our minds on our duty to our \nown military forces that are stationed there. But it seems to be \ncompletely ignored in all of our debates about China. I would say, on \nthe one side, people on the left seem to believe that, in China, 10 \ndissidents is on the same level, at least, with the whole United States \nquestion on the Korean Peninsula. People on the right seem to believe \nthat we can take positions that basically unravel, or at least \nimplicitly unravel, communiques entered into by Presidents Reagan, \nCarter, and Nixon, and we can do that with impunity, and we can forget \nany relationship between what we do vis-a-vis China in terms of keeping \nour agreements, and what they may do regarding helping us resolve the \nKorean situation peacefully.\n  There are a lot of other mutual interests we have with China, but \nthey get lost in this atmosphere. Perhaps they will continue to get \nlost until we have the kind of high-level dialogue between the \nPresident of the United States and the President of China, and between \nour Secretary of State and their Foreign Minister, that can begin to \ntalk about mutual interests and resolve the differences, which are \ndifferences of considerable importance, within the framework of working \nas partners with mutual interests. That is not possible in the current \natmosphere.\n  But what this bill says is that we should place human rights in China \nand in Tibet above anything else. The Korean Peninsula, the nuclear \nquest for arms in Korea, the 38,000 American troops that are in Korea, \nthe stability of Northeast Asia, and even Taiwan-China relations. We \nare saying--if you take this seriously--that the President should not \nhave any kind of visit to China until they act, in American terms, \nacceptably on human rights both in China and Tibet.\n  Mr. President, on human rights, I think the United States is unique. \nBut we will really be unique if we take this resolution seriously, \nbecause we would be the only country in the world that takes that \nposition. Not a single ally--not one--has taken the position that their \nhead of State should not visit China. That is what we are saying here--\nthat the President should not visit China.\n  Mr. President, maybe we do not take these sense-of-the-Congress \nresolutions seriously. They are not law, and would not be binding the \nPresident. If we do not take them seriously and they are not important, \nhow do we expect anybody else to take them seriously? Unfortunately, \nwhen we put resolutions like this in the bill, the only people that \ntake them seriously are the people they affect adversely. And they \nreact adversely. So I do not know what we are really trying to say \nhere. But I know it is counterproductive. It would postpone, if not \npreclude, efforts to establish a much-needed strategic dialogue between \nthe United States and China. Clearly, the dialog with China is more \nimportant than ever at this time-- unless we really want to go into a \nperiod of years of cold war and dangers of something far worse than \ncold war, in that part of the world.\n  For the strategic dialogue between the United States and China to be \nsuccessful in working to resolve our differences, participation is \nrequired on the highest levels of leadership. That means the President \nof the United States has an active role to play, whether it be \nPresident Clinton or President Dole in 1997. How soon this resolution \nwould apply to ``President'' Dole, saying to him, ``You should not have \nany Presidential visit or dialog with China until they meet our terms \non human rights''--I really have a hard time believing that we are \nserious about saying this.\n  So whichever President is elected in 1996, that is what this \nresolution is saying. This is indefinite. This resolution says we do \nnot think you should ever visit China until you have resolved the human \nrights questions in China and Tibet to our satisfaction.\n  Mr. President, we have not treated any other country in the world \nthis way. We do not treat Russia that way right now. We expect the \nPresident of the United States to meet with President Yeltsin, but most \nof us deplore what is happening in Chechnya, the continued killing of a \ntremendous number of innocent people there. We do not say to the \nPresident, ``Do not visit Russia.''\n\n  Mr. President, people forget that we are very proud of what Taiwan \nhas done. Taiwan had an election under very serious pressure. We are \nproud of their economic progress. All of us have very close friends in \nTaiwan. These are some of the most productive, energetic people in the \nworld. And this country is always going to have a very friendly \nrelationship with the people in Taiwan.\n  We were very patient with Taiwan. They were not a democracy, in our \nsense of the word, for years and years. We are celebrating democracy \nnow. For 35 years, we supported Taiwan when they were not a democracy. \nWe have had the same thing with the South Koreans. We celebrate what is \nhappening in South Korea now, with the democratic election of a \nPresident. We went for years and years and years, where we spent \nliterally billions of dollars helping defend South Korea when they did \nnot meet our definition of human rights. It is only in recent years \nthat they have. And now we single out China and say, ``We do not want \nour\n\n[[Page S3142]]\n\nPresident talking to you, or visiting you, or having any dialogue with \nyou, until you meet our definition of human rights.''\n  I really do not believe the Senate of the United States wants to say \nthis tonight. That is what we will say if we pass this resolution.\n  Mr. President, 7 years have passed since an American President, or \nVice President, has journeyed to Beijing, or the President, or premier, \nof China has been in Washington. This provision would say to the \nPresident: ``please do not change this situation. This is a great \npolicy. It is really working.'' Well, is it working? Does anybody think \nthat helped our relations? I think this is a fundamental error that \nwould be damaging to United States-China relations and United States \nforeign policy.\n  This conference report's provisions attempt to deal with differences \nwith China by prohibiting initiatives and efforts that would help \nresolve the very differences that we are frustrated about.\n  Quoting from a speech I gave on China about 3 weeks ago:\n\n       Not only must our expectations be realistic, but we cannot \n     wait to engage extensively with China until it has become \n     more like us. . . . We must engage with China and its current \n     leaders now. . . . China's transition and its potential \n     impels America, insofar as possible, to be actors on the \n     scene.\n\n  Mr. President, China is determined to preserve the areas it considers \npart of China, including Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and Tibet. Passage \nof this legislation will inevitably cause China to harden its position. \nWe should not make miscalculations regarding this.\n  From the Chinese perspective, Tibet, like Taiwan, is considered to be \nan issue of sovereignty to be resolved internally by China and Tibet. \nIn the Foreign Relations Authorization Act pending before us, it is \nexpressed as the sense of Congress that ``Tibet * * * is an occupied \ncountry under the established principles of international law.'' That \nis what we are saying in this bill.\n  Mr. President, as a matter of fact, longstanding United States policy \nis that Tibet is part of China. That is not a new policy by the Clinton \nadministration. We have had that policy through a number of \nadministrations. This is also shared by every member of the United \nNations. Even the Dalai Lama does not go as far as this conference \nreport. What are we doing? What are we doing? Do we know?\n  Mr. President, I view with concern section 1303 of the act, which \nadvocates establishing a special envoy for Tibet. That is what we are \nvoting on. This provision would have the United States establish a \nlevel of official relations with Tibet--if you take it seriously--that \nundermines our longstanding, established Tibetan policy. More \nimportant, this provision would weaken our ability to influence Chinese \npolicies in Tibet and would greatly weaken our influence to protect the \npeople in Tibet from abuses, which we all know have occurred.\n  My specific concerns are as follows: The proposed duties of the \nspecial envoy would duplicate and, I believe, greatly undercut \nresponsibilities already being discharged by the United States State \nDepartment--that is, promoting dialog between the Dalai Lama and the \nChinese Government concerning the religious and cultural integrity of \nTibet and discussing the human rights problems in Tibet with Chinese \nGovernment officials.\n  The President has already appointed, the Senate has confirmed, and \nthe Chinese Government has accepted an envoy to all of China--and that \nis the United States Ambassador, resident in Beijing--our former \ncolleague, Ambassador Sasser.\n  The Chinese Government, in my view, would refuse to accept a special \nenvoy for Tibet, and would in all likelihood make regular travel to \nTibet impossible for United States diplomats.\n  Is that what we want? Do we want to imply that Tibet is separate from \nChina, and do we want to have a separate United States envoy, and \nprobably in all likelihood result in virtually cutting off access of \nthe United States to Tibet? Is that what we want? Because that is what \nwe are voting on.\n  Mr. President, this provision in my view would be counterproductive \nto its intended purpose. I am sure the purpose of the provision is to \nhelp the people of Tibet. My view is that it would be totally \ncounterproductive to that end. The United States can maintain and \npromote good relations between the Dalai Lama and his representatives. \nWe can promote the need for substantive negotiations to take place \nbetween the Dalai Lama, or his representatives, and senior members of \nthe Government of China. We can coordinate United States Government \npolicies, programs, and projects concerning Tibet, and we can carry out \nany other actions the President deems necessary with regard to Tibet \nwithout the need to establish a special envoy in the process.\n  The United States cannot solve the question of Tibet on the floor of \nthis Congress. Only the people in Tibet and the people all over China, \nincluding Tibet, can resolve their differences. A special envoy could \nneither contribute to this dialogue nor foster a solution, but is \nlikely to be totally counterproductive.\n  I will close by making just one additional observation on another \nprovision, without getting into detail. Some of my other colleagues \nhave already spoken on this. Section 1708 of the pending authorization \nbill states that ``the President of Taiwan should be admitted to the \nUnited States for a visit in 1996 with all appropriate courtesies.'' \nMr. President, this provision, to say the least, is unwise at this \npoint in time--unless we want to deploy our aircraft carriers, several \nof them, to the region, and spend a great deal of the next several \nyears in the Taiwan Strait.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Maurice \nHutchinson, legislative fellow of my staff, be admitted privileges of \nthe floor during the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. NUNN. Does anyone else have time at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 52 minutes, \nand the Senator from North Carolina has 37 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNN. I yield to the former chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and ranking Democrat, Mr. Pell, whatever time he desires.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to support this conference \nreport on H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal \nyears 1996 and 1997. I recognize that House and Senate Republican \nconferees have attempted to find a middle-ground between the respective \nbills passed by each House and that this conference report is an \nimprovement over the House-passed bill. Although there are some \nprovisions in the bill that I support, I believe the bill is \nfundamentally flawed in four areas--reorganization of the foreign \naffairs agencies, funding for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \nand for our contributions to the United Nation, and American policy \ntoward China.\n  This bill requires the President to abolish one of the foreign \naffairs agencies--AID, USIA, or CDA. There is no doubt that this is an \nimprovement over the original language in the House bill, which \nmandated the abolishment of all three of these agencies. However, this \nconference report falls far short of the Senate bill, which sought to \nforce consolidation through savings rather than the mandatory abolition \nof agencies. The Senate bill preserved the President's constitutional \nright to determine how to organize those agencies which carry out the \nforeign policy directives of the President of the United States. The \nconference report takes that away. I cannot support a bill which \ncrosses this line and abolishes an important foreign affairs agency \nsimply for the sake of abolishment. On an issue such as this I feel it \nis important for the Congress to acknowledge the prerogative of the \nPresident to organize the foreign affairs agencies in a manner which \nbest serves the nation's interests and the President's foreign policy \npriorities.\n  As a strong supporter of ACDA and its mission, I am deeply disturbed \nby the inadequate funding levels for ACDA in this bill. The fiscal year \n1996 authorization of $35.7 million represents a 28\n\n[[Page S3143]]\n\npercent reduction from the fiscal year 1995 level. The fiscal year 1997 \nauthorization of $28 million is not only a 44 percent reduction from \nthe fiscal year 1995 level, but cuts ACDA so deeply that it can no \nlonger carry out its core missions, such as being our watchdog on \nproliferation, verifying arms control agreements, and monitoring \ncompliance with new agreements. This is a foolish and costly approach \nat a time when our needs in the area of arms control are increasing, \nnot decreasing.\n  The conference report also fails to authorize the necessary funds for \nthe United States to pay assessed contributions to the United Nations \nand its related agencies. I agree that we need to do all that we can to \nforce the United Nations to adopt serious management and financial \nreforms but failing to meet our treaty obligations is not the way to \nachieve this goal. It simply diminishes our influence and encourages \nother nations to take the same, ill-advised approach.\n  Finally, section 1601 of the conference report amends the Taiwan \nRelations Act [TRA] of 1979, to say that the provisions of the Act \nrelating to arms sales to Taiwan supersede any provision of the joint \ncommunique, signed between the United States and China in 1982, \nlimiting such arm sales. I believe this provision was added out of \ngenuine concern for the people of Taiwan, a concern I share. But I also \nbelieve that this is the wrong approach to Taiwan's security problem \nand the wrong time to take it.\n  Our relationship with the People's Republic of China is at one of its \nlowest points in history, certainly the lowest point since the \nTiananmen massacre. We have major disputes with the Chinese on a number \nof serious issues, ranging from trade to human rights to proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction. While we will not back away from any of \nthese issues, it is important that both governments act prudently and \nnot unnecessarily damage the relationship further. But this bill does \nthe opposite, by undercutting the basis for United States-Chinese \nrelations. Section 1601 constitutes a unilateral revision of one of the \ncornerstones of the bilateral relationship. Adopting a measure like \nthis would certainly cause a backlash from Beijing, by playing into the \nhands of hard liners in the Chinese leadership and aiding them in their \nattempt to promote an anti-Western, anti-United States agenda.\n  I also think this approach is likely to fail in its fundamental \npurpose of advancing Taiwan's security. For almost 3 weeks, we saw \ntensions rise in the Taiwan Strait as China tested M-9 missiles and \nheld massive military exercises in an attempt to intimidate a Taipei it \nfears is heading toward a declaration of independence, aided by foreign \npowers. Just this week, after Taiwan's historic presidential election \non Saturday, we are seeing some initial positive signs that both \ngovernments are reaching out to each other in order to move back toward \na more stable relationship. A reversal of U.S. arms sales policy at \nthis time would certainly hamper those efforts. It is very much in \nTaiwan's security interest that all three capitals work to defuse \ntensions, not inflame them. Section 1601 would further damage already \nstrained relations with Beijing and likely endanger, rather than \nstrengthen Taiwan. It is the wrong policy at the wrong time.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I intend to vote against this \nconference report. The President has indicated that he will veto this \nbill over the issues I have discussed as well as some others, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the administration's statement to that effect be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Statement of Administration Policy H.R. 1561--Foreign Relations \n                       Revitalization Act of 1995\n\n       If the conference report on H.R. 1561 is presented to the \n     President in its current form, the President will veto the \n     bill. While steps have been taken to improve the bill, it \n     still contains numerous provisions which do not serve U.S. \n     foreign policy or U.S. national interests.\n       The principal reasons for the veto are:\n       Forced Consolidated of Agencies. The legislation interferes \n     with the President's prerogatives to organize the foreign \n     affairs agencies in a manner that best serves the Nation's \n     interests and the Administration's foreign policy priorities. \n     This bill mandates the abolition of at least one foreign \n     affairs agency, and includes authorization levels that would \n     force other organizations to retreat further from engagement \n     in world affairs. The Administration has already implemented \n     significant reinvention of and reductions in international \n     programs and is working towards further streamlining and \n     reorganization. H.R. 1561 fails to provide, however, the \n     necessary flexibility for the Administration to manage the \n     agencies that implement foreign policy, which is essential to \n     United States leadership.\n       Authorization of Appropriations. The authorization levels \n     included in the bill for FYs 1996 and 1997, which constitute \n     ceilings on appropriations, are below the levels necessary to \n     conduct the President's foreign policy and to maintain U.S. \n     interests overseas in such areas as operating overseas posts \n     of foreign affairs agencies, arms control and \n     nonproliferation, international organizations and \n     peacekeeping, public diplomacy, and sustainable development. \n     In addition, these levels would cause reduction-in-force \n     (RIFs) of highly skilled personnel at several foreign affairs \n     agencies.\n       Taiwan Relations Act. Section 1601 amends the Taiwan \n     Relations Act to state that the Act supersedes the provisions \n     of the 1982 Joint Communique between the United States and \n     China. This would be seen as a repudiation of a critical and \n     stabilizing element of long-standing U.S. policy towards \n     China, increasing risks at a time of heightened tensions.\n       Relations with Vietnam. Section 1214, concerning the use of \n     funds to further normalize relations with Vietnam, unduly \n     restricts the President's ability to pursue national \n     interests in Vietnam, and in particular could threaten the \n     progress that has been made on POW/MIA issues and put U.S. \n     firms at a competitive disadvantage. Legislation which \n     restricts the opening of missions also raises constitutional \n     concerns.\n       U.S. Participation in International Organizations. \n     Provisions related to U.S. participation in the United \n     Nations, which provide inadequate funding levels for FYs 1996 \n     and 1997, and unworkable notification requirements would \n     undermine U.S. diplomatic efforts to reform the U.N. and to \n     reduce the assessed U.S. share of the U.N. budget. \n     Furthermore, the provisions could interfere with ongoing \n     Executive-Legislative Branch discussions aimed at achieving a \n     consensus on UN funding and reform issues.\n       Housing Guaranty Program. Section 1111 would terminate \n     several worthwhile country program, such as those in Eastern \n     Europe and would eliminate any future programs, including \n     those for South Africa. Additionally, this provision could \n     inadvertently cause the cut-off of development assistance to \n     many of the poorest countries of the world, as well as the \n     cut-off of Economic Support Fund (ESF) anti-crime and \n     narcotics-related assistance.\n       Family Planning. The conference report fails to remedy the \n     severe limitations on U.S. population assistance programs \n     placed in the FY 1996 foreign operations appropriations \n     legislation. These restrictions will have a major, \n     deleterious impact on women and families in the development \n     world. It is estimated that nearly 7 million couples in \n     developing countries, will have no access to safe, voluntary \n     family planning services. The result will be millions of \n     unwanted pregnancies and abortions.\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have two comments I would like to make. I \nfirst would like to respond very briefly to a speech earlier in the day \nmade by one of my colleagues before I discuss the foreign relations \nauthorization bill pending before the Senate. I would like to address \nbriefly the earlier comments of my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, regarding the President's involvement in \nresolving our trade impasse with Russia. The distinguished Senator \nsuggests that it was inappropriate for the President to impress upon \nMr. Yeltsin that the poultry industry is important to Mr. Clinton's \nhome State, as well as to many other parts of America; I must say \nforthrightly, the single most important industry in my State.\n  Since Russia announced over a month ago that it was banning the \nimport of all American poultry, I have been in daily contact with the \nWhite House, our Trade Ambassador Mickey Kantor, and our Agriculture \nSecretary Dan Glickman, to keep this $500 million market open to \nAmerican poultry growers.\n  Fortunately, the hard work of the administration has paid off. Just \nthis week the Russians announced that they are backing down. This would \nnot, in my view, have been possible without the direct involvement of \nthe President, the Vice President, Ambassador Kantor and Secretary \nGlickman.\n  Since 1982, Sussex County, one of our counties in Delaware, has \nremained the No. 1 broiler-producing county in the United States of \nAmerica. The Delmarva peninsula is home to 21,000 poultry workers, and \nproduces more than 600 million birds per year. It is a major supplier \nof the Russian poultry market.\n  Last year, for example, one major Delaware producer exported 1,300 \ntons of frozen poultry to Russia. Another exported $10 million worth of \npoultry products.\n  Those of us who understand this industry know that it is under \nincreasing competitive pressure as grain prices soar and the price of \nother meats fall. But, they know how to prosper in a competitive \nenvironment. That is why we can ship higher quality poultry to Moscow \nand Saint Petersburg and still beat their prices. In turn, it is the \nresponsibility of this and, I believe, every administration to maintain \nthe open international markets that they need, not only for American \npoultry but for all American products. Keep in mind that Russia's \nmarket was closed as recently as 1991. Now, Russia purchases $500 \nmillion worth of poultry every year, and the market has been growing. \nThis is just one of the many products they purchase.\n  This has been a real success story for American exports. Of American \nexports, the agricultural community is the only real success story in \nAmerican exports of continuing, year-in-and-year-out consequence.\n  I, for one, think it is perfectly appropriate, as a matter of fact \nabsolutely necessary, for the President of the United States, in this \ncase President Clinton, to let President Yeltsin know just how \nimportant these exports are. I cannot think of any better way for a \nPresident to drive the point home than to make this issue personal.\n  I wanted very much for the President to successfully resolve this \nproblem of the poultry industry. As any negotiator on the floor of this \nSenate understands, the one way in which, on a close call, we all \nappeal to our colleagues ultimately is we say: This is personal to me. \nThis is personal to me.\n  Mr. Yeltsin is a politician. Every world leader is a politician. \nPoliticians in international relations react no differently than \npoliticians on the Senate floor.\n  I think it was perfectly appropriate and necessary for the President \nto use everything in his arsenal to convince the Russians not to \nviolate international trade agreements with regard to poultry or \nanything else.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the people who disagree with the \nPresident acknowledge he is a master communicator. You can bet Yeltsin \ngot the message.\n  So let us keep the big picture in mind and not get hung up on \nquestions of style. The results, which are keeping 500 million dollars' \nworth of export markets open, speak for themselves. I think this is an \nimportant achievement on President Clinton's part and an important \ninternational trade issue. Had he failed, it would have set the \nprecedent for significant trade consequences for the United States, and \nnot just in poultry. I think most Americans, regardless of political \nparty, feel the President did the right thing. I know I think he did \nthe right thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3144-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3144-S3146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AGAINST BACKDOOR ISOLATIONISM\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would now like to register my strong \nopposition to the question we are about to vote on, the conference \nreport on H.R. 1561, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  In spite of some modifications, this report still, in my view, \nsuffers from the fatal flaws that afflicted the Senate bill which we \nvoted upon in December and I voted against.\n  This conference report would abolish three agencies that continue to \nserve the interests of the American people: The Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency, the U.S. Information Agency, and the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development.\n  While unwisely folding these agencies into the Department of State, \nit would severely cut funding for diplomatic activities, thereby \nfurther undermining our ability to carry out a coherent foreign policy.\n  The report also includes a sadly inadequate sum for foreign \nassistance, contains language that would be extremely damaging to POW/\nMIA identification in Vietnam, unwisely tampers with the 1982 joint \ncommunique with China, and generally attempts to give the impression \nthat it is an internationalist piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, the intent and impact of this legislation is not \ninternationalist at all. No, the report is, in fact, yet another \nattempt at backdoor isolationism, in my view.\n  The legislation has its genesis in a deeply flawed ideological belief \nthat no matter what the objective facts are, less Government tomorrow \nis better than whatever level of Government we have today. Following \nthis simplistic logic, we have three independent agencies today so let \nus have two, or one, or even none tomorrow.\n  Never mind that all three agencies--ACDA, USIA, and AID--have all \nmade significant strides in restructuring their activities and saving \nlarge sums of money and large sums of taxpayer dollars on their own \naccord.\n  Never mind that the missions of all three of these agencies are even \nmore important today than they were during the cold war.\n  Less is more, so hack away. If this act were anything more than a \nnumbers game, it would not blithely give the President a waiver \nauthority to save up to any two agencies of his choice. It is like \npicking draft choices. I will trade you one and you pick any two you \nwant.\n  It has nothing to do with anything other than the notion that less is \nbetter. For, if it were otherwise, we would say, ``Mr. President, you \nmust deal specifically with this agency or that agency.'' This, \nhowever, is like giving up future draft choices.\n  The legislation appears at first glance to have been crafted in \nblissful ignorance, both of what has been going on in our foreign \npolicy apparatus for years and what it takes to conduct American \nforeign policy around the globe today.\n  How else could one explain ignoring ACDA's increasingly critical \nwatchdog role in nuclear nonproliferation. It does not matter that the \ncold war is over. We now face the danger of nuclear weapons in the \nhands of several new countries, including rogue States like Iran and \nLibya.\n  Moreover, terrorist groups threaten to get ahold of nuclear material \nfor the purpose of blackmailing entire cities and potentially nations. \nNow, more than ever, we need the proven expertise and independent \njudgment of ACDA.\n  Can we really believe that the drafters of this legislation are \nunaware of USIA's technologically sophisticated\n\n[[Page S3145]]\n\nefforts to bring America's message to the world? Do they also not know \nthat American public affairs officers are often our embassies' most \nproactive diplomats? Can they not see that merging them into a large \nbureaucracy would inevitably smother their creativity?\n  Mr. President, is it credible to believe that the innovative public-\nprivate enterprise funds that USAID has pioneered in Central and \nEastern Europe have escaped the notice of the sponsors of this \nlegislation? Do they really not comprehend that development aid is a \ncost-effective way to head off crises around the world?\n  No, I think the answer to all these questions is clear: Less is more, \nso let us slash, let us slash.\n  It is bad enough that absorbing these agencies would rob them of \ntheir independence that has served this Nation so well for decades. \nBut, Mr. President, this legislation adds insult to injury by denying \nthe State Department the necessary funding to adequately carry out the \nnew functions it will now inherit, along with its current duties as the \nprincipal vehicle for the carrying out of U.S. foreign policy.\n  The sponsors of this legislation would have us believe that a \nprofligate and bloated bureaucracy needs to be cut down to size. In my \nview, nothing can be further from the truth.\n  The international affairs budget is now 45 percent lower than it was \nin 1984.\n  Altogether, it represents only 1.3 percent of Federal spending.\n  Over the past 3 years alone, the State Department's budget has been \ncut in real terms by 15 percent, at the same time the Department's \nresponsibilities have been increased with the birth of many new \ncountries out of the wreckage of the Soviet Union.\n  We see what is happening in Bosnia. We know what is happening in all \nthe former Soviet republics, and it makes sense for us not to have a \npresence there? It makes sense for us not to be involved? It makes \nsense for us to close embassies? It makes sense for us not to open \nconsulates?\n  I cannot believe that is what is motivating this legislation. It is \nsimply this notion that we should cut and slash.\n  Forced to respond to these fiscal stringencies, the State Department \nhas taken some very painful measures:\n  It has cut its total work force by 1,700 persons.\n  It has downsized the Senior Foreign Service by almost one-fifth, and, \nin my opinion, this measure is a thoughtless waste of a national \nresource.\n  It had to cancel, for example, the 1995 and 1996 Foreign Service \nexaminations--in effect, a tragic waste of a future national resource, \nnamely, the best and the brightest college and university graduates who \nwill be unable to join our diplomatic corps and serve this Nation.\n  It has cut its administrative expenses by nearly $100 million. Anyone \nvisiting an American embassy abroad has seen our highly trained \nprofessionals doubling- and even tripling-up in cramped office space, \neven as they routinely work 12 hours a day or more.\n  Yet, Mr. President, some politicians see fit to use the Foreign \nService and other agencies as whipping boys in an attempt to fuel this \nmindless anti-Government feeling that afflicts some of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I regret to say that last summer, one of our colleagues and a good \nfriend of mine castigated American diplomats for allegedly working in \n``marble palaces'' and ``renting long coats and high hats'' only a few \nweeks after Bob Frasure, Joe Kruzel, and Nelson Drew were killed on the \nMt. Igman Road above Sarajevo--working not in a marble palace, but in \nan armored personnel carrier, and wearing fatigues, not long coats and \nhigh hats.\n  Finally, the State Department has been forced to close a string of \ndiplomatic posts, thereby severely hampering our ability to carry out \npolitical, economic and cultural diplomacy in an increasingly \ncompetitive world.\n  I come from a State where there are a number of multinational \ncorporations. They have historically--not solely, but in part--had \naccess and information provided to them through economic and commercial \nofficers at our consulates and our embassies. Why are we closing them? \nIn the name of economy, in the name of the long-term future of American \neconomic growth? What is the reason?\n  From all this, any objective observer, in my view, can see that the \nforeign policy apparatus of the United States has already been pared \ndown to the bone.\n  What does this legislation do? After mandating that the State \nDepartment assume the functions of ACDA, USIA and AID, it calls for \nfurther budget cuts of $1.7 billion over the next 4 years.\n  I think this is a shell game which ends with nothing left under any \none of the shells.\n  In effect, this legislation will also cripple our ability to head off \ncrises around the world through diplomacy that this President and \nfuture Presidents of the United States will be faced with the stark \nchoice of either doing nothing or sending in the military.\n  Let me make a truly radical suggestion, Mr. President. This year we \ngave the Pentagon $7 billion more than it asked for. I have \nconsistently supported keeping the U.S. military the strongest military \nin the world, and I continue to do so.\n  But why not give the Pentagon only $5 billion more than it asked for \nand transfer the remaining $2 billion to the international affairs \nbudget, keep the three agencies functioning, and enable this country to \nget back into the big leagues of international diplomacy?\n  Unfortunately, with our backdoor isolationists in control of this \nCongress, this perfectly sensible suggestion, I believe, is totally \nimpossible.\n  No, Mr. President, this conference report is a triumph of \nideologically driven romanticism. It speaks to an earlier, simpler age.\n  Unfortunately, though, we are approaching the turn of the 21st \ncentury. The world is ever more complex, not simple, and closing our \neyes will not make the complexity go away.\n  This bogus administrative reform, combined with purposefully punitive \nbudget cuts, is no more than backdoor isolationism, in my view.\n  This conference report ought to be titled ``The Smoot-Hawley Foreign \nPolicy Act of 1996.''\n  It is a blueprint for the affairs of an inward looking, minor nation, \nnot the world's only remaining superpower.\n  As you might guess, I will cast my vote against this backdoor \nisolationism, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do \nthe same.\n  This is not a time to turn inward. This is a time to look outward. \nThis is a time to claim our mantle, to engage in diplomacy, and to help \nshape a world that will make it safer and economically more viable for \nAmericans to live in.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the majority leader has suggested that in \norder to enable Senators to get home a few minutes earlier, that we \nstart the rollcall vote immediately, but to run it on for there to be \nplenty of time for Senators to arrive. So I make that unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays. I thought they \nhad already been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 1561. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to make reference to this, and \nwill ask for this to be printed in the Record. I notice with great \ninterest a full-page ad in the New York Times of March 26, 1996, and \nthe startling information here in dark type is ``Does Sex Turn You \noff?'' Then it goes on to say--this is published by Penthouse--entitled \n``The Facts of Life.''\n  It says:\n\n       It is a touchy subject. But an important one. Especially if \n     you're a marketer who wants to reach men. If you've never \n     experienced the satisfaction of advertising in Penthouse, \n     there are some facts you should know. Facts that help explain \n     why Penthouse is a savvy business decision, and why it \n     performs as well as it does. For starters, Penthouse's \n     efficiency far surpasses Playboy, GQ, Sports Illustrated and \n     Esquire. We also reach a higher concentration of 25 to 49 \n     year old men. And at newsstands, where a full purchase price \n     helps gauge a magazine's true value to readers, Penthouse's \n     sales are routinely on top.\n       What's more, study after study has found that the more \n     involved readers are with a magazine's editorial, the more \n     they're involved with its advertising. And no magazine's \n     readers are more involved than Penthouse's. The appeal and \n     leadership of Penthouse extends beyond print, however. On \n     site on the Internet --http://www.penthousemag.com--attracts \n     over 80,000 people daily--(not hits, people.) This not only \n     makes Penthouse one of the Internet's most popular sites, it \n     enables us to guarantee advertisers an audience of 2.4 \n     million people every month. This proposition is encouraging \n     more and more marketers to take advantage of both Penthouse \n     Magazine and Penthouse Internet. If you're an advertiser who \n     wants the special stimulation Penthouse offers, contact Ms. \n     Audrey Arnold, Publisher, at 212-702-6000.\n\n  And it says down here:\n\n       Penthouse, The Facts Of life.\n\n  Mr. President, when Congress considered the Communications Decency \nAct, commonly called the CDA, as part of the telecommunications bill, \nopponents of the Communications Decency Act raised all kinds of \nconcerns that passage of the Communications Decency Act would restrict \nfree speech of adults and end the commercial viability of the Internet.\n  Let me repeat that last part again: And end the commercial viability \nof the Internet.\n  The Washington Post in this regard printed an editorial that the Exon \nCommunications Decency Act would interfere with the matter of making \nmoney on the Internet.\n  I have only cited the article that appeared in a full-page ad in the \nNew York Times and intend to make these remarks tonight to thank the \nPenthouse magazine for printing that full-page ad, which is their \nright--pretty expensive but it is their right, and obviously they are a \npretty good free enterprise, money-making concern. But I think it \npoints out more than anything else how all of the opponents to the \nCommunications Decency Act are way off base.\n\n  The recent full-page ad in the New York Times both refutes and makes \nmeaningless the claims of the elimination of free speech of adults and \nthe end of commercial viability on the Internet. Penthouse Magazine, \nwhich until enactment of the Communications Decency Act, offered free \nadult fare to Internet users of any age, was one of the first purveyors \nof sexual material to take steps to comply with the new law. That law \nis clearly working and has already been instituted to create a great \nsuccess story.\n  Before our law was introduced and before it was passed, there was \nthunderous silence, thunderous silence, Mr. President, from both the \nindustry and those loud voices that are now hammering away at the \nCommunications Decency Act.\n  Published reports have indicated that Penthouse and Hustler Internet \nsites, referencing great numbers in the wording from the ad that I just \nread, and maybe some others now require, after passage of the act, a \ncard to access these offerings.\n  Like it or not, Mr. President, this is the type of electronic \npornography that is legal and constitutionally protected for adults. If \ntheir actions are as reported of requiring a credit card before you can \naccess this particular part of the Internet that is widely, widely used \naccording to Penthouse, if they have indeed instituted the procedure of \nhaving a credit card, then Penthouse and Hustler and their like appear \nto be in compliance with the new law, and I applaud them for that.\n  Adult material remains available then to adults but children are not \nprovided pornography. This is precisely what the Communications Decency \nAct was designed to do, and it is working. The fully anticipated court \nchallenge that is now underway apparently is not aware of this fact or \nit would be a defense on its face to some of the constitutional \nchallenges that are being made.\n  The fear that keeping pornography away from children on the Internet \nwould destroy this great medium and all of those charges that have been \nmade are erroneous, they are unfounded, and it is nonsense.\n  During the year the Communications Decency Act was fully debated, \nInternet use doubled, and Internet growth has continued since the \npassage of the bill. Already, AT, MCI, and several local telephone \ncompanies have announced plans to offer easy Internet access and the \nInternet is coming to help other media as well and will come as I \nunderstand it to cable and satellite television.\n  Penthouse boasts, as I have just read, that it attracts over 80,000 \npeople daily to its Internet site and an audience of 2.4 million each \nmonth. The ad's enthusiasm for the Internet is in keeping with the \nCommunications Decency Act. We know that great system called the \nInternet that provides information and help to a lot of people is not \nonly important but I simply say that the scare tactics that continue to \nbe used by the Communications Decency Act's opponents are not well \nfounded. It is not censorship, the word opponents of the Communications \nDecency Act throw around at will, to responsibly protect our children \nfrom pornography and, I might add, pedophiles.\n  The Communications Decency Act was fully debated, extensively \nnegotiated and carefully designed to strike\n\n[[Page S3147]]\n\nthe right balance between the protection of children and the growth of \nthis exciting and promising new technology. Revisionists like to paint \na picture of Congress rushing to judgment on computer technology \nespecially as it affects the spread of pornography. In my nearly 18 \nyears in the Senate, I have won passage of many pieces of legislation \ndealing with the most important issues of the day including bills \naffecting national security, law enforcement, transportation, safety \nand deficit reduction. No bill that I have worked on has had as much \nattention, discussion or debate as the Communications Decency Act. For \none full year, the Nation has talked about the Communications Decency \nAct. And that is good.\n  The hands-off crowd, though, have argued that protection of children \nwas exclusively and totally the responsibility of the parent. For \nfamilies to safely enjoy the benefits of the Internet, the family had \nto be there turning on the computer or turning it off, making sure that \nwhatever the child brought up on the screen was acceptable to them.\n  The Communications Decency Act does not lessen--and I emphasize \nagain, Mr. President, does not lessen--the need for parents to be \nvigilant, ever vigilant. But, by putting the law on the side of the \nfamilies and the children, the Communications Decency Act recognized, \nas our First Lady might say, ``It Takes A Village.''\n  I am also pleased that the President of the United States and the \nU.S. Department of Justice fully support the Communications Decency \nAct. I am delighted that the computer industry has been working to \ndevelop blocking software and parental control software as well. Before \nthe Communications Decency act was introduced, these products did not \nexist. But all the blocking software in the world should not absolve an \nadult from the responsibility for allowing the abuse or the corruption \nof a child. The Communications Decency Act holds those who attempt to \nharm children responsible for their acts.\n  To all of those who are worried, the Communications Decency Act is \nlaw, and the Internet, in the meantime, is doing just fine. They should \nbe applauding the article and ad that I read, published by Penthouse.\n  Adults still have access to their legal vices. But most important, \nchildren are steadily gaining protection when they travel on the \ninformation superhighway.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nPresident's counsel to me be printed in the Record, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, February 28, 1996.\n     Senator Jim Exon,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Exon: Thank you for your recent letter to the \n     President concerning the Telecommunications Reform Act of \n     1996. The President has asked me to respond on his behalf.\n       On February 8, 1996, the President was pleased to be able \n     to sign the historic Telecommunications Reform Act into law. \n     I know that the President was equally pleased that you were \n     able to participate in the event.\n       Your letter also referred to Title V of the \n     Telecommunications Reform Act, otherwise known as the \n     Communications Decency Act. As you know, the President is \n     committed to defending efforts to protect children from \n     harmful material whether it is targeted at them via the \n     computer or other media. Accordingly, the President firmly \n     supports the Communications Decency Act.\n       As you accurately predicted, various challenges to the \n     Communications Decency Act have been filed.

During our annual celebration in Topeka, WI, \nGovernor Tommy G. Thompson served as the keynote speaker for the \nevening of celebration and appreciation.\n  In his narrative, Senator Bond captured the heart and strengths of \nour State, and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           A Salute to Kansas\n\n       Governor Graves, Governor Thompson, Senator Kassebaum, \n     Chairman Miller, Distinguished Guests and fellow Kansans, it \n     is my pleasure to offer a salute to Kansas on the occasion of \n     her 135th birthday of statehood. Having turned sixty years of \n     age in the past year I am pleased whenever I'm invited to a \n     birthday party for something older than I am.\n       This past summer a book titled ``Vacation Places Rated'' \n     was published which listed Kansas dead last as a desirable \n     vacation spot. The vacationers surveyed apparently felt \n     Kansas had little to offer. Such sentiments are not new. In \n     1867 Henry Stanley wrote, ``Tourists through Kansas would \n     call this place dull enough . . . For a passing traveler in \n     search of pleasure, it certainly possesses few attractions.''\n       If one is in search of a sandy sea-side shore or a snow-\n     capped mountain peak Kansas is not the place to look.\n       For those of us who call Kansas home we know what may be \n     lost on the casual visitor.\n       The beauty of Kansas resides in the subtle grace of its \n     geography, the strength of its people's character and the \n     spirit of hope that shapes its future.\n       America may not turn to Kansas when its looking for a \n     tropical resort but America looks to Kansas for so much more \n     . . .\n       Today, when Americans want the finest grain in the world \n     they call on Kansas.\n       Today, when Americans want the finest steak in the world \n     they call on Kansas.\n       Today, when Americans want oil and natural gas to heat \n     their homes and cook their food they call on Kansas.\n       Today, when Americans want the finest aircraft in the world \n     they call on Kansas.\n       And yes, Governor Thompson, we even make some pretty good \n     cheese.\n       And today, when America needs leadership it calls on \n     Kansas--\n       Congresswoman Jan Meyers, the first Republican woman to \n     chair a standing committee in the U.S. House.\n       Congressman Pat Roberts, reshaping farm policy as Chairman \n     of the House Agriculture Committee.\n       Senator Nancy Kassebaum, the first woman elected to the \n     U.S. Senate in her own right, working to reform welfare, \n     education and job training as Chair of the Senate's Labor and \n     Human Resources committee.\n       And, Senator Bob Dole who has served as Senate Majority \n     Leader longer than any other person.\n       We are blessed with an abundance of Republican leaders that \n     reflect the virtues of Kansas--persistence, hard work, common \n     sense and hope. Congressmen Brownback and Tiahrt continue \n     this tradition.\n       But this Kansas tradition of leadership is nothing new.\n       Sixty years ago in the depths of the dust bowl and \n     depression Governor Alf Landon worked to balance our state \n     budget and serve as our party's standard bearer in the \n     Presidential election. His dignity and sense of compassion \n     were not victims to the fiscal austerity of the time.\n       More than fifty years ago when America faced the challenge \n     of World War, Gen. Eisenhower lead our forces to victory in \n     Europe and secured the peace. The boyhood lessons learned in \n     Abilene served him well in that endeavor and during the eight \n     years he served our nation as President. The 34th President \n     whose boyhood home was in the 34th state.\n       Today, when the need for leadership on the national level \n     has never been greater, Americans again call on Kansas. The \n     man from Russell tested by war and tested in the public arena \n     stands ready to lead our country into the next millennium. \n     His greatest strengths are the gifts of Kansas. A character \n     shaped by faith and family, a determination to confront \n     challenges and an ingenuity to overcome them. When America \n     calls on Kansas we always offer our best. President Bob Dole \n     will be no exception.\n       Kansas has historically been willing to make tough choices. \n     The choice to reject slavery caused our state to be born in \n     the midst of a bloody struggle. A struggle for which Kansas \n     paid a high price--Kansas suffered the highest mortality rate \n     in the nation during the Civil War. But our birth in troubled \n     times only made Kansans appreciate the price of freedom even \n     more.\n       From the prairie, Kansans built a way of life--not focused \n     on the value of possessions but on the importance of family, \n     neighbors, faith and community. Obstacles were merely \n     opportunities for innovation and the creative spirit of \n     Kansans always rose to meet the challenge. We have always \n     sought the stars through difficulties.\n       Floods, grasshoppers, dust storms, drought, tornadoes--all \n     have caused the Kansas spirit to bend but it has never \n     broken.\n\n[[Page S3148]]\n\n       Tonight, on the occasion of 135 years of statehood Kansas \n     remains a great place to call home. But regardless of our \n     contributions much remains to be done. As President \n     Eisenhower said, ``Accomplishment will prove to be a \n     journey, not a destination.'' Kansas is a young state--one \n     with its best years ahead--full of possibilities. We must \n     work to accomplish the full potential of these \n     possibilities--creating an even better Kansas for future \n     generations.\n       Some may seek to exploit divisions within our party but I \n     believe many more will seek to focus on that which unites us. \n     Since the Republican Party in Kansas was organized in 1859 in \n     Osawatomie it has known its share of controversy but it has \n     also provided our state with leaders united by a belief that \n     government isn't the solution to every problem and that a \n     limited government that encourages individual opportunity and \n     freedom best serves the citizens of Kansas. With candor, \n     respect and trust we as Republicans can continue to provide \n     such leadership for Kansas. The contrasts that define our \n     differences can be a source of strength not division. We have \n     a great leader in our governor, Bill Graves. His vision for \n     Kansas is worthy of our continued mutual investment.\n       One hundred years ago a young editor, having recently \n     purchased, The Emporia Gazette, published an editorial \n     entitled, ``What's the Matter with Kansas?'' With it's \n     publication William Allen White garnered his first national \n     attention. A century later upon revisiting that question we \n     know that there is nothing the matter with Kansas that the \n     people of Kansas can't fix--working together.\n       It is true that some may look at Kansas and see only what \n     Zebulon Montgomery Pike first described as ``The Great \n     American Desert.'' But those of us that call Kansas home know \n     better. We know that Kansas is a fount of commerce, \n     prosperity, and hope--a place occupied by those who know the \n     importance of faith and family and who believe in a future of \n     unlimited potential. A land of open vista and friendly \n     people. Regardless of where we roam Kansans are sure of one \n     thing--there's no place like home. For all the blessings of \n     Kansas we give thanks.\n       Happy Birthday Kansas and Many Happy Returns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3147-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TROY SYSTEMS, INC.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased today to have the opportunity \nto recognize a company, TROY Systems, Inc., located in the great city \nof Alexandria, VA. TROY Systems is a shining example of the vitality of \nthe American Dream, having grown from a small disadvantaged section \n8(a) company into a national and award winning federal contractor. I \nwould like to especially congratulate their CEO and President, K. David \nBoyer, for TROY's incredible success. While TROY may soon be graduating \nfrom the 8(a) program, I am confident of their continued success.\n  In 1984, in a small apartment in Alexandria, David Boyer and Felicity \nBelford started on an entrepreneurial journey. Their plan was to build \na company providing information systems and technology support to the \nFederal Government. Starting with just two employees, TROY Systems has \ngrown to a work force of over 350 employees and revenues in 1995 of \nalmost $25 million.\n  In 1995, TROY was named by TechNews, Inc. and Deloitte and Touche to \ntheir National Technology ``Fast 500'' list of the fastest growing \ntechnology-intensive companies in the United States. The company shared \nthis honor with such heavyweight and well-known corporations such as \nMicrosoft, Dell Computer, and Novel. TROY Systems has received other \nsuch awards such as being named to Inc. magazine's list of the 500 \nfastest growing companies, receiving Ernst & Young's Entrepreneur of \nthe Year award, and being selected by the Virginia Chamber of Commerce \nas one of the ``Fantastic 50'' fastest growing small private companies \nin the commonwealth.\n  I would like to submit for the record an article which appeared in \nthe November edition of InSight magazine describing TROY Systems' \nimpressive growth and achievements, as well as their involvement in the \nimportant Department of Defense Defense Messaging System project.\n  TROY Systems is a fine example that the American Dream is alive and \nwell and I am proud to salute them for their hard work and \naccomplishments.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   DMS Spotlight--TROY Systems, Inc.\n\n       One member of the DMS contract team is a small business, \n     minority-owned firm with a strong background in government \n     information systems support. TROY Systems, Inc., of \n     Alexandria, Virginia, will be providing training courses to \n     help DMS users get up to speed with products procured through \n     the contract.\n       TROY became involved with Loral through the Mentor/Protege \n     program sponsored by the Department of Defense. The program \n     encourages large prime contractors to seek out small \n     businesses that can benefit from such an alliance. During the \n     course of the relationship, both companies have learned from \n     the other, and contracts have been pursued with either party \n     acting as the prime. According to K. David Boyer, Jr., \n     President & CEO of TROY, ``The major benefit of our \n     relationship with Loral has been the mutual re-engineering of \n     corporate processes, as a result of our learning experience \n     as we work together.'' Boyer started the business working \n     from a home office in October of 1984. Since its inception, \n     TROY has grown from two people to a staff approaching three \n     hundred people, and has been listed in the INC 500.\n       TROY has operated under the Small Business Set Aside 8(a) \n     Program and is currently looking forward to graduation in \n     1996. To position itself as a strong information technology \n     company into the next decade, TROY has built an impressive \n     list of federal and corporate clients. Winning large \n     government contracts over a diverse customer base has led to \n     significant expansion of TROY's capabilities. Since 1990, \n     TROY has developed and conducted worldwide user training for \n     the U.S. Army health care community, the Navy Recruiting \n     Command, and the Veteran's Benefits Administration. TROY \n     currently performs on contracts with three Department of \n     the Navy agencies (NAVSEA, NAVAIR, and NAVSUP), the Air \n     Force, and numerous civilian agencies including GSA, GAO, \n     and the RTC. In addition, TROY serves as IV & V \n     (Independent Verification & Validation) analyst for the \n     Resolution Trust Corporation's massive software systems, \n     which were built by IBM and tested by Troy Systems, Inc.\n       What seems to set TROY apart from other SDBs (Small, \n     Disadvantaged Businesses) is the consistency between its walk \n     and its talk. Boyer states, ``I built this company with the \n     philosophy that 8(a) and other such programs were not \n     necessary for us to succeed. We are a leader in our area of \n     technology expertise. That is why we have won so many \n     contracts.''\n       Loral's award of DMS provides yet another opportunity for \n     TROY to utilize its expertise. Once curricula are completed, \n     approved, and made available, DMS users will be able to \n     choose from the following courses offered through the DMS \n     contract: Basic User; Operating Systems Administrator; \n     Directory System Administrator; Message Handling System \n     Administrator; and Management Workstation System \n     Administrator.\n       Harry H. Hagenbrock is the senior manager at TROY, \n     responsible for the DMS program. Hagenbrock comments, ``Due \n     to the tremendous number of users (projected to be 2,000,000) \n     that will ultimately be on line with DMS, TROY will be \n     building its staff and resources to present the courses in \n     the field, or ``train the trainer,'' for those commands who \n     wish to provide DMS training internally.\n       TROY Systems, Inc., is ramping up its capabilities, and \n     working closely with Loral Corporation to bring its DMS \n     training and support resources to a state of readiness. CEO \n     Boyer, a former Air Force Officer, is looking forward to the \n     DMS challenge. Boyer concludes, ``Our many commercial and \n     military contracts have prepared us to train DMS users. We \n     are looking forward to help make DMS happen.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3148-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3148-S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF EDWARD L. KING\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the contributions \nto the Senate and to the Nation that have been made by Edward L. King \nwho is leaving the staff of the Senate for the private sector.\n  Ed King retired from the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel in 1969 \nafter a distinguished military career, including combat infantry duty \nin Korea and assignments in important staff positions with an emphasis \non NATO and inter-American matters.\n  After his military service, Ed turned his hand to writing and \nauthored ``The Death Of the Army: A Pre-Mortem'' which was selected by \nthe New York Times Review of Books as one of the 12 best current events \nbooks of the year for 1972.\n  In 1971, Ed came to the Hill for the first time, serving as a staff \nconsultant to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and later that \nsame year as special consultant for NATO affairs to Senator Mike \nMansfield. Ed returned to the Hill in 1975 and served as Administrative \nAssistant to Senator William Hathaway until 1979. Ed subsequently \nserved as special assistant to Senator Paul Tsongas in 1984, during \nwhich time he acted as an intermediary to the La Palma--El Salvador--\npeace talks. From 1985 to 1987, Ed served as a consultant on Central \nAmerica to Senator Robert Byrd. Finally, Ed served on the Senate \nDemocratic Policy Committee from 1987 to the present time.\n\n[[Page S3149]]\n\nOver the last 10 years, Ed has worked as a senior foreign policy \nadvisor for Majority Leaders Robert Byrd and George Mitchell and for \nMinority Leader Thomas Daschle.\n  I first came to know Ed King while he was working on the Democratic \nPolicy Committee. I also came to respect and admire Ed as he went from \nlegislative crisis to crisis with the same calm but determined and \neffective demeanor that I am sure served him and his troops so well as \na combat infantry officer. Whether the issue was pop-up legislation \ndealing with the Persian Gulf, Somalia, Haiti, or Bosnia or setting up \na routine meeting for Senators with a visiting foreign official Ed was \nalways on top of the situation, always in full control of the facts, \nand ready with a solution to bridge ostensibly irreconcilable \npositions. And despite the stress and the raised voices on the part of \nsome, Ed never lost his good nature and sense of humor.\n  But what I remember most of all were the numerous occasions on which \na long stint of negotiations ended with the parties agreed on the \ngeneral framework of a solution and leaving it to Ed to come up with \nthe specific text that embodied that general solution. And you knew \nthat the specific text would be ready the first thing the next morning \nand that it would have been agreed to on all sides at the staff level \nand vetted with and acceptable to the administration.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is losing one of its finest staff members. \nThe Nation is losing a fine public servant whose contributions will, \nfor the most part, remain unknown. I, for one, want the record to \nreflect that this Senator appreciates the service that Ed King has \nrendered to the Senate and the Nation. I know that he will be \nsuccessful in the private sector and that he will continue to make a \ncontribution in whatever he does in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3148-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nwish a very happy birthday to Gertrude Mallard Pritcher of St. George, \nSC. Mrs. Pritcher will turn 100 years old on April 13.\n  The 11th of 12 children, Gertrude Pritcher was born in Colleton \nCounty in 1896 to John Behlin and Annie Eliza Liston Hucks. In the \nhistory of her life, one can trace the history of the South Carolina \nLowcountry. She grew up in Smoaks, where she taught school in a one-\nroom schoolhouse, and Sunday school at a Methodist Church. Throughout \nthe 1930s,'40s and '50s, she lived in Beaufort County where she was \nactive in home demonstration clubs, specializing in gardening, cooking \nand sewing. A member of Daughters of the American Revolution, Mrs. \nPritcher has three daughters and one son by her first husband, William \nDaniel Mallard of Summerville. They were married for almost 50 years, \nuntil his death in 1965. Mrs. Pritcher married Asbury Pritcher of \nBeaufort County in 1972 who has also passed away.\n  Like a true Southerner, she has a love of and flair for storytelling. \nWith her knowledge of the counties of South Carolina, and with all the \nfamily and friends she has, you can bet she has some good ones to tell. \nShe enjoyed a healthy and active life for 85 years, until a stroke in \n1981. The condition curtailed her activity somewhat, but she continues \nto live comfortably in St. George where her children and grandchildren \nenjoy her company, and her tales. Let's all hope that we can have as \nrich a life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3149-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3149-S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE FLAG AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the February, 1996 issue of the American \nLegion Magazine contains a column entitled, ``We Will Continue To Stand \nBy Our Flag,'' by Daniel A. Ludwig, national commander of the American \nLegion. As my colleagues know, the American Legion, other veterans and \ncivics groups, the Citizens Flag Alliance, and countless individuals \nundertook an effort to pass a constitutional amendment authorizing \nprotection of the American flag. There was nothing in it for any of the \nparticipants in that great effort. This effort fell just short in the \nSenate. But, I note that in 1989 an amendment received 51 votes; in \n1990, 58 votes; and in 1995, 63 votes. In the other body, the effort \nwent from falling short in 1989 to an overwhelming win in 1995.\n  I said in December that the effort to enact a constitutional \namendment authorizing protection of the American flag will be back. And \nso it will, as the column by Commander Ludwig makes clear. I ask \nunanimous consent that the column be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the American Legion Magazine, Feb. 1996]\n\n                 We Will Continue To Stand by Our Flag\n\n                         (By Daniel A. Ludwig)\n\n       By the time you read this, the postmortems on the Senate \n     vote on the flag amendment will largely have subsided. The \n     media may finally have stopped smirking their smirks of \n     (supposed) intellectual superiority. The constitutional \n     scholars who were thrust into an unaccustomed limelight will \n     have gone back to their universities to continue the debate \n     in quieter fashion. The public-interest groups who took sides \n     against us--and, we always believed, against the public \n     interest--will have turned their attention to other cherished \n     aspects of traditional American life that need to be \n     ``modernized,'' which is to say, cheapened or twisted or \n     gutted altogether.\n       Observers have suggested that we, too, should give up the \n     fight. Enough is enough, they say. ``You gave it your best, \n     now it's time to pack it in.'' Those people don't understand \n     what the past six years, since the 1989 Supreme Court \n     decision, have really been about.\n       From the beginning of our efforts, debate centered on the \n     issue of free speech and whether the proposed amendment \n     infringes on it. But whether flag desecration is free speech, \n     or an abuse of free speech, as Orrin Hatch suggests (and we \n     agree), there is a larger point here that explains why we \n     can't--shouldn't--just fold up our tents and go quietly.\n       Our adversaries have long argued that opposition to the \n     amendment is not the same as opposition to the flag itself, \n     that it's possible to love the flag and yet vote against \n     protecting it. Perhaps in the best of all possible worlds we \n     could accept such muddled thinking.\n       Sadly, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.\n       In the best of all possible worlds it would not be \n     necessary to install metal detectors in public schools, or \n     have drunk-driving checkpoints on our highways, or give \n     mandatory drug tests to prospective airline employees. \n     Indeed, in the best of all possible worlds, the Pope would \n     not have to make his rounds in a bulletproof vehicle. In all \n     of these cases, we have willingly made certain sacrifices in \n     freedom because we recognize that there are larger interests \n     at stake. In the case of the metal detectors, for example, \n     the safety of our children, and our teachers, and the \n     establishment of a stable climate for instruction to take \n     place, is paramount.\n       If the flag amendment is about anything, it's about holding \n     the line on respect, on the values that you and I asked our \n     lives to preserve. We live in a society that respects little \n     and honors still less. Most, if not all, of today's ills can \n     be traced to a breakdown in respect--for laws, for \n     traditions, for people, for the things held sacred by the \n     great bulk of us.\n       Just as the godless are succeeding at removing God from \n     everyday life, growing numbers of people have come to feel \n     they're not answerable to anything larger than themselves. \n     The message seems to be that nothing takes priority over the \n     needs and desires and ``rights'' of the individual. Nothing \n     is forbidden. Everything is permissible, from the shockingly \n     vulgar music that urges kids to go out and shoot cops, to \n     ``art'' that depicts Christ plunging into a vat of urine--to \n     the desecration of a cherished symbol like the U.S. Flag.\n       Are these really the freedoms our forefathers envisioned \n     when they drafted the Bill of Rights? Thomas Jefferson \n     himself did not regard liberty as a no-strings proposition. \n     His concept of democracy presupposed a nation of honorable \n     citizens. Remove the honorable motives from a free society \n     and what you have left is not democracy, but anarchy. What \n     you have left, eventually, is Lord of the Flies.\n       Amid all this, the flag stands for something. If respect \n     for the flag were institutionalized, and children were \n     brought up to understand the unique collection of principles \n     it represents, there would be inevitable benefits to society, \n     benefits that would help turn the tide of today's chaos and \n     disrespect. For no one who takes such principles to heart--no \n     one who sees the flag as\n\n[[Page S3150]]\n\n     an untouchable symbol of democracy, of decency--could \n     possibly do the things that some people do, these days, in \n     the name of freedom.\n       The flag stands for something miraculous that took life \n     upon these shores more than two centuries ago and, if we only \n     let it, will live on for centuries more. It stands for a \n     glorious idea that has survived every challenge, that has \n     persevered in the face of external forces who promised to \n     ``bury'' us and internal forces which promised to tear us \n     apart. Let us never forget this.\n       And let us not forget that 63 out of 99 senators voted with \n     us, or that we won over 375 legislators in total. Our efforts \n     were no more wasted than were the efforts to take remote \n     outposts in the Pacific a half-century ago. Those efforts, \n     too, failed at first, but eventually we prevailed.\n       We undertook a noble fight in trying to save our flag, and \n     the fact that we have suffered a temporary setback does not \n     diminish the nobility of what we fought for. This is not over \n     by a long shot. They will hear from us again.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on the Op Ed page of today's edition of the \nNew York Times there is a column I want to call to my colleagues' \nattention entitled ``Line-Item Lunacy'' by David Samuels. Even though \nthe current debate on this matter is over for now, I encourage my \nfellow Senators to take the time to read this thoughtful opinion. Mr. \nPresident, to that end, I ask unanimous consent that the column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the column was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 28, 1996]\n\n                            Line-Item Lunacy\n\n                           (By David Samuels)\n\n       It's a scene from a paranoid thriller by Oliver Stone: A \n     mercurial billionaire, elected President with 35 percent of \n     the vote, holds America hostage to his minority agenda by \n     vetoing item after item in the Federal budget, in open breach \n     of the separation of powers doctrine enshrined in the \n     Constitution. Impossible? Not anymore.\n       With the announcement by Republican leaders that they plan \n     to pass the line-item veto this spring, the specter of a \n     Napoleonic Presidency has moved from the far reaches of poli-\n     sci fiction, where it belongs, to the brink of political \n     possibility.\n       At the moment, of course, a Presidential dictatorship is \n     far from the minds of the G.O.P. leadership and White House \n     Democrats, who hope that the line-item veto would encourage \n     the President to eliminate pork-barrel giveaways and \n     corporate tax breaks. But to see the measure as a simple \n     procedural reform is to ignore the forces that have \n     reconfigured the political landscape since it was first \n     proposed.\n       Back in the 1980's, President Ronald Reagan ritually \n     invoked the line-item veto while shifting blame onto a \n     Democratic Congress for ballooning deficits. Part Republican \n     chestnut, part good-government gimmick, the line-item veto \n     became part of the Contract With America in 1994, and this \n     month rose to the top of the political agenda.\n       What the calculations of Democrats and Republicans leave \n     out, however, is that the unsettled politics of the 1990's \n     bear little relation to the political order of the Reagan \n     years.\n       In poll after poll, a majority of voters express a raging \n     disaffection with both major parties. With Ross Perot poised \n     to run in November, we could again elect our President with a \n     minority of the popular vote (in 1992, Mr. Clinton won with \n     43 percent). The line-item veto would hand over unchecked \n     power to a minority President with minority support in \n     Congress, while opponents would have to muster two-thirds \n     support to override the President's veto.\n       By opening every line in the Federal budget to partisan \n     attack, the likely result would be a chaotic legislature more \n     susceptible than ever to obstructionists who could demand a \n     Presidential veto of Federal arts funding or sex education \n     programs or aid to Israel as the price of their political \n     support.\n       And conservatives eager to cut Government waste would do \n     well to reflect on what a liberal minority might do to their \n     legislative hopes during a second Clinton term in office.\n       Nor would the line-item veto likely result in more \n     responsible executive behavior. The zigs and zags of Bill \n     Clinton's first term in office give us a clear picture of the \n     post-partisan Presidency, in which the executive freelances \n     across the airwaves in pursuit of poll numbers regardless of \n     the political coherence of his message or the decaying ties \n     of party. With the adoption of the line-item veto, the \n     temptation for Presidents to strike out on their own would \n     surely grow.\n       The specter of a President on horseback armed with coercive \n     powers might seem far away to those who dismissed Ross Perot \n     as a freak candidate in the last election. Yet no law states \n     that power-hungry billionaires must be possessed of Mr. \n     Perot's peculiar blend of personal qualities and doomed to \n     fail. Armed with the line-item veto, a future Ross Perot--or \n     Steve Forbes--would be equipped with the means to reward and \n     punish members of the House and Senate by vetoing individual \n     budget items. This would enable an independent President to \n     build a coalition in Congress through a program of threats \n     and horse-trading that would make our present sorely flawed \n     system seem like a model of Ciceronian rectitude.\n       President Clinton has promised to sign the line-item veto \n     when it reaches his desk. Between now and then, the historic \n     breach of our constitutional separation of powers that the \n     measure proposes should be subject to a vigorous public \n     debate. At the very least, we might reflect on how we intend \n     to govern ourselves at a time when the certainties of two-\n     party politics are dissolving before our eyes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Mr. Samuels eloquently points out just one \nof the many concerns this country could very well face with the \nadoption of this legislation. He focuses on what might happen should \nour two-party system dissolve and allow for a rogue individual to be \nelected president by a minority of the American people. In this \nscenario, the possibility of a tyrannical oppressor freely and \nrecklessly wielding power has to be considered. While at the present \ntime the likelihood of such an event seems farfetched, it is just this \ntype of concern that we elected members of the people's branch must \nconsider.\n  Indeed, if there is one bright spot on this day after Senate passage \nof S. 4, it is that in eight years the Congress will revisit this \nissue. It is my hope that at that time, wisdom will prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3149-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDMUND S. MUSKIE\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments today to \nspeak about the death of former Senator Edmund Muskie.\n  I first met Ed Muskie during his visits to my family's house in \nConnecticut more than 30 years ago as he traveled back to Maine from \nWashington.\n  And like my father before me--I was honored to serve with him in \nCongress. I came to greatly admire and respect his leadership, his \nconviction, his knowledge and his great devotion to public service.\n  Edmund Muskie was a truly dedicated member of this body for 22 years. \nHe served both the people of Maine and all the American people as a \ncommitted and able legislator.\n  And when his party and his President called on him he answered. He \ntwice ran for national office as a Democrat: Once for Vice-President in \n1968 and once for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972. And \nhe finished his career as Secretary of State, under President Carter in \n1980.\n  Throughout his more than two decades of public service Ed Muskie was \nahead of his time in his efforts to keep our environment clean and \nAmerica's fiscal house in order.\n  He earned the apt nickname ``Mr. Clean'' for his pioneering work on \nthe Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, both of which he shepherded \nthrough the Senate. Generations from now, when Americans are enjoying \nour safe and healthy air and water, they should thank Edmund Muskie for \nhaving the foresight and vision to place a clean environment on top of \nthe political agenda.\n  And even before the era of exploding federal deficits in the 1980's, \nEdmund Muskie strived to bring fiscal discipline to Congress, as \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee.\n  Yesterday, former President Jimmy Carter said he had ``never known \nany American leader who was more highly qualified to be President of \nthe United States.'' And it is to the American people's misfortune that \na man of such principle never had the opportunity to reach the Oval \nOffice.\n  As a fellow Democrat and Northeasterner I remain committed to the \npolicies that Edmund Muskie so energetically championed as a U.S. \nSenator.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Jane, his children, his \nfriends and the people of Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3150-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3150-S3151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LINE ITEM VETO CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my opposition to \nthis so-called line-item veto conference report, which passed on March \n27. I have been a strong supporter of a line item veto and feel that \nsuch legislation would provide the President with an effective weapon \nto fight wasteful spending. I have voted for several line item veto \nbills that I felt were constitutional. However, I did not support this\n\n[[Page S3151]]\n\nlegislation, as it violates the plain reading of the Constitution.\n  In Article I, section 7, the Constitution sets out fundamental \nprocedures for the enactment of a law. It states that every bill should \nbe passed by both houses and then presented to the President to either \nsign or veto. If the bill is vetoed each house may override such a veto \nby two-thirds vote. The bill then becomes law once it is signed or a \nveto is overridden by each house of Congress.\n  This conference report allows the President, after a bill has become \na law, to go back and review that law and to pick and choose what \nportions of the law he desires to repeal, and to do so in an \nunconstitutional manner. This flies in the face of the fundamental \nprincipal of ``separation of powers'' and the ``checks and balances'' \nof our government. Article I, section 1, of the Constitution states \nthat ``[a]ll legislation Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \nCongress of the United States.\n  The Supreme Court in INS versus Chadha discussed the importance of \nthe ``separation of powers'' provisions in Article I, section 1. The \ncourt stated that\n\n       [t]hese provisions of Art. I are integral parts of the \n     constitutional design for the separation of powers. We have \n     recently noted that ``[t]he principle of separation of powers \n     was not simply an abstract generalization in the minds of the \n     Framers: it was woven into the document that they drafted in \n     Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.''\n\n  The Court further expressed that,\n\n       [i]t emerges clearly that the prescription for legislative \n     action in Art. I, sections 1, 7, represents the Framers' \n     decisions that the legislative power of the Federal \n     Government be exercised in accord with a singe, finely \n     wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure.\n\n  This conference report would allow the President, in effect, to \nrepeal an existing law; thereby violating the provisions of Article I. \nThe Court in Chadha held that ``[a]mendment and repeal of statutes, no \nless than enactment, must conform with Art. I.'' The Court went further \nby stating that\n\n       [t]he bicameral requirement, the Presentment Clauses, the \n     President's veto, and Congress' power to override a veto were \n     intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to \n     protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by \n     mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve those checks, \n     and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined \n     limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded.\n\nThis highlights the importance of maintaining the legislative \nprocedures set out by the Constitution and the separate powers the \nConstitution has bestowed upon the three branches of our government.\n  Mr. President, this bill chips away at the constitutionally \nprescribed ``checks and balances'' set forth by our Founding Fathers. I \nbelieve that a line-item veto can be a useful weapon against wasteful \nspending if drafted so as to protect the fundamental procedures set out \nby our Constitution; however, this bill as presented cannot sustain \nconstitutional muster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3150-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HELEN KELLY--A FAITHFUL PUBLIC SERVANT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been a member of this body for nearly \nthirty-eight years. During this time, I have come to treasure the \ntraditions of this institution and the unique place it holds in our \nsystem of government. Through the Senate I have worked with men and \nwomen who possess some of our country's finest and ablest minds, and \nwith them, I have witnessed and been part of history.\n  While this history will attest to the importance of my fellow members \nof the Senate, often what goes unnoticed is the behind-the-scenes work \nof our staffs. I feel confident in saying that there is not a member of \nthis body who could represent his or her constituents in this day and \nage without the diligent, hard work of Senate staffers. And it is to \npay tribute to one of these dedicated staffers that I speak on the \nSenate floor today.\n  Twenty years ago, on March 8, 1976, Helen B. Kelly came to work in my \noffice as a receptionist. She came with Hill experience, having \npreviously worked for Congressman Broyhill from Virginia. This \nknowledge, combined with her natural interest and compassion for \npeople, was quickly noted, and Helen was promoted to the position of \ncaseworker.\n  In my office, as in other Congressional offices, there is no greater \nmatter of importance than constituent services. As we all know, sifting \nthrough the federal bureaucracy can be a daunting and often \nexasperating experience. Well, Helen has mastered the art of cutting \nthrough Washington's red tape. Whether it be working out a visa problem \nfor a constituent's family member or giving guidance to a military \nacademy nominee, Helen has shown the dedication and perseverance to get \nthe job done.\n  I want to say thanks and congratulations to Helen Kelly on behalf of \nmy fellow West Virginians and the Senate. This is a demanding but \nrewarding profession. Were it not for people like Helen who breathe \nlife and vitality into it, I believe the Senate would not be the \npremier legislative body that we treasure today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3151-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JAPAN-UNITED STATES EXCHANGES\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important issue \nin our relationship with Japan. It has come to my attention that for \nevery American student studying in Japan, 20 Japanese study in the \nUnited States. This puts the United States at a comparative \ndisadvantage in dealing with issues of economic competitiveness and \nstrategic cooperation that confront and will continue to confront our \nbilateral ties for many years.\n  Japan possesses the second-most powerful economy in the world. Its \nresources and expertise affect the health and vitality of international \ntrade and finance. United States-Japan cooperation and understanding \nwill be required if issues pertaining to the global economy, \ndevelopment, health, peacekeeping, weapons proliferation, the \nenvironment, and others are to be addressed constructively. At the same \ntime, Japan's economic prowess poses significant challenges to and \nopportunities for improving the economic well-being of the United \nStates. We simply must learn how to gain the trust and cooperation of \nthe Japanese people, its entrepreneurs, and policy makers. We need to \ndo better and be better informed about Japan if we hope to correct the \nnagging imbalance in trade. Historically, we have been ill-prepared for \nthis task. We must be better prepared in the future.\n  One part of the solution to this problem lies in the education of \nyoung Americans in the language, culture, and society of Japan. It is \nthe young Americans of today who will take the lead in dealing with \ntheir Japanese peers in a language and style the latter will respect \nand appreciate. Back channel politics has worked well through the \nyears, but it is insufficient for the future. We now want to make \ncertain there is a very large network of United States students \nstudying in Japan that will make a difference in building the kind of \nbridges that are required if our relationship with Japan is to be more \nproductive now and in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to mention that a coalition of \npublic and private organizations is mounting a new program known as the \nBridging Project to address this need to educate more Americans in and \nabout Japan. In a time of fiscal stringency and belt tightening, public \nfunds for this and other initiatives are gong to become even more \nscarce. The private sector must get more involved. Private-public \npartnerships and other creative solutions involving the private sector \nwill be required if we are going to keep pace with our Japanese \ncompetitors. We should encourage this coalition to do everything it can \nto ensure that the United States remains competitive with Japan in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3151-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3151-S3152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HABEAS CORPUS REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just short of a year ago, this country was \nrocked by an attack on the Alfred Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma \nCity, OK. In the wake of that horrible, tragedy, this body took up \nantiterrorism legislation. I fought for the inclusion of meaningful \nhabeas corpus reform legislation in the Senate bill over the initial \nhesitation of President Clinton. The House bill contains identical \nlanguage. We will shortly be delivering a conference report to the \nPresident for his signature. At long last, after well over a decade of \neffort, we are about to\n\n[[Page S3152]]\n\ncurb these endless, frivolous appeals of death sentences.\n  I might add that this is one of the most important criminal law \nchanges in this country's history, and it is about time we get it on \ntrack.\n  To be sure, there are many other important antiterrorism measures \nwhich will be included in the final terrorism bill including increased \npenalties, antiterrorism aid to foreign nations, plastic explosives \ntagging requirements, and important law enforcement enhancements. But \nlet us make no mistake about it--habeas corpus reform is the most \nimportant provision in the terrorism bill. In fact, it is the heart and \nsoul of this bill. It is the only thing in the Senate antiterrorism \nbill that directly affected the Oklahoma bombing. If the perpetrators \nof that heinous act are convicted, they will be unable to use frivolous \nhabeas petitions to prevent the imposition of their justly deserved \npunishment. The survivors and the victims' families of the Oklahoma \ntragedy recognized the need for habeas reform and called for it to be \nput in the bill.\n  The Clinton Administration, which initially opposed meaningful habeas \ncorpus reform, came to its senses and the President himself said he \nsupported our habeas reform proposal. The antiterrorism bill, with the \nHatch-Specter habeas proposal passed this body in an overwhelming vote.\n  Most of those familiar with capital litigation know that support for \ntrue habeas reform--support for an end to frivolous death penalty \nappeals--is the most authentic evidence of an elected official's \nsupport for the death penalty. It is against this backdrop that I was \nsurprised to learn recently that on the eve of House debate on the \nantiterrorism bill--a bill that includes this important habeas reform \nproposal--the White House had sent emissaries to key Members of the \nHouse to lobby for weakening changes to the habeas reform package. \nFormer White House Counsel Abner Mikva, accompanied by White House \nstaff, met with key Members of the House and proposed that the bill be \namended to essentially restore the de novo standard of review in habeas \npetitions. This would have gutted habeas corpus reform by allowing \nFederal judges to reopen issues that had been lawfully and correctly \nresolved years earlier. I had thought we had a President who was \ncommitted to meaningful habeas reform.\n\n  When I first learned of this effort, I was surprised. After all, \nPresident Clinton promised that justice in the Oklahoma bombing case \nwould be swift. Indeed, he recognized that an end to frivolous death \npenalty appeals was critical when he said,\n\n       [Habeas corpus reform] ought to be done in the context of \n     this terrorism legislation so that it would apply to any \n     prosecutions brought against anyone indicted in Oklahoma.\n\n  [Larry King Live, June 5, 1995].\n  But then I began to consider all of the steps this President has \ntaken to undermine the death penalty. For example, President Clinton \nvetoed legislation late last year which contained language identical to \nthe terrorism bill's habeas corpus proposal. Veto message to H.R. 2586, \nthe temporary debt limit increase, Nov. 13, 1995. Prior to that, in \n1994, the Clinton Justice Department lobbied the Democrat controlled \nHouse for passage of the so-called Racial Justice Act. This provision, \nin the guise of protecting against race-based discrimination, would \nhave imposed a quota on the imposition of the death penalty. It would \nhave effectively abolished the death penalty.\n  When the Senate refused to accept this death penalty abolition \nproposal, President Clinton decided to issue a directive implementing a \nso-called Racial Justice Act-type review of all Department of Justice \ndecisions involving the Federal death penalty. [Wall Street Journal, \nJuly 21, 1994]. On March 29, 1995, Attorney General Reno issued the \ndirective. Ironically, the Clinton Administration did not see fit to \nprovide the victims' families in death penalty eligible cases with any \nright to petition the Department on the issue of whether the death \npenalty should be sought. [A.G. Reno directive on title 9 of the U.S. \nAttorneys' Manual, March 29, 1995].\n  To further gauge President Clinton's position on the death penalty \nand the streamlining of habeas corpus reform, one should consider \nwhether his Department of Justice has supported State efforts to impose \ncapital sentences. According to testimony provided to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, the Clinton Justice Department considers the fact \nthat a case involves the death penalty as a factor against filing \namicus briefs in support of the State. [Testimony of Paul Cassell, \nAssociate Professor of law, University of Utah, November 14, 1995]. The \nBush Administration filed briefs in support of the State in 44.4 \npercent of the cases on appeal where a defendant's death sentence was \nbeing challenged. Briefs were filed in 42.9 percent of these cases and \nin 1991 and in 37.5 percent of the cases in 1992. In 1994, the Clinton \nJustice Department failed to file a single brief in support of States \ntrying to carry out capital sentences. Many of these cases presented \nopportunities to protect the Federal death penalty but the Clinton \nadministration sat on its hands.\n\n  On March 14, President Clinton said that, in his opinion, the \nterrorism bill's habeas corpus provision is not as good as it could be, \nand that there are some problems in the way that it's done but that he \nmay go along with the version contained in the terrorism bill. [U.P.I. \nMarch 14, 1996].\n  Ironically, President Clinton's support for the terrorism bill seems \nto be dwindling as the likelihood for passage of habeas corpus reform \nseems to be increasing. Some Democrats appear to be preparing to \nscuttle the bill by arguing that it may not go far enough. Indeed, one \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle has gone so far as to \ncall the House terrorism bill useless. We now hear that there is talk \nwithin the White House of a possible veto threat unless the terrorism \nbill is changed.\n  What I find interesting is that most of the provisions the President \nand his brethren are flexing their muscles over were not in the \nadministration's original terrorism bill. For example, the President \nhas been critical of the House's bipartisan votes to drop a ban on so-\ncalled cop killer bullets and a provision allowing law enforcement to \nconduct roving wiretaps. On February 10, 1995, Senator Biden introduced \nthe administration's original terrorism bill, S. 390. Neither of these \nprovisions were contained in S. 390. Indeed, the House-passed terrorism \nbill is more comprehensive than the President's original bill.\n  So I ask my colleagues: Why is a bill which is substantially similar \nto--in fact broader than--the original Clinton-Biden bill of 1995 \nuseless in 1996? Could the fact that the final terrorism bill will \ncontain tough, true habeas corpus reform be what's really at issue \nhere?\n  President Clinton's newfound tough on crime rhetoric must be balanced \nagainst his administration's record of hostility toward true habeas \ncorpus reform. In a few weeks, the Congress will deliver to President \nClinton a tough terrorism bill which will contain our habeas corpus \nreform provision--a provision to end frivolous death penalty appeals. \nThis reform measure has already been vetoed once and President Clinton \nhas tried to weaken it.

The agency's mission is public service through the arts, \nand it fulfills this mandate through support of artistic excellence, \nour cultural heritage and traditions, individual creativity, education, \nand public and private partnerships for the arts. Perhaps most \nimportantly, the Arts Endowment encourages arts organizations to reach \nout to the American people, to bring in new audiences for the \nperforming, literary, and visual arts.\n  The results over the past 30 years can be measured by the increased \npresence of the arts in the lives of our fellow citizens. More children \nhave contact with working artists in the classroom, at children's \nmuseums and festivals, and in the curricula. More older Americans now \nhave access to museums, concert halls, and other venues. The arts reach \ninto the smallest and most isolated communities, and in our inner \ncities, arts programs are often a haven for the most disadvantaged, a \nplace where our youth can rediscover the power of imagination, \ncreativity, and hope.\n  We can measure this progress as well in our re-designed communities, \nin the buildings and sculpture that grace our cities and towns, and in \nthe vitality of the local economy whenever the arts arrive. The \nNational Endowment for the Arts works the way a Government agency \nshould work--in partnership with the private sector, in cooperation \nwith State and local government, and in service to all Americans. We \nenjoy a rich and diverse culture in the United States, open to every \ncitizen, and supported by the Federal Government for our common good \nand benefit.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to extend contracts between the Bureau of Reclamation \nand irrigation districts in Kansas and Nebraska, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the irrigation project contract extension act of 1996\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to extend \nthe water service contracts for irrigation projects in Nebraska and \nKansas.\n  Mr. President, a little over 50 years ago, Congress authorized \nconstruction of a set of water management projects as a part of the \nFlood Control Act of 1944. These projects were designed to provide \ncontrol, conservation, and use of water resources throughout the \nMissouri River basin. Known as the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program, \nthe system has provided flood control, power generation and irrigation \nto over 3.7 million acres, as well as stream pollution abatement, \nsediment control, water supplies for cities and industry, enhancement \nof fish and wildlife, and recreation opportunities.\n  Each of the projects had 40-year water service contracts for \nirrigation with the Bureau of Reclamation, in the Department of the \nInterior. These contracts are beginning to expire. In fact, three of \nthose 40-year contracts will expire on December 31 of this year. Though \nthe procedures for contract renewal were not spelled out, it is clear \nthat contract renewal was considered when the original agreements were \nmade. It is also clear that an immediate extension of the service \ncontracts is necessary. Extending these contracts will give the Bureau \nof Reclamation the necessary time to complete the contract renewal \nprocess as well as provide us time to collect input to fully evaluate \nour options and maximize the benefits of the best option.\n  The legislation I introduce today is straight-forward and simple: It \nwould extend each of 10 water service contracts upon expiration for a \nperiod of 4 years. The terms of each contract would be the same as \nthose originally negotiated.\n  I am glad to be able to say that this legislation has the full and \nbipartisan support of each Senator from both of the affected States, \nNebraska and Kansas. It has been a real pleasure to work with each of \nmy cosponsors on an issue where we found such clear and easy agreement, \nboth about what needed to be done and how to get there. So, on behalf \nof myself, the majority leader, Bob Dole, my friend and fellow \nNebraskan Jim Exon, Nancy Kassebaum, and the thousands of Nebraskans, \nKansans, and visitors who benefit from these projects, I introduce the \nIrrigation Project Contract Extension Act of 1996.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Simon, Mr. Leahy, Ms. \n        Mikulski, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1650. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on account of sex, \nrace, or national origin, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                        THE FAIR PAY ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Equal Pay Act, passed in 1963, \nmade it illegal to discriminate against women when determining pay \nlevels for the same job. Since then, we have made some progress in \nreducing employment discrimination against women. But we cannot have \nequality of opportunity in the workplace without equality and fairness \nin wages and salary. Even though many women have moved up and out of \ntraditionally female jobs, stereotypes and historical discrimination \nremain firmly imbedded in pay scales.\n  Current law has not done enough to combat wage discrimination when \nemployers routinely pay lower wages to jobs that are dominated by \nwomen. That is why I am introducing the Fair Pay Act of 1996. The Fair \nPay Act is designed to pick up where the Equal Pay Act left off by \npaying women equally for equivalent work.\n  The heart of the Fair Pay Act will make it illegal to discriminate \nagainst employees on the basis of sex, race, and national origin by \nrequiring equal pay for work in jobs that are comparable in skill, \neffort, responsibility, and working conditions. Women and minorities \nmake up 57 percent of the workforce and their salaries are an essential \ncomponent of family income. It is a fundamental issue of fairness to \nprovide equal pay for work that is of equal value to an employer.\n  Wage gaps can result from differences in education, experience, or \ntime in the workforce and the Fair Pay Act does not interfere with \nthat. But, just as there is a glass ceiling in the American workplace, \nthere is also what I call a glass wall--where women are on the exact \nsame level as their male coworkers. They have the same skills, they \nhave the same type of responsibilities, but they are still obstructed \nfrom receiving the same pay. It is a hidden barrier, but a barrier all \nthe same. And it is keeping out equality, opportunity, and above all \nfairness. The Fair Pay Act is about knocking down the glass wall.\n  To illustrate, consider a study done in the county of Los Angeles \nthat compared the job requirements and salaries of children's social \nservice workers who were mostly women and probation officers who were \nmostly men. The two jobs required the same skills and education, and \nthe working conditions were similar. However, the social service \nworkers were paid an average of $35,000 a year while the probation \nofficers were paid an average of $55,000 a year--a $20,000 difference \nin salary.\n  Over a lifetime, that kind of wage gap adds up. The average woman \nloses $420,000 over a lifetime due to unequal pay practices. Such gaps \nin income are life changing: it can mean the difference between welfare \nand self-sufficiency, owning a home or renting, sending your kids to \ncollege or to flip burgers, or having a decent retirement instead of an \nuncertain old age.\n  The Fair Pay Act is a commonsense business issue. Women and \nminorities make up over half of the work force and fair pay is \nessential to attract and keep good workers.\n  The Fair Pay Act is an economic issue. Working women, after all, \ndon't get special discounts when they buy milk. They can't get a \nspecial rate buying clothes for their kids. Bread and gasoline don't \ncost less for working women than working men. And women and minorities \nare certainly taxed at the same rate as men are, yet they don't get any \nbreak when April 15 rolls around.\n  The Fair Pay Act is a family issue. Family budgets are getting \nsqueezed by the day. When women are discriminated against in their pay, \nthey aren't the only ones who lose. When women aren't paid what they're \nworth, husbands and children get cheated too.\n  Now, I've heard the critics. Some say there is no discrimination in \nthe workplace. It's just the natural economic forces paying workers \ntheir fair share.\n  Others say that this is a decision that should be left to the private \nsector alone. If the private sector wants to discriminate, they say, \nthat should be their right. Well, we as a society have said \ndiscrimination in any form should not be tolerated and that's what this \nbill is about.\n  There is perhaps no other form of discrimination that has as direct \nan impact on the day-to-day lives of workers as economic \ndiscrimination. The Equal Pay Act was designed to end that. And it has \nhelped. But we need to go further to address economic discrimination \nfor equivalent work.\n  And most importantly, the American people want fair pay legislation. \nThe Fair Pay Act has already been endorsed by a wide variety of groups \nand organizations. In addition, polling data consistently show that \nover 70 percent of the American people support a law requiring the same \npay for men and women in jobs requiring similar skills\n\n[[Page S3158]]\n\nand responsibilities.

Mr. President, today, more than half our population \nfaces discrimination every day. Hard to believe, but it is true.\n  Women currently earn, on average, 28 percent less than men. That \nmeans for every dollar a man earns, a woman earns only 72 cents. Over a \nlifetime, the average woman will earn $420,000 less than the average \nman based solely on her sex. This is unacceptable. We must correct this \ngross inequity, and we must correct it now.\n  How is this possible with our Federal laws prohibiting \ndiscrimination? It is possible because we in Congress have failed to \nprotect one of the most fundamental human rights--the right to be paid \nfairly for an honest day's work.\n  Unfortunately, our laws ignore wage discrimination against women and \nminorities, which continues to fester like a cancer in workplaces \nacross the country. The Fair Pay Act of 1996 would close this legal \nloophole by prohibiting discrimination based on wages.\n  I do not pretend that this act will solve all the problems that women \nand minorities face in the workplace. It is, however, an essential \npiece of the puzzle.\n  Equal pay for equal work is often a subtle problem that is difficult \nto combat. And it does not stand alone as an issue that women and \nminorities face in the workplace. It is deeply intertwined with the \nproblem of unequal opportunity. Closing this loophole is not enough if \nwe fail to provide the opportunity for women and minorities, regardless \nof their merit, to reach higher paying positions.\n  The Government, by itself, cannot change the attitudes and \nperceptions of individuals or private businesses in hiring and \nadvancing women and minorities, but it can set an example. Certainly, \nPresident Clinton has shown great leadership by appointing an \nunprecedented number of women to his administration. Earlier this week, \nthe Department of Defense, the Nation's largest employer of women, \nreached a milestone when President Clinton appointed the first female \nthree-star general, Maj. Gen. Carol Mutter of the U.S. Marine Corps. I \nshare her sentiment when she said she could not wait until there were \nno more firsts for women. The Government has a long way to go, however, \nsince General Mutter will be the lone woman out of more than 100 three-\nstar officers.\n  The private sector also has a long way to go to provide equal \nopportunity. The report released by the Glass Ceiling Commission last \nyear found that 95 percent of the senior managers of Fortune 1000 \nindustrial and Fortune 500 companies are white males. The Glass Ceiling \nCommission also found that when there are women and minorities in high \nplaces, their compensation is lower than white males in similar \npositions. This wage inequality is the issue we seek to address today.\n  In the next decade, the changing nature of the workplace--women and \nminority men will make up 62 percent of the work force by the year \n2005--will force businesses to look at the larger pool of qualified \nAmericans to continue to be competitive in the marketplace. As this \nchange occurs, we must demand fair pay for equal work.\n  For the first time in our country's long history, this bill outlaws \ndiscrimination in wages paid to employees in equivalent jobs solely on \nthe basis of a worker's sex, race, or national origin. I say it is \nabout time. I commend Senator Harkin for introducing the Fair Pay Act, \nand I am proud to be an original cosponsor of it.\n  The Fair Pay Act would remedy gender and race wage gaps under a \nbalanced approach that takes advantage of the employment expertise of \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission [EEOC], while providing \nflexibility to small employers . In addition, it would safeguard \nlegitimate wage differences caused by a seniority or merit pay system. \nAnd the legislation directs the EEOC to provide educational materials \nand technical assistance to help employers design fair pay policies.\n  It is a basic issue of fairness to provide equal pay for work of \nequal value. The Fair Pay Act makes it possible for women and \nminorities to finally achieve this fundamental fairness. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1651. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncovered beneficiaries under the military health care system who are \nalso entitled to medicare to enroll in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits program; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n             military retirees health benefits legislation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation which will return a sense of fairness to the military \nhealth care system by providing Medicare-eligible uniformed services \nretirees the same health care plan that is currently available to every \nother retired federal employee. This proposed legislation would allow \nall Medicare-eligible military retirees and family members to \nparticipate in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan [FEHBP].\n  Under the current system, military retirees are the only group of \nFederal employees whose health plan is taken away at age 65, requiring \nthem to rely exclusively on Medicare. This is a broken promise, one \nmade as they took their oath of office. I am sure that my colleagues \nwould agree that this situation is not only inherently unfair, but that \nit also breaks a long standing health care commitment to our military \nretirees. It is worth noting that\n\n[[Page S3159]]\n\nnearly all of the largest U.S. corporations, such as General Motors, \nIBM and Exxon, provide their retirees with substantial employer-paid \nhealth coverage in addition to Medicare. The commonly held belief that \nthe health care provided for military retirees is second to none is a \nmyth. The truth is that when compared to what is provided by other \nlarge employers including the rest of the Federal Government, the \nhealth care that is provided to our Medicare-eligible military retirees \nand their family members has become second to almost all others.\n  This legislation is a major step toward the application of equitable \nstandards of health care for all Federal Employees and honors our \ncommitments to those veterans who served our Nation faithfully through \nmany years of arduous military service. I invite my colleagues to join \nme as cosponsors of this bill. I would like to thank Jack Hoggard, \nCommander, USN(RET) and Mike Matthes, Commander, USN for their efforts \nin producing this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1652. A bill to amend the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention Act of 1974 to establish a national resource center and \nclearinghouse to carry out training of State and local law enforcement \npersonnel to more effectively respond to cases involving missing or \nexploited children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n  the jimmy ryce law enforcement training center establishment act of \n                                  1996\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill \nto establish the Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for the \nRecovery of Missing and Exploited Children.\n\n  Each year tens of thousands of children are reported missing from \ntheir homes. The Department of Justice estimates that 3,000 to 4,000 \nchildren are taken coercively by nonfamily members. And the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children gets involved with almost 300 \ncases a year which involve children abducted by strangers intending \nharm. Many of these children are never seen again.\n  This is the most critical factor in a missing child investigation. \nAnd too, often, local law enforcement officials lack the experience and \nthe resources to conduct a swift and effective investigation which will \nmaximize the chances for a safe recovery.\n  The Jimmy Ryce Center, which will be established by this bill, will \ncombine the resources of the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren with those the F.B.I.'s National Crime Information Center and \nChild Abduction and Serial Killer Unit, as well as the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Jimmy Ryce Center will \nbe a national training center for law enforcement officials from all \nover the United States and its programs will address: identifying the \nelements of a missing and exploited child case investigations; applying \nresearch regarding missing and exploited child case investigations and \nanalyzing successful and unsuccessful investigative techniques; and \neducating about the national resources available to assist local \nefforts in a missing and exploited child case investigation.\n  The Jimmy Ryce Center will also make it a priority to provide \ncomprehensive nationwide training for law enforcement regarding report \ntaking and NCIC entry of missing child information. And, the training \ncenter will expand current training done by the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention and coordinate programs in all 50 \nStates and the District of Columbia.\n  I am confident the bill will have the support of the Department of \nJustice. It already has the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nand I ask unanimous consent that the FOP's letter, as well a copy of \nthe bill, be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1652\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) an investigation to find a missing child presents \n     unique circumstances for law enforcement agencies, including \n     the need for specialized training and the capability of swift \n     response to maximize the chances for the safe recovery of the \n     child;\n       (2) local law enforcement officials often lack experience \n     and are unaware of the Federal resources available to assist \n     in the investigation of cases involving a missing child; and\n       (3) a national training facility should be established to \n     assist State and local law enforcement agencies in--\n       (A) providing comprehensive training in investigations of \n     cases involving missing or exploited children;\n       (B) ensuring uniform, consistent, and meaningful use of \n     reporting systems and processes; and\n       (C) promoting the use of vital national resources.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Peter Deutsch,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: On behalf of the 270,000 members of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police, this is to express our strong \n     support for your legislation to provide funding and \n     facilities to train state and local law enforcement officers \n     in investigative techniques for utilization in missing and \n     exploited children case.\n       As a member of the Board of the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children (NCMEC), I am thoroughly familiar with \n     the wonderful work of the Center, and with the strong bond \n     which the NCMEC has forged with state and local officers. The \n     proposed Jimmy Ryce Law Enforcement Training Center for the \n     Recovery of Missing Children, which would operate within the \n     framework of the NCMEC, can only enhance that relationship, \n     and will make it even more productive.\n       We thank both of you for your leadership on this issue, and \n     in the many other areas where both of you have weighed in on \n     the side of tough yet progressive law enforcement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gilbert G. Gallegos,\n                                       National President.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 1653. A bill to prohibit imports into the United States of grain \nand grain products from Canada, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the import prohibition act of 1996\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on another matter, we learned yesterday \nthat Canada is banning all imports of United States durum as a result \nof the karnal bunt fungus found in Arizona. Mr. President, this ban \nmeans that no durum may be exported to Canada. Durum is the wheat that \nmakes pasta. So all the pasta lovers should understand most of the \ndurum that makes pasta in this country is grown in North Dakota. \nEighty-seven percent of the durum wheat that makes pasta is grown in \nNorth Dakota. And our Canadian friends from the north have now banned \nall imports of U.S. durum wheat. What does that mean? Well, it means a \nlot.\n  It means that our durum is not going to be able to leave through the \nGreat Lakes. That is where the grain that is grown in North Dakota and \nthe rest of the Midwest is transferred to what we call lakers, ships \nthat go on the lake to\n\n[[Page S3160]]\n\ntransoceanic vessels. Those transfers are made in Canadian ports.\n  This ban will mean that our grain cannot leave through those Canadian \nports. That means our grain is going to have to go south through the \ngulf adding a lot of cost and expense. That means we are going to be \nless competitive against the Canadians.\n  Mr. President, one might understand what the Canadians are doing here \nif in some way they were threatened. They themselves have acknowledged \nthey are not threatened. They themselves have acknowledged that karnal \nbunt cannot survive in the cold of Canada. And there is no karnal bunt \nthat has been found in the Midwest. The only place it was found was on \nisolated farms in some southwestern States.\n  So the Canadians are engaged, I believe, in a deception. They are \nsaying they are banning our exports of durum wheat through their ports \nto protect their producers. But by their own statements they know--and \nthey have acknowledged--that they are not threatened.\n  So what is really going on, Mr. President? I believe it is an attempt \nto secure a competitive advantage, and we should not allow it. We \nshould fight back.\n  Today, I am introducing two bills: One that will ban imports of \nCanadian durum until Canada drops its restriction on our grain. And the \nsecond bill would ban the imports of all cattle and beef from Canada \ngiven the fact that we have seen the mad cow disease develop in \nEngland. We know there have been shipments of cattle from England to \nCanada in the past.\n  If they are going to threaten us because of karnal bunt found in \nArizona, we can threaten them in the same way and shut off all imports \nfrom Canada of their beef and their cattle because of the mad cow \nsyndrome in England when we know there have been shipments of beef from \nthat country to Canada.\n  It makes just as much sense to ban imports of cattle and beef from \nCanada where there is no known BSE as it does to ban imports of wheat \nfrom the upper midwest where there are no known outbreaks of karnal \nbunt.\n  That is equivalent treatment. That is standing up for America. I hope \nthat other of my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation \nto send a clear message to our neighbors to the north that we are not \ngoing to accept their refusal to take our exports of durum through \ntheir markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Canadian Government has imposed a ban on the \n     importation of durum wheat from the United States because of \n     an outbreak of karnal bunt in Arizona.\n       (2) The ban applies to all imports of durum wheat from the \n     United States, including wheat from States where no evidence \n     of karnal bunt has been found.\n       (3) No karnal bunt has been found in any wheat produced in \n     Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, or in the \n     Great Lakes region.\n       (4) The Canadian Government has stated that due to the cold \n     climate in Canada there is no risk of an outbreak of karnal \n     bunt in Canada.\n       (5) Canada's ban on shipments of durum wheat through the \n     Great Lakes ports is unjustifiable and the ban places \n     unnecessary restrictions on shipments of other wheat through \n     the Great Lakes ports.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST ENTRY OF CERTAIN CANADIAN GRAIN \n                   PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 15 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the President shall prohibit the \n     entry, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of all \n     grain products (described in heading 1001 or 1101.00.00 of \n     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) which \n     are produced, grown, or manufactured in Canada.\n       (b) Duration.--The prohibition imposed under subsection (a) \n     shall remain in full force and effect until the Secretary of \n     Agriculture and the United States Trade Representative--\n       (1) determine that Canada has removed the prohibition on \n     imports described in subsection (c), and that durum wheat \n     products produced in the United States are permitted full and \n     fair access to the markets of such country; and\n       (2) submit to the Congress the determination under \n     paragraph (1), together with the reasons underlying the \n     determination.\n       (c) Prohibition Described.--The prohibition described in \n     this subsection is a prohibition on the importation of durum \n     wheat products produced in the United States where there is \n     not sufficient evidence that karnal bunt exists with respect \n     to such wheat.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Bradley):\n  S. 1654. A bill to apply equal standards to certain foreign made and \ndomestically produced handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the junk gun violence protection act of 1996\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing, along with my \ndistinguished colleague from New Jersey, Senator Bradley, a bill to \ngive equal treatment to the manufacture, transfer, and possession of \nboth foreign made and domestically produced junk guns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1654\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Junk Gun Violence Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the prohibition on the importation of handguns that are \n     not generally recognized as particularly suitable for or \n     readily adaptable to sporting purposes, often described as \n     junk guns or Saturday night specials, has led to the creation \n     of a high-volume market for these weapons that are \n     domestically manufactured;\n       (2) traffic in junk guns constitutes a serious threat to \n     public welfare and to law enforcement officers, and the use \n     of such firearms is increasing;\n       (3) junk guns are used disproportionately in the commission \n     of crimes;\n       (4) of the firearms traced in 1995, the 3 firearms most \n     commonly traced to crimes were junk guns; and\n       (5) the domestic manufacture, transfer, and possession of \n     junk guns should be restricted.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON MANUFACTURE, TRANSFER, AND POSSESSION \n                   OF CERTAIN HANDGUNS.\n\n       (a) Restriction.--Section 922 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(y)(1) It shall be unlawful for a person to manufacture, \n     transfer, or possess a junk gun that has been shipped or \n     transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to--\n       ``(A) the possession or transfer of any junk gun otherwise \n     lawfully possessed under Federal law on the date of the \n     enactment of the Junk Gun Violence Protection Act;\n       ``(B) any firearm or replica of a firearm that has been \n     rendered permanently inoperative;\n       ``(C) the manufacture for, transfer to, or possession by \n     the United States or a State or a department or agency of the \n     United States, or a State or a department, agency, or \n     political subdivision of a State, or a transfer to or \n     possession by a law enforcement officer employed by such an \n     entity for law enforcement purposes (whether on or off duty); \n     or\n       ``(D) the manufacture, transfer, or possession of a junk \n     gun by a licensed manufacturer or licensed importer for the \n     purposes of testing or experimentation authorized by the \n     Secretary.''.\n       (b) Definition of Junk Gun.--Section 921(a) of title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new paragraph:\n       ``(33)(A) The term `junk gun' means any firearm that is not \n     described in section 925(d)(3), and any regulations issued \n     under such section.''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3157-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3160-S3161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n  At the request of Mr. Simon, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Pell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 704, a bill to \nestablish the Gambling Impact Study Commission.\n\n\n                                S. 1219\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n[Mr. Kohl] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1219, a bill to reform the \nfinancing of Federal elections, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1483\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kyl, the names of the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. \nThomas], the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], and the Senator from \nKansas [Mr. Dole] were added as cosponsors of S. 1483, a bill to \ncontrol crime, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1487\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gramm, the names of the Senator from Nevada \n[Mr.\n\n[[Page S3161]]\n\nReid], the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], and the Senator \nfrom Kansas [Mr. Dole] were added as cosponsors of S. 1487, a bill to \nestablish a demonstration project to provide that the Department of \nDefense may receive Medicare reimbursement for health care services \nprovided to certain medicare-eligible covered military beneficiaries.\n\n\n                                S. 1612\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the names of the Senator from New \nHampshire [Mr. Smith], and the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 1612, a bill to provide for increased \nmandatory minimum sentences for criminals possessing firearms, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1623\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the names of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Simon] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 1623, a bill to establish a National Tourism Board and \na National Tourism Organization, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 26\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Oklahoma \n[Mr. Inhofe] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent Resolution \n26, a concurrent resolution to authorize the Newington-Cropsey \nFoundation to erect on the Capitol Grounds and present to Congress and \nthe people of the United States a monument dedicated to the Bill of \nRights.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 215\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Wyden] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 215, a \nresolution to designate June 19, 1996, as ``National Baseball Day.''\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 226\n\n  At the request of Mr. Domenici, the names of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Coats], the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], the Senator from \nArizona [Mr. McCain], the Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Simpson], and the \nSenator from New Jersey [Mr. Bradley] were added as cosponsors of \nSenate Resolution 226, a resolution to proclaim the week of October 13 \nthrough October 19, 1996, as ``National Character Counts Week''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3160-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3161-S3162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 50--RELATIVE TO KOSOVA\n\n  Mr. DOLE (for himself, Mr. Pell, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Pressler, Mr. \nLevin, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following concurrent resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 50\n\n       Whereas the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic \n     of Yugoslavia, adopted in 1946 and the amended Yugoslav \n     Constitution adopted in 1974, described the status of Kosova \n     as one of the 8 constituent territorial units of the Yugoslav \n     Federation;\n       Whereas the political rights of the Albanian majority in \n     Kosova were curtailed when the Government of Yugoslavia \n     illegally amended the Yugoslav federal constitution without \n     the consent of the people of Kosova on March 23, 1989, \n     revoking Kosova's autonomous status;\n       Whereas in 1990, the Parliament and Government of Kosova \n     were abolished by further unlawful amendments to the \n     Constitution of Yugoslavia;\n       Whereas in September 1990, a referendum on the question of \n     independence for Kosova was held in which 87 percent of those \n     eligible to participate voted and 99 percent of those voting \n     supported independence for Kosova;\n       Whereas in May 1992, a Kosovar national parliament and \n     President, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, were freely and fairly \n     elected, but were not permitted to assemble in Kosova;\n       Wherease according to the State Department Country Reports \n     on Human Rights for 1995, ``police repression continued at a \n     high level against the ethnic Albanians of Kosova * * * and \n     reflected a general campaign to keep [those] who are not \n     ethnic Serbs intimidated and unable to exercise basic human \n     and civil rights'';\n       Whereas over 100,000 ethnic Albanians employed in the \n     public sector have been removed from their jobs and replaced \n     by Serbs since 1989;\n       Whereas the government in Belgrade has severely restricted \n     the access of ethnic Albanians in Kosova to all levels of \n     education, especially in the Albanian language;\n       Whereas the Organization on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe observers dispatched to Kosova in 1991 were expelled \n     by the government in Belgrade in July 1993, and have not been \n     reinstated as called for in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 855 of August 1993;\n       Whereas following the departure of such observers, \n     international human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in abuses;\n       Whereas the United Nations announced on February 27, 1995, \n     that Serbia had granted it permission to open a Belgrade \n     office to monitor human rights in Serbia and Kosova;\n       Whereas Congress directed the State Department to establish \n     a United States Information Agency (U.S.I.A.) cultural center \n     in Prishtina, Kosova, in section 223 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993;\n       Whereas Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced on \n     February 27, 1996, that Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic has \n     agreed to the establishment of such center and that \n     preparations for the establishment of the center are \n     proceeding;\n       Whereas with the signing of the Dayton agreement on Bosnia, \n     future peace in the Balkans hinges largely on a settlement of \n     the status of Kosova; and\n       Whereas the President has explicitly warned the Government \n     of Serbia that the United States is prepared to respond in \n     the event of escalated conflict in Kosova caused by Serbia: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the situation in Kosova must be resolved before the \n     outer wall of sanctions against Serbia is lifted and Serbia \n     is able to return to the international community;\n       (2) the human rights of the people of Kosova must be \n     restored to levels guaranteed by international law;\n       (3) the United States should support the legitimate claims \n     of the people of Kosova to determine their own political \n     future;\n       (4) international observers should be returned to Kosova as \n     soon as possible;\n       (5) the elected government of Kosova should be permitted to \n     meet and exercise its legitimate mandate as elected \n     representatives of the people of Kosova;\n       (6) all individuals whose employment was terminated on the \n     basis of their ethnicity should be reinstated to their \n     previous positions;\n       (7) the education system in Kosova should be reopened to \n     all residents of Kosova regardless of ethnicity and the \n     majority ethnic Albanian population should be allowed to \n     educate its youth in its native tongue;\n       (8) progress toward the establishment of a United States \n     Information Agency cultural center in Prishtina, Kosova, is \n     to be commended and the Secretary of State should redouble \n     efforts to open the center as soon as possible; and\n       (9) the President should appoint a special envoy to aid in \n     negotiating a resolution to the crisis in Kosova.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent resolution \nregarding human rights in Kosova and in support of resolving the crisis \nin Kosova. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Pell, Senator D'Amato, \nSenator Pressler, Senator Levin and Senator Feingold.\n  This resolution is being submitted today in the House by \nRepresentatives Engel, Molinari, and King. We are submitting this \nresolution because Kosova has been pushed to the sidelines by this \nadministration--as well as the previous administration. And, without \nresolving the crisis in Kosova there is little, if any, hope of \nachieving a lasting peace in the Balkans.\n  This resolution cites the course of events since 1989, during which \nthe Albanian people in Kosova have been denied their fundamental human \nand political rights by the Milosevic regime. The 1995 State Department \ncountry human rights reports stated the following about the deplorable \nsituation in Kosova, and I quote, ``Police repression continued at a \nhigh level against the ethnic Albanians of Kosova, and reflected a \ngeneral campaign to keep [those] who are not ethnic Serbs intimidated \nand unable to exercise basic human and civil rights.''\n  Since martial law was imposed in Kosova more than 7 years ago, \nAlbanians have been fired from their jobs, restricted access to all \nlevels of education, especially in their own language, denied basic \npolitical rights, and subjected to severe human rights abuses, \nincluding torture.\n\n  Among other things, this resolution calls on the Clinton \nadministration to maintain the so-called outer wall of sanctions \nagainst Serbia until the situation in Kosova is resolved, to redouble \nefforts to open a USIA cultural center in Pristina, Kosova, and to \nappoint a special envoy to aid in negotiating a resolution to the \ncrisis in Kosova.\n  Since the Dayton accords were signed, there are those who claim that \npeace in the Balkans has been achieved. That is wishful thinking. Let \nme be clear: There will be no lasting peace or stability in the Balkans \nunless and until the situation in Kosova has been resolved. Indeed, \nignoring Kosova could lead to yet another violent conflict that could \nbring in our NATO allies on opposite sides. Therefore, the\n\n[[Page S3162]]\n\nUnited States must pressure the Milosevic regime diplomatically and \neconomically to end its repression of the 2 million Albanians in \nKosova.\n  Mr. President, we must bring Kosova from the back burner to the front \nburner. We need a comprehensive approach to the Balkans which includes \nKosova. I hope that the submission of this resolution will send a \nmessage to the administration that it is high time to exercise U.S. \nleadership on this critical matter.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dole in \nsubmitting this resolution on Kosova. Congressman Engel has taken the \nlead in submitting a companion resolution in the House.\n  I remain concerned about the situation in Kosova, where the majority \nAlbanian population continues to suffer severe human rights abuses. If \nleft unchecked, the situation in Kosova could be the spark that ignites \nanother powder keg of violence in the former Yugoslavia.\n  Since 1989, more than 100,000 ethnic Albanians employed in the public \nsector have been removed from their jobs and replaced by Serbs. The \nBelgrade Government has severely restricted the access of ethnic \nAlbanians in Kosova to all levels of education, and has pursued a \ngeneral campaign of intimidation and repression. This country has \ninvested a great deal in creating and maintaining peace in Bosnia. Our \ndiplomats and our military personnel are to be commended for the fine \njob that they are doing with regard to Bosnia. I am concerned, however, \nthat if the situation in Kosova is not resolved, our diplomatic, \neconomic, and military investment in Bosnia will be for naught. A \ncomprehensive solution to the former Yugoslavia must address Kosova.\n  This resolution is designed to focus attention on Kosova--as a key \ncomponent to stability in the region. It expresses the sense of \nCongress that among other things, the situation in Kosova must be \nresolved before the outer wall of sanctions be lifted against Serbia. \nIn other words, Serbia would continue to be denied access to \ninternational financial institution assistance and to be denied full \ndiplomatic relations with the United States and its allies pending the \nresolution of Kosova and other issues. There are signs that \ninternational consensus on maintaining this outer wall is cracking, and \nthis resolution is therefore useful in keeping attention focused on \nKosova. I believe it is important to send a signal to Serbian President \nMilosevic that he cannot hope to bring Serbia back into the \ninternational community's fold unless and until he agrees to address \nthe issue of Kosova.\n  The resolution also welcomes the progress that has been made toward \nthe establishment of a USIA office in Kosova. As one who sponsored \nlegislation several years ago that authorized the creation of such a \ncenter, I am particularly interested in ensuring that the United States \nestablish a presence in Kosova. Secretary Christopher should be \ncommended for securing President Milosevic's approval to establish such \na center.\n  The resolution also calls on Serbia to allow international observers \nto return to Kosova, and urges the President to appoint a special envoy \nto help in negotiating a resolution to the Kosova issue.\n  I believe it is in our interest to maintain a spotlight on Kosova, \nand I would encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3161-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3162-S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

The CBO \nestimate states that enactment of S. 1467 would not affect direct \nspending or receipts and does not contain any unfunded mandates.\n  The estimate follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 27, 1996.\n     Hon.

Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply \n     to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

Bill title: Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System \n     Act of 1995.\n       3. Bill status: As reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources on March 15, 1996.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would authorize the construction \n     of the Fort Peck Rural County Water Supply System and \n     authorize assistance to the Fort Peck Rural County Water \n     District, Inc., a nonprofit corporation, for the planning, \n     design, and construction of the proposed water system.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: Assuming \n     appropriation of the authorized amounts for fiscal year 1997, \n     S. 1467 would result in discretionary spending totaling $6.6 \n     million over the 1996-2000 period. This estimate reflects the \n     basic authorization of $5.8 million, increased, as specified \n     in the bill, by the estimated impact of inflation during the \n     time between October 1, 1994, and the construction period. \n     Outlays are estimated based on historical spending rates for \n     similar water projects. Funding for the Fort Peck project \n     would constitute new spending--to date, no amounts have been \n     appropriate for this project.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       1996     1997     1998     1999     2000 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSpending subject to appropriations action:                                                                      \n    Authorization level............................................        0        7        0        0        0\n    Estimated outlays..............................................        0        1        5        1        0\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The costs of this bill fall within budget function 300.\n       6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       7. Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal \n     governments: S. 1467 contains no intergovernmental mandates \n     as defined in Public Law 104-4 and would impose no direct \n     costs on state, local, or tribal governments.\n       The bill would limit the federal share of this project to \n     80 percent. The Fort Peck Rural County Water District would \n     have to provide matching funds of about $1.5 million in order \n     to receive the full amount of federal assistance authorized. \n     This project would be voluntary on the part of the district, \n     however.\n       8. Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill would \n     impose no new federal/private sector mandates, as defined in \n     Public Law 104-4.\n       9. Previous CBO estimate: None.\n       10. Estimate prepared by: Federal cost estimate: Gary \n     Brown. State and Local Government Impact: Marjorie Miller. \n     Private Sector Impact: Patrice Gordon.\n       11.

On March 1, 1996, in a \nspecial ceremony in Oklahoma City, Marshal Lee was presented the U.S. \nMarshals Service's Distinguished Service Award for the district office \nshe heads. I am proud to note that I nominated Marshal Lee, who was \nsworn into office by President Clinton in 1994.\n  Before her current appointment, Marshal Lee served as a Deputy U.S. \nMarshal and as a Special Agent with the Internal Revenue Service. \nMarshal Lee studied criminal justice and accounting at Grand Valley \nState University, in Allendale, MI. Marshal Lee was nominated for the \nLaura Cross Award, the Federal Government's highest honor for career \nachievement by a female law enforcement officer.\n  Marshal Lee's office was selected for the district award because of \nits leadership in accomplishing court security tasks within the \nconfines of a tight budget. The district office shuffled personnel, \ntravel and overtime expenses while continuing to provide exceptional \nsecurity. During the presentation of the award, Director Eduardo \nGonzalez noted the special security Marshal Lee's operation provided \nfor several judicial conferences and high-threat trials.\n  Despite diminishing resources, Marshal Lee and her office have \ncontinued to provide the exceptional security services for which the \nU.S. Marshals Service is known. I know that my Senate colleagues join \nme in congratulating U.S. Marshal Barbara C. Lee and the Western \nDistrict Office of Michigan for being awarded the U.S. Marshals \nService's Distinguished Service Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3163-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING THE ROTARY CLUB OF MERIDEN\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Rotary Club \nof Meriden, CT, on the occasion of their 75th anniversary.\n  On April 26, 1921, Meriden joined the nationwide movement of Rotary \nClubs under Charter 898. Numbering only 27 businessmen, the club had no \nidea then that they would grow into one of the pillars of the \ncommunity. Ever since their founding, the club has immersed itself in \nthe every-day life of Meriden, constantly striving to make the city a \nbetter place through the sponsoring of various activities and events.\n  The Rotary Club of Meriden reaches out to the people in numerous \nways. They were the first organization in the city to sponsor Little \nLeague Baseball, the great American game. The youth of Meriden are also \nassisted through college scholarships provided by the Rotary Club, as \nwell as through the Meriden Public Library Career Center, which the \nclub has long supported.\n  The Rotary Club not only contributes to Meriden's spiritual beauty, \nbut to its physical beauty as well. The club is responsible for \nplanting over one thousand trees in the city. They work closely with \nother humanitarian groups, either bell ringing for the Salvation Army \nor sponsoring bloodmobiles for the Red Cross.\n  The Rotary Club also strives to help those outside Meriden, its \ninfluence reaching as far as the international community. Their \nexchange study groups bring business and professional people to Meriden \nfrom countries such as France, Germany, and Japan, so that all may \nlearn from one another.\n  Meriden and the entire State of Connecticut is fortunate to have had \na group such as the Meriden Rotary Club in its service for 75 years. \nAnother 75 years of service and support is eagerly anticipated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3163-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3163-S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss one of the most \ndifficult issues facing our democracy--campaign finance reform. First, \nwe must recognize that our democratic system has come a long way in the \nlast 30 years. Information on who finances campaigns and how that money \nis spent is now available to any citizen. With the advance of the \nInternet, most of this information can be found through your home \ncomputer.\n  But, while disclosures laws passed in the 1970's have worked largely \nas intended, other reforms instituted at that time have created a new \nset of problems. In order to more clearly identify who was contributing \nto campaigns, Congress created a new mechanism for democratic \ninvolvement--Political Action Committees. Twenty years ago, PAC's were \nseen as positive vehicles to channel special interest dollars through \npublic organizations.\n\n[[Page S3164]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the proliferation of PAC's and special interest \ncontributions in our election system has overtaken most other forms of \ndemocratic involvement. Because of the high costs of running campaigns, \nespecially the cost of purchasing television ads, American political \ncampaign funding is dominated by special interest contributions.\n  It should not surprise us that the American public has become \nincreasingly cynical as this trend has become worse. This public \ndisillusionment contributes to pessimism about the future of our \nGovernment and has led to a disturbing lack of faith in our democratic \ninstitutions. Despite the good efforts of many grassroots citizen \norganizations and elected officials, every attempt in Congress to \nreform the campaign finance system since 1979 has failed.\n  This lack of progress is not the fault of one political party or one \nbranch of government. Democrats and Republicans have tried to push \nthrough meaningful reform for the last two decades, and reasonable \npeople can disagree about the best course for the future. But, this \ngridlock must not be allowed to stand any longer. The American public \nis demanding a fundamental change in the way campaigns are financed and \nwe must act this year to implement that change.\n  These are the reasons that I am cosponsoring S. 1219, the Senate \nCampaign Finance Reform Act. This legislation, sponsored by Senator \nMcCain and my Wisconsin colleague Russ Feingold, is the first \nmeaningful bipartisan campaign finance bill to be seriously considered \nin two decades. The fact that the House of Representatives has a \nsimilar bipartisan bill only adds credibility to this proposal.\n  S. 1219 strikes at the heart at much of what is wrong with our \ncampaign finance system: it eliminates PAC contributions; caps the \namounts that can be spent in campaigns; curtails the practice of \nbundling contributions; and closes the loopholes allowing so-called \n``soft money'' contributions. The legislation establishes many of these \nlimits through a voluntary system, thereby conforming with Supreme \nCourt rulings governing campaign financing.\n  Like many Senators, if I had drafted my own bill, I would have \nomitted some provisions of this legislation and included others. But \nany meaningful bipartisan reform must be a compromise between competing \nproposals. And campaign finance reform must be done in a bipartisan \nfashion--legislation crafted by one party and rammed through the \nCongress will not and should not get the support of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I recognize there are deep divisions among Members of \nCongress over the how to reform our campaign finance system. These \ndivisions have led to stalemate after stalemate over twenty years. And \nwithout serious reform the American public will continue to mistrust \nnot only the way we elect candidates, but the very fundamental precipes \nof our Government. This must not go on.\n  S. 1219 is the best option currently moving through the Congress to \nrenew America's faith in our elections and curtail the influence of \nspecial interest contributions. I am pleased to add my name as a \ncosponsor of this bill, and urge my colleagues to join us in this \nimportant effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3163-4", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO PLYMOUTH STATE COLLEGE ON THEIR 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n   Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nPlymouth State College on the occasion of their 125th anniversary. I \nwould like to congratulate this outstanding educational institution on \nreaching such an important milestone. The trustees, faculty, and \nstudents should be proud of the academic excellence and high education \nstandards the college represents; not just in the State of New \nHampshire but all over New England.\n  Located in the foothills of the White Mountains in New Hampshire, \nPlymouth State College, originally named the Plymouth Normal School, \nfirst opened its doors on March 15, 1871 to 80 students pursuing \nteaching degrees. Today, over 125 years later, 4,000 students attend \nPlymouth State College, pursuing degrees in the performing arts, the \nsciences, social work, languages, humanities, interdisciplinary \nstudies, the social sciences, business, and many other academic fields.\n  The history of Plymouth State College originally stemmed from the \nHolmes Plymouth Academy, which dates back to 1808, as one of the first \nteaching institutions in New England. In 1871, the academy buildings \nwere presented to the State of New Hampshire and the campus was renamed \nthe Plymouth Normal School. The school began to grow at a steady rate \nduring the late 1800's. Rounds Hall, which included a library and \nclassrooms, was dedicated in August 1891. The growth of the Normal \nSchool under Dr. Charles C. Rounds caused the State legislature to \nappropriate funds for a new dormitory called Normal Hall. During the \nturn of the century, the enrollment of the Normal School increased, \napproaching 150 students.\n  From 1911 to 1946, Dr. Ernest Silver served as the college's \nprincipal. In 1911, Dr. Silver hired the famous American poet and New \nHampshire native, Robert L. Frost, to teach psychology and the history \nof education. Robert Frost also shared Dr. Silver's residence, a house \nopposite Normal Hall that had recently been purchased. During Dr. \nSilver's administration, the school saw another period of campus \nexpansion and modernization including the opening of the new training \nschool providing added space in Rounds Hall for manual training and \nother classes. Two new dormitories were constructed, a modern library \nwas built, and facilities for recreation and physical education were \nimproved.\n  In 1939, Plymouth Normal School changed its name again to Plymouth \nTeacher's College. Construction and expansion increased during the \n1950's and the new Lamson Library was built across Highland Street in \n1964. Boyd Hall, a new fieldhouse and gym were built in 1968 and 1969. \nThe fieldhouse contains an indoor track, gymnasium, swimming pool, and \nother facilities for the physical education program at the college.\n  Just last year, the Hartman Union Building opened its new facility on \nthe property where the old high school once stood. This student center \ncontains a full-size court, weight room, snackbar, bookstore, the \ncollege radio station, the college newspaper, a sidewalk cafe, complete \nU.S. Postal Mail Service, and many more student services.\n  Most recently, Plymouth State College added a business program to the \nnumerous choices of degrees students can pursue at the college. Today's \npresident of the college, Donald Wharton, believes that every student \nmust receive a strong education and specialized instruction in a \nparticular field. The faculty and staff at Plymouth State College are \nproud of the fine reputation the teaching program has received over the \nyears, and the specialized degrees in liberal arts majors.\n  Congratulations to 125 years of academic excellence. Plymouth State \nCollege has provided outstanding instruction and a superior learning \nenvironment for New Hampshire students for years. Best wishes for \ncontinued success and expansion in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3164-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3164-S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID PACKARD\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the Nation lost a great leader \nTuesday with the death of David Packard. He was the first and greatest \nof the acquisition reformers in the top reaches of the Pentagon. As \nDeputy Secretary of Defense in the first Nixon administration, he \nfostered competition in a wide range of programs, including the Air \nForce fighter program that produced the F-16 and F-18. He helped found \nthe Defense Systems Management College at Fort Belvoir in order to \nbring modern management techniques to the defense acquisition system. \nAnd throughout the almost quarter century since he stepped down as \nDeputy Secretary of Defense, he continued in an advisory capacity to \nthe most senior reaches of Government to argue for the need for change \nin the way the Pentagon develops and buys weapon systems.\n  It is perhaps fitting that under Secretary Bill Perry's leadership, \nthe reforms which Mr. Packard advocated for so long are now taking firm \nroot throughout the military services. Dr. Perry and all the reformers \nwith whom I have had the pleasure of working during my 13 years service \nin the Senate\n\n[[Page S3165]]\n\npoint to David Packard as the first to show the way toward a more \nrational acquisition system.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful that I was able to work with David \nPackard over the last decade on several important issues. He was at an \nage when most people stop work and take up retirement. But not David \nPackard. He would answer the call of public service whenever it \nsounded. He suffered from a bad back, and taking transcontinental plane \nflights forced him to endure real pain to serve his country, but serve \nhe did.\n  David Packard always was focused on the art of the possible. He knew \nthat change was incremental and he would take what progress he could \nmake today to build for another day. I first met him in 1985. He came \nto me, a Democrat then in the minority here in the Senate, because I \nhad indicated an interest in a report he had written in 1983 for the \nWhite House Science Council. Its topic was how to improve the Federal \nGovernment-operated research laboratories. He had called for \nsignificant changes in personnel policy, in acquisition of laboratory \nequipment, and in improving laboratory infrastructure.\n  The most important change he and his panel had advocated was to allow \nall the laboratories to go to a more flexible personnel system along \nthe lines of the system then in place at the Naval Weapons Center at \nChina Lake, CA. Mr. Packard had been frustrated by the slow pace of the \nReagan administration in considering his panel's proposals. He wanted \nto jumpstart congressional consideration with my help and that of then \nCongressman Don Fuqua, another Democrat.\n  Unfortunately, all we were able to win in the short run was the \nadoption of a flexible personnel system at the National Bureau of \nStandards, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology. As \npredicted, that personnel system has worked very well and helped NIST \nmaintain its leadership in a broad range of technologies. As usual, \nDavid Packard was ahead of his time. What he recommended more than a \ndecade ago on lab personnel reform is now part of the effort to \nreinvent the Pentagon's laboratories.\n  Mr. President, I will miss David Packard's wisdom and guidance, and \nso will many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. There's a \npassage from T. E. Lawrence's book Seven Pillars of Wisdom, which \nreads:\n\n       All men dream, but not equally. Some dream by night in the \n     dusty recesses of their minds, and wake in the day to find it \n     is vanity. But the dreamers of the day are dangerous men. For \n     they act their dream with open eyes to make it possible.\n\n  David Packard was a dreamer of the day who deserves to be remembered \nby a grateful Nation for the dreams he made possible. I am glad to have \nknown him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3164-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SAGINAW HIGH SCHOOL TROJANS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Saginaw \nHigh School boys basketball team. On Saturday, March 23, 1996, the \nTrojans from Saginaw, MI, won the Michigan Class A State basketball \nchampionship over Southfield Lathrup by a score of 67 to 60. The game \ntook place in front of 11,000 raucous fans at Michigan State \nUniversity's Breslin Center.\n  The Trojans showed great character in their journey to the State \nchampionship. In their semifinal game, the Trojans rebounded from a 19-\npoint deficit to win and move on to the championship. Once again in the \nchampionship game, the Trojans had to come back from a large deficit to \nwin--this time they were behind by 12 points.\n  In the championship game, the Trojans succeeded against great odds. \nThe story of David and Goliath comes to mind when envisioning the game \nbetween Saginaw and Southfield Lathrup. Saginaw High faced a team with \na considerable size advantage, but the Trojans were not intimidated and \ncontinued to play the way they had all season long, stressing teamwork \nand defense. The Trojans caused 21 turnovers, scoring 22 points off \nthose turnovers.\n  The Trojans' hard work and determination which marked their \nchampionship victory is nothing new to those familiar with the team. \nThe Trojans' coach, Marshall Thomas, said after the game, ``No other \nteam will outwork us.'' The Trojans have surely shown us how hard they \nwill work and what heart they have in coming back from two large \ndeficits to win the Michigan State championship.\n  But it wasn't just the team who showed great heart in winning the \nState championship, as the players and coaches are quick to point out. \nSupport from the students, faculty and community was vital for the \nTrojans to overcome such long odds. Trojans' fans traveled all over the \nState to cheer their team on to victory. The fans continued to give \ntheir team strong support regardless of the score of the game.\n  I know that my Senate colleagues join me in congratulating Saginaw \nHigh School on winning the Michigan Class A State basketball \nchampionship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3165-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE DEATH OF HUNG WO CHING\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a very dear \nfriend and pioneer Hawaii businessman, Hung Wo Ching, Aloha Airgroup \nvice chairman, who died on March 26, 1996, in Honolulu. Since 1958, Mr. \nChing served on the interisland carrier's board of directors and held a \nnumber of executive positions with the company. Under his leadership, \nAloha Airlines Inc. grew from an upstart airline to become the dominant \ninterisland carrier in the State of Hawaii.\n  Hung Wo Ching was raised in Hawaii by immigrant parents from Canton, \nChina. He graduated from Honolulu's McKinley High School in 1931 and \nattended the University of Hawaii. Following his freshman year, he \nstudied liberal arts at Yenching University in Beijing, China.\n  In 1935, he returned to the United States and completed his \nundergraduate education at Utah State University, where he earned a \nbachelor's degree in agricultural economics. In 1945, he received his \ndoctorate in agricultural economics from Cornell University. When he \nwas 41 years old, he attended Harvard University as a visiting scholar.\n  In 1945, Mr. Ching traveled to Tientsin, China to start a sugarbeet \nindustry. The outbreak of civil war in China 2 years later put an end \nto those dreams, and he returned to Hawaii to concentrate on his real \nestate investments. Shortly after his return to Hawaii, the founder of \nTrans Pacific Airlines encouraged him to invest in his upstart airline.\n  In addition to being on Aloha's board of directors, Mr. Ching was \nalso a director for Bishop Insurance of Hawaii, Inc., and the chairman \nof the board of directors of Diamond Head Memorial Park and Nuuanu \nMemorial Park. He was an honorary trustee of the U.S. Committee for \nEconomic Development and the Bishop Museum, and a member of the \nadvisory councils of Cornell University and Utah State University. He \nwas a member of the Judicial Council of the Supreme Court of Hawaii, \nthe Hawaiian Civic Club, and the advisory board of Liliuokalani Trust.\n  Over the years, Mr. Ching has held trusteeships and directorships \nwith many Hawaii companies and charitable foundations, including Bishop \nEstate, Bank of Hawaii, Alexander and Baldwin, Matson Navigation Co., \nHawaiian Telephone, Hawaiian Life Insurance Co., Ltd., Hawaiian Western \nSteel, Ltd., and Hauoli Sales, Ltd.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in paying \ntribute to the memory of Hung Wo Ching, and pass along our deepest \nsympathies to his wife, Elizabeth, and his children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3165-2", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3165-S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE LEARNING WINDOW\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Newsweek magazine on February 19, \n1996, published an article regarding research that is underway by \nseveral pediatric neurobiologists in the United States on the \ndevelopment of a child's brain. The research examined the significance \nof early childhood experiences, particularly for children ages 0-3, on \nthe development of the brain.\n  According to researchers, ``it's the experiences of early childhood, \ndetermining which neurons are used, that wire the circuit of the brain \nas surely as a programmer at a keyboard reconfigures the circuits in a \ncomputer. Which keys that are typed--which experiences a child ahs--\ndetermines whether the child grows up to be\n\n[[Page S3166]]\n\nintelligent or dull, fearful or self-assured, articulate or tongue-\ntied.'' According to the researchers, almost anything is possible \nprovided children are exposed to the right experiences at an early age. \nAs one researcher, Harry Chugani of Wayne State University remarked, \n``early experiences are powerful, they can completely change the way a \nperson turns out.''\n  Mr. President, the findings of these neurobiologists support a much \ncloser examination by Congress of whether we are providing sufficient \nsupport at the Federal level for Head Start programs, and especially \nthe Zero-to-Three initiative for infants and toddlers. As my colleagues \nmay recall, during consideration of Head Start reauthorization in 1994, \nauthority for a new infant and toddler initiative was adopted as part \nof the reauthorization of Head Start programs. Under the \nreauthorization, 3 percent of total appropriations for fiscal year \n1995--$3.5 billion--was set aside for Zero-to-Three programs.\n  Currently, funding for the Zero-to-Three initiative totals $106 \nmillion. By 1998, the level of funding for the Zero-to-Three initiative \nwill increase to 5 percent of total appropriations. President Clinton \nhas requested $3.9 billion for Head Start in his fiscal year 1997 \nbudget. Under Head Start fiscal year 1995 appropriations, more than \n750,000 children between the ages of 3 and 4 are participating in Head \nStart programs nationwide.\n  Mr. President, the research of neurobiologists suggests that we may \nbe missing an opportunity to ensure that our children develop to their \nfullest potential during the early years in life, ages 0-3. The \nneurobiologists point out that there is a narrow window of opportunity \nto develop the brain's potential and that to wait until the ages of 3 \nand 4 when most children begin Head Start programs may be too late to \nhave a significant impact on the brain's development.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine the research regarding the \ndevelopment of a child's brain that is discussed in the February 19 \nissue of Newsweek. I ask that the text of the article from Newsweek \nappear in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Feb. 19, 1996]\n\n                           Your Child's Brain\n\n                           (By Sharon Begley)\n\n(A baby's brain is a work in progress, trillions of neurons waiting to \nbe wired into a mind. The experiences of childhood, pioneering research \nshows, help form the brain's circuits--for music and math, language and \n                                emotion)\n\n       You hold your newborn so his sky-blue eyes are just inches \n     from the brightly patterned wallpaper, ZZZt: a neuron from \n     his retina makes an electrical connection with one in his \n     brain's visual cortex. You gently touch his palm with a \n     clothespin; he grasps it, drops it, and you return it to him \n     with soft words and a smile. Crackle: neurons from his hand \n     strengthen their connection to those in his sensory-motor \n     cortex. He cries in the night; you feed him, holding his gaze \n     because nature has seen to it that the distance from a \n     parent's crooked elbow to his eyes exactly matches the \n     distance at which a baby focuses. Zap: neurons in the brain's \n     amygdala send pulses of electricity through the circuits that \n     control emotion. You hold him on your lap and talk . . . and \n     neurons from his ears start hard-wiring connections to the \n     auditory cortex.\n       And you thought you were just playing with your kid.\n       When a baby comes into the world her brain is a jumble of \n     neurons, all waiting to be woven into the intricate tapestry \n     of the mind. Some of the neurons have already been hard-\n     wired, by the genes in the fertilized egg, into circuits that \n     command breathing or control heartbeat, regulate body \n     temperature or produce reflexes. But trillions upon trillions \n     more are like the Pentium chips in a computer before the \n     factory preloads the software. They are pure and of almost \n     infinite potential, unprogrammed circuits that might one day \n     compose rap songs and do calculus, erupt in fury and melt in \n     ecstasy. If the neurons are used, they become integrated into \n     the circuitry of the brain by connecting to other neurons; if \n     they are not used, they may die. It is the experiences of \n     childhood, determining which neurons are used, that wire the \n     circuits of the brain as surely as a programmer at a keyboard \n     reconfigures the circuits in a computer. Which keys are \n     typed--which experiences a child has--determines whether the \n     child grows up to be intelligent or dull, fearful or self-\n     assured, articulate or tongue-tied. Early experiences are so \n     powerful, says pediatric neurobiologist Harry Chugani of \n     Wayne State University, that ``they can completely change the \n     way a person turns out.''\n       By adulthood the brain is crisscrossed with more than 100 \n     billion neurons, each reaching out to thousands of others so \n     that, all told, the brain has more than 100 trillion \n     connections. It is those connections--more than the number of \n     galaxies in the known universe--that give the brain its \n     unrivaled powers. The traditional view was that the wiring \n     diagram is predetermined, like one for a new house, by the \n     genes in the fertilized egg. Unfortunately, even though half \n     the genes--50,000--are involved in the central nervous system \n     in some way, there are not enough of them to specify the \n     brain's incomparably complex wiring. That leaves another \n     possibility: genes might determine only the brain's main \n     circuits, with something else shaping the trillions of finer \n     connections. That something else is the environment, the \n     myriad messages that the brain receives from the outside \n     world. According to the emerging paradigm, ``there are two \n     broad stages of brain wiring,'' says developmental \n     neurobiologist Carla Shatz of the University of California, \n     Berkeley: ``an early period, when experience is not required, \n     and a later one, when it is.''\n       Yet, once wired, there are limits to the brain's ability to \n     create itself. Time limits. Called ``critical periods,'' they \n     are windows of opportunity that nature flings open, starting \n     before birth, and then slams shut, one by one, with every \n     additional candle on the child's birthday cake. In the \n     experiments that gave birth to this paradigm in the 1970, \n     Torsten Wiesel and David Hubel found that sewing shut one eye \n     of a newborn kitten rewired its brain: so few neurons \n     connected from the shut eye to the visual cortex that the \n     animal was blind even after its eye was reopened. Such \n     rewiring did not occur in adult cats whose eyes were shut. \n     Conclusion: there is a short, early period when circuits \n     connect the retina to the visual cortex. When brain regions \n     mature dictates how long they stay malleable. Sensory areas \n     mature in early childhood; the emotional limbic system is \n     wired by puberty; the frontal lobes--seat of understanding--\n     develop at least through the age of 16.\n       The implications of this new understanding are at once \n     promising and disturbing. They suggest that, with the right \n     input at the right time, almost anything is possible. But \n     they imply, too, that if you miss the window you're playing \n     with a handicap. They offer an explanation of why the gains a \n     toddler makes in Head Start are so often evanescent: this \n     intensive instruction begins too late to fundamentally rewire \n     the brain. And they make clear the mistake of postponing \n     instruction in a second language. As Chugani asks, ``What \n     idiot decreed that foreign-language instruction not begin \n     until high school?''\n       Neurobiologists are still at the dawn of understanding \n     exactly which kinds of experiences, or sensory input, wire \n     the brain in which ways. They know a great deal about the \n     circuit for vision. It has a neuron-growth spurt at the age \n     of 2 to 4 months, which corresponds to when babies start to \n     really notice the world, and peaks at 8 months, when each \n     neuron is connected to an astonishing 15,000 other neurons. A \n     baby whose eyes are clouded by cataracts from birth will, \n     despite cataract-removal surgery at the age of 2, be forever \n     blind. For other systems, researchers know what happens, but \n     not--at the level of neurons and molecules--how. They \n     nevertheless remain confident that cognitive abilities work \n     much like sensory ones, for the brain is parsimonious in how \n     it conducts its affairs: a mechanism that works fine for \n     wiring vision is not likely to be abandoned when it comes to \n     circuits for music. ``Connections are not forming willy-\n     nilly,'' says Dale Purves of Duke University, ``but are \n     promoted by activity.''\n\n\n                                Language\n\n       Before there are words, in the world of a newborn, there \n     are sounds. In English they are phonemes such as sharp ba's \n     and da's, drawn-out ee's and ll's and sibilant sss's. In \n     Japanese they are different--barked hi's, merged rr/ll's. \n     When a child hears a phoneme over and over, neurons from his \n     ear stimulate the formation of dedicated connections in his \n     brain's auditory cortex. This ``perceptual map,'' explains \n     Patricia Kuhl of the University of Washington, reflects \n     the apparent distance--and thus the similarity--between \n     sounds. So in English-speakers, neurons in the auditory \n     cortex that respond to ``ra'' lie far from those that \n     respond to ``la.'' But for Japanese, where the sounds are \n     nearly identical, neurons that respond to ``ra'' are \n     practically intertwined, like L.A. freeway spaghetti, with \n     those for ``la.'' As a result, a Japanese-speaker will \n     have trouble distinguishing the two sounds.\n       Researchers find evidence of these tendencies across many \n     languages. By 6 months of age, Kuhl reports, infants in \n     English-speaking homes already have different auditory maps \n     (as shown by electrical measurements that identify which \n     neurons respond to different sounds) from those in Swedish-\n     speaking homes. Children are functionally deaf to sounds \n     absent from their native tongue. The map is completed by the \n     first birthday. ``By 12 months,'' says Kuhl, ``infants have \n     lost the ability to discriminate sounds that are not \n     significant in their language, and their babbling has \n     acquired the sound of their language.''\n       Kuhl's findings help explain why learning a second language \n     after, rather than with, the first is so difficult. ``The \n     perceptual map of the first language constrains the learning \n     of a second,'' she says. In other words, the circuits are \n     already wired for Spanish, and the remaining undedicated \n     neurons have lost their ability to form basic new connections \n     for, say, Greek. A child taught a second language after the \n     age of 10 or so is unlikely\n\n[[Page S3167]]\n\n     ever to speak it like a native. Kuhl's work also suggests why \n     related languages such as Spanish and French are easier to \n     learn than unrelated ones: more of the existing circuits can \n     do double duty.\n       With this basic circuitry established, a baby is primed to \n     turn sounds into words. The more words a child hears, the \n     faster she learns language, according to psychiatrist \n     Janellen Huttenlocher of the University of Chicago. Infants \n     whose mothers spoke to them a lot knew 131 more words at 20 \n     months than did babies of more taciturn, or less involved, \n     mothers; at 24 months, the gap had widened to 295 words. \n     (Presumably the findings would also apply to a father if he \n     were the primary caregiver.) It didn't matter which words the \n     mother used--monosyllables seemed to work. The sound of \n     words, it seems, builds up neural circuitry that can then \n     absorb more words, much as creating a computer file allows \n     the user to fill it with prose. ``There is a huge vocabulary \n     to be acquired,'' says Huttenlocher, ``and it can only be \n     acquired through repeated exposure to words.''\n\n\n                                 Music\n\n       Last October researchers at the University of Konstanz in \n     Germany reported that exposure to music rewires neural \n     circuits. In the brains of nine string players examined with \n     magnetic resonance imaging, the amount of somatosensory \n     cortex dedicated to the thumb and fifth finger of the left \n     hand--the fingering digits--was significantly larger than \n     in nonplayers. How long the players practiced each day did \n     not affect the cortical map. But the age at which they had \n     been introduced to their muse did: the younger the child \n     when she took up an instrument, the more cortex she \n     devoted to playing it.\n       Like other circuits formed early in life, the ones for \n     music endure. Wayne State's Chugani played the guitar as a \n     child, then gave it up. A few years ago he started taking \n     piano lessons with his young daughter. She learned easily, \n     but he couldn't get his fingers to follow his wishes. Yet \n     when Chugani recently picked up a guitar, he found to his \n     delight that ``the songs are still there,'' much like the \n     muscle memory for riding a bicycle.\n\n\n                             math and logic\n\n       At UC Irvine, Gordon Shaw suspected that all higher-order \n     thinking is characterized by similar patterns of neuron \n     firing. ``If you're working with little kids,'' says Shaw, \n     ``you're not going to teach them higher mathematics or chess. \n     But they are interested in and can process music.'' So Shaw \n     and Frances Rauscher gave 19 preschoolers piano or singing \n     lessons. After eight months, the researchers found, the \n     children ``dramatically improved in spatial reasoning,'' \n     compared with children given no music lessons, as shown in \n     their ability to work mazes, draw geometric figures and copy \n     patterns of two-color blocks. The mechanism behind the \n     ``Mozart effect'' remains murky, but Shaw suspects that when \n     children exercise cortical neurons by listening to classical \n     music, they are also strengthening circuits used for \n     mathematics. Music, says the UC team, ``excites the inherent \n     brain patterns and enhances their use in complex reasoning \n     tasks.''\n\n\n                                emotions\n\n       The trunk lines for the circuits controlling emotion are \n     laid down before birth. Then parents take over. Perhaps the \n     strongest influence is what psychiatrist Daniel Stern calls \n     attunement--whether caregivers ``play back a child's inner \n     feelings.'' If a baby's squeal of delight at a puppy is met \n     with a smile and hug, if her excitement at seeing a plane \n     overhead is mirrored, circuits for these emotions are \n     reinforced. Apparently, the brain uses the same pathways \n     to generate an emotion as to respond to one. So if an \n     emotion is reciprocated, the electrical and chemical \n     signals that produced it are reinforced. But if emotions \n     are repeatedly met with indifference or a clashing \n     response--Baby is proud of building a skyscraper out of \n     Mom's best pots, and Mom is terminally annoyed--those \n     circuits become confused and fail to strengthen. The key \n     here is ``repeatedly'': one dismissive harrumph will not \n     scar a child for life. It's the pattern that counts, and \n     it can be very powerful: in one of Stern's studies, a baby \n     whose mother never matched her level of excitement became \n     extremely passive, unable to feel excitement or joy.\n       Experience can also wire the brain's ``calm down'' circuit, \n     as Daniel Goleman describes in his best-selling ``Emotional \n     Intelligence.'' One father gently soothes his crying infant, \n     another drops him into his crib; one mother hugs the toddler \n     who just skinned her knee, another screams ``It's your own \n     stupid fault!'' The first responses are attuned to the \n     child's distress; the others are wildly out of emotional \n     sync. Between 10 and 18 months, a cluster of cells in the \n     rational prefrontal cortex is busy hooking up to the emotion \n     regions. The circuit seems to grow into a control switch, \n     able to calm agitation by infusing reason into emotion. \n     Perhaps parental soothing trains this circuit, strengthening \n     the neural connections that form it, so that the child learns \n     how to calm herself down. This all happens so early that the \n     effects of nurture can be misperceived as innate nature.\n       Stress and constant threats also rewire emotion circuits. \n     These circuits are centered on the amygdala, a little almond-\n     shaped structure deep in the brain whose job is to scan \n     incoming sights and sounds for emotional content. According \n     to a wiring diagram worked out by Joseph LeDoux of New York \n     University, impulses from eye and ear reach the amygdala \n     before they get to the rational, thoughtful neocortex. If a \n     sight, sound or experience has proved painful before--Dad's \n     drunken arrival home was followed by a beating--then the \n     amygdala floods the circuits with neurochemicals before the \n     higher brain knows what's happening. The more often this \n     pathway is used, the easier it is to trigger: the mere memory \n     of Dad may induce fear. Since the circuits can stay excited \n     for days, the brain remains on high alert. In this state, \n     says neuroscientist Bruce Perry of Baylor College of \n     Medicine, more circuits attend to nonverbal cues--facial \n     expressions, angry noises--that warn of impending danger. As \n     a result, the cortex falls behind in development and has \n     trouble assimilating complex information such as language.\n\n\n                                movement\n\n       Fetal movements begin at 7 weeks and peak between the 15th \n     and 17th weeks. That is when regions of the brain controlling \n     movement start to wire up. The critical period lasts a while: \n     it takes up to two years for cells in the cerebellum, which \n     controls posture and movement, to form functional circuits. \n     ``A lot of organization takes place using information gleaned \n     from when the child moves about in the world,'' says William \n     Greenough of the University of Illinois. ``If you restrict \n     activity you inhibit the formation of synaptic connections in \n     the cerebellum.'' The child's initially spastic movements \n     send a signal to the brain's motor cortex; the more the arm, \n     for instance, moves, the stronger the circuit, and the better \n     the brain will become at moving the arm intentionally and \n     fluidly. The window lasts only a few years: a child \n     immobilized in a body cast until the age of 4 will learn to \n     walk eventually, but never smoothly.\n       There are many more circuits to discover, and many more \n     environmental influences to pin down. Still, neuro labs are \n     filled with an unmistakable air of optimism these days. It \n     stems from a growing understanding of how, at the level of \n     nerve cells and molecules, the brain's circuits form. In the \n     beginning, the brain-to-be consists of only a few advance \n     scouts breaking trail: within a week of conception they march \n     out of the embryo's ``neural tube,'' a cylinder of cells \n     extending from head to tail. Multiplying as they go (the \n     brain adds an astonishing 250,000 neurons per minute during \n     gestation), the neurons clump into the brain stem which \n     commands heartbeat and breathing, build the little cerebellum \n     at the back of the head which controls posture and movement, \n     and form the grooved and rumpled cortex wherein thought and \n     perception originate. The neural cells are so small, and the \n     distance so great, that a neuron striking out for what will \n     be the prefrontal cortex migrates a distance equivalent to a \n     human's walking from New York to California, says \n     developmental neurobiologist Mary Beth Hatten of Rockefeller \n     University.\n       Only when they reach their destinations do these cells \n     become true neurons. They grow a fiber called an axon that \n     carries electrical signals. The axon might reach only to a \n     neuron next door, or it might wend its way clear across to \n     the other side of the brain. It is the axonal connections \n     that form the brain's circuits. Genes determine the main \n     highways along which axons travel to make their connection. \n     But to reach particular target cells, axons follow chemical \n     cues strewn along their path. Some of these chemicals \n     attract: this way to the motor cortex! Some repel: no, that \n     way to the olfactory cortex. By the fifth month of gestation \n     most axons have reached their general destination. But like \n     the prettiest girl in the bar, target cells attract way more \n     suitors--axons--than they can accommodate.\n       How does the wiring get sorted out? The baby neurons fire \n     electrical pulses once a minute, in a fit of what \n     Berkeley's Shatz calls auto-dialing. If cells fire \n     together, the target cells ``ring'' together. The target \n     cells then release a flood of chemicals, called trophic \n     factors, that strengthen the incipient connections. Active \n     neurons respond better to trophic factors than inactive \n     ones, Barbara Barres of Stanford University reported in \n     October. So neurons that are quiet when others throb lose \n     their grip on the target cell. ``Cells that fire together \n     wire together,'' says Shatz.\n       The same basic process continues after birth. Now, it is \n     not an auto-dialer that sends signals, but stimuli from the \n     senses. In experiments with rats, Illinois's Greenough found \n     that animals raised with playmates and toys and other stimuli \n     grow 25 percent more synapses than rats deprived of such \n     stimuli.\n       Rats are not children, but all evidence suggests that the \n     same rules of brain development hold. For decades Head Start \n     has fallen short of the high hopes invested in it: the \n     children's IQ gains fade after about three years. Craig Ramey \n     of the University of Alabama suspected the culprit was \n     timing: Head Start enrolls 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds. So in 1972 \n     he launched the Abecedarian Project. Children from 120 poor \n     families were assigned to one of our groups: intensive early \n     education in a day-care center from about 4 months to age 8, \n     from 4 months to 5 years, from 5 to 8 years, or none of all. \n     What does it mean to ``educate'' a 4-month-old? Nothing \n     fancy: blocks, beads, talking to him, playing games such as \n     peek-a-boo. As outlined in the book ``Learningames,'' each of \n     the 200-odd activities was designed to enhance cognitive, \n     language, social or motor development. In a recent paper, \n     Ramey and Frances Campbell of\n\n[[Page S3168]]\n\n     the University of North Carolina report that children \n     enrolled in Abecedarian as preschoolers still scored higher \n     in math and reading at the age of 15 than untreated children. \n     The children still retained an average IQ edge was 4.6 \n     points. The earlier the children were enrolled, the more \n     enduring the gain. And intervention after age 5 conferred no \n     IQ or academic benefit.\n       All of which raises a troubling question. If the windows of \n     the mind close, for the most part, before we're out of \n     elementary school, is all hope lost for children whose \n     parents did not have them count beads to stimulate their math \n     circuits, or babble to them to build their language loops? At \n     one level, no: the brain retains the ability to learn \n     throughout life, as witness anyone who was befuddled by Greek \n     in college only to master it during retirement. But on a \n     deeper level the news is sobering. Children whose neural \n     circuits are not stimulated before kindergarten are never \n     going to be what they could have been. ``You want to say that \n     it is never too late,'' says Joseph Sparling, who designed \n     the Abecedarian curriculum. ``But there seems to be something \n     very special about the early years.''\n       And yet . . . there is new evidence that certain kinds of \n     intervention can reach even the older brain and, like a \n     microscopic screwdriver. rewire broken circuits. In January, \n     scientists led by Paula Tallal of Rutgers University and \n     Michael Merzenich of UC San Francisco described a study of \n     children who have ``language-based learning disabilities''--\n     reading problems. LLD affects 7 million children in the \n     United States. Tallal has long argued that LLD arises from a \n     child's inability to distinguish short staccato sounds--such \n     as ``d'' and ``b.'' Normally, it takes neurons in the \n     auditory cortex something like .015 second to respond to a \n     signal from the ear, calm down and get ready to respond to \n     the next sound; in LLD children, it takes five to 10 times as \n     long. (Merzenich speculates that the defect might be the \n     result of chronic middle-ear infections in infancy: the brain \n     never ``hears'' sounds clearly and so fails to draw a sharp \n     auditory map.) Short sounds such as ``b'' and ``d'' go by too \n     fast--.04 second--to process. Unable to associate sounds with \n     letters, the children develop reading problems.\n       The scientists drilled the 5- to 10-year-olds three hours a \n     day with computer-produced sound that draws out short \n     consonants, like an LP played too slow. The result: LLD \n     children who were one to three years behind in language \n     ability improved by a full two years after only four weeks. \n     The improvement has lasted. The training, Merzenich suspect, \n     redrew the wiring diagram in children's auditory cortex to \n     process fast sounds. Their reading problems vanished like the \n     sounds of the letters that, before, they never heard.\n       Such neural rehab may be the ultimate payoff of the \n     discovery that the experiences of life are etched in the \n     bumps and squiggles of the brain. For now, it is enough to \n     know that we are born with a world of potential--potential \n     that will be realized only if it is tapped. And that is \n     challenge enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3165-3", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, last week I began giving a series of \nspeeches about the void in moral leadership in the White House.\n  By moral leadership, I don't mean morality. I mean simply setting a \ngood example for the American people: Being trustworthy, honest, \ncandid, and so on, simple, basic values that all Americans share, and \nthat all Americans expect to see in their leaders.\n  Frankly, there has been a failure by this White House to set a good \nexample.\n  And I have been very specific about my observations, what the \nPresident, the First Lady and others have done, and where the good \nexample broke down.\n  I began this series of speeches with the words of two great American \npresidents in mind.\n  The first was a pronouncement by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  FDR said that, the Presidency is preeminently about moral leadership.\n  It's not about being a good engineer or a good decisionmaker or a \ngood speaker.\n  It's about moral leadership.\n  The second was from Teddy Roosevelt.\n  He talked about the obligation we have to tell the truth about the \nPresident, more than any other American.\n  To not do so, he said, was both base and servile.\n  And so I have felt an obligation to make this observation, Mr. \nPresident:\n  There has been a failure in this White House of setting a good \nexample for the American people.\n  Today, I will further support my claim.\n  I will refer to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, conducted March \n14-17 of 1,512 randomly selected adults.\n  In the survey, half of the respondents said they thought the First \nLady is not telling the truth about Whitewater.\n  Questions about the candor and straight-forwardness of the First Lady \ngo right to the heart of my point.\n  It goes beyond the issue of anyone calling anyone dishonest, or a \nliar.\n  That would not be proper!\n  My point is that there is a growing perception out there in \ngrassroots America that the First Lady has not told the truth.\n  How can the moral authority to lead survive such a perception with \nthis White House?\n  At this point, the most qualified outside observer of the Whitewater \nand Travelgate issues is James B. Stewart. Mr. Stewart was given access \nto sources by the White House. Mr. Stewart is also described as \nideologically akin to the Clintons. He is a respected, Pulitzer Prize-\nwinning journalist, formerly with the Wall Street Journal. His bona \nfides are generally recognized as impeccable.\n  On March 11, Mr. Stewart was interviewed by ABC's Ted Koppel on \n``Nightline.''\n  Mr. Koppel asked the following question:\n\n       And to those who say, has all of this investigation, the \n     congressional investigations, the independent prosecutors, \n     the time that you have spent in putting this book together * \n     * * was it all worth all the money and the time and the \n     effort and the pain?\n\n  Here is Mr. Stewart's reply:\n\n       I think in the end we'll find that it was--that the truth \n     is important in our society, that justice is important in our \n     society.\n       I don't think you can put a pricetag on those things.\n       Yes, It's terribly expensive, and at times it seems very \n     wasteful, and at times it's nasty and partisan.\n       It often is a blood sport, as Vince Foster said. But why is \n     that?\n       It's because the truth was never honored in the first \n     place, and I hope if there's any lesson that comes out of \n     that, that people in the future will recognize that.\n  Mr. President, that is a hard punch taken at the White House.\n  That truth was never honored in the first place.\n  But it is a fair punch.\n  It is observations like Mr. Stewart's which are having an impact out \nat the grassroots.\n  The Washington Post ran a story about the new Post-ABC poll in its \nMarch 24 edition.\n  The article was written by R.H. Melton, and was entitled, ``First \nLady Bears the Brunt of Unfavorable Opinion on Whitewater.''\n  One grocery store manager in Pontiac, MI, seems to support the \ncontention of Mr. Stewart on ``Nightline.''\n  The store manager, Dwight Bradford, age 27, said:\n\n       This is something he should have settled before becoming \n     president.\n       By him not taking action, the Republicans have made him \n     look a little dumbfounded.\n       And if she knew something, she's been withholding evidence.\n       And that is wrong for a government official.\n       It makes the United States look bad.\n\n  The Post article also showed that the Whitewater response by the \nWhite House is having repercussions that cut across party affiliation.\n  Rouvain Benison, a Democrat, is also quoted in the story, saying the \nfollowing:\n\n       Whitewater is a symptom, the lack of moral leadership, of \n     moral integrity, strength, courage--all the good things in a \n     person's character.\n\n  These were not my words, Mr. President.\n  In fact, this gentleman stated the case more eloquently than I did in \neach of my speeches of the past week.\n  It is a symptom of a lack of moral leadership.\n  Word is getting out in the countryside, Mr. President.\n  The people we serve know when their leaders are failing to lead.\n  They know that moral leadership is not coming from their White House.\n  Since the time of the Post-ABC survey, a new revelation from the \nWhite House has reinforced the perception of a lack of candor.\n  I am referring to the First Lady's March 21 responses to formal \nquestions from the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.\n  The subject matter was, who knew what, when, about the firing of \ninnocent workers in the White House Travel Office.\n  Never mind that the White House released her responses too late for \nthe evening news shows to do any serious reporting.\n  That is an old trick in this town.\n  If there is bad news, or if you want to minimize coverage, just wait \ntill the TV news shows are over to release it.\n  But the real news in this story--the real news in the First Lady's \nresponses--was the fueling of the perception of a lack of straight \nforwardness, of candor.\n  In a 25-page response, only 16 pages of which contained actual \nresponses, here is what appeared: the words ``I do not recall'' \nappeared 21 times; the words ``I do not believe'' appeared 9 times; the \nwords ``I believe'' appeared 7 times; the words ``I may have'' appeared \n5 times; the words ``it is possible that'' appeared 3 times; the words \n``no specific recollection'' appeared 2 times; in one case, she reports \n``she had heard'' something, which is hearsay, yet in three other cases \nshe reports merely that she had ``no first-hand knowledge''; and, the \nfollowing phrases were used once each: ``I cannot recall''; ``he may \nhave mentioned''; ``a vague recollection''; ``I do not remember''; ``it \nis hard to remember''; and ``a general recollection.''\n  In other words, Mr. President, these were not necessarily totally \nforthcoming answers.\n  I believe the First Lady may be totally sincere in these responses, \nas opposed to taking the advice of some clever lawyer and doing a soft \nshoe routine.\n  But, given the White House's history of not being forthcoming, do you \nnot see how this could further fuel the perception of a lack of candor.\n  Do you not now see why honoring the truth in the first place--as \n``Blood Sport'' author Jim Stewart put it--is so important for our \nnational leaders.\n  Do you not now see my point about the need for our leaders to set a \ngood example.\n  That Washington Post-ABC poll tells me that about half the people of \nthis country do not have the level of confidence they should in their \nleadership in the White House.\n  In my view, Mr. President, setting the example is the most important\n\n[[Page S3170]]\n\nthing for our leaders in the White House.\n  In that respect, I agree with FDR--who I quoted earlier--but I do not \nbelieve we are getting that example, and a growing number in this \ncountry apparently agree with me.\n  It is a serious erosion of leadership and public confidence, and it \nmust be restored.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/03/28/senate-section/article/S3169-1", "month": "03", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
