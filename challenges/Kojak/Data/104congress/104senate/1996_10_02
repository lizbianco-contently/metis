I hope that we will be able to get some \nnoncontroversial issues cleared. That process has slowed down markedly, \nbut we are still hoping and working so that we can get some done that \nare supported on both sides of the aisle.

Mr. President, I will not take a full 10 minutes, but I \nwould like to speak briefly about this so-called parks bill or Presidio \npackage which is being considered here in the Senate this week and urge \nmy colleagues who are engaged in negotiations on this to come to some \nresolution so that we can move ahead with this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  My home State of New Mexico will be greatly benefited if this package \nof legislation becomes law. There are many provisions in it that I \nbelieve would be important to many constituencies around the country.\n  I notice in the October 1 Congressional Record, the Record that we \nreceived on our desks today, there is a list on page--let us see--it is \nH12197, a listing of the various titles which are included in the bill. \nI can honestly say there is probably something in here for every State \nin the Union. This is a catch-all piece of legislation which is \nintended to make necessary boundary adjustments and to make necessary \nprovisions for the protection of our public lands in a great many \nareas. These are noncontroversial provisions.\n\n  This is a summary I refer to here, a summary of the legislation that \nhas already passed the House of Representatives. I wish, Mr. President, \nwe could call this legislation up and pass it in the Senate. Today \nwould be a good time to do that while we still have enough Senators \nhere to get a quorum. I could go through and will indicate the various \ntitles.\n  The first title relates to the Presidio of San Francisco which, of \ncourse, has been the reason that the package was designated the \nPresidio package. The second title is on boundary adjustments and \nconveyances. The next title is on rivers and trails and exchanges of \nlands, then historic areas, and it goes on to describe the various \nadministrative and management provisions including the National Coal \nHeritage Area, the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area, the Augusta Canal \nNational Heritage Area, Steel Industry Heritage Project, Essex Heritage \nArea, South Carolina National Heritage Corridor, America's Agricultural \nHeritage Partnership, the Ohio and Erie Canal National Heritage \nCorridor, the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area.\n  Mr. President, to my knowledge, all of these are meritorious \nprovisions and ones which we should enact before we leave town. I think \nit would be a great shame if we were not able to do that. This is of \nparticular interest in my home State for several provisions, but \nparticularly there has been a longstanding problem of great concern to \nthe Taos Pueblo which we are proposing to resolve in this legislation.\n  The Taos Pueblo land transfer provision would transfer 764 acres in \nnorthern New Mexico which is now located in the Wheeler Peak Wilderness \nof the Carson National Forest to the Taos Pueblo, adjacent to the Taos \nPueblo.\n  The area has spiritual significance to the people in the Taos Pueblo. \nThe bottleneck area continues to be used by the Taos Pueblo Indians for \nreligious pilgrimages. The sacred Path of Life Trail, connecting the \nPueblo with Blue Lake, runs through this bottleneck. The Blue Lake \nWilderness has been a source of spiritual strength to the Taos Pueblo \nfor over 1,000 years. The bill pending before the Senate today is \nintended to complete the full transfer of the Blue Lake territory to \nthe Taos Pueblo, a transfer that Senator Anderson pursued diligently \nwhile he was here representing our State. The bottleneck tract will be \nreturned to its rightful owners under this legislation.\n  I would hate to see the legislation fail to pass because of a \ndisagreement over some totally unrelated provisions. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues to allow this land transfer in my home State and the many \nother important provisions in the Presidio package to become law. It is \nthe right thing to do for the people of Taos Pueblo. I hope very much \nwe can take that responsible action before we adjourn this session for \nthis year.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12150-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12150-S12152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          UNFINISHED BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, as the 104th Congress draws to a \nclose, I want to spend a few moments discussing what I believe are some \nimportant initiatives which are not going to make it into the statute \nbooks this year. Although I am deeply disappointed that the many \nmonths--and years--which have gone into these efforts have not borne \nfruit, I am confident that they have taken enough root that they will \nrise once again in the 105th Congress.\n  Unfortunately, the list of proposals falling into this category is \nmuch longer than I might wish. I will not go through the entire litany, \nbut I do want to set out what I was attempting to accomplish with \nrespect to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH], and our Nation's job training programs.\n  Legislation to reform the Food and Drug Administration, S. 1477, was \nreported by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources with strong \nbipartisan support. Members on both sides of the aisle spent long hours \nin negotiations, and I want particularly to commend the Senator from \nMaryland [Ms. Mikulski] for her unflagging efforts on behalf of reform. \nUnfortunately, these negotiations failed to produce an agreement which \nwould not be filibustered, and it was therefore not possible to bring \nS. 1477 before the full Senate.\n  This legislation was designed to enhance the professionalism, \nstature, and effectiveness of the FDA. In developing the measure, I was \nmotivated by a desire to assure that our Nation does not lose its \nleadership in new product development and by a desire to respond to the \nplight of countless individuals who have suffered needless delays in \nobtaining new therapies.\n  Through hearings, meetings, and other reviews of the issue, I \nconcluded that the performance of the FDA could be substantially \nimproved without sacrificing consumer confidence in the safety and \nefficacy of the products they purchase.\n  I would like to outline briefly the major principles underlying this \nlegislation, because I believe they are important and should serve as \nthe foundation for any FDA reform measure considered in the future:\n  First, as I stated, the major purpose of S. 1477 was to enhance the \nprofessionalism of the agency, and it attempted to do so by providing a \nclear statement of the agency's mission and by emphasizing performance \nstandards and accountability.\n  Second, it attempted to improve the speed and efficiency of the \nproduct testing, review, and approval process by encouraging \ncooperation between the agency and the manufacturer from the very \nbeginning. Too often, all the focus is placed on the back end of the \nprocess--FDA approval--without giving sufficient attention to steps \nwhich could be taken to improve the process during the many years \nleading up to that point.\n  Mr. President, as you know, it can take sometimes as many as 12 years \nor more before final approval is achieved.\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\n We felt strongly in the committee that process could be enhanced \nwithout hurting in any way safety, efficiency, and efficacy in order to \nbring that time span down.\n  There have been instances where the agency has implemented this type \nof cooperative approach--for example, with respect to the testing and \nreview of AIDS drugs--and this measure attempted to encompass those \npractices which have been successful.\n  Finally, the measure put forward some new options, such as the \ncontracting of review of certain medical devices. The point was not to \ntake FDA out of the picture. The bill maintained the role of the FDA as \nthe final arbiter of safety and efficacy. At the same time, it took \nsteps to assure that, at the appropriate point, the agency does come to \na decision.\n  Scientific methods and technology have changed dramatically over the \npast two decades, while our regulatory structures have barely budged. \nAn incentive is growing for U.S. companies to move research, \ndevelopment, and production abroad, threatening our Nation's continued \nworld leadership in new product development--costing American jobs and \nfurther delaying the public's access to important new products. We can \naddress these issues through sound reform legislation, and we should.\n  Another important health care matter which deserves priority in the \n105th Congress is the reauthorization of the National Institutes of \nHealth. Last week, the Senate approved a reauthorization bill (S. \n1897), and I had hoped the House of Representatives would take it up as \nwell. Unfortunately, that will not happen.\n  As a consequence, we have lost--for the moment--an opportunity to \nreaffirm the importance of the biomedical research mission of the NIH \nand to enhance the effectiveness of the agency in performing that \nmission.\n  All Americans can take great pride in the exceptional contributions \nthat the NIH has made. It has compiled an astonishing record of \nbiomedical research advances which have transformed all of our lives. \nVaccines against conditions which once crippled and killed are now \nroutine, and drugs hailed as miracles at their inception are as well \nknown as aspirin. These past successes against seemingly insurmountable \nodds have inspired confidence and offered hope to those who have \nnowhere else to turn.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the important work of the two largest \ninstitutes--the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart, Lung, \nand Blood Institute--the reauthorization bill approved by the Senate \nattempted to strengthen the ability of the NIH to respond to emerging \nissues in the biomedical research arena and in the larger health care \nenvironment in which it operates.\n\n  Among other things, this legislation authorized the creation of the \nNational Human Genome Research Institute, in recognition that one of \nthe biggest future frontiers is that of the human genetic code. The \nelevation of the National Center for Genome Research to institute \nstatus would serve to better focus NIH resources for this important \nwork.\n  It recognized the need to invest in the education and training of the \nnext generation of clinical researchers by providing for greater \nsupport for expert training of young biomedical scientists who have \nelected the difficult, and frequently less well-compensated, careers in \nscientific inquiry.\n  The bill streamlined the excess and often duplicative infrastructure \nthat has grown up over time in the NIH. Every dollar saved from \nunnecessary administrative burdens is another dollar freed up for \nsupport of biomedical research.\n  It established a framework under which additional sources of funding \ncould be tapped by creating a biomedical research trust fund within the \nTreasury.\n  This legislation included a significant initiative in the area of \nParkinson's disease research. Based on separate legislation with broad \nbipartisan support in both the Senate and House, this initiative would \nestablish up to 10 Morris K. Udall Centers for Research on Parkinson's \nDisease and provide for awards to neuroscientists and clinicians to \nsupport innovative research.\n  Turning to other issues before the labor committee this year, I think \nperhaps my greatest disappointment is the demise of the Work Force and \nCareer Development Act. I say it is the greatest disappointment not \nonly because its failure is a lost opportunity to bring about \nsignificant reform in an area where reform is sorely needed, but also \nbecause we came so close to achieving it.\n  This is not a bill which died in committee. It was not killed on the \nSenate floor; in fact, just about a year ago it was adopted by a vote \nof 95 to 2. It did not die in the House, where its companion measure \nwas adopted with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  This initiative, which has its roots in legislation I introduced with \nthe Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], in the 103d Congress, moved \nstep by step through the legislative process. Yet, the conference \nreport, which was filed on July 25, has been sitting gathering dust due \nto the threats of dilatory action should it be called up.\n  I have addressed the Senate on many occasions regarding the need for \nfundamental reform of our Nation's job training programs. I think \nreform is absolutely essential if we are to provide the skilled job \ntraining which can best address the needs of the people in each of our \nStates, because what might be necessary in Kansas might be very \ndifferent in Alabama or in South Carolina. As I have mentioned before, \nthe roughly $5 billion which the Federal Government invests in job \ntraining and related programs is small potatoes in our annual trillion-\ndollar-plus budget. Most probably feel, I think, that this is a boring \nsubject and ask why should we focus our attention on this. It doesn't \ngrab headlines. But if we wish to make welfare reform work, if we wish \nto provide a work force for the next century that is going to meet the \nchallenging demands of developing new technology, we have to be more \nflexible in letting States design good job-training programs. I just \nworry, Mr. President, that by maintaining the status quo, we are saying \nthat we are willing to live with inadequate programs and that we are \nnot willing to step forward with the innovative ideas that I think are \nimportant, and that I believe the American people think are important. \nThese are ideas that will help assure that Government spends money more \neffectively and wisely.\n\n  I contend that it is a travesty to continue to allow these billions \nof dollars to be thrown away on programs where good intentions are not \nsufficient to produce good results. We don't even have the data to know \nwhat works and what doesn't work.\n  That is what the Work Force and Career Development Act is all about. \nIt would consolidate narrowly focused Federal categorical programs into \na comprehensive statewide system--offering States the flexibility they \nneed to focus resources where the need is greatest. It would encourage \nthe development of true partnerships among educators, trainers, and the \nbusiness community. And it would focus on getting results.\n  Many forces in our society are raising the stakes for the effective \nperformance of job training programs. Technology has transformed the \nmarketplace and the skills which employers seek from their employees. \nThe recently enacted welfare reform legislation places a premium on job \nplacement and retention.\n  My biggest regret at the failure to bring about job training reform \nis the fact that those Americans most in need of quality programs which \nhave to continue to muddle their way through the current morass, will \nhave to continue to be shuttled from one program to the next, our not \nknowing for sure what will work and where they will be able to find the \nanswers they seek. I think it is a disappointment and a shame, our not \nbeing able to address the conference report before this Congress \ncloses.\n  There are other reform efforts as well which I believe could have \nmade Government programs work better. The Senator from New Hampshire \n[Mr. Gregg] and I developed legislation to reform the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration [OSHA] in an effort to place greater \nemphasis on improving safety education and less on imposing fines for \ntrivial violations. I worked with Representative J.C. Watts on the \nYouth Development Community\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\nBlock Grant Act, an effort to consolidate scattered youth development \nprograms into a locally controlled system of positive prevention \nactivities.\n  A recent edition of Roll Call mentioned the interest of the majority \nleader in spending more time overseeing existing programs, rather than \ncreating new ones. I wholeheartedly agree. We do a disservice to the \nAmerican taxpayer to add to Federal obligations while ignoring the \nperformance of those we have already made.\n  The process of oversight and reform is a long one. It does not happen \novernight or even over the 2-year course of a Congress. I would like to \nthink that the work which has gone into the initiatives I have \nmentioned today will make a contribution to efforts to be undertaken \nnext year and the year after that. Although I will not be here to \nshepherd these initiatives through their next phases, I have confidence \nthat they will flourish under the care of those who follow.\n  Mr. President, this is the last speech I will give on the Senate \nfloor. I would just like to say it has been a great honor to represent \nthe State of Kansas. I want to say a special thanks to my colleague \nfrom the State of Alabama, Mr. Heflin, who will be retiring in this \nCongress. It has been an honor to serve with him. I thank my colleagues \nand my staff and the support personnel. It has been a pleasure to serve \nwith them for 18 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as America heads into the next century and \nmillennium, it is crucial that a serious reevaluation of our role in \nthe world occur. Our role in the world will largely be dictated, at \nleast for the foreseeable future, by the fact that our Nation is the \nsole remaining superpower. This role carries with it added \nresponsibilities with regard to international and even more localized \nforeign disputes.\n  In reevaluating our role as the sole superpower, there are some \nrestraining factors that must be part of the equation.\n  The lessons of Vietnam, Korea, and Beirut, as they relate to public \nsupport, cannot be dismissed. We have to consider the attitudes of the \npopulation in this country if we are to pursue action in places like \nBosnia. A key question is how many human casualties the public will \ntolerate. Will the public support the mission and to what degree will \nit be supported? The media is a key element, since it has a tremendous \ncapacity for creating sentiment for or against a particular policy. Our \nrole might increasingly be ad hoc in nature. Public attitudes are a \npotential internal threat that can't be dismissed. There is a strong \nfeeling that America cannot be the world's policeman. There is a vocal \nsentiment of limited quasi-isolationism among many that can't be \ndismissed, and it has the potential to grow. The question of how best \nto manage this sentiment is important to the conduct of our foreign \npolicy and in assessing our role in the world.\n  Scarce and limited resources on the part of our national government \nwill also be a major determinant of our foreign policy. We are living \nin a world of shrinking government action. Both major political parties \nacknowledge this reality. It is a reality based upon budgetary \nconstraints and a desire for less government, and dictated to some \ndegree by the competition between domestic and foreign policy needs.\n  We have already seen over the last few years a tendency on the part \nof our allies to look to us for leadership and to put out fires. Our \nleadership of the NATO operations in Bosnia is a stark example. In this \nwar-torn region, we have seen not only armed battles, but rape, \ntorture, murder, and genocide. As a society which stands against such \nevils, we will be called upon to intervene. Budgetary constraints will \ncontinue to require a reevaluation of our role as a world policeman and \nas the rewarding arbiter of international disputes in places like the \nMiddle East, Northern Ireland, and other areas.\n  A key part of the reevaluation of our role as a solver of conflicts \nwill also be the reevaluation of our role in world disarmament as well \nas an arms merchant. As we rightfully pursue disarmament and restraints \non the sale of arms, we must strive to retain a sensible balance and \nnot go too far. A root cause analysis will serve us well; it is obvious \nthat not much serious fighting takes place between two parties if there \nare no arms. Our own security, in the light of more ambiguous threats \nand potential terrorism, will continue to be paramount. Military \ntechnology and the feasibility and need of such programs as SDI will \ncontinue to demand attention. These questions will not recede just \nbecause the direct threat from a competing superpower has receded.\n\n  We must not only look at our role in securing human rights around the \nworld, but also to the commercial and business opportunities in Asia, \nAfrica, and Latin America, as well as in the former Warsaw Pact \nnations. Our international trade policies are important components of \nsuch development.\n  As far as our trade policy and how it affects our own citizens, we \nmust carefully look at our trade deficits and how they will affect \nAmerica's jobs if not reduced. There should be little doubt that many \nof our traditional jobs are going overseas or across borders. While new \nservice jobs are being created, there is the increasing danger of a \ngrowing gap between the wealthy and, on the other hand, the \neconomically disadvantaged and poor and a narrowing of the middle \nclass. There is no question that Japan has emerged as a world economic \npower because of its successful trade policies. It is no secret that \none learns from the successful. So far, we have not learned from Japan \nor come close to duplicating their success. What can be learned from \nthem in making our own policies more beneficial to our national \ninterests is an important question. One key component of their \nsuccessful policy is that the corporate sector does not view the \ngovernment as the enemy.\n  Another challenge will be the role of NATO in European security and \noutside Europe. It is currently being seriously reevaluated. The \nalliance's expansion by the end of the century appears to be a foregone \nconclusion. What will the exact mission of an expanded NATO be in the \nnext century? In order to avoid some of the problems experienced by the \nUnited Nations, particularly in the ``peacekeeping'' realm, its mission \nwill have to be reevaluated meticulously, defined precisely, and \narticulated forcefully. The Pacific Rim, a rapidly expanding area of \ntrade, development, and expansion, is also one of potential security \nthreats. The lessons of China's influence in the Korean and Vietnam \nconflicts must not be forgotten. Possible East Asian alliances, as well \nas our understanding of East Asian motivations, are puzzling and \nwrought with dangers. Considerable thought, patience, and insight must \nbe given to security threats and trade relationships. The issue of \nwhether NATO could or should be used outside Europe--even if the \nconsent of the member nations were obtained--will be paramount. The \nrole of the United Nations is a major component of this issue, \nparticularly in view of China's veto in the U.N. Security Council. We \nknow the future will continue to yield technological advances that we \nhave not even thought of today. This is true both in terms of domestic \nand international policy. A renewed commitment to research and \ndevelopment will be crucial in keeping pace with the rest of the world. \nThink about the Internet and how it has already changed the ways in \nwhich we receive, transmit, and exchange news and information. This \nwill only increase in the next century. Our space program has yielded \nsome of the greatest benefits our nation has ever realized. Its bi-\nproducts have helped lead to advances in health care techniques. We \nmust commit ourselves anew to NASA and its mission. We must help \ncitizens see the direct links between advanced science and research and \ntheir relevance to their daily lives. How many unforeseen research \ntriumphs are waiting to be realized in the next century?\n  Here at home, the delivery of health care is still a great concern to \nmany of our citizens. As the National Institutes of Health and other \ngovernment and private entities continue to increase the average life \nspan of our population, the demand for health care services will only \nincrease. The costs will rise. Access will continue to be an issue. We \nmust evaluate these strains on the system and whether or not we will be \nable\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\nto meet the needs of a rapidly growing portion of the population that \ncannot partially or entirely meet the cost. There is still a consensus \nthat reform is needed; still, after all the debate and controversy, we \ndon't yet know what policy to pursue. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill is a \ngood first step, but only a first step.\n  The rising costs of higher education must be reevaluated. As college-\nlevel study and training become increasingly necessary to succeed in \ntoday's and tomorrow's complex world, what can be done about the rising \ncost? A huge percentage of a family's income goes toward educating its \nchildren, even at public institutions. How much can families \nrealistically afford before talented, bright young people start falling \nthrough the cracks? Will it be the responsibility of the government to \nprovide a safety net? How will government assistance programs have to \nbe changed to meet increased demand?\n  Our success at meeting these many challenges and the many others that \nface us depends upon how serious we are in our evaluation of them. \nPerhaps as much as any time in history, our future success will depend \non how hard we work, how thoughtful we analyze these challenges, and \nhow serious we are in building partnerships for moving the country \nforward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is an institution that \nhas benefited greatly from the service of a number of individuals who \nhave dedicated their adult lives to government. Among that group, one \nperson in particular stands apart as a man of great intelligence, \nconscience, and contemplation, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon.\n  Mark Hatfield arrived in Washington in 1966 well prepared to not only \ntake his seat in the world's greatest deliberative body, but to almost \nimmediately begin helping to shape and influence debate in this \nChamber. Ever since his 1943 graduation from Willamette University, \nMark Hatfield has either studied, taught, or served government. During \nWorld War II, Mark donned the khaki uniform of a naval officer and \nparticipated in some of the most brutal campaigns we fought against the \nJapanese. After the war, Mark returned to school and earned a master's \ndegree in political science from prestigious Stanford University. \nFollowing his time in Palo Alto, the young veteran and scholar returned \nto Willamette University where he taught political science and held the \nposition of dean of students.\n  It was during his time at Willamette that Mark became active in \npolitics, running for, and being elected to the Oregon House of \nRepresentatives in 1950. This was to be the beginning of a career in \nelected office that would take him to the Oregon State Senate, the \nGovernor's Office, and ultimately to the U.S. Senate, where he has \nserved for three decades and is Oregon's longest serving Senator.\n  During his tenure in this body, Senator Hatfield has worked hard for \nhis constituents, has fought for his beliefs, and has worked to make \nour Nation an even better place. He has been the architect of any \nnumber of legislative initiatives that sought to protect and expand \nwilderness areas in the Pacific Northwest, ensuring that this and \nfuture generations will forever know the majesty and beauty of that \nregion. Additionally, he worked hard to help promote business in his \nState, and his efforts undoubtedly helped to make Oregon an important \npart of the dynamic international economy known as the Pacific rim.\n  Mr. President, I have always had the upmost respect for my colleague \nfrom Oregon. In his 30 years in the Senate, he has always voted his \nconscience and has done what he felt was in the best interests of the \nUnited States of America. One can only admire a man who places such a \nvalue on integrity. Indeed, Mark Hatfield is a man of integrity, \nability, and dedication, and we commend him for the great service he \nhas rendered this Nation. I know that Senator Hatfield will be greatly \nmissed by all those who have served with him, and his successor will \nhave to work hard to match the commitment made by this scholar and \nSenator. I know that all the Members of the Senate wish our friend Mark \ngood health and great happiness in the years to come, and I am certain \nthat he will excel at whatever endeavor he undertakes upon his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12153-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12153-S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR NANCY KASSEBAUM\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator \nNancy Landon Kassebaum, a leading lady of the Senate and one of the \nfinest to ever represent the State of Kansas in the U.S. Congress.\n  Senator Kassebaum learned politics the old fashioned way at the knee \nof her distinguished father, Alf Landon, Republican Presidential \nnominee and Kansas Governor. She eventually followed in his footsteps \nto serve the State of Kansas in an exemplary and excellent manner.\n  In the early years she was a wife and mother, rearing four fine \nchildren, and then serving as a Senate staffer, before being elected to \nthe U.S. Senate on the Republican ticket in 1978.\n  Senator Kassebaum brought to this body a keen interest in social \nissues, focusing on areas near and dear to her--the family, children, \nand education. Today, as chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources,\n\n[[Page S12154]]\n\nshe has been able to affect greatly legislation in connection with her \nagenda in these and other important arenas.\n  On a broader scope, her work on the Committee on Foreign Affairs has \nbeen noteworthy and knowledgeable, especially her work on foreign aid \nand African issues.\n  Not only is she an able legislator, but she is a person of character, \nintellect, and dedication. She is truly a lady in every sense of the \nword, and what I believe we would say today ``A Class Act.''\n  Her sense and sensibility will be missed in the Senate, and her wit, \ngrace, and style will long be remembered.\n  On a personal note, we are proud to claim Nancy Kassebaum as an \nhonorary citizen of South Carolina. Her outstanding son, John, an \nattorney, is a resident of Charleston, and he had the good fortune and \ngood taste to marry a lovely South Carolinian, Elizabeth Williams \nKassebaum. They have two handsome children. Now that Nancy is retiring, \nwe hope she will spend even more time in our State, where she is \ngreatly admired.\n  The U.S. Senate is a better place because of Nancy Landon Kassebaum, \nand her shoes will be hard to fill. She spoke softly, but wielded a big \nstick when standing up for her beliefs and principles. Her character \nwas sterling and she has left a rich heritage for the future worth its \nweight in gold.\n  We shall miss her, and in the words of the Bard, ``We shall not see \nher likes again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12153-4", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF SENATOR HOWELL HEFLIN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my good \nfriend, Senator Howell Heflin, known by many of his colleagues and \nfriends as ``the Judge,'' who, regrettably, is retiring from the \nSenate.\n  On November 2, 1978, the U.S. Senate gained one of the most \nrespected, intelligent and able Senators in Howell Heflin. Howell grew \nup as a son of a Methodist minister, and was educated at Birmingham \nSouthern and the University of Alabama Law School. With a J.D. Degree \nin hand, he practiced law with wide recognition as a noted trial \nattorney, gaining numerous honors and awards among law societies and \nassociations.\n  During his career, Howell has made many important contributions to \nour great Nation. In addition to being an attorney, Howell served as \nChief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court prior to his election to the \nSenate, and he brought to the Senate an extensive knowledge of the \njudicial process. During his tenure as Chief Justice, ``the Judge'' \nbrought about an unprecedented judicial reform package for his State, \nwhich has been hailed as a model for the Nation and has been studied by \nnumerous other courts throughout the United States. This extensive \nknowledge and background made Howell Heflin a natural candidate to \nserve on the Senate Judiciary Committee. For years we have served \ntogether on this committee, and have worked closely on a number of \njudicial reform initiatives and measures to fight crime and drug abuse. \nThe members of the Judiciary Committee who have worked with Howell have \nundoubtably benefited from his insight on judicial matters.\n  As with many southern States, agriculture plays an important part in \nAlabama's economy, and in addition to his commitment to judicial \nissues, Howell has an equally strong interest in agricultural concerns. \nHe has been called the spokesman for southern agriculture by the \nAssociated Press, and makes his fight for farmers a national priority.\n  Senator Heflin, a former Marine who served in World War II, has a \nspecial interest in a strong national defense. His work with President \nReagan on the Strategic Defense Initiative, and cooperation with \nPresident Bush on defense matters demonstrates his nonpartisan spirit \nand his commitment to the security of this great Nation.\n  Throughout his Senate service, Howell has maintained his Alabama \nroots and applied his down home, southern values of common sense and \nlevel headedness to his work in the Senate.\n  I have great respect for Senator Heflin's commitment to his work, his \nintegrity, as well as his dedication to his constituents and to the \nUnited States of America. As he heads home to Alabama, I wish him well \nin his retirement, and trust that he will enjoy many years of health, \nhappiness, and spending more time with his growing family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12154-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WILLIAM S. COHEN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Senator William \nS. Cohen, who is retiring at the end of the present year.\n  When one thinks of New England, many images come to mind. Lighthouses \non rocky points, lobster and clam bakes on beaches, and men and women \nof few words but great wisdom. Our colleague from Maine, William S. \nCohen, is just one such person, a well-educated, well-read man with an \nimpressive background in government who has done much to benefit our \nNation.\n  Senator Cohen began his life in public service as an assistant county \nattorney for Penobscot County, and later went on to serve on the staff \nof the Governor of Maine's State Credit Research Committee. This \nexperience in the public sector sparked Bill's interest in a career in \nelected office, and it was not long before he held a succession of \nlocal positions beginning with city councilor for Bangor, followed by \nmayor of that same locale. Soon Bill turned his attention from the \nresponsibilities of a local official to the challenges that a seat in \nthe House of Representatives presents, and in 1972, he was elected to \nCongress. For three terms, Bill represented the people of his district \nfaithfully, but in 1978, he felt that he could better serve his State \nand Nation by being a U.S. Senator, and he was elected to the first of \nwhat would be three terms.\n  During his tenure in this body, Senator Cohen has served on both the \nArmed Services Committee and the Committee on Intelligence, working \nhard on a number of issues of great importance to the defense of the \nNation. As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I can say \nwithout question that Bill approaches his responsibilities with great \nseriousness and purposefulness of mind. We have all benefited from the \ncontributions he has made to the security of the United States and are \ngrateful for his efforts.\n  I hope that Bill leaves the Senate with fond memories of his time \nhere and a sense of accomplishment for his efforts. Knowing Bill, upon \nhis retirement, he is going to pursue endeavors that will be \ninteresting and challenging, and no matter what he undertakes, I am \nsure that he will enjoy great success. I have been pleased to serve \nwith my good friend from Maine, and I wish him all the best in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12154-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12154-S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR HANK BROWN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay a tribute to Senator Hank \nBrown since he is retiring at the end of the current year.\n  If there is one image that people around the world have of a \nWesterner, it is that of an independent man or woman who rides tall in \nthe saddle, stands up for what he or she believes is right, and is a \nperson of great practicality and common sense. Without question, these \nare the type of attributes that one finds in our friend and colleague, \nHank Brown of Colorado, who is bringing his career in Congress to a \nclose.\n  Though a Member of this body for only one term, Senator Brown is no \nstranger to Capitol Hill as he served for 10 years in the House of \nRepresentatives. Throughout his tenure in both Houses of Congress, he \ndemonstrated a commonsense approach to the issues before the Nation. As \na conservative, he took a hard line against Government waste, an \nexcessive Federal budget, and efforts by bureaucrats and \nenvironmentalists to impede the rights of land owners, ranchers, and \nthose who seek to harness the riches of the West.\n  I had the good fortune to serve with Hank on both the Committee on \nthe Judiciary and the Veterans' Affairs Committee over the past 6 \nyears, and his commitment to his work and to serving the Nation \nimpressed me greatly. Without question, my colleague from Colorado \napproached his duties seriously and sought to represent his\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\nconstituents as best he could. As a veteran of the Vietnam war, Hank \nwas especially sensitive and knowledgeable concerning issues that came \nbefore the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and he worked hard to ensure \nthat America never forgets those men and women who have sacrificed so \nmuch to protect the interests and ideals of the United States. I have \nno question that should Hank Brown have chosen to stand for reelection, \nthe grateful voters of his State would have easily and overwhelmingly \nreturned him to office.\n  Mr. President, in a case of life imitating popular lore, Hank Brown \nis going to saddle up and ride west into the sunset at the end of the \n104th Congress. As he makes his journey back to his home State with its \nglorious Rocky Mountains and crystal clean air, he can reflect on a \ndistinguished and well respected career in the U.S. Congress. In the \ncourse of almost two decades, Hank worked hard to forge compromises, \nreach agreements, and to fight for what is right. His efforts benefited \nthe people of Colorado and the United States, and his presence will \ncertainly be missed in this Chamber. Some say that Hank may run for \nGovernor, and if that is the case, the Mile High State, will be in good \nhands, but regardless of whether or not our friend seeks that office, \nwe commend him for his service to the Nation and wish him great success \nin the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12154-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SHEILA FRAHM\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay a tribute to Senator \nSheila Frahm, who is retiring at the end of the current year.\n  Many of our colleagues will be leaving us at the end of the 104th \nCongress. Some of these people have been here for decades, and some for \nonly a very short time. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one Member of \nthis body whose service has been brief, but in no way less than \nsterling, Senator Sheila Frahm of Kansas.\n  Senator Frahm joined us just this year after being appointed to the \nseat vacated by the resignation of the former majority leader, Bob \nDole. Sheila Frahm came to this position well prepared to carry out its \nduties as she held a number of important offices during her years in \nState government, including that of Lieutenant Governor.\n  I came to know Senator Frahm through her membership on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee. I was impressed by the determined manner in \nwhich she took her duties and responsibilities as a member of the \ncommittee. She worked hard in an attempt to make informed and \nconsidered decisions on the matters that came before us and were \ncritical to the defense of the United States. It would have been easy \nfor someone in her position to simply bide her time until the end of \nthe Congress, but I think Mrs. Frahm knew that the men and women of the \n``Big Red One'' at Fort Riley, KS, and that soldiers, sailors, airmen, \nand marines throughout the world were grateful for her excellent \nservice.\n  Mr. President, Senator Frahm will leave this Chamber at the end of \nthe 104th Congress and return to her native Kansas. Though the duration \nof her service was short, it was critical. Sheila Frahm can be proud of \nthe contributions she made to governing of the United States and we \nwill certainly be sorry to see her go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12155-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SENATOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay a tribute to Senator J. \nBennett Johnston who is retiring at the end of the current year.\n  As we all know, the South is a region that is rich in heritage and \ntradition, and one of its most time-honored practices is returning \npeople to Congress year after year in order to build up power and \nseniority. For the past 24 years, J. Bennett Johnston has served his \nnative State of Louisiana tirelessly and selflessly, and in the \nprocess, has gained great influence in the Senate, which he has \nmasterfully used for the betterment of his constituents and his State.\n  First elected to the Senate in 1972 Bennett Johnston set immediately \nto work in behalf of the people who had sent him to Washington. He \nsecured positions on several important committees, including the \nCommittees on Appropriations, and Energy and Natural Resources, that \nwere especially beneficial to the economy and people of Louisiana. For \nthe next twenty-four years, Senator Johnston dedicated himself to his \nefforts in this Chamber, accomplishing many significant things, \nincluding helping to create new jobs for Louisiana, spurring economic \ndevelopment in his State, helping to provide for the defense of the \nNation, overseeing the creation of national parks and refuges in the \nSportsman's Paradise, and having a significant role in the shaping of \nAmerica's energy policies.\n  Mr. President, as many of our colleagues are doing this year, Senator \nJohnston has decided to retire from this body. After more than two \ndecades of commendable service, nobody can fault our friend for feeling \nhis work here is done. As he heads back to Louisiana, Bennett can take \npride in his many accomplishments and the exemplary manner in which he \nhas worked to make Louisiana and the United States better and stronger. \nUnquestionably, he is a man of integrity, ability, and dedication and \nwe all appreciate the great service he has rendered this Nation. I join \nmy colleagues in wishing him good health and great happiness in the \nyears ahead.\n  I also wish to commend Bennett's wife, Mary, for the great service \nshe has rendered to the U.S. Botanical Gardens here in Washington. \nAdditionally, she is involved in many activities that benefit our \nNation and her native State including being an advocate for \nimmunization and historical preservation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I revise my unanimous-consent request of a \nwhile ago so that, before commencing my 15 minutes, the Senator from \nNew Jersey be given 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from New Jersey \nis recognized for 15 minutes to be followed by the Senator from \nCalifornia for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12155-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12155-S12157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ON MY RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, I always preferred moving to standing \nstill. As a small forward with the New York Knicks, as U.S. Senator \nfrom New Jersey, I think I have had two of the best jobs in the world. \nEach kept me on the move, each offered a unique perspective on America, \nand in each there came a time to go.\n  Tomorrow, the Senate will probably adjourn and in a few months I will \nbe leaving the Senate. I believe that U.S. Senator is the best elective \njob in the world. I thank the people of New Jersey who gave me their \nvotes and their trust; each of my three senatorial races drew me closer \nto them and forced me to grow in new and different ways. Election day \nis democracy's most intimate and important ritual. For all the polling \nand media and political strategy, I believe that there is an essence in \nany campaign that conveys the bond between the candidate and the \nelectorate on that particular election day. Ultimately, it is the bond \nthat determines the outcome.\n  For nearly 17 years, almost 18 years now, my most memorable moments \nhave come from the people that I have met. I thank those New Jerseyans \nwho told me their stories through their letters and during our \nencounters along the shore, at commuter terminals and diners and town \nmeetings and countless other settings. It is from the stories of \npeople's lives that I have been moved and that I gained hesitancy about \nuniversal solutions. It is from their stories that I saw what a small \nrole Government plays in most people's lives and, paradoxically, it is \nwhere I felt the impact of decisions taken here in Washington. I have \nreceived much more inspiration, insight, and good cheer than I could \never say. They reminded me daily of the resilience and the power of the \nhuman spirit.\n\n  Their New Jersey stories gave me substance and emotion, and lent both \nsubstance and emotion to abstractions about democracy. Now each of \ntheir stories has become a part of my own story. I have tried to listen \nto those I serve while using judgment that I believe they elected me to \nexercise. Sometimes they vented their anger and frustration, and just \nby my listening,\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\nthey seemed to feel better. I have included young New Jerseyans in my \nactivities as a Senator because democratic participation must burst \nforth anew in each generation, like flowers in the spring. Unless the \nseeds are watered there will be no blossoms.\n  I have paid attention to the religious community in my State because \nI believe the right policy always starts with the right values. I have \nrespected those who disagreed with me, especially when they took time \nto write long letters detailing their disagreements.\n  Flying north from Washington in a small plane as the Sun is setting, \nyou reach a point where the sunlight on the Delaware River turns it \ninto a metallic-looking band extending all the way up from Trenton to \nthe Delaware Water Gap. And there, lying before you, is the New Jersey \nPeninsula, bordered on the west by the Delaware River and on the east \nby the Atlantic. New Jersey offers unexpected beauty, it gives \nsurprising economic opportunity and reveals vital human diversity.\n  I have achieved greater understanding of the world with all its \nmixture of religions and ethnicities by simply representing New Jersey. \nI have become deeply attached to the Jersey shore, to the mountains of \nthe northwest, the flat farmland of the south, and even to certain \nplaces on the Garden State Parkway and the turnpike. These New Jersey \nplaces have rooted me and given my life a sense of permanence. It has \nbeen an honor to represent our State in the U.S. Senate.\n  I was not in an elective body before coming to the Senate. I had no \nframe of reference. And in the early months, I remember sitting in the \nCloakroom one night late around 2 a.m. and looking around at my fellow \nSenators in that Cloakroom. One was reading, and one was pacing, and \none was telling a joke, and one was sitting quietly, and one was \narguing. I thought to myself, ``This isn't a lot different than the \nKnicks locker room.'' In fact, it isn't. Both team play and successful \nlegislating are about getting different people from different \nbackgrounds with different personal agendas to come together and agree \non a common objective, and then work toward it.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have tried to balance the private \ninterests and the public interests, the rights of property owners and \nthe needs of society, the big players and the forgotten players. I \nhaven't always pleased everyone, but I have tried to be consistent on \nthe big issues, such as economy, race, America's role in the world.\n  I have also tried to take the long view, often passing up an \noccasional headline, to make sure when I spoke I knew what I was \ntalking about. Questions of structure, whether on taxes or trade or the \nenvironment, always interested me more than issues of marginal gain or \nquestions of blame or strategies for partisan political advantage.\n  I am saddened on occasion when the media and politicians ourselves \nconvey that politics is mean, cheap and dirty; that what we hold in \ncommon as Americans is somehow less than what we harbor in our hearts \nand minds as individuals. I have never believed that.\n  Commentators have remarked that so many Senators are leaving this \nyear that somehow the Senate will have lost its moderate pragmatic \ncenter. I strongly disagree with that. Many talented Senators with \ndistinguished records are leaving, but the Senate remains, and power in \nthe Senate rests in the middle. Future Senators will be no less \ninterested in exercising power than do those who are departing. \nTherefore, they will head to the center where knowing what you are \ntalking about, listening carefully, seeking common ground are the \nwinning attributes. The Senate does not reward extremes of either right \nor left. It rewards competence.\n  It is not possible, though, to sum up my 18 years in the Senate in a \nfew words, particularly when I recently took 427 pages to do it in a \nbook. But above all, the Senate is a human institution, shaped by the \ntalents and values and personalities of the Senators who are here at \nany one time. I owe much to those fellow Senators over the years, to \nmentors, such as Scoop Jackson and Russell Long, to my able New Jersey \ncolleague and good friend, Frank Lautenberg, to Robert Byrd, to Pat \nMoynihan, to Jack Danforth, to Al Simpson, to Bill Cohen, to Dick \nLugar, to Nancy Kassebaum, to Paul Sarbanes, to George Mitchell, to \nWendell Ford, to Tom Eagleton, to David Pryor, to Howell Heflin, to Sam \nNunn, and many, many others.\n  Over the years, I have been lucky to be assisted by competent staff \nin ways that are important for a Senate office. I always regarded the \nnewest intern in the mail room to be as relevant to the mission of \nrepresenting the people of New Jersey as the most senior legislative \naide. All of us were here for the same purpose. I gave my trust to \nmany, many members of my staff during my 18 years, and they honored \nthat trust. They represented me in countless meetings with other Senate \nand House staffers and appointees of four administrations. They \nalways made sure I had the information I needed to be prepared, they \namplified my voice, extended my reach, they knew my values, and used \ntheir own creativity to serve those same values.\n\n  The nature of a good Senator-staff/staff-Senator relationship lies \nsomewhere between the realms of family and team, with the mutual caring \nand sense of purpose that we expect respectively from each. I am \ngrateful to those ``family'' members and ``teammates'' who have \nenriched my time in the Senate with their intelligence, humanity, sense \nof humor and, above all else, hard, hard work.\n  We didn't win every battle with the bureaucracy on behalf of \nindividual New Jerseyans, but we held our own and, in the process, gave \nGovernment a little more of a human face. We didn't adopt every \namendment we wanted, but we were in the game, right there in the \ncenter, in the middle, where power is exercised and accomplishments \naccumulated in the U.S. Senate. By and large, and above all else, I \nbelieve those who served on my staff took public service seriously and \nbelieved they could make a difference in the life of our State and our \nNation, and I believe we have.\n  So, Mr. President, I am leaving the Senate, but I am not leaving \npublic life. The quest for a decent life and good wages for all \nAmericans is shaped by many influences that work on many levels. The \nimperative to engage the world flows through many channels; the fight \nfor justice occurs in many places.\n  I will continue to speak out and call it like I see it on race, on \nAmerica's role in the world, on the economic plight of the middle class \nand the poor, and on the need for thoroughgoing reform that will remove \nspecial interest from elections and reduce their influence on \nGovernment. In the coming years, I will not lessen my efforts. To the \ncontrary, I will increase them.\n  So, as I leave the familiar surroundings of the U.S. Senate, I don't \nknow what the future will bring, but I recall the words of Robert \nFrost:\n\n     The woods are lovely, dark and deep.\n     But I have promises to keep,\n     And miles to go before I sleep;\n     And miles to go before I sleep.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves \nthe floor, I just want to thank him for coming to the floor to really \nput before us a very moving tribute to the Senate from the perspective \nof one great Senator. As he mentioned those greats that he looked up to \nwhen he came to the Senate, on the day that I leave here--and, of \ncourse, you never know if it is going to be voluntary or if it is going \nto be something you plan, as the Senator planned his departure--but \nwhatever day that is for me, Senator Bradley's name will be on my lips.\n  I think he has just the right combination of hope and realism and \nintellect and heart and courage.\n\n  You will be missed, I say to my friend. For me to have had the \nprivilege, in too short a time really, to work with you on \nenvironmental issues and children's issues, campaign finance, and other \nimportant legislation, I have always looked to you for leadership and \nfor guidance. You do have many, many miles to go before you even take a \nnap, let alone sleep. Every one of us in the U.S. Senate--and really \nall the people in the country--I know I speak for California when I \nsay--you are a hero to so many of my constituents--that we wish you \nwell\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\nfrom the bottom of our hearts, and we look forward to working with you. \nI know I certainly do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12155-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING RON BROWN AND TED WEISS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when Senator Bradley spoke and he said he \nbelieved that this Senate would continue forward despite the fact that \nso many fine people on both sides of the aisle are leaving, it occurred \nto me that he is right, that the incredible strength of our democracy \nis the fact that we move forward. When there is a void to be filled, \nsomehow, even though you think it never will be--and it may take more \nthan one person to fill the void of one person's departure; it may take \nthree, it may take four--I just hope that we will all read the comments \nof the Senator from New Jersey, because one point he made is that he \ntried to stay away from the meanness of it all that we sometimes face.\n  I hope in that spirit we will in fact pass two bills that were just \nobjected to by the majority, one to rename a Federal building in New \nYork after Ron Brown and one to rename a Federal building in New York \nfor Ted Weiss. Both of these men served their country so well.\n  Ron Brown, as Secretary of Commerce, did so much in his lifetime to \nmove forward the cause of economic justice and to bring prosperity to \nall the people of this country. He died serving just that cause, that \nhuman cause. He died in a tragic plane crash with some other quite \nwonderful people. It seems to me we ought to come together as Democrats \nand Republicans and make this tribute to him and to his family.\n  Ted Weiss, someone I served with for 10 years in the House of \nRepresentatives, the toughest fighter for health care for those who \nneed it. The people of New York want to remember Ted this way. We ought \nto come together and make that possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12157-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12157-S12158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE OMNIBUS PARKS BILL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we ought to come together on this omnibus \nparks bill that is so important to 41 States. It seems to me that when \nthe House sent us over a bill which passed virtually unanimously--I \nthink it had four or five or six opposing votes--that was a statement \nthat the controversial projects were dropped from the parks bill.\n  If Republicans and Democrats in the House could come together on a \nparks bill, my goodness, why cannot we bring it up here and get it \ndone? The majority leader says he wants to get it done. I have no \nreason at all to doubt that. But I must say, Mr. President, that I \nunderstand the rules of the Senate. I know it is in his hands to bring \nthis bill before the U.S. Senate. He has chosen not to do that. If he \nhad brought this bill up like he did the FAA bill, we could have filed \na cloture motion. Mr. President, I daresay we would have had 70, 80, \nmaybe 90 votes in favor of bringing debate to a close and passing that \nparks bill.\n  How do I know this? Well, for one, I have spoken to most of my \ncolleagues individually. I know that every single Democratic Senator is \nin favor of this bill, and I know that the vast majority of Republican \nSenators are in favor of this bill.\n\n  Forty-one States. Alabama has two important parks projects in the \nbill, a historic trail designation and funding for a historic black \ncollege. Alaska has 10 projects included in this bill. Arizona has \nfour. Arkansas has two. California has 17. Colorado has nine. Florida \nhas one. Georgia has two, Hawaii has one. Idaho has five. Illinois has \ntwo. Kansas has two, including the Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, \nwhich is so important to the Senators from Kansas. Louisiana; Maryland; \nMassachusetts has four. Michigan has one; Mississippi two; Missouri \none; Montana two; New Hampshire two; New Jersey two, and one of those \nis Sterling Forest, which is so important to make that land purchase.\n  New Mexico has five. I have spoken to both Senators from New Mexico, \none a Democrat, one a Republican. They are most anxious to get this \nparks bill passed. New York has two projects. Ohio has one. Oklahoma \nhas one. Oregon has eight. Pennsylvania has two; one each in Rhode \nIsland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas; four in Utah, including the \nSnowbasin exchange, the Sand Hollow exchange, the Zion Park exchange, \nand a ski fees proposal. Virginia three; Washington State has three. \nWest Virginia has one. Wisconsin has one. Wyoming has three.\n  Then there are several others, including Martin Luther King Memorial; \nAmerican battlefield protection, which is so key; Japanese-American \nPatriot Memorial, and some very important national park agreements.\n  Mr. President, no one could ever stand up here and say that this bill \nis perfect. I daresay no bill is perfect. It may only be perfect to the \nbill's author. But in this case, so many people worked on this bill. In \nmany cases it took 2 years to get some of these provisions together.\n  Why am I so concerned? We have the Presidio in San Francisco, a \nformer military base with an extraordinary history. We want to set up a \nnonprofit public trust corporation to ensure that this magnificent \nsight becomes a jewel in the National Park System. We know we can do it \nwith this trust. If we do not have this trust, we are going to have to \ndo everything we can to have vision to make this work. But we know, \njust as the Pennsylvania Avenue rehabilitation took a trust, that a \ntrust would be able to really do this job for the Presidio.\n  We have other things in here for California that I worked on, bills \nthat I wrote for Manzanar which would preserve the very dark history of \nthe days where our Japanese-American friends were placed into camps, \ninternment camps during World War II. We want to preserve the history \nbecause we learn from history.\n  This bill is strongly supported by everyone in the House and in the \nSenate. We have a very important provision in here for the Cleveland \nNational Forest. So we have many things in our State.\n  But I truly am not here simply because of what is in this bill for \nCalifornia, although clearly it is very important to our State. This \nbill is an excellent bill. It came over from the House with tremendous \nbipartisan support. There is no reason why we should not be voting on \nthis bill.\n  The majority leader knows the rules, knows if he had brought it up, \nwe could have filed cloture, we could have had the vote, and we would \nhave had the bill.\n  He has chosen instead to say, I want to do this by unanimous consent. \nWell, that runs a bit of a risk, Mr. President, because just one \nSenator, in even an anonymous fashion, could object to this entire \npackage. I just, frankly, do not think that is fair. Too much work has \ngone in, too much sweat, too many tears, too many expectations, too \nmuch work to allow, it seems to me, one Senator to stop this bill.\n  Now, I am hopeful that we can get every single Republican to support \nthis bill. As I say, as far as I know, the vast majority do. I just \nwant to say to those who would consider objecting to this bill because \nsomething they wanted did not get in it, the beauty of the legislative \nprocess is that you live to fight another day.\n  Now, this year I have been most fortunate in being able to accomplish \na lot of my agenda. I am most appreciative of everyone, both in my \nState and on the committees here, who helped me do that on both sides \nof the aisle. I am most fortunate. It has been very productive for me. \nIf this goes down, this will be a harsh loss to me, but I can truly say \nwe will fight again. Why should 41 States be deprived of this bill? We \nhave the votes here to do it. We should have seen the bill brought up. \nWe should have had our vote. This bill should be on the way to the \nPresident.\n  Now, it can still happen by unanimous consent, but if one Senator \ntakes a position that he or she is going to say, ``I didn't get \neverything I wanted; I only got a few things for my State; I didn't get \neverything, therefore I am going to object,'' if one Senator does that, \nthat is a harsh thing to do. I want to keep reminding the Senate about \nthis. I know I will sound like a broken record, but that is a harsh \nthing to do.\n  For many years I have been working on an ocean sanctuary bill--\nstarted 14 years ago--to not allow the Federal waters off the coast of \nCalifornia to have additional oil drilling off that coast because of \nits dangers. I have a tremendous amount of support. Yet,\n\n[[Page S12158]]\n\nthere are some who believe that the oil industry should have their \nrights to do this, no matter what the consequence, and have blocked me \nfrom doing it. Now, I could stamp my foot and say I will object to \nevery single bill that comes through here unless I get my way.\n  Another area on the environment I am working on is to make sure \nchildren are protected so that when health and safety laws are written, \nwe take into account the vulnerability of our children, of our pregnant \nwomen, of our fragile senior citizens.\n  Now, I could hold up every bill that comes up and say, I didn't get \nmy way and I'm not going to let anything go through here by unanimous \nconsent because I think children should be protected. Let me tell you, \nI will fight for the children, I will fight for their safety, and I \nwill fight every day that I live, but I also understand in the U.S. \nSenate where people come with different viewpoints there is a time when \nyou come together on a bill that may not have every single thing you \nwant.\n  Mr. President, this is the moment, this is the time. We could have a \nunanimous consent request made right now to pass the bill that was \npassed in the House, no changes. We are going to live for another day. \nYes, a few of us will not be here next year, but as Senator Bradley has \nsaid, a lot of us will be, and there will be new people and a new parks \nbill and there will be a new day. But this parks bill that has all of \nthese important items in it, not the least of which is the Sterling \nForest in New Jersey and so many other important parks, it is \nincredible to me that we cannot resolve this.\n  One of the things I have been trying to do along with some of my \ncolleagues--the Senators from New Jersey have been helpful, the \nmajority leader, the Democratic leader, the White House--we have been \ntrying to see if there is some way, without adding anything to this \nbill--because it is very tenuous and it was sent over in a certain form \nand we should pass it--some way to take care of some noncontroversial \nissues that do not involve our forests and do not involve our wetlands \nand do not involve the kinds of things we must keep out of this bill. \nWe are working on that.\n\n  We are working to give respect to every Senator so that every Senator \nknows there is another day and this administration has respect for \nthose Senators who may not agree with everything in this bill. That is \nwhat we are trying to do, to show good faith and a recognition that not \nevery Senator is happy.\n  Mr. President, since the majority leader has decided not to call this \nbill up and he has tied our hands and we cannot file a cloture motion \nand we cannot vote on this, and we are losing time--if he insists on \nthat particular procedure, which is his call to make, no one else could \nmake the call for him, since the majority leader has set his course and \nhas said, ``I want a parks bill, but I am not bringing the bill up, but \nwe will do this by unanimous consent,'' if that is the case, then let \nus come together in the spirit of the closing days of this Congress, in \nthe spirit of the extraordinary Senators who are leaving this U.S. \nSenate who have fought hard, very hard, for items in this bill, whether \nit is Senator Bradley, Senator Kassebaum, just to name a couple, let us \ncome together and without a problem pass this bill and not come to the \nfloor saying, ``Well, we want to add more things to this bill.''\n  Yes, we are ending this Congress, but we are coming back in January. \nWe can do many of the things, especially if there is good will and we \nare not taking up very controversial matters that have been, yes, \npurposely kept out of this package. We cannot put them back in this \npackage. It is not going to fly. Not everybody got what they want in \nthis package. Not everybody will be thrilled with this package.\n  As I stand here in the waning hours of this Congress, we have an \nopportunity to leave here with a parks bill that has not included \ncontroversial provisions in it, that will not include controversial \nprovisions in it, but reaches out into this country, into rural areas, \nurban areas, into the most beautiful parts of this country, into those \nparts of this country where the beautiful parts are diminishing, and we \nmust reserve them. We can leave this Congress and feel so good that we \nreached across party lines and passed this bill. If they can do it in \nthe House with a few dissenting votes, we should be able to do it in \nthis U.S. Senate.\n  I intend to keep the Senate apprised of this issue as often as I have \nupdates.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I want to pay special tribute to \nthe outstanding career of the senior Senator from Wyoming, Alan \nSimpson.\n  Over the past 18 years, I have had the privilege of working with \nSenator Simpson in many different roles. His wit is unequaled. His \npassion for public life is inspiring. His commitment to the causes in \nwhich he believes--often regardless of their political implications--is \nunshakable.\n  Of course, during our shared 18 years in Congress, Alan Simpson and I \nhave sometimes disagreed. Neither of us has ever shied away from a \nhealthy debate, so some of those disagreements have been relatively \nspirited. But I have always respected his skill and determination, and \nI have always considered him a friend.\n  Senator Simpson has won many legislative battles. He's also lost a \nfew. But he has never allowed the odds against victory to discourage \nhim from a battle he believed to be worth fighting, and he has never \nlost his sense of humor.\n  Senator Simpson's special blend of humor and policy interests is \nexemplified in the book he is about to publish: ``Right in the Old \nGazoo: Observations From a Lifetime of Scrapping With the Press.''\n  Alan Simpson was born in Cody, WY, to a family with a long tradition \nof public service. His grandfather, William, was a successful and \nrespected attorney. His father, Mildred, was elected Governor and later \nserved Wyoming in the U.S. Senate.\n  Alan followed that tradition well. In 1958, he graduated from the \nUniversity of Wyoming Law School. In 1966, he was elected to the \nWyoming State Legislature, and, in 1978, he was elected to the U.S. \nSenate, where he will long be remembered as one of the most influential \nand effective Senators in Wyoming history.\n  After 30 years of public service, Senator Simpson will be remembered \nby many for countless different reasons. Some will remember his \nlegislative accomplishments. Some will remember the eloquence of his \nwords or the unique nature of his wit. Others will remember his \nfriendship and the love that he and his wife, Ann, share for their \nfamily.\n  I will remember Alan Simpson for all of those things. The Senate will \nbe a very different place without him, but I am confident that his \ninfluence on national affairs will continue through his next challenge \nas a visiting professor at Harvard. Senator Simpson will assume the \nLombard Chair at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. We know he \nwill bring all of the talents he brought to this body as Senator to \nthat responsibility as well. And all of those who are going to share \nthe good fortune of having the opportunity to listen to him, to \nexperience his wit, to experience his intellect, to experience his \ngreat vision about this country and the way he sees it today, will \nclearly be the beneficiaries. Linda and I wish him and Ann the very \nbest.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, we are in morning business. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mrs. FRAHM. Mr. President, I request up to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12159]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude for a \ngroup of individuals who all too often don't receive the credit that \nthey deserve, but we all know in this Chamber that they help to make \neverything happen. I am speaking of the staff, and particularly the \nstaff that has served and supported me since the day I was sworn in as \nSenator.\n  When Senator Dole departed this Chamber, among his rich legacy was a \ndedicated group of individuals totally committed to him and equally \ndevoted to the State of Kansas. I was fortunate to inherit this group \nof professionals, and together we have completed much of the work for \nKansas that Senator Dole had begun. Their experience, their knowledge, \nand their tireless efforts on behalf of our State has once again helped \nto make a difference.\n  To Bob Dole, public service has been both an honorable and a worthy \npursuit. ``Making a difference'' is how Bob puts it. In the Dole \nlexicon, there is no higher compliment than to tell someone that they \nhave made a difference. If he were here today, I know Bob Dole would \njoin me and the U.S. Senate in thanking our Hart Office staff, Sarah \nBrown, Darren Dick, Keira Franz, Ruth Ann Komarek, Tom Lewis, Kevin \nLinskey, Megan Lucas, Nathan Muyskens, Lisa Reynolds, Ron Seeber, Janet \nSena, Amy Smith, Dan Stanley, Erin Streeter, David Wilson, and Mike \nTorrey for all of the loyal service they have given this body and to \nKansas.\n\n  As Bob Dole would put it, ``You have made a difference.''\n  As each of the Senators know, the people who work in our State \noffices provide that vital link between the people and their \nGovernment. They serve on the front lines. They help people in need, \nlisten to their problems, receive the brunt of their frustrations, and \nin our absence these people toil daily in an effort to connect the \nGovernment to people's lives. I want to pay special tribute to our \nState office staff, Chuck Alderson, Judy Brown, Alan Cobb, Romona \nCorbin, Diana Dooms, Gale Grosch, Dave Spears, and Cathie Yeager. \nKansas is proud and deeply appreciative of their service.\n\n  There are five other special people who have been with me from the \nbeginning that I would also like to thank. They are Trent Ledouix, \nBruce Lott, Jim Rowland, Gayle Shaw, and Dave Young. Their service to \nme and to Kansas will always be remembered and appreciated.\n  Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I begin by paying my respects to those \nSenators who are departing this body. One of the great privileges for \nme has been to have worked with them. I think each in his own right has \nadded considerably to the dimension of the Senate, and particularly one \nSenator, Nancy Kassebaum, I wish to salute her for her many additions. \nI have had the occasion to sit on the Foreign Relations Committee with \nher and to observe her and watch her and see her do her homework. For \nme as a woman this has been a very special experience. So I want to \nparticularly salute her and also to thank the departing Senators for \nall of the courtesies they have extended to me and to the State of \nCalifornia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12159-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REACHING ACCOMMODATION ON THE PARKS BILL\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I echo the comments of my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, on the parks bill in the hopes that some accommodation \ncan be formulated in the next few hours that will give us a bill.\n  One of the most difficult things about this body, and I suppose any \nother body, is that we do not always get what we would like to get or \nthink we deserve in good conscience or what the body owes or what the \nGovernment should respond to. However, this is an important bill, and \nliterally dozens of States are impacted, all of them positively, by \nthis bill. For California, it is a particularly important bill.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for his indulgence, and I hope \nin the next few hours there can be some conclusion to this which will \nbring before us a bill that is significant for every Member of this \nbody.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12159-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12159-S12161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PENDING JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to address my remarks today to \npending judicial nominations. It is my understanding that there may be \nsome agreement to bring forward some additional judicial appointments \nbefore this Senate adjourns. I certainly hope that is the case. I want \nto point out five specific judges, relating to California, some of \nwhich have been before this body for a substantial period of time, and \nthe importance of those nominations.\n  We essentially have two appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals which could be filled by this Senate in the next day. The first \nis William Fletcher. He is a Harvard College graduate. He is a Rhodes \nScholar. He is a Navy officer. He is a graduate of Yale Law School. He \nhas been a law clerk for Justice Brennan, and a law professor at the \nUniversity of California at Berkeley since 1977. He actually received \nthe university's distinguished teaching award in 1993.\n  I was sitting on the Judiciary Committee when he came up for review. \nHe passed that committee with a favorable recommendation by a vote of \n12 to 6. At that time there was some concern about his mother's service \non the ninth circuit. An overture was made, as to whether his mother \nwould be willing to either retire or take senior status. She has since \nsaid that she would be willing to take senior status to avoid any tinge \nof nepotism, should he be appointed to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  I might say this. The American Bar Association has unanimously rated \nProfessor Fletcher, ``well qualified.'' That is its highest rating. His \nacademic colleagues have stated to us that he is fair minded and \npolitically moderate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of letters \nregarding Professor Fletcher's nomination be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is very hard to understand why he has been \nlingering on the Executive Calendar, essentially since May 16, without \nour having an opportunity to discuss his candidacy on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. I hope we would have that opportunity. I think it is \nimportant that we do so.\n  Another candidate who has been waiting before this body since June \n27, when she passed the Judiciary Committee on a unanimous vote, is \nMargaret Morrow, who has been nominated for District Judge in the \nCentral District of California, in Los Angeles. She is a graduate of \nBryn Mawr magna cum laude. She is a graduate of Harvard Law School, cum \nlaude. She is a partner in a prominent Los Angeles law firm.\n  She has won the Bernard E. Witkin Amicus Curiae Award from the \nCalifornia Judicial Council in 1995. She has received the Ernestine \nStalhut Award for the most distinguished woman lawyer in Los Angeles. \nShe has received the President's award from the California Association \nof Court-Appointed Special Advocates. She has received the Pro Bono \nAdvocacy Award from the Western Center on Law and Poverty. She has \nreceived a number of special awards.\n  She is the first woman president of the California Bar Association \nand served as president of the Los Angeles Bar Association. She was \nfound also to be ``well qualified.''\n\n[[Page S12160]]\n\n  Her nomination has been languishing in this body since June 27. I \nhope that in any arrangement that might be put forward, both Margaret \nMorrow as well as William Fletcher would be part of that arrangement. \nThis is extraordinarily important to me.\n  Another Presidential nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nRichard Paez. Richard Paez has had a hearing on July 31. Action in the \nJudiciary Committee has not yet been taken. He was nominated by the \nPresident on January 25.\n  Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and the \nUniversity of California Law School. He has had a distinguished career \nin Los Angeles, where he served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court from \n1981 to 1994. He was chairman of the Los Angeles County Municipal \nJudges Association in 1990. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing and \nthis Senate did appoint him to the District Court for the Central \nDistrict of California in 1994, so he has had a hearing by the \nJudiciary Committee. He has been approved by them, and he has been \napproved by this body for the district court.\n\n  Now the President has seen fit to recommend him for appointment to \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I hope that action might be taken \non his case prior to the end of this session.\n  There is one hardship case that I would like to raise at this time. \nThe national average caseload for all cases is 448 cases per judge. The \nnational average for criminal cases is 51 cases per judge. San Diego \nhas a major caseload problem. In the Southern District of California, \nin San Diego, the average caseload is almost double that of the \nnational average, 726 cases per judge. It is quadruple the national \naverage in Federal criminal cases, with 213 criminal cases per judge.\n  Jeffrey T. Miller, who is one of my nominees, was nominated to be \ndistrict judge for the Southern District of California. He is a sitting \nState superior court judge in San Diego, and has sat on that bench \nsince 1987. Prior to that time, he was deputy attorney general in the \nCalifornia attorney general's office from 1968 to 1987. I took this up \nat the Judiciary Committee. I have asked for hearings to be able to \nconsider his case. Judge Keep of the district court in San Diego has \ncalled and has indicated her concern about the caseload and asked if \nthis body might be willing to take action to confirm this judge. With a \ncriminal caseload that is quadruple the national average and overall \ncaseload that is almost double the national average, I think on a \nhardship case that judge, as well, should be approved.\n  I would like to just end with one additional judge and that is \nChristina Snyder, nominated to be the U.S. district judge, District \nCourt for the Central District of California, in hopes that her case \nmight also be heard. I recognize she has not yet had a committee \nhearing and has been waiting for one to take place since May 15.\n  What I have tried to do is indicate two court of appeals judges who I \nthink should be part of any final passage. Certainly, at the very \nleast, one district court judge, Margaret Morrow, who has been waiting \na long time, should be part of any final passage.\n  I wanted to make very clear to this whole body the importance of this \nto me, in considering any final passage of judicial appointments which \nmight come before this body. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               University of Texas\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                   Austin, TX, September 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: My expectation is that the letter I \n     wrote Judge Mikva many months ago, urging the President to \n     nominate William Fletcher for a seat on the Ninth Circuit, is \n     a part of the file that your committee has in passing on that \n     nomination. It occurred to me, however, that it might be \n     useful for me to write you directly to say what a fine \n     appointment that is and how much I hope that it will be \n     confirmed by the Senate.\n       I do not doubt that Professor Fletcher is more liberal on \n     many issues than I am. That seems to me almost entirely \n     irrelevant. Over the years that I have known him and also \n     read his writing, what has greatly impressed me has been that \n     he has a quality that I regard as absolutely essential for a \n     scholar and that I regard as equally important for a judge. \n     This is the ability to put his own preferences aside and to \n     hunt objectively to see what answer the law provides.\n       Too many scholars approach a new issue with preconceptions \n     of how it should come out and they then force the data that \n     their research uncovers to support the conclusion they had \n     formed before they did any research. I think that is \n     reprehensible for a scholar and it is dangerous for a judge.\n       I am completely confident that when Fletcher finishes his \n     service on the Ninth Circuit we will say not that he has been \n     a liberal judge or a conservative judge but that he has been \n     an excellent judge, one who has brought a brilliant mind, \n     great powers of analysis, and total objectivity to the cases \n     that came before him.\n       Although you do not know me well, I believe that our \n     acquaintance over a number of years has been enough for you \n     to know that I would not say this merely because I think of \n     Fletcher as a friend, I have spent a lifetime working for the \n     improvement of the federal courts. I believe that the \n     nomination of William Fletcher will add strength to the Ninth \n     Circuit and I hope very much that he is confirmed.\n       It is wonderful to have you as Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee, I wish you well in that challenging task. Anytime \n     I can be of assistance to you or the Committee on the kinds \n     of matters on which I have some expertness, I would be \n     delighted to help.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charlie Wright.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, October 18, 1995.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We understand that William A. Fletcher, \n     Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, \n     has been nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Ninth Circuit. We write to express our exceptionally high \n     regard for his abilities and our deep enthusiasm about the \n     prospect of his confirmation.\n       One of us (Daniel Meltzer) has known Mr. Fletcher for more \n     than 19 years, since the time they served together as clerks \n     at the United States Supreme Court. Though they now reside on \n     different coasts, they have maintained their friendship, and \n     because they teach the same law school course (Federal \n     Courts), they have been professional colleagues, discussing \n     academic matters, reading each other's publications, \n     exchanging manuscripts, and engaging in other forms of \n     academic collaboration.\n       Mr. Shapiro also knows Mr. Fletcher. Like Mr. Meltzer, he \n     too teaches Federal Courts and hence has long been familiar \n     with Mr. Fletcher's scholarship. Mr. Shapiro also served as \n     Deputy Solicitor General, from 1988-91, which gave him an \n     additional vantage point on both the work of the federal \n     courts and on Mr. Fletcher's contribution to scholarship in \n     that field.\n       In our opinion, Mr. Fletcher is a scholar of the first-\n     rank. His writing in the area of Federal Courts displays \n     intellectual rigor, mastery of the subject, and very sound \n     and balanced judgment about complex and controversial legal \n     matters. His voice is an important one that is broadly \n     respected by a wide range of scholars. His work reflects the \n     abilities not only of a creative scholar, but also of a \n     careful and thoughtful lawyer.\n       Mr. Fletcher's scholarly work extends also to the fields of \n     federal civil procedure and federal constitutional law. Thus, \n     the sphere of his interests and achievements as a scholar \n     constitute ideal preparation for the work of a federal \n     circuit judge.\n       Finally, Mr. Fletcher is a person of enormous integrity, \n     unfailing decency, and great personal warmth and good humor. \n     In light of those qualities, we believe that fellow judges of \n     all viewpoints would find him a congenial colleague, and \n     would develop for him the same professional admiration that \n     he has earned across the academic spectrum.\n       We hope that his assessment is helpful. Please let us know \n     if we can be of any further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel J. Meltzer,\n       Professor of Law.\n     David L. Shapiro,\n       William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       University of Pennsylvania,\n\n\n                                               The Law School,\n\n                               Philadelphia, PA, October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As you know, the President has \n     nominated Professor William A. Fletcher to be a judge on the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Because \n     I have known Willy since we were college classmates and \n     because I have such high regard for his character and \n     abilities, I write to urge that you support his confirmation \n     by the Senate.\n       By way of background, I was a law clerk to the late Chief \n     Justice Burger in 1974-75 and have been on the faculty of the \n     University of Pennsylvania Law School since 1979. I teach and \n     write in the areas of civil procedure, conflict of laws and \n     judicial administration. I had the pleasure of meeting and \n     testifying before you and other members of the Subcommittee \n     on the Constitution of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \n     together with Chief Judge Clifford Wallace, in 1986. The \n     subject of that hearing, Senate Joint Resolutions that would \n     have altered in fundamental ways our arrangements for federal \n     judicial discipline, subsequently occupied my attention\n\n[[Page S12161]]\n\n     as a member of the National Commission on Judicial Discipline \n     and Removal. On the Commission I worked particularly closely \n     with the Vice-Chair, Judge S. Jay Plager of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we co-authored \n     an article about the Commission's work.\n       As I mentioned, I knew Professor Fletcher as a student at \n     Harvard College, where he had a distinguished record, \n     graduating magna cum laude in history and literature (then \n     perhaps the most difficult major at Harvard) in 1968. He \n     earned another degree at Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship and \n     then served on active duty in the Navy. Following law school \n     at Yale and clerkships with Judge Weigel and Justice Brennan, \n     Willy joined the faculty at Boalt Hall (Berkeley), where he \n     has been ever since (with occasional visiting appointments at \n     other schools).\n       Willy is a scholar of federal courts, constitutional law, \n     and civil procedure. Because our interests overlap to a \n     considerable extent, I have read almost everything he has \n     written. His work is both analytically acute and painstaking \n     in its regard for history. Indeed, love of and respect for \n     history shine through all of his work, as the history itself \n     illuminates the various corners of the law he enters. For \n     instance, Willy's article on the Rules of Decision Act is a \n     tour de force. He uses marine insurance cases from our early \n     days to show how differently the judges and other lawyers of \n     that period thought about law and hence to reveal current \n     interpretations of that very important statute as the product \n     of a philosophy (positivism) far removed from the minds of \n     the First Congress. Of greater current interest are his \n     writings on the Eleventh Amendment, which has attracted \n     volumes of teleological scholarship--what is sometimes \n     referred to as ``law office history.'' Willy's work is, by \n     contrast, scrupulous, balanced, and, I believe, persuasive.\n       If only because Willy has been nominated by this President, \n     for whose campaign in Northern California he served as unpaid \n     codirector, I wish to stress that the qualities of care and \n     balance characterize all of Willy's scholarship. He is also a \n     lucid writer. As a result, his Yale article on the \n     ``Structure of Standing'' may well be the best treatment of \n     that confusing subject in the literature, as well as the most \n     faithful to the history of the doctrine. It is also far \n     removed from the expansive approach of Justice Douglas and \n     other members of the Warren Court.\n       In sum, as to Willy's legal qualifications, I second the \n     views of Charles Alan Wright expressed in the enclosed \n     article from the Los Angeles Times. I would add only the \n     suggestion that, if you have any residual doubt, you solicit \n     the views of my colleague, Geoffrey Hazard. Geof recruited \n     Willy to work with him on his casebook in Civil Procedure, \n     the best evidence of the high regard of a demanding critic. \n     Of course you can make the judgment yourself.\n       Finally, believing as I do--particularly after service on \n     the National Commission on Judicial Discipline and Removal--\n     that character is of equal importance with intelligence as a \n     desideratum in a judge, I can testify from thirty years of \n     knowing Willy Fletcher that he will bring great distinction \n     to the federal judiciary. He is a man of integrity and \n     compassion but one who knows that the law cannot (and should \n     not) solve all of society's problems.\n       Please let me know if I can provide any additional \n     information.\n       I hope that you are well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Stephen B. Burbank,\n         David Berger Professor for the Administration of Justice \n           and Acting Dean.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the New Republic, May 22, 1995]\n\n       On the other hand: After two years of lamenting President \n     Clinton's failure to appoint scholars to the federal courts, \n     we're delighted to note that he last week nominated U.C.-\n     Berkeley's William Fletcher to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n       Fletcher is the most impressive scholar of federal \n     jurisdiction in the country. His path-breaking articles on \n     sovereign immunity and federal common law have transformed \n     the debates in those fields; and his work is marked by the \n     kind of careful historical and textual analysis that should \n     serve as a model for liberals and conservatives alike.\n       If confirmed, Fletcher will join his mother, Betty, on the \n     Ninth Circuit but his judicial philosophy is more restrained \n     than hers. We hope he is confirmed as swiftly as possible.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my very great privilege to honor a \nrequest from Senator Claiborne Pell's staff to read a letter they have \nwritten to him, which will come as a great surprise to him. It is the \nfollowing:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington DC, September 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Claiborne Pell,\n     Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pell: As your current Washington and Rhode \n     Island staff--representing a collective total of 394 years of \n     service--we want to let you know of our great esteem for you.\n       Each of us has developed our own relationship with you over \n     the years; many of us know you very well. We all have \n     tremendous affection and admiration for you. We admire you \n     for your integrity and conscience, compassion and \n     understanding, and for your devotion to Rhode Island and your \n     constituents. You have been an exceptional and devoted public \n     servant for 36 years, and in that, a constant example to all \n     of us who served your cause.\n       You have always extended to each of us the greatest measure \n     of respect, courtesy, and kindness. You have been sensitive \n     and caring when we had personal problems or tragedies, and \n     you have joined us in celebrating the good things that have \n     happened in our lives. Even in the fast-paced, high pressure \n     world of Capitol Hill, you never failed to say ``please'' or \n     ``thank you'' and always had a word of praise for a job well \n     done. Few, if any, of us have ever seen you lose your temper; \n     most of us don't think you have one.\n       Those of us who have traveled around Rhode Island, and \n     indeed the world, with you or on your behalf continue to be \n     proud, though not surprised, at the love, affection, trust, \n     and approval that greets you. But your overwhelming \n     popularity should not be misconstrued as a failure to take \n     unpopular positions; to the contrary, you have often cast \n     votes which find you in the smallest minority, allowing your \n     conscience and good judgment to be your guide. You were able \n     to do this and not only survive politically, but thrive \n     politically, because you are a leader, and the people of \n     Rhode Island knew that you would lead, even if others were \n     slow to follow.\n       Since your retirement announcement last fall, we have been \n     touched, pleased, and proud of the many tributes of your \n     colleagues and friends. In particular, there have been \n     bipartisan accolades about your ``civility'' toward other \n     Members, even in the heat of debate. We whole-heartedly agree \n     with this assessment because we know your civility is \n     universal.

HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, quite the most notable, if at times \nlittle noted, fact about the American Constitution is that the Framers \nbrought a\n\n[[Page S12162]]\n\nwholly new conception of the nature of political man to the design of \nAmerican Government. They were keenly aware of this fact, for it was \ncrucial to their claim that a republic might work, given, as ``The \nFederalist'' remarks at some point, ``the fugitive existence'' of the \nancient republics of Greece, and that of Rome. That history was \nfamiliar to what we would call educated persons in the 18th century, \nand it made for skepticism at best; pessimism in the main. But harken, \nsaid the Framers, we have developed a ``new science of politics,'' \nwhich radically changes the assumptions on which those ancient \ngovernments were founded. We would not depend on virtue in our rulers; \nvirtue was too rare, too fleeting, too unforeseeable. To the contrary, \nwe would take man as he is and use his defects to perfect a new system \nof government that would endure by virtue of its recognition of how \nlittle virtue may be depended upon. Instead, we would build into our \nGovernment a system of checks and balances whereby the clash of \ninterests would offset one another and make up, in that wonderful \nphrase, for ``the defect of better motives.''\n  Well, the Republic has endured. In the world today there are two \nnations and two only which both existed in 1800 and have not had their \nform of government changed since then. That is to say, the United \nStates and the United Kingdom. And, of course, the case can be made \nthat the Government of the United Kingdom is radically different, then \nfrom now. Ours is the very same in structure, with changes that only \nreaffirm the original purpose; reaffirm and enhance. And surely time \nhas confirmed the Framers in their judgment that interest, not virtue, \nwould rule the polity. Not unbridled, demonic interest; but interest \nwithal.\n  The more, then, may we note and ought we note the appearance from \ntime to time of a political figure singular for disinterestedness and \nfor virtue, as the ancients would have understood it, and which is as \nsingular today as ever, and immediately recognizable. Such a person is \nMark Hatfield of Oregon, who would never dream of calling himself the \nconscience of the Senate, although he has been just that for an \nastounding 30 years.\n  I state that he would never dream of thinking himself such, much less \nencouraging others to do. For he is singularly of that great Anabaptist \ntradition which condemned government involvement in religion and which \neventually led to the idea of the separation of church and state. Mark \nHatfield would fear that conscience might too readily decline into \ndogma. And so, he has spoke but little of such matters. He has merely \nand singularly embodied them.\n  He came of age in the Second World War, and served in the U.S. Navy \nfrom 1943 to 1946. At the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue there is \ncarved in granite a wonderful line of John F. Kennedy: ``Any man who \nmay be asked in this century what he did to make his life worthwhile, \ncan respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction, `I served in \nthe United States Navy.' '' I would simply say that this would surely \nbe the case had he served with the like of Mark Hatfield. A man of deep \npacific conviction, serving his country in wartime withal.\n  He returned to become a professor of political science at his own \nWillamette University. There then began a political science lesson of \ndazzling deftness and direction. First, the Oregon House of \nRepresentatives. Next, the Oregon State Senate. Secretary of State; \nGovernor. Thence to the U.S. Senate.\n  There is none of us in this body who does not treasure some aspect of \nhis great, transcendent qualities. For my own part, may I record his \ndogged, affectionate, informed interest in the career of Herbert \nHoover. Woodrow Wilson had two subcabinet members who would go on to \nthe Presidency: Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hoover was by \nfar the more learned and experienced man, but fate was harsh. And it \nwas a kind of fate, not so different from that of Wilson himself, as \nHoover depicted it in a superb account, ``The Ordeal of Woodrow \nWilson.'' The book, first published in 1958, was reprinted in 1992. \nNaturally, a brilliant introduction was written by Mark Hatfield.\n  And so he and his beloved Antoinette return to Oregon and to his \nchair at Willamette University. We must not say we will not see his \nlike again. The Constitution does not call for such, but one doubts the \nRepublic can be sustained without some such as he. One or two a \ngeneration: capable of gaining power not for power's sake, but for \nvirtue's imperatives. In our time that man has been Mark Hatfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12161-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12162-S12163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COAST GUARD REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senator Stevens for \nhis hard work to reauthorize the U.S. Coast Guard [USCG]. This small \nbut vital Federal agency has faithfully served our Nation since 1790. \nConsidered by many to be a model agency, the USCG has been the guardian \nof safety and security for our Nation's maritime highways and sea links \nto the world. Under the joint leadership of Senator Stevens and \nRepresentative Bud Shuster, a long-overdue reauthorization of this \nworthy agency has been completed. A difficult task. A real \naccomplishment.\n  Because almost all of our imports, exports and domestic freight are \ntransported by water, the reauthorization of the USCG is of utmost \nimportance. Approximately 90 percent of Americans live within 100 miles \nof the coast or a major waterway. Many Americans enjoy recreation near \nthe water and many pursue their livelihoods using affordable products \nefficiently transported by water. Clearly, the Coast Guard protects \nthese vital interests.\n  The Coast Guard has made great strides toward fostering our \nprosperity and safety. In my home State of Mississippi over the past 2 \nyears, the USCG has conducted nearly 4,000 search and rescue missions, \nsaving over 200 lives and $9 million in property. Let me tell my \ncolleagues about a few noteworthy accomplishments made in the State of \nMississippi.\n  Last fall, an overturned propane truck in Kiln, MS, was righted and \nthe road was promptly reopened. This was due to the direct and \ncoordinated efforts of the Coast Guard and the local volunteer fire \ndepartment.\n  Last winter, the Coast Guard coordinated a 1-month cleanup plan in \nresponse to a slurry oil discharge between the levees and the batture \nin Vicksburg. This required a cooperative effort between the \nauthorities in two States, Mississippi and Louisiana, leading to the \ndevelopment of contingency plans for interstate and railroad bridges \nshould another barge-rail accident occur.\n  In 1995, Hurricanes Erin and Opal hit Mississippi's coastal towns. \nThe Coast Guard's proactive approach to this situation mitigated \ncountless small oil spills caused by sinking pleasure crafts.\n  When a chemical release in the Port of Bienville caused a significant \nfish kill, the Coast Guard served as the first response agency, taking \nimmediate steps to contain the spill.\n  With 2 percent of America's imported oil coming through the port of \nPascagoula, there is great potential for accident. Thanks to the \nvigilance of the Coast Guard, this lightering operation has been \neffective and environmentally safe. In fact, their recent mapping of \nthe environmentally sensitive areas along Mississippi's coast and \nwaterways has permitted the Coast Guard to respond to potential \npollutants in a more effective and focused manner.\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the State of Mississippi, I would like to \npersonally commend the hard work of the men and women serving the Coast \nGuard at Point Estero and Point Monroe in Gulfport, Patoka in \nGreenville, Greenbrier in Natchez, Kickapoo in Vicksburg and \nPascagoula, as well as those who work at Station Gulfport, Aids to \nNavigation Team Gulfport, and the National Data Buoy Center at Stennis \nSpace Center.\n  The Coast Guard may be one of the most productive agencies in the \nGovernment today. In lives and property alone, the Coast Guard returns \na value to America equal to nearly four times its total cost. On an \naverage day, the Coast Guard seizes illegal shipments of narcotics with \na street value of over $7 million, interdicts 14 illegal migrants, \nresponds to 38 oil or hazardous chemical spills, conducts 180 search \nand rescue cases, saves 12 lives and services 150 aids to navigation. \nThe Coast Guard does this every day, all year round, for less than $4 \nbillion annually. I believe\n\n[[Page S12163]]\n\nthat no other government investment can match the unique value of the \nCoast Guard.\n  Despite this heavy workload, however, the Coast Guard has \naggressively sought to streamline its organization and reduce its \noverall budget. In the past 3 years, Adm. Robert E. Kramek, the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, has reduced the service's work force by \n4,000 positions and lowered it's annual budget by $400 million--all \nwithout reducing any services to the general public. While many \nagencies have failed to offer meaningful contributions to our efforts \nto balance the Federal budget, the Coast Guard has been a leader in \nfiscal responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I again commend Senator Stevens and Representative \nShuster for their dedication to reauthorizing the USCG. I would also \nlike to recognize two staff members whose focused efforts were integral \nto the success of this reauthorization, Tom Melius of Senator Stevens' \nstaff and Rebecca Dye of Representative Coble's staff. Their hard work \nhas certainly paid off. This legislation will ensure that the Coast \nGuard will continue to do an excellent job of protecting our Nation's \nmaritime highways for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12162-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr President, I rise to comment briefly on an aspect of \nthe omnibus fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill that the Senate just \npassed.\n  My Senate colleagues will recall that the Internal Revenue Service \nhas proposed a field office reorganization that would cut 2,490 \nemployees, many of them from front-line taxpayer assistance jobs. These \nemployees are now in field offices, where they provide needed services \nto taxpayers in North Dakota and other rural States. The IRS proposes \nto hire 1,500 new employees in its regional headquarters to do some of \nthe same work now carried out at the field office level.\n  This IRS proposal puzzles me for a number of reasons.\n  First, we all know that taxpayers too often have trouble getting \nstraight answers out of the IRS. The proposed reorganization would make \nit even more difficult for North Dakotans to have access to advice and \nassistance on how to comply with Federal tax law. I often hear from \nconstituents who are frustrated at their inability to get sound tax \nadvice from this agency. A 1-800 number, which may or may not be \nanswered, is no substitute for the ability to walk into an IRS field \noffice and receive advice in person.\n  Second, if the IRS is trying to save money, it could start by \nexamining its personnel policies on the rotation of managers. My State \nstaff tells me that no other Federal agency changes its management \nstaff as constantly as does the IRS. Sometimes the North Dakota State \ndirector stays for only a year or so before moving on to the regional \noffice in Saint Paul, or elsewhere. Besides harming institutional \nmemory about tax matters in North Dakota, this rapid turnover means \nthat the IRS must spend more on moving expenses. The IRS also has an \narrangement with local real estate firms to buy managers' homes so that \nthose leaving North Dakota do not suffer any loss as they leave. I am \ntold that the IRS district that includes North and South Dakota and \nMinnesota has spent $300,000 on managerial moves in the past few years. \nNone of the front-line employees who may be fired will be eligible for \nthis sort of moving assistance.\n\n  Third, by moving jobs from North Dakota to St. Paul, the IRS will \nactually be increasing its payroll costs. A salary of $30,000 will go \nmuch further in a small city than in a large metropolitan area. The IRS \nis therefore likely to be able to attract more qualified people in my \nState than in the Twin Cities with the same salary level.\n  Given my concern with this IRS proposal, I am pleased that the \nomnibus\n\n[[Page S12164]]\n\nappropriations bill contains a provision that would delay the \nreorganization plan until March 1997, at the earliest. In addition, \nbefore implementing its reorganization, the IRS will have to submit a \nreport to the Congress justifying its plan on cost-benefit grounds.\n  This provision is not a perfect solution to this problem. I would \nhave preferred the original language offered by Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska to the freestanding Treasury-Postal appropriations bill. That \nlanguage would have delayed the reorganization until the National \nCommission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service had a chance \nto issue its final report.\n  Nevertheless, this provision buys us time to try to understand the \nproposed reorganization and to see whether the IRS can justify its \nplan. I look forward to working with the distinguished minority leader, \nSenator Daschle, and the ranking member of the Treasury-Postal \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Kerrey, to ensure that the IRS \ndoes not abandon rural States in a misguided attempt to achieve phantom \nsavings.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12163-6", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FEDERAL FIREARMS DISABILITIES PROVISION OF THE OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS \n                                  BILL\n\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, upon the passage of the omnibus \nappropriations package, I would like to take a moment to discuss a \nprovision that will prohibit the expenditure of funds for the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' [ATF] disability relief program.\n  The background behind this simple provision is as follows. Under \ncurrent Federal law, someone who has been convicted of a crime \npunishable by more than 1 year is ineligible, or disabled, from \npossessing a firearm--a sensible idea. However, Congress created a \nloophole in 1965 whereby convicted felons could apply to ATF to have \ntheir firearm privileges restored, at an estimated taxpayer cost of \n$10,000 per waiver granted.\n  We have fought to end this program and have succeeded in stripping \nthe program's funding in annual appropriations bills since 1992.\n  This year, we faced an additional challenge in our efforts to keep \nguns out of the hands of convicted felons. A recent court case in \nPennsylvania misinterpreted our intentions and opened the door for \nthese convicted felons to apply for judicial review of their disability \nrelief applications.\n  In this case, Rice versus United States, the Third Circuit Court of \nAppeals found that the current funding prohibition does not make clear \ncongressional intent to bar all avenues of relief for convicted felons. \nBy their reasoning, since ATF is unable to consider applications for \nrelief, felons are entitled to ask the courts to review their \napplications.\n  This misguided decision could flood the courts with felons seeking \nthe restoration of their gun rights, effectively shifting from ATF to \nthe courts the burden of considering these applications. Instead of \nwasting taxpayer money and the time of ATF agents, which could be much \nbetter spent on important law enforcement efforts, such as the \ninvestigation of church arsons, we would now be wasting court resources \nand distracting the courts from consideration of serious criminal \ncases.\n  Fortunately, another decision by the fifth circuit in U.S. versus \nMcGill found that congressional intent to prohibit any Federal relief--\neither through ATF or the courts--is clear. The fifth circuit concluded \nthat convicted felons are therefore not eligible for judicial review of \ntheir relief applications.\n  Given this conflict in the circuit courts, it is important that we \nonce again clarify our original and sustaining intention. The goal of \nthis provision has always been to prohibit convicted felons from \ngetting their guns back--whether through ATF or the courts. It was \nnever our intention to shift the burden to the courts.\n  Congressman Durbin and his colleagues succeeded in their efforts to \ninclude language in the House appropriations bill to make clear that \nconvicted felons may not use the courts in their efforts to get their \nguns back. I applaud the House committee for its wise vote on this \nissue.\n  During the same markup, Congressman Durbin's efforts were undermined \nby a related exemption offered by Congressman Obey. This exemption \nwould have allowed those individuals convicted of nonviolent felonies \nthe ability to appeal for judicial review of their relief application.\n  According to Congressman Obey's amendment, the opportunity to appeal \nto the courts would have been closed to those felons convicted of \nviolent crimes, firearms violations, or drug-related crimes. All other \nfelons would have been allowed to apply to the courts for review of \ntheir relief applications.\n  Mr. Obey's exemption was clearly inconsistent with the original \nintent of this provision for three simple reasons:\n\n  First, one need only consider people like Al Capone and countless \nother violent criminals who were convicted of lesser, nonviolent \nfelonies, to understand how dangerous this Capone amendment will be to \npublic safety. Our intent when we first passed this provision--and \nevery year thereafter--has been to prohibit anyone who was convicted of \na crime punishable by more than 1 year from restoring their gun \nprivileges via the ATF procedure or a judicial review.\n\n  Second, as Dewey Stokes, the former president of the Fraternal Order \nof Police noted, most criminals do not commit murder as their first \ncrime. Rather, most criminals start by committing nonviolent crimes \nwhich escalate into violent crimes. An ATF analysis shows that between \n1985 and 1992, 69 nonviolent felons were granted firearms relief and \nsubsequently re-arrested for violent crimes such as attempted murder, \nfirst degree sexual assault, child molestation, kidnaping/abduction, \nand drug trafficking.\n  Third, there is no reason in the world for the taxpayers' money and \ncourt resources to be wasted by allowing the review of any convicted \nfelons' application to get their guns back. It made no sense for ATF to \ntake agents away from their important law enforcement work, and it \nmakes even less sense for the courts, which have no experience or \nexpertise in this area, to be burdened with this unnecessary job. Let \nme make this point perfectly clear: It was never our intent, nor is it \nnow, for the courts to review a convicted felon's application for \nfirearm privilege restoration.\n  I am pleased that the conference committee understood our original \nintention and did not allow the Obey provision to stand. As it stands, \nthe omnibus appropriations law is consistent with our lasting desire to \nstop arming felons.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for clearly laying out the facts. \nAs the coauthor of this provision, I share his interest and concern \nabout this issue. I am also pleased that the conference committee \nunderstood our intent regarding the Federal firearms relief program. I \nagree with his analysis completely and intend to closely follow this \nsituation in the coming year to see if any further legislation is \nnecessary to clarify our intent. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to let my colleague know how much I enjoyed working on this \nissue with him as well as so many other matters. I want to thank him \nfor his commitment to this issue, and for the excellent work of Susan \nKaplan and Amy Isbell of his staff, and I want to ensure him that \nalthough he will not be here next year to continue his work in the \nSenate on this matter, I fully intend to carry on the fight for us \nboth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12164-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12164-S12165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

And again, as others have noted, this particular iteration \nof these departures is notable, not only because of the numbers of our \nfriends who are going on to other pursuits, but more importantly \nbecause of the quality of their contributions while they were here, \nwhich we now face doing without.

In these \nhistoric 36 years, which have included some of our Nation's greatest \nand most contentious challenges, Claiborne Pell has graced these Halls \nand the debates and legislative struggles therein, with reasoned \ninsight, deft statesmanship, and calming counsel.

BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe South's great men and one of the Nation's great legislators, \nSenator J. Bennett Johnston. Back in January 1995, when Senator \nJohnston announced he would not seek a fourth term in the U.S. Senate, \nI thought then that we were about to lose a master of the legislative \nprocess and a true gentleman.\n  Whether working on the Naiton's energy policy or working to address \nthe nagging problem of nuclear waste storage, you could count on \nSenator Johnston, a master negotiator, to solve all but the most \ncontentious problems before they reached the public eye. You could bet \nyour boots that Bennett Johnston would not take an issue to the floor \nuntil he had those problems solved or knew the issue so well that no \nSenator could challenge him on the facts. As my colleagues know, he \nknows more than all of us combined about the intricacies and complex \ndetails of every energy issue, even the most complex and technical.\n  As chairman or ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and the Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Johnston has placed his stamp on Louisiana and \nthe Nation. I remember his dogged determination in passing the National \nEnergy Security Act, a major revamping of the Nation's energy policy. \nTime and time again, he defeated attempts to kill the legislation and \nshepherded the bill into law. I also remember his work on an issue \nwhich is of great importance to my State--that of nuclear waste \ndisposal. Bennett Johnston has carried this program almost single \nhandedly, and, although we still have a ways to travel before putting \nthis problem to bed, without Senator Johnston's work, we would be light \nyears away from a solution. For all this, the people of Louisiana and \nthe Nation are grateful.\n  I think the thing which the Senate will miss most is Senator \nJohnston's ability to solve the most contentious problems in a \ncongenial manner. In that sense, he reflects the best of the South--\nthat of being a gentleman. No matter how heated the debate or \ncontroversial the issue, Senator Johnston had a smile on his face and \ntreated his opponent with respect. In today's political climate, it is \nthis attitude which we will miss most.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Senator Johnston amassed a long list of \naccomplishments during his career in the Senate. A career which began \n24 years ago, and, if he had chosen to pursue reelection, could have \ncontinued indefinitely.\n  When Senator Johnston announced to the Senate that he was leaving, he \nquoted the great Senator Russell M. Long of Louisiana who said, ``It is \nimportant to retire as a champ, and to leave the stage when the crowd \nstill likes your singing.''\n  Mr. President, the Senate still likes Senator Johnston's singing, and \nI hate to see him exit the stage. As Senator Johnston leaves, I \ncongratultate him for all his successes and wish him and his charming \nwife Mary the best. We will miss them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12165-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARK HATFIELD\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am sad when thinking of the Senate's \nimpending loss of so many Members, especially of Senator Mark Hatfield. \nSenator Hatfield and I have been friends since 1958, when we both were \nyoung Governors of our respective States. Mark Hatfield is smart, \ntough, and independent and an unfailing gentleman. Although we do not \nagree on every issue, I know that when Mark Hatfield votes he votes \nwith his conscience. A man of conviction is a man of quality and as \none, Senator Mark Hatfield transcends all partnership.\n  It has been a pleasure and an honor to work with Senator Hatfield. \nAlthough we are from opposite sides of the aisle and the country, we \nhave many shared interests, including Coastal Zone Management and NOAA, \nthat agency so essential to the well-being of Oregon, South Carolina, \nand other coastal States. However, Senator Hatfield's  attention \nextends beyond the general populace to those who are most vulnerable \nand often lacking a strong voice. Time and again, Mark Hatfield has put \nhimself on the line in the fight for economic and social justice, often \nat political risk. He is willing to take a stand on the hard issues. \nOne program to benefit under his watch is the Legal Services \nCorporation, an organization which provides legal counsel to the \nindigent.\n  Oregon and the Nation is losing a valuable public servant and \nstatesman in Senator Mark Hatfield. He and his lovely wife, Antoinette, \nwill be missed by all. We wish them the very best as they return to the \nState they love so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12165-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12165-S12166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to take a few movements to salute all \nof our colleagues who are retiring from the U.S. Senate. These are \nindividuals of uncommon character and devoted service--individuals who \nhave strengthened their Nation and enriched each of us who has had the \nopportunity of serving with them.\n  We all know who these 13 Senators are. In retiring, they will \nundoubtedly affect the composition and character of this important \nlegislative body. Over the weeks, these Senators have been recognized \nby their associates, colleagues, friends and constituents. Many \ntributes have been offered here on the floor.\n  Today, I would like to express my personal gratitude not only to all \n13, but to several Senators who had a particular influence on me, the \ncommittees on which I serve, and our agendas in those respective \ncommittees.\n  Senator Howell Helfin is retiring after three terms as the honorable \nSenator from Alabama. In our years of working together--getting to know \neach other in our service to the North Atlantic Assembly--I have grown \nto appreciate and admire this great gentleman. He has judicial \ntemperament, one that I imagine was carefully cultivated in the many \nyears which prepared him for his service here in Washington.\n  Senator Heflin has a keen understanding of diplomacy and America's \neminent position in the world. His dedication to the North Atlantic \nAssembly, our international interests, along with his service in the \nSenate, and to his fellow Alabamans qualify him for that honored \ndistinction of statesman. And I feel richly rewarded for the time I've \nbeen able to spend with him.\n  Senator David Pryor, also retiring after three terms, is another \ncolleague I want to salute personally. He's the other half of the fly-\nbefore-buy duo. Together we worked to create the operational and live \nfire testing laws for weapons. He was critical in our efforts, \ninstrumental to our success.\n  Many authors and military personnel have documented the lives saved \nas a result of problems discovered and corrected in operational live \nfire tests. In other words, there are men and women today who, perhaps \nunknowing, owe a great deal of gratitude to Senator Pryor and his \ntenacity in seeing this legislation through.\n  Despite many attempts to ignore and circumvent these laws by the \ndefense buying bureaucracy, Senator Pryor and I provided rigorous \noversight, regardless of which party controlled Congress. When the \nDemocrats were in\n\n[[Page S12166]]\n\ncharge, Senator Pryor chaired the hearings. I chaired when Republicans \nwere in charge. Our objective was never lost, and the work moved \nforward. Our commitment was always to the courageous soldier in the \nfield--the individual dependent on the weapon systems.\n\n  Another Senator with whom I've had the pleasure of working closely is \nSam Nunn, one of the most honorable, fair and bipartisan leaders I've \nknown. Sam and I have alternated between chairing and serving as \nranking minority member on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations \nsince 1981. On many occasions, our staffs worked together on joint \ninvestigations.\n  We launched the first congressional investigation identifying crack \ncocaine as a significant drug problem. We investigated airline safety, \nand explored the Justice Department's handling of the Jackie Presser \nghostworkers issue. Senator Nunn has been a staunch opponent of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, and he has gained world renown as an expert in \nmatters of defense and foreign affairs.\n  Most recently, he and I launched the first investigation of Russian \norganized crime activities in the United States, continuing PSI's \nlongstanding history of being Congress' primary organized crime \ninvestigator.\n  I am also grateful to Senator Nancy Kassebaum and her leadership in \nhealth care. Nancy is another one of the profoundly thoughtful Senators \nwho serve as the catalyst for important policies and laws. She was \ncertainly a catalyst in the effort to successfully pass the medical \nsavings account demonstration program, as part of our effort to make \nhealth care more accessible for Americans.\n  Another retiring Member of the Senate, after five terms in Senator \nMark Hatfield, a man whose dedication to principle has distinguished \nhis career in the State House as well as on Capitol Hill. Among his \nmany legislative successes, I'm grateful for Senator Hatfield's work on \nbehalf of Amtrak, as well as his objective analysis and contributions \nto debates and initiatives through the years.\n  Likewise, Hank Brown, and his rugged, no-nonsense approach in \npromoting a strong foreign policy and fiscal responsibility. Hank and I \nhave served together on the North Atlantic Assembly, and we have joined \nefforts to strengthen the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. His \neloquence and clear logic make him unusually effective and a pleasure \nto work with--not to mention his love for St. Bernards--another \ndevotion we share.\n  I appreciate Bill Cohen, our distinguished senior Senator from Maine. \nSenator Cohen is a noted novelist, a poet. I've found many of his \nspeeches brilliantly enriching, especially a speech he gave a few years \nago about the changing culture around us. Bill has been a dogged \nproponent of cutting waste, fraud, and abuse on the Government Affairs \nCommittee, and he has been active in our efforts to understand and \nbuild relationships of trust with the nations of the Pacific. He will \nbe remembered not only for his work with ASEAN, but for his efforts on \nbehalf of NATO, and his chairing of the Munich Conference.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to recognize Senator Alan Simpson, a \ngood friend and revered colleague. There are few men who become legends \nin their own time, but Al is certainly one of them. His easy-going, \naffable manner and ready wit were equal to his majestic stature and \ntrademark smile. There hasn't been a time when Al's opened his mouth to \nspeak that I haven't waited in anticipation for some new sparkling gem \nof wisdom, a witty turn of phrase, or an outright joke.\n  Al taught us, as his mother taught him, that humor is the \nirreplaceable solace against the elements of life; hatred corrodes the \ncontainer it's carried in. With his humor, he could diffuse even the \nmost impassioned and tensely difficult moments.\n  It was Al who, during one very difficult period--a period of some \ncontention on this floor--told us of the successful marriage philosophy \nhe shares with his wonderful wife, Ann. It was a simple philosophy: \n``Never go to bed angry * * *'' he said. ``Always stay up and fight!''\n  During another heated moment, in the middle of the confirmation \nhearings on Judge Robert Bork, Al reminded us, with his western charm, \nthe ``Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, but not to their own \nfacts.''\n  And it was Al who taught us how to deal with the media. Once, when \npressed for his church preference, he answered: ``Red brick!''\n  Indeed, as the liberal commentator, Mark Shields, has recognized, \n``Al Simpson is a man of uncommon wisdom.'' With his retirement, he not \nonly leaves behind a rich legislative legacy, and dear memories for \nfriends, but a reputation akin to that which attends Will Rogers. I can \nonly imagine that in the years and decades ahead, Al, like Mark Twain, \nWill Rogers, Winston Churchill, and other great wits, will come to \ninherit aphorisms and jokes that he never told. But then, those of us \nwho know him, realize that he truly deserves such an honor.\n  It has been my pleasure to serve with Senators Simpson, Cohen, Brown, \nHatfield, Kassebaum, Nunn, Pryor, and Heflin--as well as with Senator \nSimon, who we saluted with our bowties last week, Senator Bennett \nJohnston--four successful terms from Louisiana, Senator Exon, and \nSenator Bradley, who I've had the pleasure of serving with on the \nFinance Committee. And I appreciate Senator Pell, another fine leader \nwho leaves a great legacy, both at home and abroad. Mr. President, I \nsalute all those who are retiring this year. Each has lived a life in \ndeeds, not words, and in their actions have written their legacy on \ntablets of love and memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12165-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there shall be 3 \nhours for debate on the conference report, with the time to be equally \ndivided between the two leaders.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senate now is going to continue its \nwork on the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill.\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADMINISTRATOR HINSON\n\n  As we start that, I want to take a moment to pay tribute to that \nAgency's leader, David Hinson.\n  As many Members of the Senate know, Administrator Hinson will be \nleaving his post later this year, and he will return with his wife, \nUrsula, to their home in Idaho.\n  I just called him Administrator Hinson. That is tough for me to say \nbecause over the last years, those of us who have worked with him \nalways called him David. He is a very approachable guy and one who we \nunderstand. He comes from the West. In my State, where aviation is very \ncritical and more than 75 percent of our communities can be reached \nonly by air, David has become well known. He has been to Alaska several \ntimes. He had to cancel a recent visit with our air carriers because of \nthe tragedy of TWA Flight 800.\n  But he is continuing to work on solutions to our problems, \nparticularly the problems that we are experiencing at the Juneau \nInternational Airport. Two critical departures have been revoked, and \nDavid is working with safety personnel to try to find a way to make \nthose departures safe for travelers in and out of our capital city.\n  As Administrator, Mr. Hinson has set the FAA on a good course, \nworking with a very competent assistant and associate administrator, \nLinda Daschle. He has been able to urge Congress to address the FAA's \nfuture funding needs, and he has worked to improve commuter airline \nsafety and,\n\n[[Page S12167]]\n\nwith the help of Congress, has streamlined procurement rules within the \nFAA.\n  He is someone I have found very interesting, because in his younger \nyears, he flew in and out of my State as a commercial airline pilot.\n  He was flying for the old Pacific Northern Airlines. He knows what it \nmeans to be involved in commercial aviation. He knows the people who do \nthe flying. I think that is the most important thing.\n  The FAA people have a tough job. When a plane crashes, we are all \ninclined to look for someone to blame. Often the finger pointing begins \nwith the FAA itself. But the FAA's record of ensuring safety for us in \nour skies is unparalleled by any nation in the world. We move in an \nenormous number of planes and passengers every day, every week, every \nmonth, every year.\n  While no institution is perfect, and it is very difficult for any \nadministrator to really get much of a hold on an entity that has such a \nlong tradition as the FAA, David Hinson has worked with his team to \nreally promote improvements to safety.\n  I am one Senator who has urged Administrator Hinson to stay on. But \nhe has had a call that I think very few people can resist and that is \nfrom his grandchildren, I understand, and his wife and children. It is \nunfortunate that we are going to lose David Hinson as the Administrator \nof the FAA.\n  Madam President, he is honest, straightforward, clear thinking, and \nhe deserves the thanks of the American people for what he has done.\n  The FAA, under his leadership, has brought about a great many \ninnovations. One to me as a pilot that I find most interesting is the \napproach that has been given by the FAA during this period to utilizing \nnew technology. He has moved forward through the terminal Doppler radar \nweather and Air Force surface detection equipment and brought us into \nthe 21st century with a whole series of new innovations.\n  But above all, one of the things that has probably been the most \nstartling has been the FAA's augmentation of the GPS system to enhance \nnavigation signals throughout the United States.\n  The FAA's approach will allow the airlines to use GPS for precision \napproaches to airports even in bad weather when vision is severely \nlimited by smog and bad conditions. They did the initial design and \nprocurement work on the accelerated timetable, cutting at least a year \noff the delivery schedule. Early deployment of this system late in this \ndecade will save airlines hundreds of millions of dollars annually due \nto more precise routings and fuel savings and increased airport \nefficiency.\n  I myself took a trip just recently with the GPS on a very small \nplane, and by virtue of using the GPS, together with our navigation \nsystem, we saved fuel, we saved time, and above all, we flew a safer \nroute.\n  I think that the country ought to really realize what has happened in \nthis period when David Hinson, a man with a background in aviation, has \nbeen the Administrator. He has brought us a new FAA, an FAA that is not \nafraid of competitiveness in the industry, who wants and understands \ngrowth in the industry, and it has been a period of time when even \ngeneral aviation has expanded and the costs to general aviation have \ndecreased.\n  It is now, I think, a challenge for whoever takes his place to find a \nway to really ensure that there will be a continued place for general \naviation in our aviation programs in the United States. Some people \nwant to sort of squeeze out the private jets, the private aircraft, the \nsmall planes and believe that they are inefficient and cause difficulty \nwithin the system.\n  That is not true, Madam President. There is room in our Nation's \nairline and airways system for every type of plane. I do believe that \nwe will improve on what Administrator David Hinson has done to ensure \nthat we have not only the best and the most active, but we have the \nsafest transportation system in the world.\n  I do very seriously commend him for his actions. I wish him well. He \nhas had a very great impact on the bill that is before us, Madam \nPresident, and has continually visited all of us to assure that we try \nto put aside differences that we might have and get this bill passed.\n  This bill, Madam President, contains many vitally important aviation \nsafety and security provisions. No single provision is more important \nthan title VII, which provides long overdue assistance to the families \nof victims of aviation disasters.\n  This provision absolutely must be adopted. It is one of the \nprovisions where the survivors of victims of various aircrafts came to \nthose of us on the Commerce Committee and urged us to have a hearing. \nWe did have a hearing. We readily discovered that the families of \nvictims of past air crashes have suffered a great deal.\n  The most recent tragedies, of course, involved ValuJet's flight 592, \nTWA's flight 800. Those brought forward the issue of the treatment of \nvictims' families in the wake of aviation accidents. More and more of \nthese accidents involve larger and larger jets, more people and more \ndifficult circumstances.\n  As I said last week at the Commerce Committee hearing on the \ntreatment of victims' families--I was pleased to be there with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota, Senator Pressler; the hearing \nwas held at his request. He urged many of us to come and listen to \nthese people.\n  We heard from family members who have lost loved ones in five \naviation disasters. These witnesses eloquently shared their harrowing \nexperiences. Each witness urged us the same thing, Madam President. \nThat is my point for speaking about this. They urged that we include \nHouse bill 3923, the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996, \nin the reauthorization conference report.\n  After several hours of hearing, the FAA reauthorization conferees met \nand unanimously agreed to include H.R. 3923 in the compromise \nreauthorization bill as the families have requested.\n  This provision will improve the notification of families, protect the \nprivacies of grieving families, improve the overall treatment of family \nmembers, and ensure family members have better access to accident-\nrelated information.\n  The family assistance title of this FAA bill, which is being blocked \nhere now temporarily--I hope just temporarily--will require the \nNational Transportation Safety Board to designate an NTSB, one of their \nown Board employees, as the family advocate for each commercial \naviation disaster--they will designate an independent organization, \nsuch as the Red Cross, to coordinate care and support of the families--\nand to coordinate the recovery and identification of accident victims, \nto brief families before press briefings, and to--let me emphasize \nthat--to brief the families before they brief the press. All of them \nsaid they have a right to know before they hear it on the television or \nover the radio or read in a newspaper what has happened.\n  This is one of the key provisions of this bill. It is one of the \nreasons the bill must be passed this year. We cannot wait until next \nyear for that basic change. It tells people involved, in assembling \ninformation about these disasters, to brief the families involved first \nand inform the families of public hearings on the accident and allow \nthose families to attend any public hearings.\n\n  The family advocate created by this legislation will assist grieving \nfamilies by acting as the point of contact within the Federal \nGovernment for the families, acting as liaison between the families and \nthe airlines and obtaining passenger manifests and providing manifest \ninformation to families who have requested it.\n  Madam President, I spoke to members of the airline industry. They \nwelcome this concept. They welcome having someone who is known to be \nthe person in charge of information for family information.\n  This family assistance provision in this legislation will also \nrequire the National Transportation Safety Board to designate an \nagency, such as the Red Cross, to assist grieving families, as I said. \nThat agency would coordinate the care and support of families, meet \nwith families who come to the scene and contact other families who \ncannot, provide counseling for the families, ensure privacy of the \nfamilies from anyone, whether it is media or lawyers, whomever it might \nbe, communicate with families about the role of Government and the \nagencies and\n\n[[Page S12168]]\n\nairlines involved, and arrange for suitable memorial services when \npossible, obtain the passenger list, and use it to provide information \nto the families, and use the airlines' resources and personnel to the \nextent practical.\n\n  Now, this family assistance provision, Madam President, would require \nairlines to take a number of steps to compassionately work with \nfamilies of aviation tragedies. Airlines would be required to publicize \na reliable toll-free number and provide staff to handle calls from \nfamilies, to notify families as soon as possible of the fate of their \nloved ones, in person if practical, using suitably trained individuals \nto give out that information, provide the passenger list to the NTSB \nfamily advocate and to the Red Cross immediately. Even if the names on \nthe list have not been verified, they must start immediately working \nwith the NTSB and the Red Cross.\n  Further, they must consult with families before disposing of the \nremains and personal effects of the passengers, and return the \npassengers' possessions to the family, retaining all unclaimed \npossessions for 2 years. In other words, they must keep them 2 years in \norder that family members who may finally get information about their \nloved one could reclaim possession for up to 2 years.\n  They must consult with the families about any monument for the \naccident and treat the families of nonrevenue passengers and victims on \nthe ground the same as any other people involved. Finally, they are \ndirected to work with the Red Cross to improve the treatment of \nfamilies.\n  Madam President, these compassionate and comprehensive measures to \nassist families of aviation disaster victims are now in this bill. If \nthe bill is changed in any way, and fails, it will be at least another \nyear before we get back to this point. The pleas of families who very \nmuch want to ensure that families of victims of future aviation \ndisasters are treated better than they were will be ignored if this \nbill is not approved at this session.\n  I think it is absolutely necessary for us to approve this conference \nreport.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord excerpts of statements and testimony of victims and their \nfamilies that really moved the committee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation\n\n\n   testimony of richard p. kessler, jr., husband of kathleen parker \n               kessler, a passenger on valujet flight 592\n\n       My name is Richard P. Kessler, Jr., a citizen of the United \n     States and the husband of Kathleen Parker Kessler, a \n     passenger on ValuJet Flight 592, who was killed on May 11, \n     1996, when Flight 592 crashed into the Everglades near Miami. \n     I am also a practicing attorney in Atlanta. As I stated, I am \n     a citizen of the United States, but the laws of the United \n     States did not protect me, my daughter or the families of the \n     other passenger victims.\n       It has been over four months since the crash, it doesn't \n     seem that long. During the first two months following the \n     crash, I witnessed the best and the worst of human behavior. \n     The best of human behavior was demonstrated by the people of \n     Miami; the federal, state and city agencies who assisted the \n     families of the victims and conducted the search for the \n     remains of the victims; the volunteers; the counselors; and \n     especially one volunteer, Victoria Cummock, a victim's \n     advocate and President of Families of PAN-AM 103 Lockerbie. \n     The worst of human behavior was demonstrated by members of \n     the press, the electronic media, and the members of my legal \n     profession.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I urge the Senate to introduce and pass a Bill exactly like \n     HR 3932 that has passed the House and attach amendments that \n     provide for pilot vision equipment, passenger smoke \n     protection and smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. I am \n     told that pilot vision cost per ticket is less than one cent; \n     passenger smoke protection is less than five cents per ticket \n     and penny or two for smoke detectors. Given this cost which \n     is recouped from the flying public, how can ValuJet or any \n     other airline be allowed to fly citizens of the United States \n     without outfitting their planes with such equipment that is \n     available in the marketplace?\n       I am dedicating the next two years of my life to help bring \n     about better treatment of families of victims and the change \n     of the paradigm that is used in these personal injury \n     disasters. My wife died on Flight 592, but she is in Heaven, \n     I know, because she had God give me two signs that were \n     witnessed by other people. As a trial lawyer she would want \n     the paradigm that we now employ in these disasters to be \n     changed to protect the interests of all parties.\n       I do not want the families of the victims of the next \n     airline crash to endure the emotional rape that we had to \n     endure following the crash of Flight 592. The next victim \n     could be your wife, daughter, son or parents.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n             TESTIMONY OF KENDRA ST. CHARLES, OF USAIR #405\n\n       Chairman Pressler, it is with great pleasure that I appear \n     before you and your fellow colleagues today. Hopefully, we \n     can change the way families are treated after an airline \n     disaster by enabling the NTSB to designate an independent \n     nonprofit organization (like the Red Cross with \n     professionally trained grief and disaster counselors) to give \n     care and support during this horrific time. A key provision \n     in the House Bill.\n       On March 22, 1992, I was a passenger aboard USAir #405. We \n     had been delayed at New York's LaGuardia Airport as a \n     snowstorm had begun. As we sat on the runway, I looked out \n     the window watching the snow continue to fall and assured \n     myself that ``they'' would never let us attempt to take off \n     if it were not safe.\n       After a thirty-five minute delay, we were finally cleared \n     for take off. Moments after we were in the air, the plane \n     went violently out of control, cart wheeling down the runway \n     crashing upside down with part of it in Flushing Bay. I \n     survived the impact and subsequent explosion, I survived \n     being projected through a fireball and landing in Flushing \n     Bay. I survived nearly drowning, as my seat belt held me \n     under the water. I unbuckled it and was able to wade through \n     the fiery waters, not unlike the scene from TWA 800, to make \n     my way to shore. I was one of the lucky ones. I had survived \n     a living hell, but it did not prepare me for the treatment I \n     was about to experience from the airline and insurance \n     company.\n       Unconscious and barely clothed (my clothes had been ripped \n     off during impact) I was taken to a hospital with no means of \n     identification. As I was fighting for my life, my sixteen \n     year old daughter was at home watching television waiting for \n     me to return home. Suddenly the Sunday night movie was \n     interrupted by a report of an airplane crash. Her worst fear \n     was about to come true. She immediately called the 800 number \n     that was flashed on the screen. It was busy. All alone she \n     sat motionless in disbelief watching the media coverage of \n     the crash she feared I was on. Rescue workers were shown \n     pulling body bags from the wreckage. Still she was not able \n     to get through to receive any kind of information. As my \n     family arrived at my home to support my daughter, they too \n     met with the frustration of not being able to receive any \n     confirmation by either the 800 number or USAir directly. \n     Finally, out of desperation, my brother drove to the \n     airport in a blizzard to confirm that I was aboard the \n     doomed flight.\n       In the hospital the doctors were unsure if I would live. I \n     was hooked up to a respirator that forced oxygen into my \n     punctured and burnt lungs for three days. I spent three weeks \n     in the burn unit until I able to return home. During my \n     hospital stay the person that I was to rely on for assistance \n     and to help coordinate my needs as well as my family's needs \n     was an untrained USAir ticket agent whose main concern was to \n     find any pre-existing conditions that I might have for the \n     purpose of future litigation. To expect that the same people \n     who had almost killed me were now going to be my caretakers \n     was very confusing. Not only were they not trained for any \n     kind of crisis intervention, but there was a direct conflict \n     of interest. They were more interested in what kind of \n     disability insurance I might have--to know how long I could \n     afford to live without an income. In other words, how \n     desperate I was to settle any damage claim.\n       My physical and emotional recovery continued for several \n     years. During that time I was under the care of doctors and \n     physical therapists whose services were to be paid for by the \n     insurance carrier. Several months would pass without any kind \n     of payment. Clearly the airline was attempting to put \n     pressure on me in any way that they could. I soon realized \n     that once the media stopped filming the ``sympathetic airline \n     officials'' that they were actually more like a brand of \n     angry pit bulls waiting to attack the victim for a second \n     time.\n       Unfortunately, I have witnessed this same inhumane \n     treatment of families by the airline in other aviation \n     disasters. USAir 427-American Eagle 4184-Valu Jet 59--and now \n     TWA 800. The need for change is long overdue. There will be \n     another snowstorm. There will be another delay--whether it be \n     at LaGuardia or another airport. Regretfully, there will be \n     another crash. I implore you to act now before another family \n     suffers the horror that mine did. Our children deserve \n     better, we the people deserve better.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n   testimony of victoria cummock, president, families of pan am 103/\n                               lockerbie\n\n       My name is Victoria Cummock. Today, I have come to present \n     testimony as the widow of John Cummock, a 38 yr. old \n     passenger who died along with 269 people, during the \n     terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. I \n     have also come here to present testimony as President of \n     Families of Pan Am 103/Lockerbie and as ``a long time \n     observer'' and victims advocate having been involved in \n     disaster response work over the past 8 years and most \n     recently with the families of TWA 800, Valujet 592 and the\n\n[[Page S12169]]\n\n     Oklahoma City bombing. Although, I am a Commissioner on the \n     White House Commission on Aviation Safety & Security, which \n     was formed on July 25 by President Clinton and is Chaired by \n     Vice President Gore, please note that my testimony here today \n     does not reflect the views of the White House Commission.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Over the past year the House Aviation Sub-Committee has \n     worked very closely with families of numerous air disasters. \n     After holding various hearings, legislation was drafted to \n     specifically address these issues. HR 3923 embodies what air \n     disaster victims families have cried out for, time and time \n     again . . . for years. It provides families of air disaster \n     victims, the same quality of professional disaster care, \n     currently given to all Americans during all other types of \n     disasters, whether natural or man made. This legislation \n     expands the role of the NTSB by placing the NTSB in the lead \n     coordinating role, to manage all aspects air-disaster \n     response and victims' family care.\n       HR 3923 enables the NTSB to designate an independent \n     nonprofit disaster organization (like the Red Cross, with \n     certified grief counselors and disaster professionals to care \n     for the families). This will insure humane and uniform \n     treatment, by providing a professional disaster response thus \n     avoiding future mis-handling, conflicts of interest or abuse \n     of authority by airlines. We strongly support this change and \n     respectfully ask the Senate to adopt the House language and \n     pass this legislation on to the President desk to sign. More \n     planes will go down for different reasons. Let's not wait for \n     another disaster before we implement this change.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n               statement of dario j. cremades, flight 800\n\n       Good morning Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. I \n     wish to thank you for allowing me to present my views on S.R. \n     253 and H.R. 3923, the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance \n     Act of 1996. Although the testimony I am presenting are my \n     personal views, they are shared by many other families of \n     victims of flight 800.\n       In spite of all the ink that has flown since TWA flight 800 \n     exploded and fell into the Atlantic, these are things that \n     have remained unsaid and which deserve to be told. Because \n     the wounds that this disaster has left in its victims will \n     only heal if adequate measures are taken to prevent it from \n     ever happening again.\n       Our story really started on the eve of July 17th, 1996 \n     when, after having supper, we sat to watch television in our \n     apartment's living room in Manhattan. The scheduled programs \n     were interrupted by news briefs, informing us that an \n     accident had occurred at about 8 pm, off the coast of Long \n     Island shortly after the plane departed from JFK. Our mood \n     was somber and concerned about the tragedy, keeping in the \n     back of our minds the departure of our nephew Daniel, 15 \n     years of age, bound for Paris that same evening.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       In light of the prior statement, our family feels H.R. 3923 \n     and S.R. 253 combined and expanded reflect the needs of the \n     families of TWA flight 800 and tries to correct some of the \n     issues presented in this testimony and we support its \n     implementation into law. But we also propose the following \n     specific recommendations to consider.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n            hans ephraimson, families of korean airlines 007\n\n       Mr. Chairman: Your initiative to hold a Hearing on air \n     crash passenger issues at short notice is welcomed. We thank \n     your Committee and its hard working staff.\n       We endorse H.R. 3923 as passed by the House of \n     Representatives and regret not to have had the opportunity to \n     participate in the legislation contemplated by the Senate, \n     hoping that the issues, that have to be urgently addressed in \n     the wake of the TWA 800 tragedy be incorporated in the \n     forthcoming legislation.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. For instance, Kendra St. Charles, who was a passenger \naboard the USAir flight 405 appeared before us, just an incredible \nstatement concerning her personal survival from that crash. She was \ntaken unconscious and barely clothed to a hospital, and had no means of \nidentification. She found her 16-year-old daughter was at home watching \ntelevision and had the Sunday night movie interrupted with a report of \nthe airplane crash. When she called the 800 number that flashed on the \nscreen, she had no way to find out what was going on.\n  She said, ``Hopefully, we can change the way families are treated \nafter an airline disaster by enabling the NTSB to designate an \nindependent nonprofit organization--like the Red Cross, with \nprofessionally trained grief and disaster counselors--to give care and \nsupport during this horrific time.''\n  I commend to all the testimony of Kendra St. Charles.\n  We heard from Victoria Cummock, a dedicated woman whose husband was a \nsurvivor of the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie disaster. She has been responsible \nfor working with various people throughout the country to try and urge \na different way of dealing with the survivors of victims of air \ndisasters. She specifically came to our committee and urged we look at \nH.R. 3923. She said, this ``embodies what air disaster victims have \ncried out for time and time again * * * for years. It provides families \nof air disaster victims the same quality of professional disaster care \ncurrently given to all Americans during other types of disasters, \nwhether natural or manmade.''\n  She made a great impression on me. We should all thank her for the \nwork she has done to bring about the Coalition of Families of Aircraft \nDisasters.\n  We also heard from Richard Kessler, Jr., who was the husband of \nKathleen Parker Kessler who was a passenger on ValuJet flight 592. He \ncame to us on the Commerce Committee and made this statement:\n\n       I urge the Senate to introduce and pass a bill exactly like \n     H.R. 3932 that has passed the House, and attach amendments \n     that provide for pilot vision equipment, passenger smoke \n     protection and smoke detectors, and fire extinguishers.\n\n  We did not have the time to do that because of the situation that \nexisted at the end of Congress, but we have adopted that bill, H.R. \n3932, as an amendment to this conference report. It is in this bill.\n  We also heard from Dario Cremades. He appeared with regard to the \ntreatment of families of aviation disaster victims. He particularly \nreferred to the TWA flight 800. He had some very difficult problems. I \ncommend his statement, likewise. He said:\n\n       In light of the prior statements, our family feels H.R. \n     3923 combined and expanded reflects the needs of families of \n     TWA Flight 800 and tries to correct some of the issues \n     presented in his testimony.\n\n  He urged us to support that House bill.\n  Lastly, Hans Ephraimson-Abt is one of the members of the families of \nthe Korean Airline 007 disaster, an aircraft that took off from my home \ncity, and we all know was shot down as it went westward from Alaska. He \ntold us that his group supported the passage of House bill 3923, and he \nvery much wanted to have us enact as quickly as possible that and other \nmatters. The other matters, unfortunately, will have to wait until next \nyear.\n  The point, Madam President, is that this bill contains the whole bill \nH.R. 3923, which is very much sought by all of those who have come \nbefore the Congress who represent families of those who have already \nsuffered so much as a result of airline disasters. I think it would be \na travesty if we have to go back and start all over next year and have \nit be more than a year before we get this legislation passed. Aviation \nwelcomes it, the Red Cross welcomes it, the people who have been \ninvolved in these instances in the past welcome this legislation, and \nit is absolutely a must that we pass this bill this week without \namendment and get it to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his tremendous leadership on the issue before the Senate today, and \nof course for his leadership on all issues relating to working people.\n  I come to the floor today to speak about the issue that is holding up \nthe passage of the FAA reauthorization bill. As the Senator from Alaska \nwas just indicating, that is the problem we have, the bill is held up \nand it does need to go forward. The problem that some of us have is \nwith the item that has been added to the conference report. What I am \ntalking about is an effort to give special treatment to one company--\nthe Federal Express Co.--by subverting standard labor law requirements \nin order for this company to be able to avoid unionization.\n  Maybe this is just part of a larger agenda. I think it is part of a \nlarger agenda, symbolized by aspects of the Contract With America, \nwhich represented an assault on the working people of this country. In \na sense, this is one more kick from that contract at working people.\n  Like all of my colleagues and all of us on this side of the issue \nhave said, we understand the importance of reauthorizing the FAA. No \none, absolutely no one, wants to jeopardize in any way the safety of \nour Nation's air travelers and personnel. I, like all of my colleagues, \nsupported this critical bill when the Senate passed it earlier this \nyear. But as we have heard repeatedly now, the bill that passed the \nSenate did\n\n[[Page S12170]]\n\nnot contain --did not contain--the controversial antiunion provision \nthat has now been inserted into the conference report.\n  The other side of this debate has conveniently mentioned over and \nover again the unanimous vote in the Senate, but has also conveniently \nfailed to mention the fact that this controversial provision was not \npart of the bill when that unanimous consent vote was held in the \nSenate. Also, Madam President, this provision was nowhere to be found \nin the House version of the bill, either. So it truly has no place in \nthe conference report that is before the Senate today.\n  Now, I realize, having been here for nearly 4 years now, that \ninserting material into a conference report which has not been \nconsidered by either body has become almost commonplace in the \nCongress.\n  Madam President, that doesn't make it right, and it doesn't make it \nthe right place for the sponsors of the Contract With America to \nadminister one more blow to the working people of this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As a matter of fact, the House Parliamentarian said it \nwas outside the scope of the conference, and it was the only item that \nrequired an independent vote in the House of Representatives, other \nthan the conference report, just to point out the validity of the \nSenator's statement. The Parliamentarian, who does not have a special \ninterest in this particular matter, who neither favors it being in or \nout, but who is just ruling on the basis of an objective standard, said \nthis is outside of the conference and, therefore, it is the only item \nbeyond the conference report to require a special vote.\n  I just wanted to ask the Senator, does that not help sustain the \npoint he is making that this particular item was nowhere, either in the \nHouse or Senate bill, and just came at the very last moment?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. It does that \nand more, because it ties in with other facts that the other side can't \ndeny. Not only was this item treated in the way the Senator indicated, \nnot only was it not part of the Senate bill, or the House bill, but we \nhave also had analysis by the CRS, an independent agency that we rely \non, saying that the deletion of the term ``express carrier'' in the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995 does not appear to be a technical error. I will \nsay more about that in a moment.\n  These are the slender reeds that the other side are resting on--that \neverybody voted for this bill originally, even though this provision \nwas not in it, and it was somehow a technical error. This is not much \nto rely on. When you have a special interest provision of this \nmagnitude, maybe that is what you do.\n  Madam President, this provision would help Federal Express resist the \nefforts of its workers to unionize. That is the purpose of it, whether \nyou call it technical, or whether you call it a drafting error. The \nfact is that the purpose of it is to stop possible unionization. It has \nalready been rejected by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Let me \nrepeat, the Appropriations Committee rejected the amendment. Yet, \nsomehow it reappeared on the table during the bill's conference, and it \nwas inserted into the conference report, where proponents felt it was \nwell protected from attack. I want to repeat that phrase: Where it was \nwell protected from attack.\n  Again, I have been here almost 4 years. I know about the idea of \ntrying to put the stuff that you want through on what is called a must-\npass bill. People back home are catching on to it, too. I watched it \nwhen we had the legislation to help out the folks in California after \nthe earthquake. That wasn't one of the bills we weren't sure was going \nto become a law. We knew we had to help the people in California. So \nmoney was tacked on for Pennsylvania Station, the space station, and so \non. It is a vehicle you use to try to avoid having items have to stand \non their own weight in front of the Congress. When this item was placed \nbefore separate votes in the Congress, it didn't make it. So the \nAmerican people are catching on to this kind of abuse of the \nlegislative process.\n  Madam President, this is another similar vehicle, another must-pass \nbill. It wasn't chosen by chance. You will notice that a separate bill \nto correct this so-called technical error wasn't going anywhere. No \nchance. Proponents put it on the FAA authorization bill and said, ``We \nare sorry it was snuck in there, but we have to pass the bill.'' That \nis the game. It is an insider game. But people are catching on.\n  This one was just a little too much, and to have it thrown on such a \nvery, very important bill for our airports across the country seems \nlike just a bit too much to me. Some may say, well, as of January, we \nhave a line-item veto. The President can line out something like this. \nOf course, the new line-item veto authority does not extend to this \nkind of provision, but though I have never advocated extending the \nline-item veto authority beyond removing excess spending items, if the \nPresident had a broader authority, this is certainly one situation \nwhere it would be a good policy to take this piece of special interest \nlegislation out of this bill.\n\n  So the practice will continue, unless we here and people across the \ncountry say, wait a minute, we don't want laws made this way. We don't \nwant one company to be able to push its weight around and shove this \nprovision into a bill and say it absolutely has to pass, regardless of \nthe merits of the provision, because otherwise we won't be able to help \nour airports.\n  Madam President, this is one of the most clear examples of special \ninterest treatment I have ever seen. You know it, and I know it, and \nevery Member of this body knows it. It's offensive and it doesn't \nbelong on this bill. To accuse Members of the Senate of not caring \nabout airport safety and the welfare of air passengers just because we \nobject to this subversion of the rules is just disingenuous. We know \nwhat is going on here, and nobody can say this particular provision has \nanything at all to do with airline safety.\n  Supporters of the provision claim that it is simply a technical \ncorrection, to correct the accidental deletion of the term ``express \ncarrier'' from the Railway Labor Act, which was amended in the \nInterstate Commerce Termination Act of 1995--a technical error. My \ncolleagues, does this look technical to you? Does all the controversy \nand anger on this issue look technical to you? It is not technical. The \nterm was intentionally removed by the Congress last year, and has now \nbeen intentionally inserted into the FAA conference report by the \nMembers of the conference committee. In fact, researchers in the \nbipartisan American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service \nsay that the deletion of that term ``express company'' does not appear \nto have been inadvertent or mistaken. To the contrary, the deletion \nappeared to be consistent with the statutory structure and the intent \nof Congress. Moreover, it appears unlikely that Federal Express would \nconstitute an express company, as that term is used in the proposed \namendment.\n  That is the CRS analysis, Madam President, not a labor union. CRS is \nthe Congress' own nonpartisan research service. Although the report and \nits author have been maligned here on the floor, I think those \naccusations have been unfair. We all rely on CRS for unbiased analyses \nof the facts. They say that this provision does not merely make a \ntechnical correction. It is a significant, substantive change. If there \nis one thing it is not, it is technical. This is a significant policy \nchange, Madam President. It does not belong on this bill.\n  Moreover, it is interesting to note that Linda Morgan, Chair of the \nSurface Transportation Board, formerly the ICC, confirmed CRS's opinion \nthat Federal Express would not qualify as an express carrier. In a \nrecent letter to Congressman James Oberstar, Ms. Morgan stated that \nwhen the term ``express carrier'' was in use, the ICC considered \nFederal Express to be a motor carrier, not an express carrier, as the \ncompany claims it was and would like to be considered in the future.\n  Let me just read briefly from that letter:\n\n       The ICC considered FedEx to be a motor carrier.\n\n  She continued later:\n\n       In a decision in 1934, the ICC concluded that express \n     company operations wholly by\n\n[[Page S12171]]\n\n     rail, or partly by rail and partly by water, were subject to \n     ICC regulation, but that an express company's motor carrier \n     operations were not.\n\n  So this is a special interest provision, designed to protect the \ninterest of one company. Now, we see these kinds of provisions often in \ntax bills, where one single company is given a tax preference like a \nspecial depreciation break or a tax credit. This provision, however, in \nmy mind, is way out in front of the pack in terms of special interest \nbenefits.\n  This provision, I want to reiterate, is designed exclusively for this \nsingle company, Federal Express, to allow it to impose special barriers \nto block unionization efforts among employees who transport cargo by \ntruck. Other motor carriers, including FedEx's major competitor, UPS, \nare, in contrast, subject to the National Labor Relations Act and \norganize at specific localities. If FedEx truckers in Pennsylvania want \nto form a union, they should have that right, under the NLRA. But if \nthis provision goes through, FedEx truck drivers across the Nation \nwould all have to agree to a single nationwide bargaining unit or \nforfeit the right to organize. They would have to forfeit the right to \norganize. It is an awfully big hurdle. It is a hurdle intended to \nprevent unionization. That is not what the NRLA provides for millions \nof workers across the Nation. But under this provision FedEx would have \nthe more stringent rules of the National Railway Labor Act applied to \nits truck drivers.\n\n  Supporters of the FedEx provision also claim that if we do not pass \nthis bill this week, without amendment, that the safety of air travel \nwill be significantly threatened. Again, this is a kind of blackmail \nattempt to stick a special interest provision in a bill and say that it \ncan't be removed without jeopardizing the underlying vital legislation \nand then shift the burden to those who want to get the special interest \nprovision out.\n  It is a good trick. But we are here today to say that it is unfair \nand that we have been willing and will continue to be willing to come \nout here on the floor of the Senate to indicate that it is not \njustified.\n  Let me just refer to a similar occurrence not too long ago on another \nitem for which the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was taking \nthe lead on a bipartisan basis with the Senator from Kansas to try to \nget some semblance of health care reform in this country. Another \nprovision like this got stuck in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. It was not \nuntil Members of the Senate objected loudly, strenuously, and publicly \nto that special interest provision that the proponents, with some \nembarrassment, suddenly agreed to have it dropped through a correcting \nresolution. That is what should happen right here. It should happen \nright now. This provision should be dropped so that we can get the FAA \nbill passed and signed into law in the next few hours.\n  Let me stress once again--because this is the whole heart of the \nopposition's argument--that they want to pretend inaccurately and \nunfairly that we oppose the underlying bill. We do not oppose the \nunderlying bill. I would like to see the FAA be reauthorized before \nthis Congress adjourns.\n  My colleagues, the Senators from Massachusetts and Illinois, have a \nbill ready--it is at the desk--that I support wholeheartedly. That is \nthe bill we should be considering. It is the conference version of the \nFAA bill minus just this one offensive FedEx provision. But the other \nside will not agree to bring up that bill. It is they, not we, who are \nholding up the reauthorization of these important aviation programs.\n  So again, let us ask: Why is it so important to supporters of this \nprovision that it remain in the bill? How can it be so important? After \nall, they keep saying over and over and over again that this is a minor \ntechnical amendment. Well, then why does Federal Express care so much \nthat it be considered an express carrier? The reason is clear: They \nwant to avoid unionization. That is the benefit to this so-called \ntechnical correction. Federal Express, and my colleagues who support \ntheir provision, understand how much more difficult it would be for \nFederal Express' truck drivers to unionize if they have to organize all \nof their employees nationwide as opposed to being able to form local \nunions.\n  In fact, Madam President, Federal Express' antiunion sentiment is, \nunfortunately, well documented. Federal Express Co. produces a manual \ncalled the Manager's Labor Law Book, which states that its corporate \ngoal is to remain union-free. Of course, we all know that if Federal \nExpress is able to maintain its union-free status, it will be easier \nfor it to remain competitive with UPS. Like Federal Express, UPS' \nairline operations are covered under the Railway Labor Act. However, \nUPS' truck drivers are covered by the National Labor Relations Act, and \nthey have been members of local Teamsters unions for decades.\n  Interestingly, Federal Express' trucking operations expanded in \nrecent years. Some of their drivers have been attempting to organize, \nbut they have, not surprisingly, met resistance from the company's \nmanagement. The issue of whether the company's trucking operation is \nmost appropriately covered under the NLRA or the RLA is currently in \nlitigation.\n\n  So what is this? What is this provision today? This is a backdoor \neffort to win that dispute. This amendment has no business in this \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point, because I think it \nis a very, very important one; that is, as the Senator is pointing out, \nthis is a matter that is in litigation at the present time. This is a \nmatter that is in litigation at the present time. What we are being \nasked to do is superimpose a legislative resolution on what is \nbasically a judicial determination and thereby deny the rights of \nworkers to make a judgment and decision under the existing law.\n  Does the Senator not agree with me that most people would understand \nthat that is sort of changing the rules of the game, changing the \ngoalposts in the third quarter, and that this is basically saying that \nfor people who are trying to play by the rules of the game, ``Well, it \nis just too bad, you tried to play by the rules of the game, and we are \nnot going to take a chance that you may reach a positive result. We are \ngoing to shortchange you and really stick it to you by undermining your \nlegitimate interests by legislative solution''?\n  Is the Senator's opposition to this also based on his belief that we \nshould not, at a time when there are matters in litigation, impose a \nlegislative solution that would directly affect the outcome of that \nlitigation?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor his question.\n  Let me say, first of all, that I have the great honor and pleasure of \nserving with him not only on the Senate floor but particularly on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. For one concerned with the independence of \nour judiciary and the relationship between the Congress and judiciary, \nthis is a threatening prospect. I suppose incidents like that have \noccurred in the past in this great country. When the power of one \nsingle company cannot only move a Congress like this to jeopardize the \nreauthorization of a bill but do it in such a specific and targeted way \nas to try to undo the process in the courts is even more frightening.\n  It is not only a question for working people; it is a question for \nanyone. They should have the opportunity to go to court and have a \nmatter resolved without some company being able to flex its muscles in \nthe waning days of the Congress to undo their right to their day in \ncourt.\n  So I do think that this is an extremely important aspect of my \nopposition. I am opposed to it anyway, but it seems particularly \ninflammatory when this matter is being litigated at this time, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts has indicated.\n  It makes me want to just sort of add on to something that he has said \nto me earlier. This is part of a broader agenda. This isn't just an \nisolated moment where somebody decided to insert a provision to help a \ncompany. This is part of a broader agenda to shove back working people \nin this country so they can't get as organized as they need to be in \norder to protect themselves and their families. It is a broader agenda. \nIt is a broader agenda that was very clearly articulated in that \nContract With America about which we will have a referendum in a few \nweeks. So let us not just view it in isolation.\n\n[[Page S12172]]\n\n  It is inappropriate. It does not belong here. It is a special \ninterest item but part of a broader agenda that is willing not only to \npush its weight around in the Congress but to also try to override the \nprocedure in our courts.\n  What we are faced with here today is a situation in which many \nMembers of this body have worked very, very hard to craft a good bill. \nI praise all of them. I think they have succeeded. But, unfortunately, \nthe conferees allowed a corporate special-interest provision to be \nattached to this good bill, and now we are being pressured to pass the \nbill and its offensive add-on quickly because the end of the fiscal \nyear has come and because, as we all know, it is an election year and \neveryone wants to go back to their home States.\n  But to conclude, I think we would be making a larger mistake than \nusual if we do not remove this provision.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Simon-Kennedy substitute, which \nwill provide a clean FAA reauthorization. If the proponents of this \nprovision would let us pass a clean bill, this measure not only could \nbut I imagine would be signed within a few hours. It is the proponents \nof this special interest treatment for one big company, not the \nopponents, who, I am afraid, have subverted the legislative process.\n  So let us drop this provision, let us drop it now, and let us get a \nclean FAA bill passed.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Peter \nFolger and Jessica Korn, fellows in my office the past year, be granted \nfloor privileges for the remainder of the discussion today on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, under the crunch of time, particularly \nduring yesterday, we did not get an opportunity to recognize the \ncomments of the distinguished Presiding Officer. I had the distinct \nprivilege of serving with Wallace Bennett, of Utah. There is certainly \nno finer gentleman, certainly no finer Senator.\n  We lived in the same neighborhood and exchanged greetings over the \nweekends, and those kinds of things. I was powerfully interested, \nbecause I do remember the FAA bill at that particular time, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska recalls, when we worked on this with \nSenator Magnuson and others. This is a good bill. I acknowledge the \ncontribution that the now-Senator Bennett of Utah, the Presiding \nOfficer, made to that legislation in its formative days. Hopefully, \nafter tomorrow's vote, we can make gains in continuing to beef up air \nservice, particularly in the area of safety.\n  I also did not get an opportunity to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska. He and I have worked on this over the years. And I \nparticularly am thankful for the leadership of the Senator from \nArizona, John McCain. Senator McCain has been like a tiger for a couple \nof years, trying to bring some changes to the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  I have come all the way around in my own mind to thinking in terms of \na separate Federal Aviation Administration, a separate board, outside \nthe department, because I am sure it would receive better attention and \nI am sure it would receive better performance.\n  The Presiding Officer was talking about John Volpe. I remember when \nJohn Volpe came on as the Secretary of Transportation. He and I had \nboth served as Governors together. A lot of people have been working on \nthis for a long time.\n  Let me get right to the point here with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, who gets really far afield talking about blackmail, \nsticking it to them, power grab and all of that. He asked, why is it \nimportant? It is very important to this Senator. None other than Mark \nTwain said, years ago, that the truth was such an important item, it \nshould be used very sparingly.\n  The truth is that we made a mistake. Why is it important? It is a \nmatter of honor. I am trying my dead level best to correct the mistake. \nIt was on our watch last December. I was the ranking member, and the \nfacts should be stated and the truth given accurately.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin said when it was voted for, the provision \nwas in it--absolutely false. The language ``express company'' was in \nthe Interstate Commerce Act when we voted for the termination act, and \nthereafter, the staff was writing it up and those kinds of things, they \nthought the term ``express company'' was not necessary and deleted that \nphrase. So it was a drafting error made.\n  So, when they say it was dropped out and that this amendment is part \nof a broader agenda, this Senator says: part of the contract with \nAmerica? Come on. Everybody back home would break out laughing if they \nheard. I have been talking against that contract for 4 years now. I did \nnot think much of it as politics. It was all applesauce: Get rid of the \nDepartment of Education, the Department of Commerce, get rid of the \nDepartment of Energy, repeal--get rid of public television, get rid of \nthe Park Service--just get rid of it all? Come on. This is not any part \nof the contract. It is part of my particular watch, and I am going to \nget it corrected. Do not give me this stuff about procedure now.\n  They said, back in my law school days, if you have the law you argue \nthe law as strongly as you can. If you have the facts with you, you \nargue the facts. And if you do not have the facts or the law, you beat \non the desk, and yell about procedure. And that is what we are \nlistening to. ``It was in the House bill, it was not in the Senate \nbill''--heavens above, we passed an omnibus appropriations and \ncontinuing resolution earlier this week with hardly a dissenting vote. \nI would think one-third of it was not in there before or had ever been \nseen or whatever else. I know the new things that were put in, we were \nglad to get them in. That is the nature of the process. Any of that, \n``sneaking around, pulling the rug out, sticking it to them, \nblackmail''--that is tommyrot and they know it. They are the ones \ntrying to pull the rug out because they continually falsely report the \nsituation.\n\n  I read again the statement of the Senator from Massachusetts, talking \nabout that Philadelphia case: ``Federal Express challenged the \npetition, arguing the entire company, including its truck drivers, is \ncovered by the Railway Labor Act and not the Labor Relations Act, and \ntherefore the bargaining unit for its truck drivers must be nationwide. \nThe board has not yet decided the issue.''\n  Absolutely false. The board decided the issue on November 22 of last \nyear. In Re: Federal Express, 23 NMB, No. 13. And I quote what they \ndecided unanimously:\n\n       The board is of the opinion that Federal Express \n     Corporation and all its employees sought by the UAW's \n     petition are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n  But the Senator from Massachusetts says--``a man convinced against \nhis will is of the same opinion still''--and I quote yesterday again, \n``The Senator from South Carolina still cannot show where Federal \nExpress is an express company under the Railway Labor Act.''\n  I just did. That is one of the most recent decisions. I laid it in \nthe Record and enumerated some 31 decisions. Maybe we ought to ask it \nin reverse. Find me a single decision since 1973, when Federal Express \nwent in business, in which it was not held to be an express company \nunder the RLA. It has always been held that it is under the Railway \nLabor Act.\n  Mr. President, let me move on. Right here they say you are not \nplaying fair, that they are playing by the rules of the game. We are \ntrying a new case here that we have not had a hearing on or anything, \nthey say--it makes me go to the Record.\n  They say the United Parcel Service has so many planes and trucks, \nFederal Express has so many planes and trucks, United Parcel Service \nplays by the rules and Federal Express ought to play by the rules.\n  Oh, boy, that has been raised by the best of the best lawyers. There \nis not any question that the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers both \nhave the best of the best lawyers.\n  In the Board case: United Parcel Service, Timothy J. Gallagher and \nthe International Brotherhood of Teamsters, National Committee \nintervenor, decision and order of August 25 of last year by Chairman \nGould and members Stephens, Browning, Cohen and Truesdale, and I quote:\n\n\n[[Page S12173]]\n\n\n       Approximately 92 percent of the packages picked up, \n     processed and delivered by the respondent travel exclusively \n     by ground.\n\n  Ninety-two percent; 85 percent of Federal Express travels by air, and \nthat case, interestingly, appeared in an argument made by the teamster \nattorney on May 9, 1996, in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals \nfor the District of Columbia Circuit. United Parcel Service petition, \nNational Labor Relations Board. Mr. Muldolf, the lawyer, was answering \na question.\n\n       Mr. Muldolf: Well, the case now pending before the NLRB is \n     a FedEx case which has been referred back. There has not been \n     a decision there, but if you take the NLRB's decision in UPS \n     and you take the NMB's advisory opinion in Federal Express, \n     you see--and I can't tell you what the NLRB is going to do--\n     these companies are like night and day. Ninety-two percent on \n     the ground, 15 percent on the ground--\n\n  That is the language of their own lawyer. But you get the politician \nlawyers who appear on the floor of the Senate and they want to try a \ndifferent case. I don't know if they have ever been in the courtroom \nbefore. This Senator has made a living at it. We are not going to let \nthem get by with this bum's rush, because exactly what they accuse me \nof--inserting this language, of pulling the rug and sticking it to \nthem--is exactly what they are trying. They know when they say \n``litigation pending'' that there is none. The NLRB has been sitting on \nthe finding of the National Mediation Board since last November. I have \nsearched the record, and in the last 50 years of 100 cases where the \nNational Mediation Board has given its opinion, the NLRB has yet to \nreverse it.\n  So they know it is a given. If they tried to rule otherwise, it would \nbe appealed and reversed right away. So there is nothing pending. But \nwhat they are trying to do is come in after the rules of the game, \nafter November 22, after the full hearing over a 5-year period. It \nwasn't started until the end of 1990, the first part of 1991. After 5 \nyears and with all the lawyers, they were unanimously ruled against, \nand they try now to change the rule by saying, ``Oh, they made that \nerror. We can get this organized, and we can get the votes, we can \ncontrol it.''\n  They have been blocking correcting this mistake every way they can. \nYes, they blocked it in the Appropriations Committee because I wasn't \nprepared. I thought an honest error would be respected by Senators as \ngentlemen. I went in, explained exactly what happened. We called the \nroll, and it was 10 to 10. I hadn't even bothered to get the proxies. \nHowever, later on, we did include it in the conference report. It has \nbeen debated, affirmed in the House by a rollcall vote. We are ready to \nvote now, and they are claiming we are filibustering.\n  It reminds me, I say to the Senator, of a young lad who went to the \npsychiatrist, and she drew a line on the board and said, ``What do you \nthink of?''\n  The young lad said, ``Sex.''\n  She drew some crosses.\n  He said, ``Sex.''\n  She drew circles.\n  He said, ``Sex.''\n  She said, ``Young man, you're the most oversexed, depraved person \nI've ever seen.''\n  ``Doctor, me depraved?'' he said. ``You're the one drawing the dirty \npictures.''\n  Come on. Are we doing the filibustering? We are ready to vote, have \nbeen ready to vote. They are the ones who moved to postpone. I haven't \nheard that motion in the 30 years I have been here; never heard it. But \nI heard it from the Senator from Massachusetts for the first time. Then \nthey wanted to read the bill. And they say we are the ones \nfilibustering?\n\n  Why is it important? Because the truth is important. It was not part \nof the bill when it left the Senate. It was not a part of the bill when \nit left the House. We know it wasn't in there. Look at what we voted on \non Monday. I can give you ad nauseam a list of things that were never \nin the House, never in the Senate that appeared there.\n  They say this is ``one more blow to the working people.'' It is not \nany blow to the working people. I am not engaged in that kind of work. \nI am not forestalling the entire Congress for a broader agenda. I could \ncomment further but in the interest of time let me go down to a couple \nof other things.\n  The intent. Oh, yes, the Congressional Research Service. The comment \nwas made he was demeaned, the lawyer. If I could get him, I would wring \nhis neck. I couldn't demean him enough. Why? Because he was asked about \nthis provision and said it was put in intentionally, when he knows \notherwise. He failed and refused to quote the intent of the Congress.\n  This is in the conference report, Mr. Shuster, of the committee of \nconference, submitted the following report:\n\n       The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall \n     neither expand nor contract coverage of employees and \n     employers by the Railway Labor Act.\n\n  With the deleted language, that is the ambiguity we are trying to \nclarify. But when you look for intent, and we told them about it, the \nCRS letter continually disregards the intent with this letter to the \nMembers. I can't get to all the Members and explain this. They have \nlabor reps running all around. They say, ``Stay home, they have to get \nthe 60 votes.''\n  It is so hard, as Twain says, to use the truth. It's so hard to \ndevelop it around this particular issue.\n  There has been an onslaught, Mr. President, against the company. I \nsaw a part of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts' press \nconference on TV. By the time I saw it, it was cut, but it was \npartially on C-SPAN that ``it was a horrible company; they hadn't given \na pay raise in 7 years,'' the FedEx employee was saying. I called, and \nwe will get it in the Record. They have had, I was told, over the last \n8 years, each year an average of 6.5 percent, for a total of a 50 \npercent wage increase. I said that very carefully because that is \nexactly what I was told, and I am going to get a copy of it.\n  Mr. President, we have in this book: ``The 100 Best Companies to Work \nfor in America'' with special recognition in the following categories: \nOne of the best 10 overall companies; one of the 10 best for job \nsecurity; one of the 10 best for women; one of the 10 best for \nminorities; one of the 12 best with significant employee ownership; one \nof the 10 best training programs. We have the Minority Business \nCouncil; the Hispanic Council; the Good Housekeeping magazine's 69 top \ncompanies for working mothers, and on and on and on.\n  This book--we wouldn't want to put the book in the Record --is ``The \n100 Best Companies to Work for in America,'' by Robert Levering and \nMilton Moskowitz.\n  But when you get an outstanding company, and they are playing by the \nrules, and you get the bum's rush as a result of a drafting error, \nafter the conference, that we have been trying to correct, and then \nthey give you all this procedure and everything else like we are doing \nthe sneaking--we have done nothing here in this particular provision in \nthe FAA Reauthorization Act but put the parties back exactly where they \nwere, which was the intent. None of the rights or responsibilities were \neither contracted or expanded for employees or employers.\n  We have not had hearings. When they talk about hearings, there was \nnot any hearing when this was deleted, there was not any statement \nmade. I cannot find--I said, ``Where is the Senator, where is the \nCongressman who said, `I wanted this. I put it in. I discussed it. I \ntalked about it.'?'' They cannot find one of 535; yet we get accused of \nblackmail.\n  I never heard of such outrageous fraud going on here trying to change \nthe entire picture of what really is the case with respect to this \nparticular matter.\n  Mr. President, one more time I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record excerpts of the National Mediation Board's opinion in re \nFederal Express case No. 4-RC-17698.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     National Mediation Board,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 22, 1995.\n     Re NMB File No. CJ-6463 (NLRB Case 4-RC-17698) Federal \n         Express Corp.\n\n     Jeffrey D. Wedekind,\n     Acting Solicitor, National Labor Relations Board, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Wedekind: This responds to your request dated July \n     17, 1995, for the National Mediation Board's (Board's) \n     opinion as to whether Federal Express Corporation (Federal \n     Express or FedEx) and certain of its employees is subject to \n     the Railway Labor Act,\n\n[[Page S12174]]\n\n     as amended, 45 U.S.C. Sec. 151, et. seq. The Board's opinion, \n     based upon the materials provided by your office and the \n     Board's investigation is that Federal Express and all of its \n     employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   I.\n\n       This case arose as the result of a representation petition \n     filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by the \n     International Union, United Automobile Aerospace and \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW). The UAW \n     initially sought to represent a unit of Federal Express's \n     employees including ``all regular full and part-time hourly \n     ground service employees in the Liberty District.'' \\1\\ On \n     December 9, 1991, the UAW amended its petition to exclude \n     ``ramp agents, ramp agent/feeders, handlers, senior handlers, \n     heavyweight handlers, senior heavy weight handlers, checker \n     sorters, senior checker/sorters, shuttle drivers, shuttle \n     driver/handlers, office clerical employees, engineers, guards \n     and supervisors as defined in the Act [NLRA].'' The titles \n     remaining in the UAW's petition include: service agents, \n     senior service agents, international document agents, \n     couriers, courier/handlers, tractor-trailer drivers, \n     dispatchers,\\2\\ courier/non-drivers and operations agents.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express Liberty District are employees subject to the \n     National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). The UAW acknowledges \n     that pilots and aircraft mechanics employed by Federal \n     Express are subject to the Railway Labor Act. However, the \n     UAW contends that the two-part test traditionally employed by \n     the Board to determine whether an entity is a carrier should \n     be applied to the unit of employees it seeks to represent in \n     Federal Express' Liberty District. According to the UAW, the \n     employees it seeks to represent in the Liberty District do \n     not perform airline work and are not ``integral to Federal \n     Express' air transportation functions.''\n       Federal Express asserts that it is a carrier subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act and, as a carrier, all of its employees are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express notes that \n     the Board and the courts have repeatedly found it to be a \n     carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. According to \n     Federal Express, the job classifications remaining in the \n     petition are integrally related to Federal Express' air \n     transportation activities. Federal Express contends that it \n     is a ``unified operation with fully integrated air and ground \n     services.'' According to Federal Express, allowing some \n     employees to be covered by the National Labor Relations Act \n     and others to be subject to the Railway Labor Act would \n     result in employees being covered by different labor \n     relations statutes as they are promoted up the career ladder.\n       Federal Express contends that the two-part test suggested \n     by the UAW is not appropriate in this case. According to \n     Federal Express, the Board uses the two-part test to \n     determine whether a company is a carrier, not to determine \n     whether specific employees of a carrier perform duties that \n     are covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal Express \n     cautions that adoption of the test suggested by the UAW \n     ``would drastically alter labor relations at every airline in \n     the country.'' According to Federal Express, under the UAW's \n     test, most categories of employees except pilots, flight \n     attendants and aircraft mechanics would be subject to the \n     NLRA.\n       The Board repeatedly has exercised jurisdiction over \n     Federal Express. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 (1995); \n     Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal Express \n     Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1993); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 126 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express \n     Corp., 19 NMB 297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 \n     (1989); Federal Express/Flying Tiger, 16 NMB 433 (1989); \n     Federal Express, 6 NMB 442 (1978). There is no dispute that \n     Federal Express is a carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act \n     with respect to certain Federal Express employees (i.e. \n     Pilots; Flight Attendants,\\3\\ Global Operations Control \n     Specialists; and Mechanics and Related Employees; Stock \n     Clerks; and Fleet Service Employees). However, the Board has \n     not addressed the issue raised by the UAW: whether or not \n     certain Federal Express employees are subject to the Railway \n     Labor Act.\n       The NLRB initially requested the NNB's opinion as to \n     whether FedEx is subject to the RLA on July 1, 1992. However, \n     on that date, the NLRB granted the UAW's request to reopen \n     the record and the file was returned to the NLRB. The NLRB \n     renewed its request on July 17, 1995 and the NMB received the \n     record on July 31, 1995. The NMB received additional evidence \n     and argument from FedEx and the UAW on August 17, 1995 and \n     September 5, 1995.\n\n\n                                  ii.\n\n       Federal Express, a Delaware corporation, is an air express \n     delivery service which provides worldwide express package \n     delivery. According to Chairman of the Board and Chief \n     Executive Officer Frederick Smith, Federal Express flies the \n     sixth largest jet aircraft fleet in the world.\n       Federal Express' jet aircraft fleet, currently includes \n     Boeing 727-100's, Boeing 727-200's, Boeing 737's, Boeing 747-\n     100's, Boeing 747-200's, DC 10-10's, DC-10-30's and \n     McDonnell-Douglas MD-11's. Federal Express also operates \n     approximately 250 feeder aircraft, including Cessna 208's and \n     Fokker 27's. It has over 50 jet aircraft on order.\n       Federal Express currently serves the United States and \n     several countries in the Middle East, Europe, South America \n     and Asia, including Japan, Saudi Arabia and Russia. According \n     to Managing Director of Operations Research Joseph Hinson, \n     Federal Express does not transport freight that moves \n     exclusively by ground to or from the United States.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                            iii. discussion\n\n       The National Mediation Board has exercised jurisdiction \n     over Federal Express as a common carrier by air in numerous \n     published determinations. Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 279 \n     (1995); Federal Express Corp., 22 NMB 257 (1995); Federal \n     Express Corp., 22 NMB 215 (1995); Federal Express Corp., 20 \n     NMB 666 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 404 (1993); \n     Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 394 (1989); Federal Express \n     Corp., 20 NMB 360 (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 126 \n     (1993); Federal Express Corp., 20 NMB 91 (1992); Federal \n     Express Corp., 20 NMB 7 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 19 NMB \n     297 (1992); Federal Express Corp., 17 NMB 24 (1989); Federal \n     Express/Flying Tiger, 16 NMB 433 (1989); Federal Express, 6 \n     NMB 442 (1978). In eight of those determinations, the Board \n     exercised jurisdiction over ground service employees of \n     Federal Express. The substantial record developed in this \n     proceeding provides no clear and convincing evidence to \n     support a different result.\n\n\n                                   a.\n\n       Section 181, which extended the Railway Labor Act's \n     coverage to air carriers, provides:\n       ``All of the provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter \n     except section 153 of this title are extended to and shall \n     cover every common carrier by air engaged in interstate or \n     foreign commerce, and every carrier by air transporting mail \n     for or under contract with the United States Government, and \n     every air pilot or other person who performs any work as an \n     employee or subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, \n     subject to its or their continuing authority to supervise and \n     direct the manner of rendition of his service.'' 45 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 181. (Emphasis added).\n       Federal Express is an air express delivery service which \n     holds itself out for hire to transport packages, both \n     domestically and internationally. Federal Express and the UAW \n     agree that Federal Express and its air operations employees, \n     such as pilots and aircraft mechanics, are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The disagreement arises over whether \n     Federal Express' remaining employees are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. The UAW argues that the employees it seeks \n     to represent do not perform airline work and are not \n     ``integral to Federal Express' air transportation \n     functions.'' Federal Express asserts that all of the \n     employees sought by the UAW are integrally related to its air \n     express delivery service and are subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act.\n       Since there is no dispute over whether Federal Express is a \n     common carrier by air, the Board focuses on whether the \n     employees sought by the UAW's petition before the NLRB are \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. The Act's definition of an \n     employee of an air carrier includes, ``every air pilot or \n     other person who performs any work as an employee or \n     subordinate official of such carrier or carriers, subject to \n     its or their continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition of his service''. The Railway Labor Act \n     does not limit its coverage to air carrier employees who fly \n     or maintain aircraft. Rather, its coverage extends to \n     virtually all employees engaged in performing a service for \n     the carrier so that the carrier may transport passengers or \n     freight.\\4\\\n       In REA Express, Inc., 4 NMB 253, 269 (1965), the Board \n     found ``over-the-road'' drivers employed by REA subject to \n     the Act stating:\n       ``It has been the Board's consistent position that the fact \n     of employment by a ``carrier'' under the Act is determinative \n     of the status of all that carrier's employees as subject to \n     the Act. The effort to carve out or to separate the so-called \n     over-the-road drivers would be contrary to and do violence to \n     a long line of decisions by this Board which would embrace \n     the policy of refraining from setting up a multiplicity of \n     crafts or classes. As stated above, there is no question that \n     this particular group are employees of the carrier.'' \n     (Emphasis in original).\n       The limit on Section 181's coverage is that the carrier \n     must have ``continuing authority to supervise and direct the \n     manner of rendition of . . . [an employee's] service. The \n     couriers, tractor-trailer drivers, operations agents and \n     other employees sought by the UAW are employed by Federal \n     Express directly. As the record amply demonstrates, these \n     employees, as part of Federal Express' air express delivery \n     system, are supervised by Federal Express employees. The \n     Board need not look further to find that all of Federal \n     Express' employees are subject to the Railway Labor Act.\n\n\n                                   b.\n\n       In the Board's judgment, the analysis of the jurisdictional \n     question could end here. However, Federal Express and the UAW \n     have directed substantial portions of their arguments the \n     ``integrally related'' test. Specifically, the participants \n     discuss whether the employees the UAW seeks to represent are\n\n[[Page S12175]]\n\n     ``integrally related'' to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions. The Board does not find consideration of the \n     ``integrally related'' test necessary to resolve the \n     jurisdictional issue, however, review of the relevance of \n     this test is appropriate.\n       The UAW argues that the employees it seeks to represent are \n     not integrally related to Federal Express' air carrier \n     functions and therefore are not subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act. Federal Express asserts that the NLRB and federal courts \n     have found its trucking operations integrally related to its \n     air operations.\\5\\\n       However, the Board does not apply the ``integrally \n     related'' test to the Federal Express employees sought by the \n     UAW. Where, as here, the company at issue is a common carrier \n     by air, the Act's jurisdiction does not depend upon whether \n     there is an integral relationship between its air carrier \n     activities and the functions performed by the carrier's \n     employees in question. The Board need not consider the \n     relationship between the work performed by employees of a \n     common carrier and the air carrier's mission, because section \n     181 encompasses ``every pilot or other person who performs \n     any work as an employee or subordinate official of such \n     carrier or carriers. . . .'' (Emphasis added).\n       Even if the Board were to assume arguendo that the \n     ``integrally related'' test applies to the facts in this \n     case, the Board would hold in concurrence with the recent \n     decision in Federal Express Corp. v. California PUC, supra, \n     at note 10, that the ``trucking operations of Federal Express \n     are integral to its operations as an air carrier.'' 936 F.2d \n     at 1078. Employees working in the other positions sought by \n     the UAW perform functions equally crucial to Federal Express' \n     mission as an integrated air express delivery service. As the \n     record demonstrates, without the functions performed by the \n     employees at issue, Federal Express could not provide the on-\n     time express delivery required of an air express delivery \n     service.\n       The Board has employed the ``integrally related'' test when \n     it has examined whether to apply the trucking exemption under \n     Sec. 151 of the Act. O/O Truck Sales, 21 NMB at 269; Florida \n     Express Carrier, Inc., 16 NMB 407 (1989). Specifically, the \n     Board has applied the ``integrally related'' test when it has \n     considered trucking operations conducted by a subsidiary of a \n     carrier or a company in the same corporate family with a \n     carrier. In Florida Express, supra, the Board found Florida \n     Express, a trucking company which is a wholly-owned \n     subsidiary of Florida East Coast Railroad, to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In O/O Truck Sales, \n     supra, the Board found O/O Truck Sales, a trucking and \n     fueling company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of CSXI \n     (which is commonly owned with CSXT), to be a carrier \n     subject to the Railway Labor Act. In contrast, Federal \n     Express directly employs truck drivers, couriers and all \n     other employees sought by the UAW's petition.\n\n\n                                   c.\n\n       The UAW argues that the Board should apply the two-part \n     test used by the Board in other factual settings for \n     determining whether an employer and its employees are subject \n     to the Railway Labor Act. See, for example, Miami Aircraft \n     Support, 21 NMB 78 (1993); AMR Services Corp., 18 NMB 348 \n     (1991). The Board does not apply the two-part test where the \n     company at issue is engaged in common carriage by air or \n     rail. The Board applies the two-part test where the company \n     in question is a separate corporate entity such as a \n     subsidiary or a derivative carrier which provides a service \n     for another carrier. In those situations where the Board \n     applies the two-part test, it determines: 1) whether the \n     company at issue is directly or indirectly owned or \n     controlled by a common carrier or carriers; and 2) whether \n     the functions it performs are traditionally performed by \n     employees of air or rail carriers. Under this test, both \n     elements must be satisfied for a company to be subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act. Federal Express is an admitted carrier and \n     the employees at issue are employed directly by Federal \n     Express. Accordingly, the two-part test does not apply to \n     this proceeding.\n       Even if the two-part test were applicable, the employees at \n     issue here would be covered by the Railway Labor Act. Federal \n     Express, as a common carrier, has direct control over the \n     positions sought by the UAW. In addition, the Board has found \n     that virtually all of the work performed by employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition is work traditionally performed by \n     employees in the airline industry. For example: couriers, Air \n     Cargo Transport, Inc., 15 NMB 202 (1988); Crew Transit, Inc., \n     10 NMB 64 (1982); truck drivers; Florida Express, Inc., 16 \n     NMB 407 (1989); customer service agents; Trans World \n     International Airlines, Inc., 6 NMB 703 (1979).\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Based upon the entire record in this case and for all of \n     the reasons stated above, the Board is of the opinion that \n     Federal Express Corporation and all of its employees sought \n     by the UAW's petition are subject to the Railway Labor Act. \n     This finding may be cited as Federal Express Corporation, 23 \n     NMB 32 (1995).

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, The Capitol, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader and Mr. Speaker: We are writing to \n     you to set out the facts regarding a technical error in the \n     ICC Termination Act of 1995, Public Law 104-88. The mistake \n     concerns the context in which the ICC Termination Act \n     addressed the relationship between the economic regulation of \n     transportation under Subtitle IV of Title 49, United States \n     Code, and the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et. seq.).\n       The ICC Termination Act abolished the former Interstate \n     Commerce Commission, reduced economic regulation \n     substantially in both rail and motor carrier transportation, \n     and transferred the reduced but retained regulatory functions \n     to a new Surface Transportation Board, part of the Department \n     of Transportation.\n       One form of ICC regulatory jurisdiction under the former \n     Interstate Commerce Act was exercised over ``express \n     carriers''--as defined in former 49 U.S.C. 10102, a person \n     ``providing express transportation for compensation.'' This \n     was part of the ICC's jurisdiction, since express service \n     originated as an ancillary service connecting with rail \n     freight service.\n       The Railway Labor Act included in Part I coverage of ``any \n     express company . . . subject to the Interstate Commerce \n     Act.'' [45 U.S.C. 15].\n       In the ICC Termination Act, economic regulation of express \n     carriers was eliminated from the statutes to be administered \n     by the new Surface Transportation Board, on the ground that \n     this form of regulation was obsolete. (Another category of \n     ICC and Railway Labor Act ``carrier''--the sleeping-car \n     company--was similarly eliminated from STB jurisdiction.)\n       In light of the abolition of economic regulation, the ICC \n     Termination Act contained a conforming amendment (Section \n     322, 109 Stat. 950) which also struck the term ``express \n     company'' from the Railway Labor Act definition of a \n     ``carrier.'' Although unaware of any possible effects of this \n     conforming change on the standards applied under the Railway \n     Labor Act, Congress plainly delineated its intent in new \n     Section 10501(c)(3)(B) of Title 49, U.S. Code [109 Stat. \n     808]: ``The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 \n     shall neither expand nor contract coverage of employers and \n     employees by the Railway Labor Act.''\n       The apparent contradiction between the legislative intent \n     stated in Section 10501(c)(3)(B) and the conforming Railway \n     Labor Act in Section 322 could be interpreted to alter the \n     legal standards by which companies are determined to be \n     governed, or not governed, by the Railway Labor Act. \n     Therefore, a technical correction is necessary to restore the \n     former Railway Labor Act terminology and thus avoid any \n     inference that is at odds with the clearly stated legislative \n     intent not to alter coverage of companies or their employees \n     under the Railway Labor Act.\n\n[[Page S12176]]\n\n       We hope that this brief summary of the facts will provide \n     you with information useful in your future deliberations.\n           Respectfully,\n     Bud Shuster,\n       Chairman.\n     Susan Molinari,\n       Railroad Subcommittee Chairwoman.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there are some other things to be \ntouched upon as we move through this. I think one of the important \nthings is the particular charge that they come bringing about something \nbeing unfair and not according to the rules, or whatever else.\n  I reiterate as positively, as affirmatively as I can, ever since \n1973, when the Federal Express Co. was organized, it has been under the \nRailway Labor Act, the Railway Labor Act. All of its matters, I am \nfinding out as a lawyer, are automatically referred by the NLRB to the \nNational Mediation Board. The matter that is now being discussed, what \nis being ``fair'' and ``unfair'' and those kinds of things, and ``Why \ncan't we change that?'' it could be if we had some hearings, if we had \nit brought before the Congress.\n  But the best of the best has just served on what we call the Dunlop \nCommission. When President Clinton came to town, he got the former \nSecretary of Labor under Gerald Ford, President Ford, and said, study \nand see what needs to be done under labor, the labor statutes.\n  None other than Doug Fraser, the former president of the United Auto \nWorkers, served on that commission. And that commission determined that \nthe Railway Labor Act should not be modified.\n  We can be ready to argue that and go in length on it. But I think \nwhen you find the UAW lawyer, and they know about this decision of the \nMediation Board that I already put in the record, when you find a \nTeamster lawyer, in his arguments before the circuit court, when you \nfind the Dunlop Commission--if we had just started this thing, we would \nhave weighted support by all the particular studies and lawyers who \nhave been in the particular field.\n  But like the sheep dog that had tasted blood, when they saw this \nparticular mistake, they went to gobble up the entire flock. They said, \n``We can do it. All we need to do is have everyone anxious to go home, \nand we'll just show them, and we'll move to postpone. We'll say, `Read \nthe conference report. Read it.''' And then after reading it for 2 \ndays--the distinguished Senator said he did not know why we were here \nfor 2 days. The 2 days is so the union crowd can work around the clock.\n  I cannot do any work when I am on the floor trying to defend the \ntruth. Yet we are getting blamed for blackmail and that kind of thing. \nI think it is totally out of character with the service here in this \nparticular body. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.

The way it was divided \nup, we are entitled to at least have time for the Senators in \nopposition, the position of the Senator from Massachusetts and the \nothers. I did not understand the time agreement was to be between--I am \nalways glad to accommodate, but I mean we have had one speaker against \nit. Now it is 20 until 4. We have been here since 2 o'clock. We have \nhad 15 minutes on one position.\n  I ask, how was the time allocated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time was under the control of the \nrespective leaders. Therefore, the time on the part of the Democratic \nSenators is charged to the Democratic leader, and the time on the part \nof the Republican Senators charged to the Republican leader.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, that is a surprise to me. Was that \nthe way it was done yesterday, Mr. President?\n  As I understand, I had the control of the time yesterday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct, \nthat was the procedure yesterday. There is a different time agreement \nin place today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, parliamentary inquiry. When was that time \nagreement entered into?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is incorrect. It is the same \nagreement.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well then, could I ask the Chair then to correct the \ntime allocation?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there is no correction due. This time was \ndivided across the aisle, an even amount of time for the Democrats and \nan even amount for Republicans. After all, we do have more Senators on \nthis side of the aisle than that side of the aisle, and yet we split \nthe time evenly. Three hours each day is to be split evenly between the \ntwo sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Or their designees, as it was yesterday, Mr. President. \nI was here all day yesterday.\n  We talk about a ``jamming.'' We were here yesterday, and we had it \ndivided up evenly between those for it and against it. We have had one \nspeaker who has spoken for 14 or 15 minutes against this provision, and \nnow we are told we have 38 minutes left. That is not the--that is very, \nvery clear. That certainly supports what we have been saying about this \nparticular provision, Mr. President. We did not divide the time \nyesterday that way. It is unacceptable to say you are to change the \nrules of the game overnight without anything to demonstrate it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was mistaken in suggesting there was \na change in the time agreement. The Chair is advised by the \nParliamentarian that the agreement has been followed in this pattern \never since it was entered into.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Massachusetts to \nlook at the order. It is ordered that at 2 p.m., Wednesday, October 2, \nthere is to be 3 hours for debate only, to be equally divided between \nthe two leaders. That is what we are doing.\n  If the Senator seeks any more time, I am prepared to stay here as \nlong as he wants to have more time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have every intention to have time to do that, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This time is to be equally divided between the two \nleaders.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It was my understanding----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, 46 Senators over there have an hour and a \nhalf, and 53 Senators over here have an hour and a half. I do not see \nanything unfair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take what time I shall need at the appropriate \ntime, Mr. President. This is the first time that I can remember in the \ntime I have been in the Senate when there has been a division on an \nissue with those Members that are for a proposal and those that are \nagainst, and when there is a time agreement to divide the time equally, \nand then have it interpreted the way it has been interpreted--this is \nthe first time in my recollection this has happened.\n  I made it clear, both to our leader, and he indicated to the majority \nleader as well, as to what we were asking for, and that is to have an \nhour and a half on each side to make the presentation evenly divided. \nThis is a convoluted interpretation of that understanding.\n  I will take such time as I might need later on.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from New \nMexico desires.\n  The order is specific, to be equally divided between the two leaders. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts has been assuming he has been designated \nby the leader that he is to assume the time. I have not been advised.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time, Senator Murray, did you want?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Less than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. She has been waiting longer. I will yield if they take \nit out of their time, and then ask that the Senator from New Mexico be \nrecognized after Senator Murray completes her remarks.\n\n[[Page S12177]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico will be recognized at the conclusion of \nthe remarks of the Senator from Washington. The Senator from Washington \nis recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today as a strong proponent of the \nbill before us H.R. 3539, the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization bill. This legislation does provide critical aviation \nsafety and reform efforts and it is the principle authority for \naviation infrastructure investments.\n  The importance of this bill only underscores the time and serious \nattention, Members in this Chamber have given to the legislation's \nexpress carrier provision. I have listened closely over the last few \ndays to colleagues whom I deeply respect, on both sides of this issue \nand both sides of the aisle.\n  As much as I want to see the FAA bill pass, I believe we must focus \non the question of fairness. Did this provision, we are now debating \nreceive enough public comment and undergo hearings necessary to \nadequately judge the change? Is this provision so insignificant, that \nit can be quickly addressed in the rush to adjourn? Are we creating a \npriority system that places specific companies above others?\n  These questions are serious and far-reaching. This provision raises \ntoo many concerns and justifies this Chamber's serious examination of \nthe language. First, one must look at the legislative history of this \nrider. There has never been a hearing on this provision in a House \nsubcommittee or full committee. Neither have there been any hearings on \nthis provision in a Senate subcommittee or full committee.\n  There have been previous attempts to attach the rider to omnibus \nappropriations bills, the National Transportation Safety Board \nreauthorization and the Railroad Unemployment Act. All of these \nattempts to insert this controversial language have failed.\n  The rider was not on this bill as it passed the House and was not \nincluded in the Senate's original FAA reauthorization bill until it \nreached the conference committee. There are even jurisdictional \nquestions to be answered as the House required a special rule just to \nconsider the provision. In the end, 198 Members of Congress opposed the \nFAA bill with this added rider.\n  Second, as debate continues on this provision, it becomes clear that \nthis is not simply a technical correction. The term ``express carrier'' \nhas been obsolete for years and was purposely removed from the Railway \nLabor Act and the Interstate Commerce Act when Congress passed the ICC \nTermination Act last year. Express carrier was removed, simply because \nno express carrier existed since the mid-1970's.\n  Congress is charged with promoting an equal playing field for all. \nUnfortunately, what appeared to be an innocuous correction has become a \ndangerous reclassification. We must ensure that employees of one \ncompany have the same opportunities as those employees in other similar \norganizations.\n  Many will try to boil this issue down into another labor battle. I \nprefer to look at the provision as one that denies a specific group of \nemployees, basic rights in the workplace. These opportunities are \nalready granted to these employees' colleagues.\n  All of us are ready for adjournment. Many have felt that they've \nbecome hostage to an insignificant technical correction with little \nimpact. Our 4 days of debate will one day, however, appear \ninsignificant. Especially in contrast to the thousands of workers who \nwill forever be held hostage by this language.\n  Mr. President, let's act reasonably. Let's act rationally and by all \nmeans let's adjourn. But let's leave this session with a clear \nconscience and a bill we can all live with, confident that we did not \nact in haste or shortsightedness.\n  In the interest of good Government and good public policy, let's \nremove the provision and re-examine it through the normal legislative \nprocess. In the interest of good Government and good public policy, \nlets pass the FAA bill without this express provision. This legislation \nis strong enough on its own merits. I am certain the House will \nrecognize its responsibility to come back and finish a job, so critical \nto America's workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12166-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12177-S12178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                        Senator Bennett Johnston\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have not had occasion to speak on the floor with \nreference to some of my close friends, retiring Senators, other than \nsome remarks I made with reference to Bennett Johnston. We came to the \nSenate together, and I addressed my thoughts on Bennett Johnston. He is \nmy ranking member and I have been his.\n  Now I will take a few minutes to talk about a number of Members. I do \nnot know that I will be able to comment on all my fellow colleagues \nthat are leaving, but I will briefly state my remarks, and I hope \nbrevity is not taken by any of the departing Senators as an indication \nof my heartfelt feelings. In a few minutes I will cover a lot of them \nwith some observation that I remember most specifically about each \nSenator.\n\n\n                           Senator Paul Simon\n\n  I start with a Democrat Senator, Senator Paul Simon from the State of \nIllinois. I perceive, as I look at Senator Simon, that he was a quiet \nman, who acquired a great deal of respect in this Chamber and became \nvery effective because he has been very forthright in the manner that \nhe does business and carries out his initiatives and efforts.\n  He has always put all his cards on the table, even in cases where not \nall the cards were on his side. I think his reputation for integrity \nand honesty, along with his articulate manner of presenting things in a \nlow-key manner, have gained him a significant reward in this \ninstitution by way of his accomplishments. We will miss him.\n  Obviously, he has done work in mental illness parity, the Genetic \nPrivacy Act, the balanced budget amendment for which he will be known, \nline-item veto, some work on homelessness, problems of violence on \ntelevision, and the programming that he has deemed indecent and not \nworthy of presentation. I commend him for his time in the Senate and \nwish him and his wonderful wife the very best.\n\n\n                           Senator Hank Brown\n\n  Second, I take a few moments to talk about Senator Brown from the \nState of Colorado. I wanted to say right up front, I have been in this \nChamber now for 24 years, 4 terms. I have not seen a Senator make as \nmuch of an impact in 6 short years as has the distinguished Senator, \nSenator Brown, from the State of Colorado. He is a man with great \ntalent, a marvelous wit, and a great knack for making the complicated \nsimple. He has helped us present very complex issues in ways that the \nAmerican people understand, and he has done that wherever he chose in \nwhatever committee work or here on the Senate floor.\n  No one was more effective in defeating the 19 billion dollars' worth \nof so-called stimulus package proposed by President Clinton which would \nhave been $19 billion more added to the deficit. Senator Brown provided \nclear, powerful examples and straightforward and practical reasons as \nto why we should not do that. His ideas were contagious, and I believe \namong the many things he can take credit for, it is this example of \nclarity that he gave to all of us which permitted an issue that \nclearly, clearly, should not have gone the way the President asked. \nBecause of him, it did not.\n\n\n                            Senator Jim Exon\n\n  Let me take just a moment to talk about another Senator. First of \nall, I wish I had more time to talk about my cohort on the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Exon, of the State of Nebraska. But as I indicated, \nI do not have enough time to say all that I would like, and I don't \nbelieve I will find enough time; but here are the three things I recall \nmost vividly about the Senator. First and foremost--and only people who \nwork with the budget will appreciate this--I think Senator Exon should \nbe commended because, as he took over the Budget Committee, he was \nfully aware that you can't do that work without the very best staff. He \nretained and added to the fine staff, and, as a consequence, the work \nand combat of budgeting was done in a professional manner, in a manner \nclearly calculated to present the facts and the truth.\n\n  Obviously, he has been a leader in budget matters, a strong Senator \nin\n\n[[Page S12178]]\n\nfavor of fiscal control. While we may differ, there is no question that \nin my chairmanship and his ranking membership of that committee, we \nclearly set the tone for the country that a balanced budget was \nabsolutely necessary for the future of our children and our country. He \nhas gained expertise, obviously, in some special areas of armed \nservices, for which I commend him. Those who are in agriculture and \nfarming in his State know how hard he worked to maintain the right \nthings, as he saw them, for that part of America's marketplace mix. \nMuch of that was directed at his State, but it helped many farmers \neverywhere.\n\n\n                         Senator Howell Heflin\n\n  Mr. President, I have just a few remarks about the distinguished \nSenator, Senator Heflin. I think we all know this Senator came here as \na renowned judicial reformist from his State, where he presided in a \nmasterful way over reorganizing the judicial system and putting honesty \nand integrity back front and center in that system in Alabama. He \nbrought to us his very sharp mind on legal matters, and he has been \nconsistently well-prepared on a wide diversity of issues, for which he \nwill be remembered as much for the clarity of purpose and the clarity \nof expression as for the issues themselves.\n  He also deserves our accolades, because anybody who chairs the Ethics \nCommittee of the U.S. Senate for any sustained period of time deserves \nour highest esteem. Not only did he do that, but he did it during the \nmost difficult of modern times in terms of that Ethics Committee. I \nbelieve the matters before him took a long time because of their \ncomplexity and personal nature, but things came out fairly well. I \nbelieve he is entitled to a great deal of respect for that.\n\n\n                          Senator David Pryor\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say a few words about a Senator on the other \nside of the aisle, Senator Pryor. Let me just say that this Senator, as \nI view it, has been a marvelous, quiet, strong advocate for the issues \nthat concern him. Whether it was the Taxpayers Bill of Rights, which he \nproposed, or whether it was his advocacy for small business, he \nobviously did it with a kind of calm and calmness that many of us wish \nwe could have every day we come to the floor of the Senate.\n  I also want to commend him, because it fell to him--and I assume it \nwas with relish on his part--to be the principal defender in many \ninstances of the current occupant of the White House, President Bill \nClinton. They are from the same State. Senator Pryor had been Governor, \nas had Senator Bumpers, of that State. I think his efforts to support \nthe President and fellow Arkansas resident was done eloquently and \narticulately. But I also believe that he had the ability to do that, \nwhich puts him in an extremely partisan mode, without ruffling the \nfeathers of those of us on this side of the aisle because of the way he \ndid it. It seems to me that he added some great character to his \npersonality, because he did it in a way that was not intended to offend \nus on this side of the aisle, and he did it in great, good spirit. I \ncommend him for that. He had a heart attack and came close to death in \nthat episode. He brought a great deal of calmness to all of us, as he \nshared going through the rigors of that incident. I thank him for the \npersonal way he has affected all of us in a positive manner.\n\n\n                          Senator Alan Simpson\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about Senator Simpson. \nI don't know what we can say to label him. We all, in a very strange \nway, sort of smile when we think of Senator Simpson. I guess it is fair \nto say that he is our cowboy philosopher. He has educated and delighted \nthe Members of this Chamber with his unmatched sense of humor and his \nsharp wit, with his fine mind and his broad knowledge.\n  He has helped lead the charge in so many areas that are so \ndesperately in need of reform. While he didn't yet accomplish his goal \nof reforming the entitlement programs of this country, it is clear that \nhe never backed away from calling things exactly as he saw them, \nwhether or not that would lead to his adulation or to, as he has \nindicated to many of us, clamor by many, or to being chastised by many \ngroups because of the way he presented issues, which was in the \nforthright manner that he believed in.\n  He took a lead in such matters as immigration reform. I think it is \nfair to say we would not have major immigration reform signed into law \nby this President but for this Senator. He was courageous in that \nregard, and he will be very much missed.\n  There will be a few Senators whom I will mention before we adjourn. I \nwill try to find time without burdening the Senate. At a time when \nperhaps there is nothing else to do, I will try to find another 15 or \n20 minutes to comment on a few other Members. Those I have commented on \nand talked about will be missed. I trust that we will all get to see \neach other again, and frequently. But I understand that may not be the \ncase, for as you leave the Senate, sometimes you don't see each other \nfor years. We will miss them dearly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12177-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12178-S12191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued to consider the conference report.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take the bulk of my time to \ntalk about really the underlying fundamental issue, which is how we are \ngoing to treat working families, because we have heard a great deal \nabout technical amendments, nontechnical amendments, holdings, \ncommittee reports, and all of the others. I will just reference some of \nthose items very, very quickly and then get to what I think is really \nthe fundamental issue. That is the issue of fairness. Are we, by the \naction that has been included in the legislation, really denying some \nfundamental justice to scores of American workers who have been playing \nby the rules and believe that they ought to have their rights \nconsidered and adjudicated under the National Labor Relations Act, a \nprocess and procedure which is being considered at this very time?\n  Mr. President, just to reiterate the points that have been made by \nSenator Feingold, Senator Murray, Senator Simon yesterday, and others, \nall of us are for the FAA conference report--without this particular \nprovision. We were prepared to offer the FAA conference report without \nthis provision as an amendment to the continuing resolution and do it \nwithin a 5- or 10-minute time limit. That would have been over and been \naccepted in the House of Representatives, and we would not be here this \nafternoon discussing this particular amendment. Or we could follow \nanother procedure by just calling a clean bill up from the calendar \nthis afternoon and acting on that this afternoon and doing that by \nvoice vote, and our colleagues and friends would not have to \ninconvenience themselves by being here tomorrow.\n  There is a question then about whether the House would accept it or \nnot. But the precedent is quite clear that the House has taken \nfavorable action in such situations in the past and are still acting on \nsome measures, even as we are here.\n  There is really very little reason to doubt that they would accept \nit, particularly when you look back over the debate and discussion in \nthe House of Representatives when they were considering the FAA \nconference report.\n  So that is where we are, Mr. President, and that is why we continue \nto maintain that it is those who are continually committed to this \nprovision who are the ones that are really holding up the Senate. It is \nnot those of us who want to move along into other endeavors but feel \ncompelled to protect the rights of working families to make this case.\n  Mr. President, just very briefly, the National Mediation Board has \nruled 12 times since 1978 on cases involving Federal Express. There has \nbeen a discussion of that by my friends and colleagues, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina and others. These cases involve requests for union \nelections, unfair labor practice charges, and other labor-management \nissues. In one case involving the Airline Pilots Association, the\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\ncourt Board found that FedEx had engaged in unfair labor practices that \ntainted the election so badly that a new election was ordered.\n  In all 12 of these cases the National Mediation Board exercised its \njurisdiction over Federal Express as an airline. Federal Express argued \nover and over to the National Mediation Board that it was an express \ncompany too. The National Mediation Board ignored this argument every \nsingle time. No court or board has ever held Federal Express is an \nexpress company under the Railway Act.\n  That is the statement I made yesterday. Individuals can quote various \ncases and draw various conclusions. But those statements remain \nuncontroverted.\n  Mr. President, just again very briefly, was this really an oversight, \nor was this just a technical question? If we accept the arguments that \nhave been made by my friend and colleague from South Carolina--he \ninterprets the cases favorably to Federal Express, and states that the \nNational Mediation Board ruled that all of its trucking operations \nwould be considered under the Railway Labor Act, there is no real \nreason why we have to even be in the situation that we are in. You \ncan't have it both ways. You can't say they have all ruled in all of \nthese cases to include it and, therefore, they would achieve what \nFederal Express wants to achieve, and that is to get all of their \ntrucking operations under the coverage of the Railway Act so that there \nwill not be the possibility of the workers to get together to pursue \ntheir grievances. We are not under any illusion--and nobody should be--\nabout exactly what the issue is really all about. So if it is, as the \nSenator said, they should not really need this measure. But, \nnonetheless, they have fought tooth and nail, tooth and nail in order \nto get it, which basically sustains the point that I have made.\n  How did we come to this situation? I refer just to the ICC \nTermination Act of 1995. That act struck the term ``express company'' \nfrom the Interstate Commerce Act. In the conference report, by Senate \namendment it said ``Outdated references to express and sleeping car \ncarriers, which no longer exist, would be removed.'' A conforming \namendment struck the same term from the Railway Labor Act.\n  This is the conforming measure in the ICC Termination Act. You have \nit specifically in the legislation, and specifically in the conference \nreport. And that conference report was signed by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hollings, and many others.\n  So it is difficult again for us to perceive that this was somehow \njust a hyphen that was overlooked. Those are the facts. There may be \ndifferent conclusions drawn from this fact. But, nonetheless, that is \nso.\n  Mr. President, the fact remains that when we asked an independent \nreview board to review and evaluate whether this was a technical \ncorrection, or whether it was a substantive correction, the \nCongressional Research Service reviewed the history, reviewed the \nlegislative history, reviewed the various documents, and indicated that \nit was not. It was a substantive issue. I know the Senator from South \nCarolina is unwilling to accept the Congressional Research Service's \nindependence in its review of this and its conclusion. But, \nnonetheless, they have found and supported the same position that I \nhave taken. Senator Feingold, Senator Murray, Senator Simon, and I have \nnot taken the position of the Senator from South Carolina. I can \nunderstand why he differs with it. But, nonetheless, the Congressional \nResearch Service again supports our position.\n\n  If you review what the debate was over in the House of \nRepresentatives--where the members of the House Transportation \nCommittee and Aviation Subcommittee, Democratic members, indicate very \ncompellingly their view--they never viewed this as a technical \namendment. And, as a matter of fact, the House Parliamentarian ruled it \nwas outside of the scope of the conference itself because it was \nnontechnical and required an independent vote. The House \nParliamentarian is not under the purview nor under the control of the \nSenator from Massachusetts, nor our other colleagues. He made a \njudgment that it was outside of the scope of it and required the House \nof Representatives to vote on it. Virtually all of the Democrats voted \nin opposition--30 Republicans voted in opposition, and 15 Democrats \nvoted in favor of it.\n  So, I took time yesterday to review the relevant statements of the \nmembers of the House Transportation and Aviation Committee that made \ncomments on this, that are basically in support of the Congressional \nResearch Service and others that this is not a technical correction. It \nis an effort by Federal Express to have this growing operation of the \nutilization of trucks considered under the Railway Labor Act, and \nthereby be able to have a competitive advantage over any of their \ncompetitors. Make no mistake about it. This provision is only for one \ncompany.\n  I mean the idea that we are making a technical correction out here \nlike it was generic and it was going to apply to a whole class defies \nany kind of logic, or understanding, or truthfulness, as has been used \nhere on the floor of the Senate. It only affects one company; and that \nis Federal Express.\n  So, let us try to at least not to misrepresent exactly what the \nsignificance of all of this is. The reason for that is Federal Express \ncurrently has 560 aircraft, and 37,000 vehicles, according to the \nfiscal year 1997 earnings statement, Federal Express makes no secret of \nits plans to increase its trucking-only operation.\n  In May 1996, a top Federal Express official told a House staffer \npreparing a paper on Federal Express for a graduate school course that \nFedEx's ultimate goal is to send 80 percent of its packages by truck. \nIn the future, according to this Federal Express official, only \novernight packages traveling more than 400 miles will be flown, and all \nothers will travel on the road.\n  So this business shift is the real reason Federal Express wants \n``express company'' reinserted in the Railway Act.\n  To date, Federal Express has successfully argued that the Railway Act \napplies because the company is an airline. But, as Federal Express \nlooks less and less like an airline and more and more like a trucking \ncompany, its argument that the Railway Labor Act applies becomes much \nweaker.\n  That is what this is all about. Those facts have never been really \ndisputed or argued with, and that is because this is the essence of \nwhat this whole special interest provision is all about. Federal \nExpress wants assurance that its workers will forever be covered by the \nRailway Labor Act, thus requiring nationwide bargaining units and \nmaking union organizing far more difficult. If ``express company'' is \nreinserted in the Railway Labor Act, Federal Express can argue in the \nfuture that its trucking operations qualify and, therefore, block its \nemployees' efforts to organize.\n  Mr. President, that, all respects to the contrary, I think is the \nfair representation as to the reasons that we are here and why this \nparticular provision has been put into this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have here the letter from the Executive Office of \nthe President, the Office of Management and Budget. I will include the \nwhole letter in the Record.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the whole letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's position on the conference report to H.R. \n     3539, the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996.\n       Let me begin by stating that there are many positive \n     aspects of the conference report including many vital \n     provisions which we strongly support. The bill authorizes \n     Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) programs, including \n     the Airport Improvement Program, which enables the award of \n     critical safety, security, and capacity expansion grants to \n     airports throughout the country. H.R. 3539 also includes \n     several important aviation safety and security initiatives, \n     including many recommended by the Vice President's Commission \n     on Aviation Safety and Security. In addition, the bill \n     provides for many important reforms to the FAA that will \n     enhance air travel safety\n       Unfortunately, the conferees to this bill also added a new \n     controversial provision which would reinstate coverage of \n     ``express companies'' under the Railway Labor Act.\n\n[[Page S12180]]\n\n     The provision appeared in neither bill and was agreed to \n     without hearing or public debate. Congress deleted express \n     companies from the scope of the Railway Labor Act last year \n     in the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination At (P.L. \n     104-88) believing that the last express company went out of \n     existence years ago.\n       The Administration believes that the provision is not a \n     ``technical amendment'' to transportation labor law. In fact, \n     it could result in a significant shift of the relationship \n     between certain workers and management. We hope Congress will \n     not jeopardize aviation safety, security, and investment \n     initiatives as it comes to closure on this issue.\n       Accordingly, the Administration opposes inclusion of this \n     extraneous ``express company'' language in H.R. 3539, and \n     urges the Senate to complete action on this important \n     authorization bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just review it very quickly.\n\n       I am writing to express the administration's position on \n     the conference report on the Federal aviation authorization.\n       There are many positive aspects of the conference report, \n     including vital provisions, which we strongly support. The \n     bill authorizes the Federal Aviation Administration's \n     program, including the Airport Improvement Program, which \n     enables the award of critical safety and security capacity \n     expansion granted to the airports throughout the country.\n       H.R. 3539 also includes several important aviation security \n     initiatives including many recommended by the Vice \n     President's Commission on Aviation Safety and Security. In \n     addition, the bill provides for many important reforms to the \n     FAA that will enhance air travel safety.\n       Unfortunately, the conferees to this bill also added a new \n     controversial provision which would reinstate the coverage of \n     ``express companies'' under the Railway Labor Act. The \n     provision appeared in neither bill and was agreed to without \n     hearing or public debate. Congress deleted express companies \n     from the scope of the Railway Labor Act last year in the \n     Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act believing that \n     the last express company went out of existence years ago.\n\n  That is the REA.\n\n       The administration believes that the provision is not a \n     technical amendment--\n\n  I will stress, ``not a technical amendment.'' ``Not a technical \namendment.''\n\n     to transportation labor law. In fact, it could result in a \n     significant shift of the relationship between certain workers \n     and management. We hope Congress will not jeopardize aviation \n     safety, security and investment initiatives as it comes to \n     closure on this issue.\n       Accordingly, the Administration opposes inclusion of this \n     extraneous ``express company'' language in H.R. 3539, and \n     urges the Senate to complete action on this important bill.\n\n  Mr. President, there you have it as well. They understand us. I do \nnot know how much more we have to do. I do not think much more because \nanybody who has followed this discussion or debate can see and \nunderstand very clearly that this is not a technical amendment. Here it \nis in the administration's review, Congressional Research Service \nindependent review, members of the various committees who understand \nthe history and the background of this review, that it is substantive, \nand as the administration's own letter points out, ``the provision is \nnot a technical amendment to transportation. In fact, it could result \nin a significant shift in the relationship between certain workers and \nmanagement.''\n  That is the issue. That states the issue. It affects the relationship \nbetween workers and management. Now, let us get to what that really \nmeans in terms of the workers and the management.\n  Mr. President, I regret very much that we are facing the impasse, but \nan important issue of principle is at stake--whether a large and \npowerful corporation can abuse its power and misuse its influence and \nobtain an unjustified benefit that flagrantly undermines the basic \nrights of employees. Let us get to the real issue, and that is the \nrights of working families. That is what is at stake, the rights of \nthese workers' families who have pursued their interests under what \nthey believed would be the law under the National Labor Relations Act, \nand that is the trucking operations would be under the National Labor \nRelations Act. They have not been able to get the final judgment and \ndecision but the matter is in litigation. They believed they would be \nunder that National Labor Relations Act. I think any fair evaluation, \nlooking at UPS and other examples of holdings, would say they would.\n  Now, the issue at stake here has nothing to do with aviation \nsecurity. It has everything to do with special interest legislation of \nthe worst kind. The Senate Republican leadership is cynically using the \naviation bill to conceal their antiworker payoff to the Federal Express \nCorp. The delay in the vote gives us time to shine the spotlight of \npublic opinion on this unacceptable antilabor rider. I am optimistic \nthat in the coming days we can succeed in passing a clean aviation bill \nwithout the Republican personal interest provision. That provision is \ndesigned solely to deny employees of a single corporation their right \nto join a union.\n  Truck drivers employed by the Federal Express Co. in Pennsylvania \nbegan organizing a union because they had not received a raise in more \nthan 7 years. It is unconscionable for the Senate to intervene on the \nside of management to deny those men and women their rights.\n\n  Federal Express is a company that has grown rapidly in the past 20 \nyears. The original motto of the company was, ``People, Service and \nProfit.'' But as the company grew the rank and file men and women who \ncontributed so much to the growth of the company found that they were \nbeing left further and further behind.\n  In 1991, truck drivers at Federal Express in Pennsylvania began \norganizing to address the same economic issues that face most working \nfamilies. Not only had Federal Express truck drivers been denied a pay \nincrease for over 7 years but the drivers also were concerned about \ncompany decisions subcontracting their routes, hiring temporary drivers \ninstead of full-time regular employees, and reducing their hours on the \njob.\n  The organizing effort started with a group of 12 employees in \nPennsylvania. After months of preparation, the workers filed a petition \nwith the National Labor Relations Board for an election to form a union \nof 1,200 truck drivers in Federal Express' Liberty District in \nPennsylvania.\n  The corporation, with its intense antiunion bias, has used legal \nmaneuvers ever since to block those employees' efforts, and 1,200 truck \ndrivers still have not been granted a chance to vote on whether to have \nunion representation. Federal Express' delay has not cooled the \ndrivers' commitment to work together to improve their conditions of \nwork. In fact, more and more Federal Express employees are standing \ntogether and standing up to management. Employees are organizing not \njust in Pennsylvania but in 48 other States as well.\n  Now in desperation Federal Express has come crying to Congress to \nobtain this special interest rider to block their employees' efforts.\n  Now, who are these workers? Let me tell about some of the people at \nFederal Express, people who have worked hard year after year, people \nwho want nothing more than to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. They are loyal workers. They are proud of Federal Express and \nthe work they have done to build the company into a national powerhouse \nbut they want to join together to better themselves. They want a voice. \nThey want the ability to organize and address issues that are of \nconcern to them.\n  Let me tell you about some of them. We heard from Leanna Cochran, \nfrom Indiana, who worked for Federal Express for 14 years as a courier, \ntruck dispatcher and, in her own words, ``anything else that needed to \nbe done.''\n  When she joined there were 80 employees in the area. Now there are \n4,000. She told us how proud she was to wear the uniform.\n\n       We dedicated our lives to making Federal Express what it \n     is. In the late 1980's, I often worked over 100 hours per \n     week. My friends say I have purple blood.\n\n  Meaning the symbolic color of the Federal Express.\n\n       My friends say I have purple blood. Now there is no \n     overtime because the company is contracting out more and more \n     of its work. As Federal Express grew, management stopped \n     caring about the people. The company's President, Fred Smith, \n     has said there will never be a general pay increase in \n     Federal Express, only performance standards that are \n     impossible to meet. Even Fred Smith could not meet them.\n\n  Joe Carney, a tractor-trailer driver at Philadelphia station for 16 \nyears, is 1 of the 12 original employees who met in 1991 to try to \nstart a union.\n\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\n\n       I've always given 150 percent of my effort loyally to the \n     company, and I still am. I'm a team player, but I feel \n     strongly that we need to have a union to help the workers. As \n     a senior employee, I've seen my wages, benefits and other \n     conditions steadily erode. At one point I didn't have a raise \n     for nearly 7 years.\n\n  He explained that Federal Express' success, growing from 5 to 17 \ntruck terminals in the Philadelphia area while he has worked there, has \nnot translated to better wages or job security for the workers.\n\n       We are all dismayed by what is happening in Congress. It's \n     difficult for us to understand why any Senator would support \n     a special interest provision for Federal Express that will \n     undermine our efforts to get a union or try and build a \n     better life for ourselves and our families.\n\n  Elizabeth Tucker, 42 years old, has been paying taxes for 24 years. \nShe is a Vietnam era veteran. She enlisted in 1973. She served her \ncountry. She was a married mom for a number of years but was divorced \nand had to go to work to support herself and her 10-year-old daughter. \nShe took a job at Federal Express in 1987. She started as a package \nhandler, then a service agent, then become a truck driver, which she is \ntoday--a hard working, loyal employee since she started.\n  Last year, her mother was diagnosed with cancer. She asked the \ncompany to work with her so the family could help her mother with \ncancer treatments. She asked to use all of her own time, her vacation \ntime, and her personal time to arrange her schedule with her sister and \nfour brothers so that their mother would not have to go through the \ncancer treatment alone. Federal Express told her she could use her own \ntime and arrange it with her sister and brothers so that they could \ntake care of her mother.\n  They all arranged their schedules to take care of their mother, but 7 \ndays before she was to take the time off to take care of her mother, \nFederal Express said they were not going to honor their agreement with \nher, they were not going to let her take the time off to take care of \nher mother. She had to rearrange everything with her sister and \nbrothers so that their mother did not have to undergo cancer treatment \nby herself. To make matters worse, her daughter had recently had an \ninfectious intestinal disease which required her to take time off to \ncare for her. She was also exposed to the disease and therefore could \nhave been contagious.\n  What did Federal Express do? Just before they finally agreed to let \nher go to take care of her mother, they gave her a disciplinary letter \ndue to her absenteeism--because she missed work because she and her \ndaughter were sick. Imagine the stress. Her mother has cancer, her \ndaughter is sick, all she wants to do is use her own time to take care \nof her mother. Her employer finally lets her, but sticks a disciplinary \nletter in her hand.\n  Her job is stressful also. Her truck has to make 100 stops a day. \nFederal Express gives a money-back guarantee if a package is not \ndelivered before 10:30 a.m. Drivers are required to deliver packages \nwithin 3 minutes of each other during the morning. From the time they \nhand one customer a package they only have 3 minutes to get the next \npackage delivered. This is not only stressful, but raises serious, \nserious safety issues because it requires the drivers to drive as fast \nas possible to get to the next stop. If drivers take more time than the \ncompany requires, they can be denied performance pay, or get a letter \nthat they are not working up to par--or it could lead to a disciplinary \nletter. The pressure is intense.\n  The company has asked drivers to shorten their time between \ndeliveries and asked for them to get there at 90 percent of the time \nthey had last year, and are asking for it to be done in only 87 percent \nof the time this year. They can only drive so fast.\n  Elizabeth Tucker has been working hard for Federal Express, driving \nand meeting the demands of her employer for many years now. She is \ntrying to meet her family needs also. She is doing her best.\n  Bill Chapin lives in Indianapolis, has a wife and two children, a boy \nand a girl; he served 6 years in the Navy, enlisted. He is a Vietnam-\nera veteran. He has been working for Federal Express for 13 years as a \ntruck driver; works with another 125 truck drivers at his shop. He is \nvery proud of his work. He worked 96 hours one week, did everything to \nbuild the company, did everything he was asked to do, did whatever it \ntook to get the job done. ``Now the focus is all on profits, not \npeople,'' he says. ``They have been reducing the hours, hiring more and \nmore part-time and temporary employees. No pay raise for many years.''\n  But pay is not the only issue. Bill was chairman of the safety \ncommittee in his shop, and there were numerous workplace injuries and \naccidents. Most of these resulted from the requirement to meet very, \nvery strict time deadlines. People injured themselves trying to meet \nthese deadlines. People also got into car accidents trying to meet the \ndeadlines.\n  Bill talked about the danger created by drivers who had to make the \n10:30 money-back deadline. He said that from 10:15 to 10:30 every \nmorning, people's lives are in danger as drivers go as fast as possible \nto meet the deadline. He said if a driver is late, he could get written \nup or he could lose his job. These drivers have families. They cannot \nafford to lose their jobs.\n  Unfortunately, that means people get injured, and it means that there \nare truck accidents. Bill heard about these at the safety committee \nmeetings he attended. He remembered one meeting in particular, in 1993, \nwhen a truck driver in Chicago was trying to meet a 10:30 deadline. It \nwas about 10:28 or 10:29 and the driver was trying to find the address \nof his next stop and did not see a 70-year-old woman crossing the road, \nand the driver hit her.\n  After listening to this report at a safety meeting, Bill quit the \ncommittee. Pay is important and Bill wants better pay and benefits, but \nBill also wants a safe workplace and wants a voice to talk about these \nissues. He wants to organize. He served his country in the Navy. He is \na good and loyal employee. He has worked hard to support his family. He \njust does not understand why the U.S. Senate would help his employer \nprevent him from joining with his fellow workers.\n  Ros Ranamon has a wife and a 21-month-old daughter. He is a truck \ndriver in Washington, DC. He works with 300 other truck drivers, and \nhas been with Federal Express since 1992, but he is considered a senior \nemployee because the turnover is so high. He started as a part-time \nemployee with Federal Express. When he was part-time, he was sick with \nthe chicken pox, but the company had no disability benefits for part-\ntime employees. He had only 5 sick days. After they started to organize \nin the company, the company began a part-time disability program for \nits part-time employees.\n\n  So it is not just pay. Sure, pay is important, and he would like \nbetter pay. But the employees need better benefits also.\n  There are other parts of the job that they need to organize for. For \nexample, the company requires them to take a job knowledge test every 6 \nmonths. If you fail the test you could lose your performance pay. You \nget written up or lose your job, but no employee has a right to see the \ntests or the answers. Some were told they failed the test and would \nsuffer the consequences, but they found out the test scoring system did \nnot always work right. Sometimes it failed people who passed the test. \nHe just works hard to raise his family. He is just trying to make a \ndecent wage. He is just looking for fair treatment.\n  Ros Ranamon talked about how Federal Express gives all its employees \nnice, sharp uniforms, but employees' pockets are empty. They just do \nnot give the employees raises, not until some of the employees tried to \norganize a union.\n  These workers, and thousands more like them, deserve better.\n  We had these people who commented today in our committee room, and \nbehind them another 20, from Federal Express. These are individuals who \nneed those jobs, and talked about their own personal experience. They \ntalked about the sickness and illness of members of their family, about \ntheir children. It is a very difficult thing to do.\n  They were willing to share that. Frankly, it takes a good deal of \npolitical and moral courage, because there is no question that those \nindividuals are going to be targeted. I hope not. I hope I am wrong. We \nwill watch very closely those workers who are loyal, dedicated to \nFederal Express, each and every one of them. They indicated dedication \nto Federal Express, but that they wanted fairness and decency in the \nworkplace\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\nto deal with some of these grievances. They wanted at least the \nopportunity to be able to see if they could convince other members to \nbe able to join a union.\n  Maybe they could not, but they were trying to play by the rules of \nthe game that are defined under the National Labor Relations Act. Their \ncase is moving ahead since 1991.\n  But after this amendment that we are talking about here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate, effectively you are wiping out their efforts to \nplay by the rules. Men and women who have served in Vietnam, have been \nworking since childhood, who have children of their own, playing by the \nrules--but, nonetheless, the big company comes in, planning to expand \nits trucking operation, trying to get an inside deal, trying to get an \ninside advantage. One company benefits and its name is Federal Express, \nand we are being asked to go ahead and continue with that, which is no \nmore technical than a man in the moon.\n  CRS recognizes it, the administration recognizes it, the House \nMembers who are members of this committee recognize it. And any fair \nreading of the history of this measure and the actions that were taken \nwould understand that as well.\n  These workers, and thousands more like them, deserve better. They \ndeserve the right to decide for themselves whether and how they want to \norganize and deal with their employer. They should be allowed to join \nwith other Federal employees in their area to form a union to protect \ntheir interests. There is no reason whatever for Congress to intervene \non the side of management to block that effort.\n  Make no mistake about it, that is what this is about, tilting the \nscales for management. That is what the purpose is, to give them a leg \nup against those workers. Federal Express is determined to deny these \nPennsylvania workers and other groups of employees in other States \nacross the country the right to organize on a local basis. That is what \nthis antiworker rider is all about.\n  So, I say: Shame on Federal Express for their pursuing this, and on \nour Members of Congress, in the final hours, for including it. Let us \nfight to reject cloture and reject this special interest rider, and \npermit employees of this company to decide for themselves whether and \nhow to bargain with their employer.\n  The aviation bill will pass in a second once this antilabor rider is \nremoved. There is no threat whatever to the aviation bill. The \nRepublican Senate is knee deep in Republican hypocrisy as Republican \nSenators talk about the importance of the aviation bill. We all agree \non its importance.\n  What we don't agree on is that this bill should be used by the \nRepublican leadership in the House and the Senate to sneak through into \nlaw a special interest antiwork payoff to Federal Express at the \nexpense of the corporation's deserving, long-suffering employees.\n  Few things more vividly illustrate the antiworker bias of the \nRepublican Congress than this shameful antiworker rider. Republicans \nsay, ``Who cares about a handful of truck drivers in Pennsylvania?''\n  We reply, ``We do. Democrats do. Democrats are on their side.''\n  We make no apology fighting for them against this shameful Republican \nmaneuver. Those Pennsylvania workers are a symbol of what is wrong with \nthis Republican Congress. A farewell gesture by the Republican-\ncontrolled Congress as we adjourn for the election is to try to enact a \nlaw, one more in their long line of antiworker proposals. The American \npeople understand what happens here. There will be two votes on this \nissue: one is on Thursday in the Senate, and another on election day in \ncommunities across this country.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned, these will be the final actions that \nwill be taken by the Congress, and in thinking about this particular \nmeasure and listening to those who hold a different position, I was \nthinking back over the period of the last 2 years and what has been the \nrecord with regard to working families by the leadership in the House \nand Senate of the United States.\n  I step back to the early part of this Congress, to the period in \nFebruary and March of a year ago, and see one of the first actions that \nwas being put forward in the Congress and the Senate of the United \nStates was the repeal of what we call the Davis-Bacon Act. That is to \nuse a prevailing wage, whatever the average wage is in a particular \nlabor market area, on the building of Federal construction, so that the \nfact the United States is contracting in a particular geographic area \nwill not either raise or depress the wages of working families. That \napplies to the construction industry, which is the second most \ndangerous industry--mining, No. 1, construction, No. 2.\n  The average wage across the country and in my State of Massachusetts \nunder the Davis-Bacon work for construction workers is $27,500--\n$27,500. I was asking myself, what do our Republican friends have \nagainst workers who are working in one of the most dangerous \noccupations making $27,500, individuals who have acquired skills, have \ngone through various training programs? What is it about those workers, \ngiven the range of different challenges that we are facing in this \ncountry, what is it about those workers in the construction industry \nthat we are going to say, ``We're going to undermine and we're going to \nmake sure they are not even going to average $27,500.''\n  Nonetheless, that effort was made not just once, not just twice, not \njust three times, but on a whole series of pieces of legislation. They \nadded the repeal of Davis-Bacon to the National Highway System, and we \nblocked that. Then they tried to include the repeal of Davis-Bacon in \ntheir budget bill in 1995, but, once again, we forced them to remove \nit.\n  Time in and time out, not just to raise this issue and let the Senate \njudge it and then say, ``All right, so the decision has been made that \nwe are not going to repeal it,'' but relentless--relentless--to try to \nundermine working families that are going to make $27,500 in the \nconstruction industry.\n  So we said, ``All right, that is just the beginning. That is just the \nfirst program.'' But it was just about that time that we had the \nRepublican budget, and the Republican budget was going to provide over \na 10-year period an additional $4 trillion for what would be considered \ncorporations and individual tax benefits. There was only going to be \none area where there were going to be tax increases--$4 trillion for \ncompanies and the wealthiest individuals, but only $20 billion of \nraising the taxes.\n  One could say, ``Look, out of all of those tax loopholes, certainly \nwe ought to be able to find $20 billion in there.'' I can think of \nseveral of them. They come to mind now about the issues of deferral or \ntitle transfer, and other items, which are just gimmicks which work to \nan unfair advantage for those who take advantage of them.\n\n  We thought we might be able to recover the $20 billion. The answer to \nthat was no. The Republican leadership wanted to increase the taxes on \nworking families, again, by reducing the earned income tax credit. Who \nbenefits from the earned income tax credit? Workers who make below \n$28,000 who have children. They are the principal beneficiaries. As the \nincome goes down, they are able to participate in the program, and it \nis actually phased out at about $30,000. Here we have a $20 billion tax \nincrease on working families that are below the $30,000.\n  Cutting back on construction workers, cutting back on workers who \nhave children with the earned income tax credit.\n  Mr. President, it did not take long right after that when I, Senator \nDaschle, and a number of our colleagues--my colleague, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Levin, and many others--introduced an \nincrease in the minimum wage for working families, for individuals who \nwork 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year.\n  Since the late 1930's, Republicans and Democrats have come together \nto make sure those people who are going to work are going to be able to \nacquire sufficient income so they do not live in poverty. We were going \nto honor work in America.\n  In 1980, a family of three was at the poverty line. But over the last \n5 years, we have lost the purchasing power. It is at a 40-year low. All \nwe wanted to do was to try and bring that purchasing power just about \nclose to what the poverty line would be for a family of three.\n  All we found out was the strong opposition of the Republican \nleadership.\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\n This is what House Majority Leader Dick Armey said on January 24, \n1995:\n\n       I will resist any increase in the minimum wage with every \n     fiber in my being.\n\n  This is what the Republican whip, Tom DeLay, said:\n\n       Working families trying to get by on $4.25 an hour don't \n     really exist.\n\n  Well, Mr. DeLay, why don't you talk to the approximately 4 million \nfamilies that got the 50-cent addition yesterday?\n  The increase in the minimum wage is a woman's issue. Sixty-six \npercent of those who get the increase in the minimum wage are women. It \nis a children's issue, because of the millions of children living in \nfamilies that are dependent on that increase in the minimum wage. It is \nan adult issue. Seventy-seven percent of those who receive it are \nadults.\n  Mr. President, not according to our Republican leadership. Here is \nour Republican conference chairman, John Boehner:\n\n       I'll commit suicide before I vote on a clean minimum wage \n     bill.\n\n  And so they went on, refusing to permit at least our committee to \nhave a hearing on the increase in the minimum wage so we could review \nwhether it is inflationary or whether there is going to be a job loss. \nImportant studies indicate in a number of instances an expansion of the \njob market, because more people, who had gotten out of the job market, \nwill come back because they want to participate because they think it \nis well worth their efforts to work at that figure. We wanted to have a \nhearing to put some of those issues to rest, but we were denied even an \nopportunity to have the hearing.\n  Then we came to the floor, and time in and time out, the Republican \nleader, Senator Dole, resisted every single effort that we made in \norder to get a minimum wage increase scheduled on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate and went to extraordinary heights to make sure we were not going \nto get it.\n  We finally did get it, and after we got it, what did the Republican \nleadership try to do? Tried to reduce it, No. 1, and delay its \nimplementation, No. 2. It was supposed to go into effect July of this \nlast year. It went in effect in October. There were talks about trying \nto do it in mid-January or February.\n\n  You know, the interesting reason why it was that time was so that the \nlarge commercial stores could have the lower wages during the Christmas \nperiod. That was the reason. Thinking about working families? Thinking \nabout those people that are out there trying to make a living? That was \nthe position with regards to working families.\n  That is why, Mr. President, when we are coming with the last action \nof this legislation, many of us are not surprised of the virtual \nuniform support for this provision on the other side and the virtual \nRepublican unanimity in the House of Representatives. We have seen what \nthat record has been and what value they have placed on the interests \nand the grievances of working families--working families.\n  Another area, of course, that they have great interest in the working \nfamilies is the----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to continue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I think the Senator's time has expired some time ago.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked consent to be able to proceed, and I was granted \nconsent to be able to proceed.\n  Mr. STEVENS. When was that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. When I started.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't remember the Senator being granted extra time. I \nwas very indulgent. The Senator has been speaking for 40 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't believe it has been that long.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have not spoken on this issue now for 2 hours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was here at 2 o'clock. And we know, at least in the \nearlier time, you indicated that you were prepared to see that I was \ngoing to be able to be given time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is true.\n  Mr. President, isn't the Senator from Alaska entitled to half of his \ntime?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the regular order, Mr. President, to be able \nto proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is acting 10 \nminutes over his time. And I am not aware of the consent before I took \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, as we found out earlier in the \nafternoon--I mean, the Senator from Alaska has pointed out--my good \nfriend and colleague, Senator Hollings, spoke using other time \nyesterday, and using, allegedly, our time today under the \ninterpretation that was made on this. I had understood that I was going \nto be able to have the chance to speak. And I will ask for 10 more \nminutes to be able to conclude my remarks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not have any objection if the Senator wants \nadditional time, but I would like some time now. I mean, I thought this \nwas equally divided. The Senator has spoken for now almost an hour this \nafternoon. It is very interesting, a Democratic campaign speech, Mr. \nPresident. But I have not heard much about the bill before us for the \nlast 40 minutes.\n  So I do not have any problem giving the Senator extra time to speak \non the bill, but why should I listen to this bunch of stuff that is \ngoing on over here that is not true? We can speak all night and half \nrun the campaign from here. We are the only ones listening to the \ncampaign here. But I have been hearing about nothing but a bunch of \nstuff about taxes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If I could interject here, the Chair asks that \nMembers to address other Members through the Chair.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has made a request to be granted 10 \nmore minutes. Do I hear an objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object, unless after this Senator gets to use some of \nhis time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withdraw the request, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from ----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I asked earlier to be able to proceed without \ninterruption. I was granted recognition for that. I would ask, is the \nChair going to respect that or not going to respect it? I will be glad \nto abide by whatever the Chair says. I intend to sometime be able to \nmake this talk, whether it pleases the Senator from Alaska or not. I \nintend to make it. And I know that he might not want to hear it. But I \nwill be glad to do it at one time or the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from Alaska would withhold, the \nChair is not aware of any arrangements prior to my tenure in this \nchair. The Chair advises, the Senator from Massachusetts has gone 9 \nminutes over his time, and he has asked for 10 more minutes, and I did \nhear objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask to be added to the Senator's time that he has \npreviously been allowed such time as he seeks now, 10 minutes.\n  Is that what the Senator seeks?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am not making any--I will take my chances when I--I \nknow the rules of the Senate, and I will get a chance to speak tonight. \nI will take my chances and get the floor when I can.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is what I am afraid of.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is too bad.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no desire to be here all night because the \nSenator is piqued now.\n  I want to ask how much time he wants so we have some understanding. \nWe were supposed to have 3 hours equally divided. We had 3 hours \nequally divided. How much more time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Such time as I might use. And I yield the floor at the \npresent time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like in on this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nMassachusetts have completed, I think I ought to be able to answer the \ncharges about my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator seek now?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first, let me ask unanimous consent that \nthe time of the Senator from Massachusetts be extended for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S12184]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the sincerity of the Senator's inquiry on \nthis, but I will take--under the rules of the Senate, I will be able to \nget recognition at an appropriate time. I will take such time as I will \nuse. We were all set to have an hour and a half divided, as we did \nyesterday, Senator. We would have finished this whole debate at 5 \no'clock. And then we have had the jiggling of what I consider rules by \nskewing the time between those that either favor the amendment or not. \nI know the Senator has a different time. But since that has been the \ncase, I know my rights under the Senate rules. And at the appropriate \ntime I will regain the floor and complete my statement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I again read, ``on Wednesday, October 2, \nthere be 3 hours for debate only, to be equally divided between the two \nleaders.'' And we are trying to do that. I would be willing to, in view \nof the misunderstanding, to extend that time for the Senator from \nMassachusetts. But as I understand it, this is the only debate today. \nMaybe the Senator knows something I don't know. But at the present \ntime, the Senator from Massachusetts objects to the extension of time \nto meet his needs.\n\n  I will yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator withhold for just a minute?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let me try it this way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts be given the time following the time that the Senator \nfrom South Carolina has asked, equal to the time that the Senator from \nSouth Carolina uses--it's 24 minutes, I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yielded time to the Senator from South Carolina time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, aside from the procedure, the allocation \nof time where you can't even move at this particular point to satisfy \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, let me refer immediately \nto the chart that is behind the Senator.\n  As you know, irrespective of the time allocation, Mr. President, the \nsubject allocation was clear. And the subject allocation was an \namendment by the Senator from South Carolina governing Federal Express \nor express companies in the Federal Aviation Authorization Act.\n  And if the TV could go around, they could come right to this, ``Why? \nPay for tax cuts for the rich, help Republican special interests.'' \n``Republican attack on the middle class, slash Medicare, slash \neducation, slash college opportunities, slash wages for working \nfamilies.''\n  I think, Mr. President, of the octopus method of defense, whereby the \noctopus, once cornered, squirts out this dark ink around the waters and \nthen escapes within his own dark ink. I can tell you here and now by \nthe references of the--and I quote--``Republican special-interest \nprovision'' that nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  This Senator from South Carolina has been a Democrat since 1948.\n  I am not yielding to the Senator from Massachusetts on who is the \nDemocrat and what is the Democrat's proposal. I proposed this, I \nproposed it proudly, I proposed it fairly, and exactly as the Senators \nand House members on the committee, by a vote of 8-6, would have it \nproposed, and by a majority vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nand has been approved.\n  I am not coming here with this talk about the Republican special \ninterest provision, ``Shameful Republican maneuver.'' I put it in \nthere. Why is it important? To answer the question of the Senator from \nWisconsin, it is a matter of honor. We made the mistake. Federal \nExpress did not make a mistake. Federal Express did not ask for \nanything. I was told that we left out the reference ``express company'' \ninadvertently--not at the time we voted; it was after we voted. This \nparticular ICC Termination Act, back in December, and after it was \nvoted out, Mr. President, in the drafting of the final measure that we \nautomatically signed, it was eliminated as I related earlier.\n  To come up with an antiworker charge, an issue of fairness and \nfundamental justice and all of that--they are ready to vote everything \nelse. They are holding it up, after they moved to postpone, after they \nasked the entire report be read, and then make again the categorical \nstatement, ``No court has held Federal Express as an express company \nunder the Railway Labor Act.''\n  Well, we have some U.S. court decisions since commencing operations \n23 years ago, and I ask unanimous consent that this listing, Mr. \nPresident, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Federal Express Is Covered by the Railway Labor Act--The Technical \n                 Correction Does Not Change That Status\n\n       Since commencing operations 23 years ago, Federal Express \n     and its employees consistently have been determined by the \n     federal courts, the National Mediation Board and the National \n     Labor Relations Board to be subject to the RLA. See e.g., \n     Chicago Truck Driver, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union v. \n     National Mediation Board, 670 F.2d 665 (7th Cir. 1982), \n     Chicago Truck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union v. \n     National Labor Relations Board, 599 F.2d 816 (7th Cir. 1979); \n     Adams v.

Case No. 13-RC-\n     14490 (1977); Federal Express, N.L.R.B. Case No. 13-CA-30194 \n     (1991). The charges filed with Region 13 in Chicago, Case No. \n     13-CA-3019 and Region 1 in Boston, Case No. 1-CA-22,585 were \n     withdrawn after we presented the above evidence of our \n     jurisdictional status.\n       The National Mediation Board (NMET) recently ruled on \n     Federal Express RLA status by stating unequivocally that \n     ``Federal Express and all of its employees are subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act.'' Federal Express Corporation, 23 N.M.B. \n     32 (1995).\n       The term ``employer'' under the National Labor Relations \n     Act excludes ``...any person subject to the Railway Labor \n     Act:'' 29 U.S.C. Sec. 152 (2). Excluded from the definition \n     of ``employee'' under the National Labor Relations Act \n     is''...any individual employed by an employer subject to the \n     Railway Labor Act...'' 29 U.S.C.Sec. 152 (3). The Railway \n     Labor Act defines ``carrier'' as ``... (including) every \n     common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign \n     commerce...''45 U.S.C. Sec. 151, First and Sec. 181. Federal \n     Express is a common carrier by air engaged in interstate and \n     foreign commerce, and is certificated pursuant to Section 401 \n     of the Federal Aviation Act.\n       That interpretation of the statute consistently has been \n     applied by the NMB. Section 201 of the RLA, 45 U.S.C. Section \n     181, provides that the Act ``shall cover every common carrier \n     by air engaged in interstate and foreign commerce . . . and \n     every air pilot of other person who performs any work as an \n     employee or subordinated official of such carrier or \n     carriers, subject to its or their continuing authority to \n     supervise and direct the manner of rendition of his \n     service.'' (Emphasis added). In accordance with that \n     legislative directive, anyone employed by an air carrier \n     engaged in interstate or foreign commerce is covered by the \n     RLA. As was explained in REA Express, Inc., 4 N.M.B. 253, 269 \n     (1965):\n       ``It has been the Board's consistent position that the fact \n     of employment by a ``carrier'' is determinative of the status \n     of all that carrier's employees as subject to the Act. The \n     effort to carve out or separate the so-called over-the-road \n     drivers would be contrary to and do violence to a long line \n     of decisions by this Board which embrace the policy of \n     refraining from setting up a multiplicity of crafts or \n     classes. As stated above, there is no question that this \n     particular group are employees of the carrier.''\n       The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit noted in regard to the NMB's Federal Express \n     case that ``the NLRB had `never' asserted jurisdiction over'' \n     (Federal Express'.'' United Parcel Service,\n\n[[Page S12185]]\n\n     Inc., v. National Labor Relations Board. 92 F.3d 1221 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1996). Federal Express has participated in five union \n     representation elections conducted under the auspices of the \n     National Mediation Board, the most recent in 1995, and \n     presently is participating in a sixth RLA election.\n       The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in Federal Express Corp. \n     v. California Public Utilities Commission, 936 F.2d 1075, \n     1978 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, ______ U.S. ______, 119 \n     LEd.2d 578 (1992) found:\n       ``The trucking operations of Federal Express are integral \n     to its operation as an air carrier. The trucking operations \n     are not sonic separate business venture; they are part and \n     parcel of the air delivery system. Every truck carries \n     packages that are in interstate commerce by air. The use of \n     the trucks depends on the conditions of air delivery. The \n     timing of the trucks is meshed with the schedules of the \n     planes. Federal Express owes some of its success to its \n     effective use of trucking as part of its air carrier \n     service.''\n       That court also stated:\n       ``Federal Express is exactly the kind of an expedited all-\n     cargo service that Congress specified and the kind of \n     integrated transportation system that was federally desired. \n     Because it is an integrated system, it is a hybrid, an air \n     carrier employing trucks. Those trucks do not destroy its \n     status as an air carrier. They are an essential part of the \n     all-cargo air service that Federal Express innovatively \n     developed to meet the demands of an increasingly interlinked \n     nation.''\n       It clearly has been established that Federal Express is a \n     carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. Its employees are \n     likewise subject to the Railway Labor Act. No court or agency \n     has ever determined that Federal Express or any of its \n     employees are subject to the National Labor Relations Act.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, citing just a few, Chicago Truck Driver, \nHelpers and Warehouse Union, 670 F.2d 665 in the 7th circuit; Chicago \nTruck Drivers, Helpers and Warehouse Workers Union v. National Labor \nRelations Board, 599 F.2d 816. Go right on down the list, Adams v. \nFederal Express Corporation, 547 F.2d 319, Federal Express Corp. 22 \nN.M.B.--that is not the court decision, but I can continue to cite \nthem.\n  Court after court, board after board, and on the contrary, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts refuses to acknowledge the \ntruth, refuses to acknowledge that fact, and continually, the first \nday, yesterday, and now again today, stating, and I listened to him \nclearly, ``No court has held Federal Express as an express company \nunder the Railway Labor Act.''\n  Absolutely false. Mr. President, that is the whole point about the \nmodification here--this is a technical amendment. This is an important \namendment. It was an important error because it was very, very clear, \nthe intent, as I read from the ICC Termination Act of 1995 conference \nreport the following sentence: ``The enactment of the ICC Termination \nAct of 1995 shall neither expand nor contract coverage of employees and \nhelp employers by the Railway Labor Act.'' So they were covered at that \nparticular time. They were covered under a 5-year proceeding, under \nthat Philadelphia case, finally found unanimously on November 22, 1995, \nand we said our intent was not to change it. Through the drafting \nerror, we found out, months later, in 1996, that it was changed.\n  They do not ever ask and they do not want to find out. Mr. President, \nthere is a letter relative to the Office of Management and Budget. They \ngot a spurious one from the Congressional Research Service. Now, \nOctober 2, 1996, Franklin D. Raines says:\n\n       Congress deleted express companies from the scope of the \n     Railway Labor Act last year in the Interstate Commerce \n     Commission Termination Act believing that the last express \n     company went out of existence years ago.\n\n  Where did he get that? I was there. You were there. Come on. We said \nspecifically, ``The enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall \nnot expand nor contract coverage of employees and employers by the \nRailway Labor Act.''\n  So he never called me. I could have told him, as far as I know, it \nwas an innocent mistake. He says, ``This particular Hollings amendment \nand the FAA was agreed to without a hearing or public debate.'' Where \nwas the public debate? Where was the hearing? Where was the Members' \nknowledge? At least the Members know of my particular amendment. We \nnever knew of the dropping of the language there. So they want to get \nso official there ``that could result in a significant shift of the \nrelationship.''\n  Why do they not call you up and find out what really went on, and why \nthe positive interest? They continue to make these false statements. \nThe Railway Labor Act was not to be modified in any way and the board \nhas decided when they continue to say it has not decided, why it is as \nimportant a matter, I reiterate again and again, a personal matter with \nus and members of the committee that we would correct this. It is not \nfor any special interest corporation. Federal Express had nothing to do \nwith it when it was knocked out, and it certainly does not have \nanything to do with it other than trying to help me get some votes, I \nhope, now, but it is not being done for them; it is being done for our \nparticular consciences. Maybe some in the Senate do not have any \nconscience left anymore.\n  Mr. President, there was another point. They keep on talking, all \nthat about Davis-Bacon and minimum wage. I was going to come in and get \nthe good Government award because I voted for Davis-Bacon, and I \nbelieve the Senator from Massachusetts was trying to give me the good \nGovernment award and get on my good side, but it had nothing to do with \nthis particular amendment.\n  A list of the board of directors of Federal Express is here and we \nfind that Howard Baker, the former majority leader on the other side of \nthe aisle, and George Mitchell, the former majority leader on this side \nof the aisle are among the current board--I do not believe they would \ngo along with that particular picture of a Federal Express truck, \nunfair or antiworker corporation.\n\n  I have so many things to go down and begin to correct because they \nare just running a touchdown in the wrong direction, part of a broader \nagenda, and all of these things that they put in, they have yet, since \nthe very beginning, given me the name of the Senator or the name of the \nHouse Member that knew about this particular mistake being made.\n  This letter, as indicated from OMB that we thought the term express \ncompany was out, a staffer over there at the ICC apparently thought \nthat, and that is why he left it out. It was not any part of our staff, \nit was not any Senator, it was not any House Member, it was not any \nhearing, it was never discussed. Does not anyone feel, as a matter of \nhonor, we ought to correct the mistake?\n  It is not technical or superfluous. It is important. You can see how \nthey are trying to roll the U.S. Congress, how many in here with \nfairness and tax cuts for the rich and Republican special interests and \nmaking it a partisan thing, so we can get a partisan vote if we cannot \nget the 60 votes to go to cloture. It is an embarrassment. They just do \nnot have the facts on their side. They do not have the truth on their \nside. They do not have the decisions on their side.\n  Their rights, the rights of all workers, have been protected over the \nmany, many years, long before the Senator from Massachusetts came and \nthe Senator from South Carolina came. But they are trying a political \ngimmick here with news conferences and workers, and going down the list \nof the workers.\n  I thanked the Senator from Arizona yesterday. He happened to be \nattendant to the particular cases. He went down to those workers. I \ncan't keep up with the number of workers they continue to bring. I \nguess with over 120,000 workers the world around, they can find a few. \nBut the ``best of the best'' labeling of the 100 best companies to work \nfor in America puts Federal Express at the very top in every regard. It \nis an outstanding company. They have nothing to do about taking \nadvantage. I have something to do about not being taken advantage of \nand correcting the mistakes that were made, never heard, never \ndiscussed, never talked about, and put it where it is. So this crowd \ncan't come in here rolling with their getting letters written from OMB. \nThey have political power. I know their influence. They have influence \nover the CRS. The poor lawyer can write, except for the sentence he was \nasked about. Some say he ought to be fired from the Congressional \nResearch Service, saying it was done intentionally, when the language \nsays affirmatively, word for word, it wasn't done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The time yielded to the Senator \nhas expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S12186]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to get back now to talking about \nthe bill that is before us. I am saddened that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has seen fit to attack the Republicans on the floor \nbecause of the situation we are in right now. As my friend from South \nCarolina said, the amendment being objected to by the Senator from \nMassachusetts is the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina. It \nis not a Republican plot. I don't know what all that stuff is over \nthere. As a matter of fact, I don't think it complies with the rules. \nYou can have billboards, as I have here, of a certain size, in order to \nillustrate a point pertaining to the matter pending before the Senate, \nwhich is the FAA bill.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I want to make sure that everyone \nunderstands this is probably the most far-reaching bill in the history \nof the United States dealing with aviation security and safety. It is a \nbill that, if it does not become law, is going to make us next year go \nback to square one and start the process all over.\n  Meanwhile, any tragedies that happen in this country, in terms of \naviation safety or security, are going to be laid right at the feet of \nthe people who prevent this bill from becoming law. There is a \npossibility that tomorrow a point of order will be raised against the \nbill even if we shut off debate, on the basis of the scope of this \nconference report.\n  In the conference report, we have included a series of matters that \nwe thought were absolutely essential to the outcome of this process. \nThe President appointed a commission. It was called the Gore \nCommission. That commission represented a series of things. In the \nthings that were recommended, we have tried to include in this bill \nprovisions that were in either the House bill or Senate bill to respond \nto the Presidential Commission on Airport Security and Safety.\n  For instance, there is the child pilot safety provision, Mr. \nPresident. That is title VI of this bill. I spoke earlier today about \nthe family assistance provision, which was H.R. 3923. That is title VII \nof this bill. They are beyond the scope of the conference, there is no \nquestion about it. It takes the forbearance of the Senate to pass the \nbill that the House has already passed, recognizing the emergency that \nexists in our country coming out of recent tragedies in the aviation \nfield.\n  Now, we have in this bill a provision that requires the FAA to study \nand report to Congress on whether some security responsibilities should \nbe transferred from airlines to airports. That is in section 301. The \nFAA is directed now to certify companies that provide security \nscreening. No longer is that going to be just an airport activity. It \nis an FAA responsibility now. We have provisions to bolster weapons and \nexplosive-detection technology. Money for that is in the appropriations \nbill that passed now. It passed on Monday. The authorization to spend \nthe money is in section 303. Unless the bill passes, that will not be \ndone. There will not be explosive-detection facilities at our airports \nuntil Congress gets around to passing the bill again in the next year--\nhopefully. It has taken us 2 years to get it in this Congress. I \npredict that it will take at least 18 months in the next Congress to \nget back to this point.\n\n  This bill requires that background and criminal history records \nchecks be conducted on airport security screeners and their \nsupervisors, on those people, airport security screeners and \nsupervisors. In other words, we are not going to let the fox in the \nhenhouse in terms of the security of the aviation facilities.\n  We require the FAA to facilitate the interim deployment of currently \navailable explosive-detection equipment. That means they will do it \nimmediately. It is going to happen immediately if this bill passes.\n  We require the FAA to audit the effectiveness of criminal history \nrecords checks and encourage the FAA to assist in the development of \nthe passenger-profiling system. We permit the Airport Improvement \nProgram and passenger facility charges funds to be used for safety and \nsecurity projects at airports. That is direct availability of funds for \nthat purpose.\n  The FAA and FBI must develop an aviation security liaison agreement. \nThey must lay out in advance how they are going to work together on \nsecurity problems. FAA and FBI must carry out joint threat assessments \nof high-risk airports. That begins immediately when this bill passes. \nThere is money in the appropriations bill to do it. It requires the \nperiodic assessment of all airport and air carrier security systems, \nand it requires a report to Congress on recommendations to enhance and \nsupplement screening of air cargo.\n  Mr. President, this bill is absolutely essential to the future \nsecurity of our airports and our airway systems.\n  Further, let us talk about aviation safety. This bill reiterates in \nsection 401 that safety is the highest priority of the FAA. It \nfacilitates the flow of FAA operational and safety information \nprimarily. It authorizes FAA to establish standards for the \ncertification of small airports so as to improve safety at those \nairports.\n  The NTSB and FAA must work together to improve the system for \naccident and safety data classification so as to make it more \naccessible and consumer friendly. It requires the sharing of pilots' \nemployment records between former and prospective employers to ensure \nthat marginally qualified pilots are not hired. That is one of the \nbasic defects in our laws today. This mandates that a new employer has \nthe right to the pilots' records from all prior employers. Now, Mr. \nPresident, if there is any reason, above all, to pass the bill, it is \nright there, title V: No more defective pilots being hired by someone \nwho does not know of the prior record of the pilot.\n  This will discourage attempts by child pilots to set records or \nperform other aeronautical feats. Unfortunately, that is required \nbecause of the recent problem we had with regard to a child pilot. \nBeyond that--look at this, Mr. President--this provides the authority \nto expend $1.46 billion on airports through this AIP program. That \nmoney can't be spent until this bill passes.\n  I have a whole list of things that are underway, Mr. President--\nunderway now--and they are items that ought to proceed. I want to put \nsome of them in the Record. Let me talk about some of them.\n  In northwest Arkansas there is a grant for the replacement of a \ncommercial service airport. If these funds are not available the new \nregional airport will cease until grant funds are made available in the \nearly next year.\n  In Reno at Lake Tahoe, the international airport there, they have \ncompleted a major parallel runway. But they have to have additional \nfunds in order to complete that runway, and that must be available in \nthe next 30 days.\n  They are in this bill.\n  The Sacramento International Airport just completed reconstruction of \nanother parallel runway system. The immediate need is for the \nentitlement and discretionary funds to pay the debt for that process.\n  In other words, that can't be finished.\n  Over in Rhode Island at Providence, the Teddy Green State Airport, \nthere is money in this bill. And if it is not available immediately the \nRhode Island Airport Corp. will suffer financial hardship, and cash \nflow problems, if this grant is not made by the end of this first \nquarter of fiscal year 1996.\n  In Philadelphia, there is a runway under construction;\n  In Ithaca, NY, another runway construction;\n  Albany, NY, construction;\n  Clarksburg, WV;\n  Buffalo, NY;\n  Right here in Washington, the Metropolitan Washington Airport \nAuthority;\n  Danville, VA;\n  Roanoke, VA;\n  The State airport in Baltimore;\n  Charlottesville, VA;\n  Out in Portland;\n  In Denver;\n  And, the Seattle-Tacoma Airport which is very familiar to people from \nmy State and the occupant of the chair.\n  Mr. President, this is a national bill. It is money that is spent \nfrom a trust fund. It does not come from the Treasury. It comes from \nthe trust fund. In order to take money out of the trust fund it must be \nspecifically authorized. And this is the authorization right here. This \nis the bill before us.\n\n[[Page S12187]]\n\n  If a point of order is made tomorrow against this bill and allows the \nbill to be destroyed, the whole conference report falls--the whole \nconference report.\n  From there on, you can only operate by unanimous consent; unanimous \nconsent. This whole bill will then be dependent upon unanimous consent. \nAny one Senator can say, ``No. I do not want go along.''\n  Now we have three or four Senators right now who say they don't want \nthe bill to go forward as it is. And we are flying people back here \nfrom all over the country to get 60 votes. We will get 60 votes to stop \nthis filibuster.\n  That is what it is. It is a filibuster against FAA security and \nsafety legislation because of one small provision, and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina stated what it is. It is to correct an error that was \nmade when a bill was passed here last December.\n  Under the circumstances, all this business--I am a very patient man \nnormally. At least I think I am. Some people may disagree. But I think \nI am patient with regard to expressions of opinion here on the floor. \nBut I never thought I would come out here and listen to this campaign \nspeech from the Senator from Massachusetts when we agreed to 3 hours \nequally divided today to debate this conference report.\n  Suddenly, it has developed into a campaign debate. If it is to \ncontinue, I am going to call for the campaign people to come out here \nand conduct the debate. I was prepared to debate this bill, and the \nreason this bill must become law.\n  I want to say, Mr. President, in all seriousness now, if this bill is \nto be destroyed by a point of order on a technicality tomorrow, we are \ngoing to be around I think a long time next year, and we are going to \nbe hearing the charges that will come out of the terrible calamity that \nwill happen in the event there is another serious airline crash, and we \nend up with the same laws--the same inadequate laws--trying to deal \nwith them. Because that has been the problem--whether it is the ValuJet \nin Florida or the crash over New York, these crashes now are involving \nso many different problems; problems of recovering the remains of the \naircraft from deep water off our shores, or to try to get it out of a \nterrible swamp down in Florida, and all of the various problems \nparticularly of the victims.\n\n  I think I am about ready.\n  What is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 13 minutes and 50 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Massachusetts has no time \nremaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator from South Carolina wish any more time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator because on the \nsubject here, the point of order, I remind all of my colleagues. That \nis what is required under this unique session that we had here in the \nU.S. Congress this year. We could not complete our work on six of the \nvery important appropriations bills. Many of the provisions here early \non Monday and all of Tuesday were included. I got upset with all kinds \nof provisions that never appeared in the House side and never appeared \nin the Senate side.\n  So I am very careful not to roll anybody, or pull any tricks. And I \nam rather taken aback that they are trying to talk and use the \nexpression ``blackmailing,'' and everything else, when that is exactly \nwhat has occurred--all through the very organized Senator trying to say \n``blackmail'' this body. And the reason the Senator from Alaska has all \nof this documentary evidence up here to help the Republican special \ninterests is to, by cracky, do their dead level best to make it a \npartisan issue when it is not; and making it a partisan issue requiring \nsome 60 votes; all the time clothing themselves as being so reasonable; \nso interested in issues of fairness; fundamental justice; and, all of \nthat. They are clothing themselves in those garments, and then come \naround and gut you. We know what is going on.\n  With respect to pay--and then I will yield--the statement was made \nearlier that the young lady, or someone, who had not had a pay raise in \n7 years took me aback. So I called. And I will now read what was \ndelivered to me by Federal Express, and I quote.\n\n       The average pay growth of the entire FedEx work force with \n     over 1 year of service, including over 30,000 couriers, has \n     exceeded 50 percent over the last 8 years, and has averaged \n     in excess of 6.5 percent per year over that same time period. \n     The officers of Federal Express are excluded from this \n     calculation.\n\n  So the smearing of the corporation--the company--the smearing of the \nsponsor with the charge of ``blackmail'' and ``jamming'' it, and \nrunning around the end, and trying to pull the rug out in the middle of \nthe game, those are all smear tactics. They know it. They know I \nwouldn't engage in it. I am taking exception to it as strongly as I \nknow how.\n  We will stand here with the rest of them because we have the truth on \nour side. Hopefully the truth will prevail tomorrow in spite of these \nlabels and machinations that go on here trying to adulterate the \nprocess. That is what they are trying to do because they don't have \nfairness on their side.\n  We are not changing any fundamental law with the Hollings amendment \nin the FAA bill. Rather, we are restoring the parties to where they \nare, we think, at the moment, but certainly where they were in December \nof last year before this drafting error was made at the time of the \ntermination of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed that approximately 75 \npercent of our people who travel between cities in this country now go \nby air. In my State, as I have said before, over 75 percent of the \ncommunities in my State can be reached only by air. No one, I think, \nhere is more sensitive to the problems of aviation safety and security \nthan those of us from Alaska. It is an area one-fifth the size of the \nUnited States. We literally are one-quarter the size of the continental \nUnited States. When you look at our problems in terms of aviation, we \nlive and sleep and some of our people are born and many of them die on \nairplanes. We have to have aviation security. I have worked long and \nhard on this bill. We have had some disagreements over funding of the \nfuture expansion and modernization of our airports and airway system, \nbut I must tell the Senate there has never been a disagreement in our \ncommittee that we had to have a bill this year. It has to be done.\n\n  When we got in conference and we started adding other issues --as I \nhave said, we added the victims rights, victims assistance legislation, \nthe rights of families legislation, we added a couple other items here \nand the measure obviously was opened beyond the original scope. The \nSenator from South Carolina offered his amendment. I believe it was the \nlast amendment to be adopted----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. STEVENS. In the conference, and it was adopted. There was a \ndebate on it but an overwhelming vote, bipartisan vote in the \nconference.\n  I have to tell the Chair I never suspected that we were going to have \nthis kind of delay on this bill. To me and to the people I represent, \nit is the most important bill of the whole Congress. I thought that the \nfishing legislation, extension of the 200-mile limit bill, the Magnuson \nAct was important--I still think it very important--but this bill \naffects the lives of every Alaskan several times a week. I cannot tell \nthe Senate how strongly I feel about getting it passed, and how sad I \nam to learn that in all probability there is going to be a point of \norder raised on this bill tomorrow.\n  Incidentally, we must have 60 votes here tomorrow, and we are sending \nthroughout the country alerts to everyone to come back and vote. I \nthink there is an obligation of all Senators to be here, but obviously \nit is going to take at least 60 here tomorrow to terminate this \nfilibuster. If the filibuster is not terminated, obviously the \nconference report fails. If the point of order is granted, obviously, \nthe conference report fails also. It is not going to be an easy thing \nto explain to the country if we are not able to pass this bill.\n  So, again, I urge Senators to come back, that they be informed about \nthis bill, to understand what it is. It is not part of the chart that \nis behind the Senator from Massachusetts. It has\n\n[[Page S12188]]\n\nnothing to do with taxes or any Republican attack on anybody. It is the \nmost serious bill in the aviation era that has ever been passed by \nCongress. I hope it becomes law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there now be 30 \nminutes under the control of Senator Kennedy, 30 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Hollings, and 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Nickles, and following the conclusion or yielding back of the \ntime, the Republican whip be recognized to make appropriate consents \nfor the Senate to adjourn until 9 a.m. on Thursday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the the Senator from Massachusetts yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield for a question. We have had some \nexchange on the question of how we are going to proceed now. If it is \nagreeable, I would like to take just a few moments. We have been \nworking through this process.\n  Unless it is a brief comment, I think I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I do not want to take the additional time \nto repeat the fundamental core issue, whether this was the technical \namendment or whether it was a substantive amendment. I think that case, \nalthough there is a difference in the expression of the Members on our \nside on this issue, particularly the Senator from South Carolina and \nmyself, I will let the record stand. I think the independent evaluation \nby the Congressional Research Service, the administration's own \nposition, the different statements made by the Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, and the history of the debate on this issue, the \nconclusions that one can draw from the conference committee when that \nmeasure was addressed--all indicate quite clearly that the measure was \ndropped with the abolition of the Interstate Commerce Commission. And \nsince there had not been any entity that lived up to the old railroad--\nREA requirements, it was an anachronism and was effectively dropped. I \nthink that case, hopefully, has been made to the satisfaction of the \nMembers.\n  Mr. President, I just want to add, this measure, with all respect to \nthe comments that have been made around here, has been out there in a \nnumber of forms over the period of this last Congress, being pursued by \nFederal Express, by the Republican leadership, Bud Shuster over in the \nHouse of Representatives and later it was put forward by the Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  But there were more than three or four instances where this was \nattempted by Republican leadership in the House of Representatives. The \nfinal action on this legislation came to 203 Republicans for the bill, \n15 Democrats; 168 Democrats, 30 Republicans, so it is 218 to 198, the \noverwhelming majority of the Democrats opposed; the overwhelming \nmajority of the Republicans in support. I believe that is what we are \ngoing to see tomorrow. So, whether it was advanced by the Republicans \nor Democrats in the caucus--clearly this is a provision that is \nstrongly, strongly supported by our Republican friends.\n\n  I want to just finally point out, as I was mentioning earlier, we \nshould not be surprised that it is being so strongly supported by our \nRepublican friends because I feel that the fundamental issue is the \nissue of fairness and equity to these workers who are trying to follow \nprecedent as truck drivers and to be considered under the National \nLabor Relations Act. They were following that precedent. The precedent \nmost visible, I think, for most of us, was UPS, where the truck drivers \nare effectively doing the same thing. They are the principal \ncompetitor, as well as the Post Office. And there, the truck drivers \nare considered under the National Labor Relations Act. The issue is \nwhether these truck drivers will be able to be so considered. The \npurpose of this amendment is to make sure that they are not.\n  That is the bottom line on this. By not covering them, we see what \nthe authority and the power is of Federal Express in dealing with their \nemployees. I reviewed earlier in the day, some really extraordinary \ninstances of grievances that Members have. I will put in the Record as \nwell the pay rates that are significantly different from those that \nhave been advanced.\n  Nonetheless, if the workers were so happy the company would not have \nto worry about having a union for them. That is the bottom line.\n  If everything is hunky-dory, they are not going to go ahead. That is \nwhat happens around here. It is only when there are legitimate \ngrievances focused on pay and other grievances that there is a \nconsideration of a union. All we are saying is let the workers make \nthat judgment and make that decision and don't foreclose them. That \nhappens, we believe, to be the current state of the law, and with this \naction, the interest of those workers would be circumvented, would be \ncompromised. It is not the Senator from Massachusetts. We have had the \nCRS, the administration has said it, and those members of the \nTransportation Committee in the House have reaffirmed it.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a final few moments to put this into \nsome kind of perspective.\n  Should we be surprised that the overwhelming majority, in this \ninstance it will be the Republicans in the Senate, as it was in the \nHouse, are supporting a provision that would effectively undermine the \nlegitimate interests and rights of those truckers? Should we be \nsurprised with it?\n  The point I was making earlier in the presentation is I don't think \nwe should be surprised when we look at what the record has been over \nthe period of these last 2 years on economic issues, minimum wage, \nEITC, other issues affecting income, the Davis-Bacon Act, or whether it \nhas been the interest of workers versus the powerful special interests \nwhen we came to opening up the pensions.\n  Here are legitimate funds paid in by workers, and the corporate world \nis trying to get its hands into those pension funds. We have seen the \nabuses in the 1980's and the attempt, again, that was being made, in \nspite of votes here in the U.S. Senate saying we shouldn't do it, to \nopen up those pensions to the corporate raiders. That is a matter of \nfact. Senators might not want to listen to this. Senators might \ndisagree with this fact. But the fact of the matter is, we took action \nhere in the U.S. Senate that would have compromised the savings of \nworkers. We have compromised their income, and we have compromised \ntheir savings they put away for a life's dream.\n  Then we came back to issues that would have affected their health, \ntheir safety, and, under the fine leadership of Senator Kassebaum, I \nthought we had a bipartisan effort, virtually unanimous by our \ncommittee, unanimous here, eventually, on the floor, and we were \ndelayed a period of 8 months before we were even able to bring this \nmeasure up.\n  Who would that measure have affected? Working families playing by the \nrules, paying the premiums, that might have some preexisting condition \nand might want to go to another job or to be able to continue the \npayment of their premiums and retain their insurance to deal with some \nof the most important things. Who was delaying that? Many of the major \ninsurance companies at the cost of the workers.\n  That has been the history, Mr. President. Our friends on the other \nside might not want to hear it, they might not like it, but that \nhappens to be the record.\n  When we had a bipartisan effort to do something about mental health \nunder the leadership of Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone, it was \npassed here on the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n  Who weighed in against that provision in terms of mental health? The \ninsurance industries. And who would have benefited from it? Working \nfamilies. Who would have benefited from the leadership that Senator \nBradley showed in trying to deal with the, I\n\n[[Page S12189]]\n\nthink, unfortunate restrictions that are placed upon expectant mothers \nand their babies after delivery and putting a time limitation of 24 \nhours, 48 hours with more complicated births. Who would benefit? It \nwould be the mothers in working families, the wives in working \nfamilies. Who opposed it? The insurance industry.\n\n  Our friend and colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, had difficulty \nwith that, and eventually it was accepted in the final hour.\n  Whether it has been on what we call the baby bill, or whether it has \nbeen on mental health, or whether it has been even on the proposal \nSenator Wyden advanced to try and remove the gag on the doctors in this \ncountry in HMO's to give consumers full information--who are the \nconsumers? Workers. Who is on the other side? The insurance industry. \nBecause of the resistance we had on that, the proposal of Senator Wyden \nwas not agreed to.\n  All I am pointing out is time in and time out, over this period of \ntime, whether it is working families, children of working families with \nthe large cuts in the education programs--who benefits from those \nprograms? It is the sons and daughters of working families. They are \nthe ones who qualify for the Pell grants or the Stafford loans.\n  You have to be under a certain income. It can get as high as about \n$62,000, if you have three or four children in school. But it is, \nbasically, for the children of working families to try and permit them \nto go. Nonetheless, we saw the cutbacks on the Pell grants and the \ncutbacks in the loan programs.\n  Whose children are going to benefit? It is the sons and daughters of \nworking families.\n  We have the assault on the incomes, wages of workers, we saw the \nreduction in the education program, we saw the reduction of Medicare, \nwhich would have meant $2,400 per couple over a period of 5 years they \nwould have had to pay out, and if they weren't able to pay it under \nSocial Security, who would have ended up paying it? It would have been \nthe working families who want to make sure their parents have some \ndegree of respect and dignity.\n  It is with regard to cuts in the income of working families, the \ncutback in Medicare, or increase in the premiums of copays and \ndeductibles, which, if the senior can't pay for it, will be paid for by \nthose working families. There were even cuts in the Medicaid Program. \nWe have 18 million children on Medicaid; 4.5 million under the \nRepublican proposal would have been knocked off Medicaid. Two-thirds of \nthe children on Medicaid have parents who are working. They are the \npoorest of the poor.\n  What is going to happen with those cuts? It slashes the wages to \nworking families, a slash in college, slash in education, slash in \nMedicare, for what? To pay for the hundreds of billions of dollars in \ntax cuts. For whom? For the wealthiest individuals. That happens to be \nthe fact. There are people on the other side who don't want to hear it. \nThere were attempts to silence us on this side of the aisle from making \nthose speeches. That was true yesterday, when my good friend, Senator \nMcCain, said, ``We don't have to listen to this, we don't want to \nlisten to it,'' and left the floor. Or the attempt to try and silence \nus here on the floor this afternoon. Those are the facts. Our \nRepublican friends may not want to hear it, but those are the facts.\n  To come back to the core issue, what we are talking about is the \nlegitimate interests, rights, and grievances of those workers in \nPennsylvania, and we referred to those earlier. Should we be surprised \nthat in the final hours, we are going to give short shrift to those \nworkers based upon what has been the Republican leadership in the House \nand the Senate over this period? We should not be surprised, Mr. \nPresident. We should not be surprised.\n\n  Should we speak for those individuals? I think that we should speak \nfor those individuals.\n  Should we support the FAA conference report? Sure, we should support \nit. The Senator from Alaska knows we could call up a clean bill, and it \nwould pass in 5 minutes--5 minutes. No one has to come back. That issue \nis resolved. Turn the lights down in the U.S. Senate and let's go back \nand have the debate with our constituents across the country on what \nkind of future the American people want to support.\n  Do they want someone who is going to represent working families, or \ndo they want someone who is going to be involved in the special \ninterests? We do not have to bring all our Members on back. All we have \nto do is have the clean bill, take the conference report without those \nprovisions that undermine the legitimate interests of working families \nin Pennsylvania. We could have passed that, and we would not be here \nthis evening.\n  But, oh, no. We are not going to do it that way. We are just going to \ninsist that those provisions are going to be included in any provision. \n``We don't care whether you're going to stay here or not and speak for \nthem.'' I have welcomed the opportunity to speak for those families.\n  I think they have rights and they have interests, and they are \nentitled to someone to speak for them. I welcome the opportunity, and I \nconsider it an honor to be able to speak for them.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter and a news \nrelease from Public Citizen detailing the practices of Federal Express \nand their impact on public safety be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 2, 1996.\n       Dear Senator: Tomorrow you will vote on an amendment to the \n     Federal Aviation bill that will limit the ability of Federal \n     Express workers to organize under the labor laws. This \n     amendment has not been subject to any hearings or legislative \n     debate but is a last minute add-on to the conference report.\n       We urge you to vote against cloture for the following \n     reasons:\n       (1) If this anti-labor amendment passes, Federal Express \n     workers will have no ability to organize to protect their \n     safety on the highways. This is a particularly critical issue \n     because in 1995 Federal Express (and some other companies) \n     rammed through an amendment to the National Highway System \n     (NHS) legislation that eliminates all federal motor carrier \n     safety requirements for most of the trucks their employees \n     drive--10,001 to 26,000 pound trucks. Among the highway \n     safety standards that were abolished are hours-of-service, \n     driver qualifications, equipment standards, and inspection \n     requirements. This amendment was opposed by the insurance \n     industry, highway safety organizations, the fire fighters and \n     the Administration. Without the ability to organize for their \n     own protection, and with a hole blown through the fabric of \n     federal motor carrier safety requirements, these workers \n     lives literally are on the line.\n       Between 1991 and 1994, the fatal injuries and crashes \n     involving trucks in this vehicle class increased by 50% with \n     1,400 people killed in 1994 and thousands injured. In \n     addition to the operators of these trucks, of course, the \n     public at large is also at risk. UPS opposed this amendment \n     on the NHS bill because many of the federal safety \n     requirements are already part of their labor contracts.\n       (2) This is not the first time or the second time that \n     Federal Express has used last-minute tactics to gain passage \n     of controversial amendments to law. In the 1990 aviation \n     authorization bill, with no hearings, exemption from local \n     noise requirements for aircraft were pushed through. In the \n     1994 aviation authorization bill, Federal Express was \n     involved in getting preemption of state regulation of truck \n     prices, routes and services through the Congress with no \n     hearings in the Senate where the amendment was added to an \n     unrelated bill and only a last minute hearing in the House \n     during the conference negotiations. State officials were \n     outraged at the way this was maneuvered. In 1995, motor \n     carrier safety standards were eliminated for Federal Express \n     type trucks in the National Highway System legislation. In \n     1996, the anti-labor provision Federal Express seeks to get \n     enacted in the aviation authority conference report is the \n     most recent in a long string of such maneuvers.\n       These issues are major public policies that deserve \n     appropriate hearings and evaluation. The public is already \n     angry about the way wealthy business interests dominate the \n     congressional decision-making process. This history of \n     Federal Express sponsored legislation, combined with the \n     millions of dollars it spends each year on lobbying, campaign \n     contributions, and providing air transportation services to \n     key members of Congress, undermines our democratic system. \n     Federal Express has a long history of opposition to \n     government regulations. But when they want to block their \n     employees' efforts to form a union and gain an unfair \n     advantage over their competitors, the sky's the limit on \n     money and political muscle they will use to get their own \n     customized regulatory protection made into law.\n       (3) There have been concerns raised on the Senate floor \n     about the need to pass the aviation bill for protection of \n     public safety. But many Americans also will be endangered if \n     Federal Express workers cannot negotiate safety protections \n     (now that federal rules are abolished) as do the UPS workers. \n     And the limits on Federal Express workers will be permanent \n     while the aviation system will\n\n[[Page S12190]]\n\n     merely experience a small delay and it is already fully \n     appropriated. Please remember as many people die on the \n     highway every day as die in one airline crash.\n       (4) The labor amendment on the aviation bill which \n     overrules pending litigation should be fully debated in the \n     labor committees of the Congress and subject to the same \n     review and procedural rules that most legislation receives. \n     If this means that the House of Representatives has to return \n     to Washington to repass a clean aviation bill, that is a \n     small price to pay. Hopefully, it would discourage future \n     manipulation of this sort.\n       In sum, for the safety of Federal Express drivers and the \n     driving public at large, for fairness and integrity of the \n     legislative process, and for the workers of the Federal \n     Express company, we urge you to vote against the cloture \n     petition and pass a clean, unadulterated federal aviation \n     bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joan Claybrook.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Public Citizen, Oct. 2, 1996]\n\n  Public Citizen Supports Effort to Block Sweetheart Deal for Federal \n          Express; Commends Senator Kennedy's Principled Stand\n\n       Washington, DC, October 2.--The consumer advocacy group \n     Public Citizen today applauded Senator Edward M. Kennedy's \n     (D-MA) efforts to block an attempt to add a special ``Federal \n     Express protection'' clause that was slipped into the Federal \n     Aviation Reauthorization bill.\n       ``Federal Express has a long history of opposition to \n     government regulations,'' said Joan Claybrook, president of \n     Public Citizen. ``But when they want to block their \n     employees' efforts to form a union and gain an unfair \n     advantage over their competitors, the sky's the limit on \n     money and political muscle they will use to get their own \n     customized regulatory protection made into law.''\n       Federal Express is one of the most active lobbying \n     companies in Washington, and this attempt is a text-book \n     example of how Washington works to benefit fat cats at the \n     expense of ordinary citizens. In the first six months of this \n     year alone, Federal Express reported lobbying expenses of \n     $1,149,150 and the use of nine outside lobbying firms. And \n     Federal Express backs up its lobbying with generous campaign \n     contributions. In the 1993-94 election cycle, Federal Express \n     gave over $800,000 to 224 candidates for federal office. And \n     it's given well over half a million dollars to members of \n     Congress so far in the 1995-96 election cycle, with $543,000 \n     reported to the Federal Election Commission as of July 1, \n     1996. And just to make sure the major political parties don't \n     forget Federal Express, they've given at least $159,900 in \n     soft money to the Republican National Committee, and at least \n     $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee.\n       To make sure its voice is heard in the Capitol, the FedEx \n     board of directors includes high political profile members \n     such as Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, former \n     Senator Howard Baker and former DNC Chair Charles Manatt. \n     There are also reports of Federal Express making its \n     corporate jets available to members of Congress and other \n     political figures, and accepting the equivalent of commercial \n     air fare as payment. Public Citizen is currently asking \n     Senators and their staff to disclose any use of Federal \n     Express aircraft for their personal, official or campaign \n     travel.\n       Federal Express has used its political clout lobbying \n     muscle and its campaign contributions to get numerous special \n     provisions inserted into various legislation. In 1995, \n     Federal Express was able to get exemption from federal motor \n     carrier regulations for its delivery trucks in the National \n     Highway System legislation. This exemption for trucks from \n     10,000 to 26,000 pounds was granted even though the number of \n     fatalities from crashes of trucks in this size range \n     increased by 50% from 1991 to 1994, when 1400 people died.\n       The exemption of these delivery trucks from federal motor \n     carrier standards leaves Federal Express drivers and other \n     motorists less protected. If the drivers had union \n     representation, they could address safety concerns in \n     contract negotiations. Federal Express now wants regulatory \n     aid to make that possibility more difficult for employees to \n     achieve.\n       In other years Federal Express used language slipped into \n     aviation bills to win exemptions from state noise \n     requirements and exemption from state price, route and \n     service regulations. The stage for the current eleventh-hour \n     battle was set earlier this year when Congress rejected \n     similar amendments.\n       ``What we are seeing is simply another flagrant example of \n     a politically active and well-connected corporation trying to \n     use its influence and connections to make an end run around \n     the legislative process,'' concluded Claybrook. ``Federal \n     Express is trying to get it's special interest protection \n     written into law without hearings, discussion or debate. \n     Fortunately, Senators Kennedy, Harkin, Simon, Feingold and \n     others who support working families are making sure the \n     public knows exactly what is going on, and we commend them \n     for it.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on tomorrow we have, as I understand it, \nan hour of time before the vote, which will be evenly divided. I would \nlike to ask the Chair now, who controls, just so I will know what \nsteps, if any, to be taken this evening to be given assurance that at \nleast those who are opposed to this amendment will have an equal time \nwith those who are in favor of the amendment. What is the understanding \nof the Chair at the present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe conference report will occur at 10 a.m. on Thursday. There will be \n1 hour of debate to be equally divided between the majority leader and \nthe minority leader prior to the cloture vote, with the mandatory \nquorum call under rule XXII waived.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, I am satisfied that both the \nmajority and minority leader will work out an arrangement to ensure \nthat the time divided will be fairly divided between those who support \nand those who oppose.\n  So I have no further requests. I thank the Members for the \nopportunity to make these presentations here this afternoon, and I look \nforward to tomorrow and hope that we can, by assuring that we are not \ngoing to gain the cloture--I hope that right after that we, if we are \nsuccessful, will move to a clean bill and pass it overwhelmingly. I \nhave every expectation that by noontime the House will be willing to \naccept it, as they have at other times actions which we have taken on \nthis measure, and that we will have done justice to many workers who \nhave been playing by the rules of the game.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to reserve the remainder \nof his time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will reserve it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Under my allotted time I want to make certain that I \nrelinquish at least 5 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, who has \nbeen waiting to speak on an entirely different subject. So if the Chair \nwill counsel me. But I do not think I am going to take but about 10 to \n15 minutes here.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, when the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts ends up on this important thing with pay for tax cuts, \nhelp Republican special interests, and all those other things--they are \nremoving the charts now--talking about mental health, Pell grants, \nanything and everything to make it a partisan issue, I have learned in \nthe early days, like my black friends, how to interpret.\n  I will never forget the story they had in the earliest days in \npolitics when we used to have the literacy tests given. The poor black \npresented himself at the polls to vote. The poll watcher says, ``Here. \nHere. Read this,'' and showed him a Chinese newspaper. He took that \nnewspaper, and he turned it up there, and he then turned it around, and \nthen he turned it on the side, and everything else. He said, ``I just \nread it.'' He said, ``What does it say?'' He said, ``No poor black is \ngoing to vote in this State today.''\n  I read the Senator from Massachusetts. He knows that truth and the \nfacts and the conscience is on the side of the Senator from South \nCarolina. What he is saying--translated--is, this is horrendous \nRepublican conduct concurrent with the contract, like they said to the \nblack male, and doesn't take care of mental health, Davis-Bacon, \nminimum wage, Pell grants, all these other things, so that the \nsubstantial Democrat vote needed for the cloture vote in the morning \nwill stay home.\n  I know substantial Democrat votes who listened and have told me that \nthey will support this opportunity to correct the mistake.\n  Let me emphasize, that it was a mistake. They try, in the opinion of \nthe CRS, to say it was intentional or in the opinion of the Office of \nManagement and Budget to say that it was intentional. But we read time \nand time again--every time I have to continue to turn to it--I said, \nhere is the intent, if you really want the intent. Because we all \nagreed the enactment of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 shall neither \nexpand nor contract coverage of employees and employers by the Railway \nLabor Act.\n\n  So according to intent, nothing was changed. But now they come and \nsay it was. So I said, ``Well, like me, why don't you try to find a \nSenator who suggested it? Why don't you try to find a House Member who \neven discussed it? Why don't you find anybody in that conference or \nbefore or after who suggested it? Then some staffer may say,\n\n[[Page S12191]]\n\n``Oh, I remember my Senator or my Congressman wanted to make sure.'' \nNot to be found whatsoever.\n  The truth is that the counsel at the ICC, which does not certify \nexpress carriers like Federal Express air carrier, where 85 percent of \ntheir packages are carried by air, intimated since the Railway Express \nAgency had gone bankrupt and their rights had been transferred, there \nwas no need for the language.\n  But they all now agree, 2 months later in 1996, when we learned about \nit, it was an inadvertence, because it was a hotly contested thing over \na 5-year period in the Philadelphia case used by the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts says that here the poor \nworkers are right in the middle of trying to get their rights and are \nbeing cut off at the pass by the Senator from South Carolina. Not at \nall. Their rights are the same as under that 5-year case on November \n22, 1995, under this particular amendment.\n  What we are trying to do is make sure that all rights of all parties, \nas expressed in the ICC Termination Act, are unchanged, neither \nexpanded nor contracted.\n  So we are not pulling the rug out. On the contrary, we are preventing \nthe rug from being pulled out. We are not changing the rules of the \ngame. On the contrary, we are trying to prevent the rules from being \nchanged after the game. For what it was is, on November 22, by a \nunanimous opinion of the National Mediation Board, Federal Express was \nan express carrier under the Railway Labor Act. It was not until \nDecember 15 that we marked up that conference report on the termination \nof the ICC. That is wherein they dropped the two words, ``express \ncompany.'' That is wherein the ambiguity is, in spite of the expressed \nintent. That is the ambiguity that the Hollings amendment intends be \ncorrected.\n  I am proud, because we have used that device ad infinitum here this \nparticular week in the adoption of six appropriations bills. And \nmatters included in those bills were never in the House, never in the \nSenate, included for the first time, and we voted overwhelmingly for \nthem. So do not come with procedure and technicality.\n  Not a special interest in the sense of giving a corporation something \nthey never had. A special interest in the light of the truth. The truth \nis a special interest of the Senator from South Carolina. It is a \nmatter of honor and conscience. When we found this mistake was made on \nour watch, we wanted to make every reasonable effort to make sure it \nwas corrected.\n  Don't give me about hearings. The mistake was made without any \nhearings, without any discussion, without any knowledge. So we need not \nhave any hearings or knowledge now. However, we did have knowledge. We \ndid argue it in the conference. We voted 8 to 2 on a 4-to-1 vote to \ninclude it. It passed the House, and has been ready to pass the Senate \nsince the beginning of the week, except for the motion to postpone, the \nrequirement of the reading of the bill, for all of these machinations \nwhere they say they are not for filibuster and are engaging in a \nfilibuster.\n  That is not the matter of an issue never litigated. The Teamster case \nin 1993 which I referred to in the Record stated that it had nothing to \ndo with Federal Express, but in a unanimous opinion by the National \nLabor Relations Board, an opinion by the chairman stating that the \nUnited Parcel Service has 92 percent of their packages delivered on the \nground, did not qualify, in contrast, as Federal Express has since its \ninitiation or beginning in 1973.\n  On the contrary, it is entirely different, quoting the Teamster \nlawyer, ``As night and day.'' But they come with the oozing argument, \ntrying to get the foot in that door--what is the matter; United Parcel \nService operates under the rules, why cannot Federal Express? Federal \nExpress is operating under the rules. It has operated under the rules. \nThere is no court decision other then holding it should operate under \nthe rules of the Railway Labor Act.\n  Yet, my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts continues to say \nagain and again and again there is no court decision finding that \nFederal Express is an express company to operate under the Railway \nLabor Act. He could not show me one decision when I asked. I asked for \nthe grounds. Where is the decision that he finds otherwise? It is not \nan issue unstudied.\n  We formed the Dunlop Commission here at the beginning of the year \nunder the former Secretary of Labor under President Carter, and that \ncommission found that the provisions of the Railway Labor Act should \nnot be changed. I emphasize the fact that Mr. Doug Fraser, former \npresident of the United Auto Workers, was a member of that commission.\n  Now, Mr. President, there is no reason to waste the time of the \nSenate here about Federal Express being antilabor. We know Howard \nBaker, the former majority leader, is not antilabor. We know George \nMitchell, former majority leader on this side of the aisle, is not \nantilabor. They are both on the board. I put in more good Government \nawards for recognition for Federal Express than you could possibly \nimagine--continuous--over the years.\n  In ``the 100 Best Companies To Work for in America,'' they rated at \nthe top in every respect for workers' rights, good housekeeping, for \nworking men. Who is the best company for working women? They won that. \nFor minorities, for Hispanics, in any particular regard, you find \nFederal Express is diligent, working, growing, and paying.\n  I finally have to put in, when we heard we had not had a pay raise; \nto the contrary, for the past 8 years, all Federal Express workers, \nincluding 30,000 couriers--not including their board members, but \nincluding 30,000 couriers--all have received an average of 6.5 percent \nover the past 8 years or over a 50-percent increase in their wages. \nThat is the fact. No use to come out here and slam and paste antiworker \nsigns with a big old Federal Express truck on them and begin a diatribe \nagainst the Republican Party. That is the worst performance I have ever \nseen.\n  I yield 5 or 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator and reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. First of all, I want to thank very much the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina for letting me proceed.\n  I ask that I might proceed for 8 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12178-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12191-S12192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there are 13 Senators who have chosen not \nto run for reelection. Each one I consider a friend. With each one, I \nhave had extremely enjoyable experiences--whether it be traveling \nabroad, as with Howell Heflin; working on the centrist coalition, as \nwith Hank Brown, Bill Cohen, Nancy Kassebaum, Sam Nunn, and Al Simpson; \nlong hours spent together on the Finance Committee with Bill Bradley \nand David Pryor; friendly times in this Chamber with Bennett Johnston, \nPaul Simon, and Jim Exon; a long time friendship that goes back over 30 \nyears with Mark Hatfield; and working together for our State with \nClaiborne Pell.\n  Claiborne Pell has been here the longest, 36 years. His splendid \nachievements on behalf of education will long be recognized for their \nbenefits, not just to millions of young people, but also to our Nation.\n  His years on the Foreign Relations Committee have been devoted to \nobtaining treaties to foster a long term peace.\n  Our Nation's cultural life has been enhanced by his originating the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. By any measure, his Senate career has \nbeen a splendid one.\n  It is always risky to single out any individuals from a star studded \ngroup such as the 13 who are retiring, but I would like to make a few \nadditional comments regarding six of those with whom I have worked \nespecially close.\n  The first five Senators I will mention were for the past 4 years in \nour bipartisan mainstream coalition and our bipartisan centrist \ncoalition. We spent scores of hours together in room S-201 here in the \nCapitol working together to forge legislation first on health care and \nthen on the budget.\n  Ever since Bill Cohen came to the Senate, he and I have exchanged \nviews on legislation. I've listened especially\n\n[[Page S12192]]\n\ncareful to his thoughts on national defense and matters pertaining to \nthe aging. It has been a joyful relationship and his penetrating \nappraisal of senatorial actions has been a continuous leavening to some \ntiring sessions that we have had. Above all, I will remember his \nwillingness to take difficult votes in attempting to put our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  As do all Senators, I have tremendous respect and affection for Nancy \nKassebaum. That quiet manner and lovely smile hides a spine of steel. \nShe takes courageous positions and sticks by them. She was always there \nwhen challenging budget votes had to be taken.\n  Al Simpson is noted for his humor, occasionally earthy and always \npertinent. But, never should we forget the difficult subjects he has \ndealt with, forged into legislation, brought to the floor and achieved \npassage. Whether it be immigration, veterans affairs or Medicare \nmatters, Al Simpson has the courage to tackle the tough issues.\n  Likewise, Hank Brown has dealt with these budgetary matters that, if \nunrestrained, will bankrupt our country and leave no Medicare, and a \nSocial Security System that is a shambles. His constant cheerfulness \nand quiet determination will be greatly missed.\n  The final retiree from our centrist group is Sam Nunn. Everyone knows \nof Sam as a defense expert, whether it's ICBM's or troop numbers in \nNATO, he is the leading expert. But his courageous efforts to control \nthe Federal budget should receive equal billing. Like the other members \nof the centrist group, he was willing to take the tough votes. He has \nbeen a giant in this Senate.\n  Finally, to longtime friend, Mark Hatfield, a special farewell. Calm, \ndetermined, devoid of side or slickness, always courageous, willing to \nwithstand tremendous pressure if his principles were under attack; he \nstands as a model Senator.\n  All 13 of these Senators will be greatly missed and our Nation will \nbe hard pressed to replace them with their equals.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12191-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12192-S12193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with the conference report on S. 1994, the \nFAA bill, is still pending before the Senate, I want to take a moment \nto run through the provisions dealing with air safety. Having authored \nthese with Senators McCain and Ford, I want the legislative history to \nbe clear about how we got here and what we expect.\n  When we began the process, this was a relatively modest \nreauthorization bill, no safety measures to speak of. But we have come \na long way: with this legislation, we are going beyond all the talk \nabout safety.\n  The conference report includes two central provisions on air safety; \nthe first eliminates the FAA's so-called ``dual mandate'' to make \nsafety paramount at the FAA; the second requires the NTSB to make \nairline safety information available to the public.\n  Just as the American public relies on the FDA to assure that the food \nsupply is safe, the flying public relies on the FAA to make sure \naviation is safe. This is the FAA's most important and fundamental \nmission. Building an infrastructure for an ever-increasing demand for \nair travel is not.\n  The problem is that until today, the law gave the FAA a dual mandate. \nIt said to the FAA, go out and promote air commerce but keep an eye on \nsafety as well. Mr. President, that simply isn't acceptable.\n  The dual mandate created a dilemma for the Agency. If, for example, \nan FAA official believed new safety equipment, like better flight data \nrecorders, would greatly improve safety, but it carried a huge price \ntag, what should that official do? That official would have to decide \nwhether the safety benefits outweighted the costs to the aviation \ncommunity. That is not the type of cost-benefit analysis I find \nacceptable.\n  That is why I sponsored the amendment, adopted unanimously by the \nCommerce Committee, to eliminate the Agency's dual mandate and make \nsafety paramount. The FAA should not have to choose between safety and \npromotion of the industry.\n  The genesis for second provision on aviation safety information is my \nlong-held belief that one thing Government can and should do is give \nAmerican consumers access to good, unbiased information. It is time to \nadopt new policies that empower the consumer, to make it possible for \nconsumers to get critical information about aviation safety in our \ncountry.\n  Everyone who flies should be able to make informed choices about the \nairlines they fly and the airports they use. This legislation will \nenable consumers to do that.\n  Right now, it is possible for consumers to find out if their bags may \nbe crushed and whether their flights will arrive on-time. But it is \npretty darn hard for consumers to find out if the airline they are \nflying on has been fined for violating a major safety law.\n  Back in July, Senator Ford and I wrote the FAA asking them to work \nwith the NTSB, industry, labor and others to come up with a way to make \naviation safety information available to the public.\n  I have talked to people in all parts of the aviation community--the \nFAA, NTSB, airlines, labor, manufacturers, pilots, and consumer \ngroups--about the best way to do this. While there are certainly \ndifferences over how to do it, everyone agrees that it should be done. \nAnd I agree with those in the industry who say that anything involving \nsafety should not be part of competition. But by having uniform \ndefinitions, standards, and public access to this information, I \nbelieve we will move safety out of the shadows and into the sunshine.\n  To get this kind of information today, consumers have to go through \nthe legalistic torture of the Freedom of Information Act. I do not \nthink that's good enough.\n  In addition, the kind of safety information gathered by the FAA and \nthe NTSB is also a problem. It is pretty tough to figure out what's an \naccident and what's an incident. It is certainly unfortunate if a \nflight attendant trips and breaks a leg during a flight, but that \nshouldn't be recorded in the same way as an engine losing power in mid-\nair.\n  The intent of the provision in this bill is to have the NTSB make \naccurate information available to the public about aviation safety, \nincluding accidents and violations of safety regulations. This \nparticular provision focuses on the NTSB, and I expect the NTSB effort \nto parallel the FAA's ongoing project of looking at how to make its \ninformation on accidents as well as violations of its regulations \navailable to consumers.\n  In a few weeks, the FAA will be reporting back to Senator Ford and \nmyself on the best way to handle a broader task: getting the FAA's more \ncomprehensive safety information on accidents and fines for violations \nof safety regulations out to consumers. I look forward to this report.\n  Mr. President, there are many other important elements in this \nlegislation, but I wanted to take this time to explain in greater \ndetail those relating to aviation safety. These are critical components \nof this bill. I hope my comments will provide some guidance to the NTSB \nand the FAA as they proceed to put them into practice.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I wish to congratulate Senator Pressler on his efforts \nand those of the other Senate conferees to work out a beneficial \naviation bill in conference. The conference report before us covers \nairport grants for the fiscal year beginning yesterday, as well as a \ncontinuation of FAA programs, new aviation security measures, and other \nmatters. The bill also establishes a process by which Congress can get \nrecommendations from outside experts on how much funding FAA will need \nin future years for FAA programs, including airport grants, and who \nshould be paying greater or lesser user taxes or fees. In this respect, \nI had hoped the conference report would have made clear that this blue \nribbon commission should look at the issue of user taxes or charges \nfrom the viewpoint of the metropolitan areas where they are generated \nas well as indicating which user\n\n[[Page S12193]]\n\ngroups provided them. I believe that this blue ribbon commission should \ngenerate information as to the annual amount of Federal aviation user \ntaxes that are collected or attributable to aviation activity within \neach metropolitan area in the United States and to compare these \nmetropolitan area totals to the annual amounts of Federal airport \ngrants that are annually received within each of these metropolitan \nareas.\n  This data would be highly useful to airport sponsors and metropolitan \nplanning organizations for assessing the probable impacts of any \nrecommended changes to the existing aviation user tax structure. The \ndata which I wish to have developed would be for the latest year for \nwhich the information is available, and could involve estimates when \nactual data about the geographic source of specific aviation user taxes \ncan't be determined precisely.\n  When the next FAA authorization bill is presented to us, this \ninformation would be useful in helping us make important judgments as \nto the equity of user taxes or fees in comparison to the airport grants \nour metropolitan areas have received.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. I agree with the Senator. The information you request \nshould have been included within the charter of the blue ribbon \ncommission that will be looking into these matters under this \nlegislation. After this legislation is enacted, I will talk to the \nSecretary of Transportation to make sure that the Senator's request is \nsatisfied and that the data he requests is assembled and timely made \navailable to all of us. I appreciate his bringing this oversight to our \nattention.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator. I very much appreciate his efforts \nto follow through on this matter and I look forward to voting in favor \nof the conference report before us.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when the Federal Government enacted laws \nregulating the trucking industry, it created the Interstate Commerce \nCommission [ICC] to administer regulations pursuant to these laws. \nThese regulations were repealed during the Carter administration. \nHowever, it was not until last year that Congress finally got around to \neliminating the ICC.\n  The purpose of the ICC Termination Act of 1995 was simply to \neliminate a bureaucracy that had outlived its usefulness. By its \nexpress terms, it was in no way intended to change the labor law.\n  Unfortunately, a technical error in the act--if left uncorrected--\ncould have a serious impact on labor law.\n  Since 1934, the interests of employees of express carriers such as \nFedEx have been protected under the Railway Labor Act.\n  Unfortunately, the ICC Termination Act inadvertently dropped the term \n``express carrier'' from the Railway Labor Act.\n  This was not a deliberate change of law. In fact, the ICC Termination \nAct expressly states that its enactment ``shall neither expand or \ncontract coverage of the employees and employers of the Railway Act.''\n  The provision included in the FAA Reauthorization Act that has become \nthe target of such rhetoric and controversy is nothing more than a \ntechnical correction.\n  If this technical flaw in the ICC Termination Act had been detected \nbefore its enactment last year, Congress would have corrected it \nwithout fanfare.\n  The debate today is not about being pro-union or pro-management.\n  The debate today is not about wages in America.\n  The debate today is not about anything except making a technical \ncorrection to clarify that express carriers are in the same position \ntoday with respect to the Railway Labor Act as they were last year \nprior to enactment of the ICC Termination bill.\n  We are not plowing new ground here. We are simply clarifying that \nwhat was law for over 60 years continues to be the law of the land.\n  All the heat and bluster of this debate cannot change this simple \nfact.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in bringing this debate to a close, \npassing the FAA reauthorization bill and righting a technical wrong.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 18 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Massachusetts has \ncompleted, then I have completed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12192-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12193-S12194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                         Senator Howell Heflin\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have already spoken and put in the \nRecord various praiseworthy notes of my association over the years with \nthese outstanding Senators, both Republican and Democrat, who are \nleaving us. None have been closer to me, on the one hand, over on this \nside than Howell Heflin of Alabama. We have been in each other's States \nseveral times. I have gotten to know him and his distinguished wife, \nMike--Elizabeth, I think, is her full name, if I am not mistaken. He is \nwhat someone would call a Senator's Senator. He had to serve in the \nrole as chairman of our Ethics Committee. You can see the sensitivity \nof a Senator's Senator in the regard in any kind of local matter. I see \nthey all have picked up the same thing I thought, or I picked up what \nthey thought, relative to being the peanut Senator. The agricultural \ncommunity in Alabama is going to be missing in representation, to a \ndegree, because no one really can replace Howell Heflin.\n  We in the law field otherwise are going to be penalized because he, \nas a former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has had \nprofound judicial knowledge and also judicial feel for the particular \nstatutes and the issues before this particular body.\n  So I just cap it off by saying that this Senator is going to miss his \nhumor. He has always had a good way of taking these complex human \nproblems and issues and bringing them right down to the ground with \nsome humorous story about someone he remembered back down in Alabama.\n\n\n                        Senator Nancy Kassebaum\n\n  We are fortunate in South Carolina to have the grandchildren of Nancy \nKassebaum. I have always admired her for what the Senator from Rhode \nIsland just said. She is a woman of steel, who makes up her own mind \nand takes the very difficult stands for her politically, because \nsometimes her very colleagues and others around may be voting \notherwise. But you can bet your boots Senator Kassebaum of Kansas has \nstudied, from all angles, a particular problem and made her own \njudgment as to what is fair and right in the interest of the people.\n\n  With respect to our friend, Bill Cohen, he is the one literate \nSenator that we have. I envy him, because in the evenings when we would \nbe attending the various parties and receptions for the different \ngroups visiting from your home State, and otherwise, we would always \nmiss Bill. You would find out Bill is writing another book, reading \nsome important document, or something else. We have read and not only \nheard his poetry and his books, but his sum-up talk here. Just this \npast week, I am getting a copy of that one for the good of the Senate \nand getting it printed, because I think it more or less sums up what \nhas been occurring here in Government and politics, particularly in the \nU.S. Senate, good and bad, over the past 20-some years. We are going to \nmiss him most of all, in my opinion.\n\n\n                            Senator Sam Nunn\n\n  Mr. President, My neighbor is Sam Nunn. No one knows the defense \nbudget better. No one is more conscientious about the Nation's \nsecurity. No one has studied, in depth, the disarmament problem, and no \none has worked to solve these particular problems, and no one has a \ngreater respect for integrity amongst his colleagues than Sam Nunn of \nGeorgia.\n\n\n                          Senator David Pryor\n\n  Mr. President, I now want to mention my friend, David Pryor. I hope \nwe can get him back here by morning. As we all know, his wonderful son \nhas been under surgery down in Texas. And, of course, that is his first \nobligation, and we all understand that. We need every vote we can \npossibly get, but the most popular, obviously--and everybody will \nagree--was David Pryor's, because Pryor always had a good word for \neveryone, and he centered on those things, such as the taxpayers' \nrelief from the IRS, and something about the drug companies, or \nwhatever it was. He went into it and stuck with it and then listened to \nthe other Senators with respect to their particular interests.\n\n[[Page S12194]]\n\n That is the value of service in the U.S. Senate--education. We are \nsupposed to learn. And that is why I have always stayed in politics, \nbecause I learn something new every day. I have also learned when to \nhush when the hour is past 6 o'clock and staff is looking at me like an \naberration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

A bill to provide for the retention of the name of the \nmountain at the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming known as \n``Devils Tower'', and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n             THE DEVILS TOWER NATIONAL MONUMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which will \nenable Devils Tower National Monument to retain its historic name.\n  This national monument--indeed, our Nation's first national \nmonument--has been known as ``Devils Tower'' for over 120 years. It is \nknown the world over as perhaps one of the most distinguishing natural \nfeatures of my State and is universally known for providing some of the \nbest crack climbing in the world.\n  In short, Mr. President, Devils Tower--and worldwide recognition of \nit, even through such movies as ``Close Encounters of the Third \nKind''--is vitally important to my State, which depends so heavily on \nour tourism industry. But, to no one's surprise, there are always those \nout there who cannot leave a perfectly good thing alone. William \nShakespeare said it well in ``King Lear'': ``Striving to better, oft we \nmar what's well.''\n  According to a July 17, 1996 release by the U.S. Board of Geographic \nNames, the National Park Service has advised the Board that several \nnative American groups intend to submit a proposal--it may already have \nbeen submitted--to change the name of the monument. The intention--and \na perfectly worthy one--is to find a name that is less offensive to \nnative Americans, many of whom regard the monument as sacred.\n  Mr. President, I am fully sensitive to the feelings of those involved \nwith this initiative. My great-grandfather, Finn Burnett, was asked to \nbe the ``boss farmer'' for Chief Washaki of the Shoshone Tribe. And my \ngreat uncle Deck married a full-blooded Shoshone. However, I do join my \nHouse counterpart, Congresswoman Barbara Cubin, in earnestly believing \nthat little will be gained from a name change, and much history and \ntradition could be lost.\n\n  Be aware that there is no obvious traditional Indian name standing as \nthe obvious alternative designation. The disparate native American \ngroups behind this proposal cannot even agree on what the proper name \nshould be. They seem only to agree on what it should not be--Devils \nTower.\n  The number of suggested ``aboriginal names'' is as numerous as the \nnumber of different groups clamoring for the change. Among the \ncandidates are Bear's Lodge, Grizzly Bear's Lodge, Bear's Tipi, Bear's \nLair, Bear Lodge, Bear Lodge Butte, Tree Rock, and many others. So we \nshould all understand that this is not a matter of changing the name of \nDevils Tower back to another which would be widely agreed upon and \nrecognized by most native Americans. Instead, this initiative seems to \naccomplish little more than to dredge up age-old conflicts and \ndivisions between descendants of European settlers and descendants of \nnative Americans. This is most unfortunate and would result only in \neconomic hardship for the area's citizens--``Indian'' and ``non-\nIndian'' alike. My legislation would prevent such hardship and preserve \nthe name of Devils Tower, a name widely recognized and certainly the \nfurthest thing from being offensive to any particular ethnic group. I \nurge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 2189. A bill to enhance the administrative authority of the \npresident of Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n the southwestern indian polytechnic institute administrative systems \n                              act of 1996\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, with Senator Domenici, I \nam introducing the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute \nAdministrative Systems Act of 1996.\n  The Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute [SIPI] is a first class \ncommunity college in Albuquerque, NM. It offers vocational and academic \ncourses to Indian students from across the country and from all tribes. \nSIPI has recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, and has developed a \nlong-term plan for expansion of its physical plant and its \ninstructional program.\n  SIPI is currently operating as a BIA-funded organization governed by \nthe personnel rules of a Federal agency. These rules are not \nappropriate for an academic institute. For the last year and a half I \nhave been working with the Committee on Indian Affairs to find a way to \ngive the president and board of regents of SIPI control over their own \npersonnel policies.\n  The purpose of this act is to enhance the authority of the president \nand board at SIPI to hire and promote faculty appropriately, allowing \nthem to function more like other academic institutions. I applaud \nSenator Kassebaum for the excellent work she has done to develop \nsimilar legislation for Haskell Indian Nations University, offering \nHaskell the same kind of improvements in their personnel policies. \nSenator Domenici and I hope to work with her and Senator Inouye and \nothers to ensure that both of these institutions are provided \nadministrative authority to operate their personnel policies well and \nappropriately. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southwestern Indian \n     Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the provision of culturally sensitive experiences and \n     vocationally relevant curricula at Southwestern Indian \n     Polytechnic Institute is consistent with the commitment of \n     the Federal Government to the fulfillment of treaty \n     obligations to Indian tribes through the principle of self-\n     determination and the use of Federal resources; and\n       (2) giving a greater degree of autonomy to Southwestern \n     Indian Polytechnic Institute, while maintaining the institute \n     as an integral part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will \n     facilitate the administration and improvement of the academic \n     programs of the institute.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Institute.--The term ``institute'' means the \n     Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute, located in \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 4. PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Inapplicability of Certain Civil Service Laws.--\n     Chapters 51, 53, and 63 of title 5, United States Code \n     (relating to classification, pay, and leave, respectively) \n     and the provisions of such title relating to the appointment, \n     performance evaluation, promotion, and removal of civil \n     service employees shall not apply to applicants

During his time on the board he made many contributions to \nhis community and to his State.\n  Many contributions have been made to his community during his terms \nas a county commissioner. They include bringing the computer age to the \nlocal courthouse and library. The building of a new jail which will be \npaid for next year, and expanding the park system and improving the \nhighways.\n  For 33 years Bill taught high school government and civics to \nstudents at Mankato High and Mankato West. Bill is a firm believer in \nthe good of government, and feels that it is the public's \nresponsibility not to take our democracy for granted. And, he practices \nwhat he preaches. You participate in a democracy by voting, by keeping \ninformed, and in Bill's case, running for office in order to make \nthings change.\n  His public service has also included 2 years in the U.S. Armed Forces \nin the U.S. Army. Throughout his life, Bill's career has been \ninterspersed with athletic coaching, baseball umpiring and police \nreserve and civil defense work, as well as dedicated church and \ncommunity service.\n  I commend Bill Schimmel on his many contributions over the years, and \njoin with his family, friends, and colleagues in extending my warmest \nwishes for a well deserved retirement. Indefagitable, Bill will \ncontinue to remain active in the community he loves.\n  Congratulations Bill, you're an inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12197-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12197-S12198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT HISTORY MONTH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of Franklin Roosevelt's most \nfamous speeches is commonly referred to as the ``four freedoms'' \nspeech. He said:\n\n       We look forward to a world founded upon four essential \n     human freedoms. The first is freedom of speech and \n     expression--everywhere in the world. The second is freedom of \n     every person to worship God in his own way--everywhere in the \n     world. The third is freedom from want--everywhere in the \n     world. The fourth is freedom from fear--everywhere in the \n     world.\n\n  These optimistic words were spoken less than 1 year before the \nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It was an anxious time for America. \nThe United States was very reluctant to get involved in another war, \nbut the spread of Hitler's empire across Europe and into northern \nAfrica demanded a call to action. The U.S. Army was so unprepared for \nany conflict that it was training with broomsticks for machine guns and \nsacks of flour for mortar fire.\n  In the wake of Pearl Harbor, the country was in shock and fearful of \nattack. Guns were placed on top of Washington, DC, buildings and Army \nunits in American cities were put on alert to be on the lookout for \nenemy planes. However, President Roosevelt's confidence in the face of \nadversity was contagious. He called on the country to put down \neverything and concentrate on beating the enemy. Millions of men \nenlisted to defend freedom. Roosevelt mobilized the country to make \nweapons of war at levels that many critics called unrealistic. Women \nflocked into the workplace at unprecedented levels to fill the labor \nshortage. On the homefront, everything from Sunday automobile drives to \nmeat and butter were sacrificed to provide for the men on the front \nlines. The greatest sacrifice among the many sacrifices which America \ngave for the war effort was the loss of many lives among a generation \nof the country's finest young men and women.\n  Roosevelt kept the country updated on the war effort through his \nfireside chats. They were so popular that stores ran out of world maps \nbecause so many citizens were following along with the President at \nhome. The President had a unique ability to convey to the American \npeople the seriousness and grave nature of the situation that America \nfound itself in, while at the same time showing unqualified confidence \nin the American people to get the job done.\n\n  One cannot properly speak of Franklin Roosevelt without considerable\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\nmention of his wife Eleanor. When President Roosevelt was struck with \npolio, Eleanor Roosevelt represented him in places that he could not \nreach. She toured the country and reported back to her husband on what \nshe had heard. She was one of his closest and most trusted advisers.\n  While not an adviser, the Roosevelt's dog, Fala, provided \ncompanionship for the President in very difficult times. It was \nreported that the President was rarely seen without the dog trailing \nclose behind. Even the Roosevelt dog was not immune from political \nattacks, however. Following one such attack, Roosevelt remarked, \n``Well, of course, I don't resent attacks, and my family doesn't resent \nattacks, but Fala does resent them--his Scotch soul was furious. * * * \nHe has not been the same dog since.''\n  Roosevelt was elected President in 1932 at the depth of the Great \nDepression and he died while serving as President in April 1945, \nshortly before the surrender of Germany in World War II. During those \nyears, the world underwent a tidal change, which touched the lives of \neveryone then and since. It is the ultimate testament to President \nRoosevelt that he was reelected an unprecedented three times during \nsuch a turbulent era, proving both his effectiveness and immense \npopularity.\n  In fighting the Depression, he was able to use the Federal Government \nas an effective tool in getting people working again. Through the U.S. \nvictory in World War II, Roosevelt positioned the United States in a \nleadership position in world affairs that has lasted for over 50 years. \nWe continue to reap the benefits of his leadership today.\n  Yesterday, October 1, 1996, marked the first day of Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt History Month.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues the inspiring story of Sigmund Nissenbaum of Warsaw, Poland, \nwhich was brought to my attention by a group of distinguished American \nRabbis--headed by Grand Rabbi Shmuel Teitelbaum and Rabbi Hertz Frankel \nof Brooklyn--who recently returned from Poland where they helped \nrededicate three historic Jewish cemeteries which had been almost \ncompletely destroyed by 50 years of neglect and vandalism.\n  Sigmund Nissenbaum, a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, has \ndevoted his life to keeping alive and protecting the one-glorious \nJewish heritage of Poland. For almost 1,000 years before 1939, Poland \nhad the world's largest Jewish population. The vast majority of \nPoland's 3 million Jews were killed by the Nazis, and most of the \nsurvivors were driven into exile by the post-war Communist regime. \nDuring these trying days, Sigmund Nissenbaum--often almost \nsinglehandedly--battled against overwhelming odds to protect Poland's \nJewish cemeteries.\n  The collapse of the Communist government in 1989 allowed Mr. \nNissenbaum to solicit support for his endeavors from Jews residing in \nthe United States and Israel, leading to the creation of the Nissenbaum \nFoundation. For the past 7 years, this foundation has institutionalized \nthe life work of Sigmund Nissenbaum, erecting memorials to the victims \nof the Holocaust in several Polish cities and restoring over a dozen \nhistoric cemeteries.\n  Rabbi Hertz Frankel reports that he has:\n\n       . . . personally observed Mr. Nissenbaum gathering \n     skeletons from cemeteries which had been trampled by \n     hooligans. His compassion, care and conscience are an \n     inspiration to Jews throughout the world, and to Polish non-\n     Jews as well. The current Polish government and Catholic \n     Church leaders have noted his historic role in helping to \n     restore a measure of dignity to the final resting place of so \n     many of his people.\n\n  I know I speak for the entire Senate when I congratulate Sigmund \nNissenbaum, who recently celebrated his 70th birthday, and wish him \nmany more years of success in his life's sacred work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12198-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12198-S12200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last week marked the 35th \nanniversary of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, whose \npurpose is to reduce threats to the United States through arms control, \nnonproliferation, and disarmament. It is the only agency of its kind in \nthe U.S. Government, or, in fact, the world.\n  This is a bittersweet anniversary for the agency. On the one hand, it \njust has witnessed the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in \nNew York. ACDA was at the forefront of advocating and negotiating this \ntreaty, which represents an historic achievement by banning all nuclear \nexplosions worldwide.\n  On the other hand, however, arms control efforts have just been dealt \na great setback by virtue of the Senate's decision not to take up the \nChemical Weapons Convention this year. I would like to take this \nopportunity to express my strong support for the Chemical Weapons \nConvention [CWC] and my concern over the delay in giving advice and \nconsent to its ratification.\n  The Chemical Weapons Convention is an unprecedented international \nagreement designed to eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Unlike earlier protocols which prohibit only the use of \nchemical weapons, this Convention aims at stopping their production, \ntransfer, and storage by providing incentives to participation, \nverification of compliance, and penalties for violation. It now has \nbeen signed by 160 countries and ratified by 64. The United States is \nthe only G-7 country not to have ratified it. All of our major trading \npartners have done so. And many of the countries whose adherence is \nmost important will not ratify it if the United States does not.\n  The CWC has been before the Senate for consideration for nearly 3 \nyears now. During that period, Senators from every relevant committee \nhave had ample opportunity to examine the convention and to address the \nissues that have been raised in connection with it. The Foreign \nRelations Committee, for example, has held 8 public hearings and 1 \nclosed hearing, with 31 separate witnesses, along with numerous \nbriefings in open and closed session, since the spring of 1994. The \nArmed Services Committee has held three hearings on the military \nimplications of the treaty, and additional hearings have been held in \nthe Intelligence Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, and, \nmore recently, the Judiciary Committee. On April 25, 1996, the Foreign \nRelations Committee reported a bipartisan resolution of ratification, \naddressing all the major issues that were raised during the course of \nconsideration of the convention.\n  This treaty will not make the threat of chemical weapons \nautomatically disappear from the face of the earth. But it will \nconstrain the proliferation of chemical weapons, it will establish \ninternational norms and standards against them, and it will make it \nharder for rogue regimes and terrorists to gain access to them. It will \ndeter covert chemical weapons programs by making them much more \ndifficult and expensive--legally, morally, and financially--to \nmaintain. There is currently no legal regime prohibiting the \ndevelopment, production, storage, and transfer of chemical weapons, and \ntherefore no legal basis on which to challenge chemical weapons \nprograms.\n  I believe there are three major reasons why this treaty will serve \nAmerican interests, and why a failure to ratify it could have \ndevastating repercussions.\n  First, the CWC requires others to join us in doing something we \nalready plan to do. As a matter of U.S. policy we have already decided \nto destroy our current stockpile of chemical weapons. There is a \nprovision in law, first signed by President Reagan, that we eliminate \nour chemical weapons by the year 2004. We are going to do that \nregardless of what happens with this treaty, because we think that is a \nwise thing to do. The leaders of our military services have agreed that \nwe can effectively deter the use of chemical weapons without \nthreatening retaliation in kind. In short, we don't need chemical \nweapons and we don't want them.\n  The value of this treaty is that it brings along many other countries \nin\n\n[[Page S12199]]\n\nagreeing to do the same thing. So rather than taking a unilateral \naction, we will be establishing a basis for others to take similar \naction. As Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark, Director of Strategic Plans and \nPolicy in the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told the \nForeign Relations Committee:\n\n       The convention's imposition of an internationally \n     recognizable obligation to destroy all chemical weapons \n     essentially places all other CW capable state parties on an \n     equal footing with the United States. Because of the \n     convention's trade restrictions and provisions, proliferators \n     outside the convention will find it increasingly more \n     difficult to acquire the chemical precursors essential to \n     building a chemical weapons stockpile.\n\n  Similarly, Stanley Weiss, chairman of Business Executives for \nNational Security, wrote in the Washington Times:\n\n       Without the treaty, the United States can only act \n     unilaterally against nations like China, believed to be \n     assisting Iran to develop chemical weapons. With the CWC in \n     force, those countries who do business with rogue nations run \n     the risk of being cut from nearly every trading nation on the \n     planet.\n\n  The second major reason this treaty is in our interests is because it \nwill provide us with better information about what other countries are \ndoing in the area of chemical weapons. We know that the verification \nregime in this treaty is not perfect. There will probably be countries \nor agencies that will cheat on this agreement, and there are others who \nmay not sign it. But if we are party to the treaty, we will have an \nopportunity to investigate and inspect potential violations. We will \nhave access to information about what those countries are doing. In \nfact, Secretary of Defense Perry argued:\n\n       . . .while we recognize that detecting illicit production \n     of small quantities of CW will be extremely difficult, we \n     also recognize that would be even more difficult without a \n     CWC. In fact, the CWC verification regime, through its \n     declaration, routine inspection, fact-finding, consultation \n     and challenge inspections, should prove effective in \n     providing a wealth of information on possible CW programs \n     that simply would not be available without the convention.\n\n  Likewise, then-CIA Director James Woolsey noted that ``We will know \nmore about the state of chemical warfare preparations in the world with \nthe treaty than we would know without it.''\n  The point is that we are going to have to monitor potential \nviolations in either case. Regardless of whether there is a treaty or \nnot, regardless of whether we ratify it or not, our intelligence \nagencies will need to collect information about chemical weapons \nproduction and possession by other countries. But if we participate in \nthe Convention, we will have more avenues to learn about those \nviolations, and we will have an opportunity that we otherwise would not \nhave to conduct challenge inspections.\n  Moreover, any violations that are discovered will be made known to \nthe world and receive universal condemnation. The treaty in effect \ncreates an international mechanism for identifying and exposing \nviolators. As Secretary of State Christopher pointed out to the Foreign \nRelations Committee, ``By ratifying the Convention, we will add the \nforce and weight of the entire international community to our efforts \nto assure the destruction of Russian chemical stocks. Our action will \nalso spur other nations such as China to ratify and join the regime.'' \nAn op-ed by Amy Smithson in the Baltimore Sun last year noted that \n``the Senate's consent to ratification of the CWC would help open \nRussian storage sites to international scrutiny, allowing inspectors to \ninventory and secure these weapons. If the Senate ratifies the treaty, \nwhich will ban the development, production, stockpiling and use of \nchemical weapons, pressure will increase for Russia to do the same.''\n  Third, a failure to ratify would put U.S. interests at a distinct \ndisadvantage. If the CWC enters into force without us, then U.S. \nchemical manufacturers will immediately find themselves under economic \nsanctions. They will immediately have to obtain end-user certificates \nfor the sale of certain chemicals abroad, and after 3 years they will \nnot be able to export them at all. Indeed, a letter signed by the CEO's \nof 53 of the largest chemical firms in the country warns as follows:\n\n       Our industry's status as the world's preferred supplier of \n     chemical products may be jeopardized if the U.S. does not \n     ratify the Convention. If the Senate does not vote in favor \n     of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying \n     American jobs.\n\n  So the consequences of not approving the treaty will be very \nconsiderable both on U.S. industry and for our overall national \ninterests. Unfortunately, this appears to be a situation in which \npartisan political considerations have played an important role. On \nthis point, I ask that three editorials, from the Washington Post, the \nNew York Times, and the Baltimore Sun, be inserted in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Some of the arguments that have been made against this treaty are \nvery difficult to follow. On the one hand, opponents have argued that \nit does not allow anytime, anywhere inspections, and thus that some \nviolations might go undetected. But it was the Bush administration that \ndecided, as a matter of protecting U.S. national interests, that we did \nnot want to have anytime, anywhere inspections because that would \njeopardize our trade secrets and national security, and possibly \nviolate constitutional rights. So it was the United States, under a \nRepublican administration, that decided not to include unrestricted \ninspections.\n  On the other hand, opponents contend that the treaty is too intrusive \nand allows international investigators too much latitude in inspecting \nU.S. facilities. I find this argument surprising when the chemical \nmanufacturers themselves are strongly supporting this treaty. In the \nletter that I cited earlier, the CEO's state:\n\n       Our industry participated in negotiating the agreement and \n     in U.S. and international implementation efforts. The treaty \n     contains substantial protections for confidential business \n     information (CBI). We know, because industry helped to draft \n     the CBI provisions. Chemical companies also helped test the \n     draft CWC reporting system, and we tested the on-site \n     inspection procedures that will help verify compliance with \n     the treaty. In short, our industry has thoroughly examined \n     and tested this Convention. We have concluded that the \n     benefits of the CWC far outweigh the costs.\n\n  How can it be argued that the inspections regime is too rigorous, and \nat the very same time that it is not rigorous enough? Both the Bush \nadministration and the Clinton administration, after thorough review, \nhave concluded that the balance obtained in this treaty is fair and \nreasonable. As former President Bush wrote in a letter to Senators Pell \nand Lugar in July 1994:\n\n       The United States worked hard to ensure that the Convention \n     could be effectively verified. At the same time, we sought \n     the means to protect both United States security interests \n     and commercial capabilities. I am convinced that the \n     Convention we signed served both objectives, effectively \n     banning chemical weapons without creating an unnecessary \n     burden on legitimate activities.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a Convention that was negotiated and signed by \nRepublican administrations and has received broad bipartisan support. \nWe have heard testimony from the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nabout the importance of this treaty to U.S. national interests. Gen. \nJohn Shalikashvili testified that ``from a military perspective, the \nChemical Weapons Convention is clearly in our national interest.'' \nSecretary of Defense William J. Perry, along with Attorney General \nJanet Reno, wrote in a recent op-ed for the Washington Post:\n\n       The case for ratification is compelling on both military \n     and law enforcement grounds. . . . Destroying existing \n     chemical weapons and preventing potential enemies from \n     obtaining them will unmistakably strengthen America's \n     defense, which is why both Presidents Reagan and Bush, \n     together with America's military leaders, have strongly \n     supported the conclusion of such a treaty. . . .By moving \n     forward on the Chemical Weapons Convention, the United States \n     also will greatly improve its law enforcement capabilities \n     for investigating and prosecuting those who plan chemical-\n     weapons attacks. . . . To increase the battlefield safety of \n     our troops and fight terror here and around the globe, the \n     Senate should ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention now.\n\n  I think it is unfortunate that the treaty has been deferred until \nnext year. Here we had an opportunity to move forward on an agreement \nthat clearly would promote American interests, increase American \nsecurity, and preserve American leadership. I regret that was not done, \nand I urge that it be taken up promptly in the next Congress.\n  The articles follow:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 15, 1996]\n\n                            Treaty Turnabout\n\n       For the better part of a decade Sen. Robert Dole was a part \n     of the legion of Republicans,\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\n     including Ronald Reagan, George Bush, James Baker, Brent \n     Scowcroft, Colin Powell and Richard Lugar, who supported \n     writing a treaty to outlaw poison gas. Last week, on the eve \n     of a Senate vote on ratification, Mr. Dole indicated that he \n     had changed his mind and joined the opposition to the treaty \n     of his former Senate colleagues Trent Lott, Jesse Helms, Jon \n     Kyl and others.\n       It is hard to believe the political campaign had nothing to \n     do with the candidate's flip-flop, although Mr. Dole does \n     cite reasons. He suggests he had reservations about the \n     treaty's coverage--the rogue states that are its prime target \n     will surely reject it--and about its enforceability, which \n     under the best of circumstances will not be foolproof. Others \n     who are not running for office have also cited these views, \n     but we think there are strong arguments against them. The \n     treaty does not immediately reach the rogues, but it does \n     create a legal and political framework in which they can be \n     better isolated and pursued. The implicit opposition \n     alternative of a treaty with full coverage simply does not \n     exist. Again, enforcement will not be total under this \n     treaty, but here is a case where the best is the enemy of the \n     good. Enforcement will be better than it is without a treaty, \n     and practice can make it better still.\n       Mr. Dole cites the situation of American chemical companies \n     which, he believes, would suffer under unacceptably intrusive \n     inspection obligations. But the companies themselves have \n     greeted the treaty as a welcome and bearable liberation of \n     their exports from the onus of contributing to rogue chemical \n     stocks. The former majority leader seems unaware that the \n     ``unilateral chemical disarmament'' that he now opposes was \n     begun by President Reagan. The American military does not \n     want a weapon that is irrelevant to deterrence and more \n     dangerous to handle than any conceivable battlefield benefit \n     warrants.\n       The treaty has been pulled, not killed. In other political \n     circumstances, it can be sent back up to the Senate. But \n     meanwhile, the ratifications of other states will bring it \n     into effect. As a result, the American government will be \n     frozen out of the treaty's initial application--this can only \n     warm the poison gas crowd--and the American chemical industry \n     will risk a cutoff of tens of billions of dollars in exports. \n     We don't believe that's in the United States' national \n     interest or Mr. Dole's, for that matter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 15, 1996]\n\n                      Mr. Dole Bumps a Good Treaty\n\n       It is not uncommon for election-year politics to \n     contaminate Congressional lawmaking, but a vitally important \n     international treaty should not be cynically sacrificed for \n     political advantage. That is what happened last week when Bob \n     Dole reached back into the Senate to block the expected \n     approval of an agreement banning the development, production, \n     stockpiling, sale and use of chemical weapons.\n       In so doing, Mr. Dole derailed a treaty negotiated by the \n     Administrations of his Republican brethren Ronald Reagan and \n     George Bush, and supported by Republicans and Democrats. \n     Though Mr. Dole offered many policy objections, the real \n     point was to pick a fight with President Clinton and deny him \n     the afterglow of a diplomatic achievement.\n       As the Senate vote approached last week, Mr. Dole, who had \n     not previously opposed the agreement, chimed in with a letter \n     to the majority leader, Trent Lott, urging that approval be \n     withheld until the accord had been accepted by virtually \n     every other country in the world and there was assurance that \n     even the smallest violations could be detected. Fearing they \n     could no longer count on the 67 votes needed for approval, \n     treaty sponsors pulled the measure, dooming it in this \n     Congress. It can be brought back for a vote next year.\n       No treaty can absolutely prevent terrorists and other \n     outlaws from smuggling small quantities of chemical weapons. \n     But the Chemical Weapons Convention, already signed by 160 \n     nations and ratified by 63, could make it much harder for \n     countries like Iraq, or criminals like the group that \n     unleashed lethal sarin gas in the Tokyo subways last year, to \n     obtain toxic chemicals or their ingredients.\n       American military leaders, responsible politicians of both \n     parties and the American chemical industry all favor the \n     treaty.\n       The convention, including its verification system and \n     severe restrictions on chemical purchases from countries that \n     have not ratified, is now likely to go into effect without \n     the United States, potentially costing the American chemical \n     industry billions of dollars in lost exports.\n       Mr. Dole complained that the convention imposed intrusive \n     paperwork on American industry and risked the trade secrets \n     of American chemical manufacturers. But the agreement's \n     inspection and paperwork provisions were negotiated in close \n     cooperation with the chemical industry.\n       The United States is already destroying most of its own \n     chemical weapons arsenal, and current Pentagon doctrine \n     excludes the use of these weapons even in response to a \n     chemical attack.\n       Mr. Dole's new scorched-earth strategy in Congress was not \n     limited to the chemical weapons treaty. To insure that the \n     President cannot claim credit for enactment of an immigration \n     bill this year, Mr. Dole is now pressing to give states the \n     right to deny a public education to the children of illegal \n     immigrants. He knows that provision would lead either to \n     defeat the bill in the Senate or to a Clinton veto.\n       At least this particular maneuver would do little harm \n     since the immigration bill is filled with other unacceptable \n     provisions. But imperiling the Chemical Weapons Convention is \n     trifling with the national interest. It is a measure of his \n     desperation that Mr. Dole would seek to stir his becalmed \n     campaign by blocking such an important and beneficial treaty.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Sept. 14, 1996]\n\n                  Dole's Re-Entry Into Senate Affairs\n\n       So great is the Republican impulse to deny President \n     Clinton bill-signing ceremonies before the November election \n     that his opponent, Bob Dole, has slipped into a negative \n     posture that strikes us as dumb politics. Acting somewhat as \n     Senate majority leader in absentia, Citizen Dole has used his \n     influence with some former colleagues to ditch two key pieces \n     of legislation--a wide-ranging reform of immigration laws and \n     ratification of a Chemical Weapons Convention crafted during \n     the Bush administration.\n       Both measures are believed to have fairly wide public \n     support. Both are now in coma due to poison pill amendments \n     prescribed by Mr. Dole. One can only hope that after election \n     passions wane, wiser counsels will prevail.\n       The roadblock on immigration reform is due to a Dole-backed \n     amendment that would allow states to deny public schooling to \n     children of illegal immigrants. ``I can't believe they are \n     doing this,'' lamented Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., an ally of \n     the GOP nominee for president.\n       The treaty dealing with poison gas was put on the back \n     burner after the Clinton administration spurned killer \n     amendments that would have prevented its implementation until \n     Iraq, Libya and North Korea ratify it, thus giving these \n     rogue states veto power. Another Republican, Sen. Richard \n     Lugar of Indiana, said the whole process has been \n     ``politicized'' in ways harmful to U.S. foreign policy.\n       The Chemical Manufacturers Association, fearful of setbacks \n     in international trade, complained that treaty opponents have \n     ``disfigured and distorted [it] beyond recognition.'' But \n     hard-line unilateralists, such as Sens. Jesse Helms and Jon \n     Kyl, contend that international controls under the convention \n     would add to the costs of small chemical companies.\n       It is a shame that a treaty aimed at reducing stockpiles of \n     mustard gas, nerve agents and other deadly chemicals has \n     fallen victim to U.S. domestic politics. This country was its \n     foremost advocate, not least because an estimated 30,000 tons \n     of Russian chemical weapons are vulnerable to theft and \n     misuse by terrorists and pariah governments. Now Moscow can \n     continue to abstain. Now the votes of only a handful of \n     foreign nations can put the treaty into effect without U.S. \n     participation.\n       Just as the U.S. needs to control immigration, so it needs \n     to play a leading role in policing a treaty that would ban \n     manufacture as well as use of chemical weaponry. Once the \n     election is over, both issues require resurrection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12198-2", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12200-S12201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INTERNATIONAL FAMILY PLANNING ASSISTANCE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate version of the Foreign \nOperations bill included my amendment to provide $410 million for \ninternational family planning assistance, an increase of $54 million \nabove last year's level. That amendment also deleted a House provision \nwhich would have penalized private organizations that use their own \nfunds for abortions, even where abortion is legal.\n  This is the remaining issue to be decided in the conference on this \nbill, and it is now in the hands of the White House and the House and \nSenate leadership. I appreciate the White House's support for my \nposition. This is an issue of critical importance to the welfare of \nhundreds of millions of women around the world, especially in poor \ncountries where family planning services are often lacking or \ninadequate.\n  Last year, after going back and forth with the House several times on \nthis same issue, the House sent us a provision that resulted in a \ndrastic cut in funding for family planning. Chairman Hatfield, who has \nconsistently voted pro-life, opposed that provision, as did I, because \nit cut family planning services to millions of women with the \ninevitable result that there would be an increase in unwanted \npregnancies and abortions.\n  But the House recessed immediately after, and in order to avoid \nanother Government shutdown the Senate reluctantly acquiesced in the \nHouse provision. I, and I know others feel likewise, do not want to see \na repeat of that fiasco.\n  This year, the House included a provision which not only continues \nthe one-third cut in funding for family\n\n[[Page S12201]]\n\nplanning, but it also included a version of the Mexico City policy by \nimposing restrictions on what private organizations can do with their \nown money in order to receive U.S. Government funds.\n  Why we would want to do that when there are hundreds of millions of \npeople who want family planning services but cannot get it, and the \nworld is struggling with the enormous pressures of over a billion \npeople living in poverty already, is beyond me.\n  I understand the herculean efforts that Congressman Callahan and \nothers on the House side have made to try to resolve this matter in a \nway that does not damage the Agency for International Development's \nfamily planning program. I also greatly appreciate the tireless efforts \nof Senator Hatfield, who has tried every conceivable approach to \nreconcile the House and Senate provisions.\n  However, I urge the administration to stand firmly on the side of \nwomen, on unrestricted access to family planning, and on the right of \nprivate organizations to use their funds as they see fit--including for \nabortions, consistent with the laws of the countries where they \noperate. At a time when the world's population will double in the next \n50 years and 90 percent of the new births will occur in countries that \ncannot even feed and care for their own people today, there is no more \npressing issue for American leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12200-1", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GLENORA G.

In 1977, Glenora joined several other committed \nmembers of the community to found the Flint neighborhood improvement \nand preservation project, and the Flint neighborhood coalition.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting \ntoday to pass the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, legislation Senator \nKohl and I introduced earlier this year to combat economic espionage. \nThis bill addresses an issue of critical importance to our Nation's \neconomic well-being. It is a testament to the importance of the issue \nthat we are able to act in a bipartisan fashion on the eve of national \nelections.\n  As chairman of both the Select Committee on Intelligence and the \nJudiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and \nGovernment Information, with jurisdiction over legal matters involving \ntechnology, I have been concerned with the threat posed to American \neconomic competitiveness in a global economy by the theft of \nintellectual property and trade secrets.\n  In an increasingly complex and competitive economic world, \nintellectual property forms a critical component of our economy. As \ntraditional industries shift to low-wage producers in developing \ncountries, our economic edge depends to an ever-increasing degree on \nthe ability of our businesses and inventors to stay one step ahead of \nthose in other countries. And American business and inventors have been \nextremely successful and creative in developing intellectual property \nand trade secrets. America leads the nation's of the world in \ndeveloping new products and new technologies. Millions of jobs depend \non the continuation of the productive minds of Americans, both native \nborn and immigrants who find the freedom here to try new ideas and add \nto our economic strength.\n  Inventing new and better technologies, production methods, and the \nlike, can be expensive. American companies and the U.S. Government \nspend billions on research and development. The benefits reaped from \nthese expenditures can easily come to nothing, however, if a competitor \ncan simply steal\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\nthe trade secret without expending the development costs. While prices \nmay be reduced, ultimately the incentives for new invention disappear, \nalong with jobs, capital investment, and everything else that keeps our \neconomy strong.\n  For years now, there has been mounting evidence that many foreign \nnations and their corporations have been seeking to gain competitive \nadvantage by stealing the trade secrets, the intangible intellectual \nproperty of inventors in this country. The Intelligence Committee has \nbeen aware that since the end of the cold war, foreign nations have \nincreasingly put their espionage resources to work trying to steal \nAmerican economic secrets. Estimates of the loss to U.S. business from \nthe theft of intangible intellectual property exceed $100 billion. The \nloss in U.S. jobs is incalculable.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who wish more detail about the \nnature and scope of the problem of economic espionage, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the article ``The Lure of the Steal'' from the \nMarch 4, 1996, U.S. News & World Report, and an article by Peter \nSchweizer, ``The Growth of Economic Espionage--America if Target Number \nOne'' from the January-February 1996 edition of Foreign Affairs be \nprinted at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a major problem for law enforcement in \nresponding to the increase in such thefts has been a glaring gap in \nFederal law. For many years, the United States has had a variety of \ntheft statutes in the United States Code. These laws are derived \nprimarily from the common law of theft. For example, it violates \nFederal law to move stolen property across State lines. In order to \nviolate such laws, however, the courts have held that the property \nstolen cannot be intangible property, such as trade secrets or \nintellectual property. In addition, theft usually requires that the \nthief take the property with the intention of depriving the lawful \nowner of its use. But such a test if useless when a person copies \nsoftware and leaves the original software with the lawful owner, taking \nonly the secrets on the software but leaving the physical property. The \nlawful owner still has full use of the property, but its value is \nsignificantly reduced.\n  In order to update Federal law to address the technological and \neconomic realities of the end of the 20th century, I began working \nearlier this year with Senator Kohl and officials from the Department \nof Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation on developing \nlegislation. We developed two separate bills, that were introduced as \nS. 1556 and S. 1557. The former bill broadly prohibited the theft of \nproprietary economic information by any person. The latter bill was \nmore narrowly drawn to proscribe such thefts by foreign nations and \nthose working on behalf of foreign nations.\n  At the end of February, I chaired a joint hearing of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology, and \nGovernment Information on the issue of economic espionage. Continuing \nto work closely with members of the Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees, the administration, and various industry groups, Senator \nKohl and I were able to produce the bill the Senate is today \nconsidering.\n  The Senate adopted S. 1556 with an amendment I offered, based on S. \n1557, to bring together into a single vehicle the prohibition on the \ntheft of trade secrets and proprietary information by both private \nindividuals and corporations and by foreign governments and those \nacting on their behalf, and passed them using H.R. 3723, the House \ncompanion bill, as the vehicle. The language of my amendment dealing \nwith foreign-government-sponsored economic espionage was, with minor \nchanges, unanimously reported to the Senate by the Intelligence \nCommittee earlier this year as part of the Intelligence Authorization \nAct. We have now reconciled the Senate- and House-passed bills in this \nagreement, which also incorporates several unrelated provisions. \nSenator Kohl and I are inserting into the Record a managers' statement \nwhich reflects the understanding of the bill's sponsors on the intent \nbehind and meaning of the economic espionage bill.\n  Adoption of this bill will not be a panacea, but it is a start. \nCongress has started moving to protect U.S. economic interests. For \nexample, earlier this year we enacted strong anticounterfeiting \nlegislation, S. 1136, to protect American business from counterfeit \ngoods. This bill addresses cognate problems. Both are only a start. \nCorporations must exercise vigilance over their trade secrets and \nproprietary information. Contract law may provide civil remedies. In \naddition, some States have adopted legislation to allow the owners of \ntrade secrets to use civil process to protect their ownership rights. \nWe have been made aware that available civil remedies may not be \nadequate to the task and that a Federal civil cause of action is \nneeded. This is an issue we need to study carefully, and will do so \nnext year.\n\n  For helping to make sure that this legislation was passed this year, \nI want to thank Senator Kohl for his leadership, and acknowledge the \nwork of his excellent staff, Jon Leibowitz and Victoria Bassetti. I \nalso want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch, and his staff, especially Paul Larkin and Pat Murphy, for their \nvaluable contributions to this legislation. I would also be remiss if I \ndid not also thank Chairman McCollum of the House Crime Subcommittee, \nand Representative Schumer, ranking member of that Subcommittee, and \ntheir staff, Glenn Schmitt and Bill McGeveran, for their hard work. \nFinally, we worked closely with the Justice Department and the Federal \nBureau of Investigation in developing this legislation, and I want to \nthank Alan Hoffman of the Justice Department and Pat Kelly of the FBI \nfor their hard work on this bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Mar. 4, 1996]\n\n                         The Lure of the Steal\n\n               (By Douglas Pasternak with Gordon Witkin)\n\n       Not long ago, Subrahmanyam M. Kota went into hamsters--or, \n     to be more precise, their ovary cells. That was a big switch \n     for Kota. In the 1980s, he allegedly sold military secrets on \n     infrared detectors to the KGB. With the cold war over, \n     however, hamster ovaries were the coming thing. A Boston \n     biotech company had genetically engineered the cells to \n     produce a protein that boosted the manufacture of red blood \n     cells, making them a valuable commodity. Kota and a former \n     company scientist are charged with stealing a batch of the \n     hamster cells and offering them to an FBI undercover agent in \n     exchange for $300,000. Law enforcement officials suspect the \n     pair of selling another batch to a biomedical research outfit \n     in India. It was dramatic evidence of how the world of \n     espionage has changed--from selling secrets to the KGB one \n     year to moving hamster ovaries to a research firm in India \n     another. Kota has been charged with three counts of \n     espionage. He pleaded not guilty and is out on bail awaiting \n     trial.\n       Today the field of economic espionage is wide open. Instead \n     of missile launch codes, the new targets of choice are \n     technological and scientific data concerning flat-panel \n     televisions, electric cars and new computers. ``During the \n     cold war, we thought of the threat as KGB agents crawling \n     into the facility,'' says Gregory Gwash, the deputy director \n     for industrial security matters at the Defense Investigative \n     Service. ``The game is no longer espionage in the classic \n     sense.''\n\n\n                             growing threat\n\n       Economic espionage is as old as greed itself. But with huge \n     sums to be made stealing designs for computer chips and \n     patents for hormones, the threat is growing. Rapid changes in \n     technology are tempting many countries to try to acquire \n     intellectual properties in underhanded ways, thus bypassing \n     the enormous costs of research and development. New \n     global communications--cellular phones, faxes, voice \n     transmissions and data on the Internet--make this type of \n     spying easier than ever.\n       And it's not just hostile governments snooping. ``Countries \n     don't have friends. They have interests!'' declares a poster \n     from the Department of Energy's counterintelligence program. \n     ``Guess which countries are interested in what you do?'' A \n     senior U.S. intelligence official answers the question. ``The \n     ones who do it most,'' he says, ``are our greatest friends.''\n       Indeed, countries such as France, Israel and China have \n     made economic espionage a top priority of their foreign \n     intelligence services. A congressional report released last \n     week confirmed that close U.S. allies are after critical U.S. \n     technology, saying they posed ``a significant threat to \n     national security.''\n\n\n                          intensified efforts\n\n       Friend or enemy, Washington is taking the trend seriously. \n     The nation's intelligence agencies are increasing their \n     overseas collection of information on foreign bribery\n\n[[Page S12209]]\n\n     schemes that put U.S. corporations at a disadvantage. The \n     agencies are also providing classified information to U.S. \n     policy makers engaged in trade negotiations with foreign \n     governments. Domestically, the FBI has also taken more-\n     aggressive steps recently. This month, the Justice Department \n     sent new draft legislation that would bolster the FBI's \n     ability to investigate economic espionage to the Office of \n     Management and Budget. The new bill--named the Economic \n     Espionage and Protection of Proprietary Economic Information \n     Act of 1996--is badly needed, says the FBI, because there are \n     no statutes that deal with the theft of intellectual \n     property, making it difficult to prosecute such cases.\n       In the past year, FBI agents have recorded more than a 100 \n     percent increase in economic spying and now have more than \n     800 cases under investigation--espionage attempts from the \n     supersophisticated to the downright crude. ``We're seeing all \n     of the above,'' says Robert ``Bear'' Bryant, who oversees all \n     FBI counterintelligence investigations nationwide, ``from the \n     cyberattack to the shoplifter.''\n       Economic-espionage investigations require the FBI to gather \n     intelligence through electronic surveillance and physical \n     searches, a source of concern to many civil libertarians. But \n     the FBI is empowered under existing law to gather \n     intelligence for such purposes, and the new legislation would \n     define more precisely how and when FBI agents could \n     investigate the theft of corporate secrets. The key, legal \n     specialists and FBI supervisors say, is defining precisely \n     what constitutes conducting intelligence investigations, \n     looking for spies and theft prevention, and what is a \n     primarily criminal investigation whose objective is to put a \n     spy behind bars. Both objectives can be accomplished, but the \n     law requires intelligence and law enforcement interests be \n     defined very carefully.\n       The quest for corporate advantage has put many of the old \n     players from the cold war back on the chessboard. Just this \n     month. Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered his senior \n     intelligence officials to increase their efforts to obtain \n     high-technology secrets from the West.\n       Besides gathering intelligence and conducting criminal \n     investigations, federal law enforcement officials have been \n     trying to help corporations protect themselves. A law enacted \n     in 1994 authorizes Attorney General Janet Reno to make \n     payments of up to $500,000 for information leading to the \n     arrest and conviction of anyone involved in economic \n     espionage. The National Counterintelligence Center, headed by \n     an FBI agent but based at CIA headquarters in suburban \n     Virginia, was established in August 1994, in part to help \n     coordinate a governmentwide response to economic espionage \n     incidents. The center began providing regional security \n     briefings for industry last May. The FBI recently opened its \n     own Economic Counterintelligence Unit, and its Development of \n     Espionage, Counterintelligence and Counterterrorism Awareness \n     (DECA) program inaugurated an instant fax alert service to \n     U.S. corporations regarding specific economic-intelligence-\n     collection activities. It is supplemented by the State \n     Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council, which, like \n     DECA, has begun posting economic threat information on an on-\n     line bulletin board for its members.\n       Some security experts say the FBI should employ more active \n     measures to counter the threat. Mike Sekora tracked the \n     global technology trade for the Defense Department in the \n     1980s, identifying foreign interest in U.S. technology to \n     pre-empt thefts. Now a technology consultant, he believes the \n     FBI should do the same.\n       Profit motives aside, economic espionage is booming because \n     there are few penalties for those who get caught. Rarely do \n     economic spies serve time in jail. Nor do countries that \n     encourage such activities have much to lose; since most are \n     U.S. allies, Washington prefers to scold them in private \n     rather than risk political backlash in public.\n       Companies and industries targeted by foreign spies often \n     contribute to the problem. Few report known acts of \n     espionage, fearing it will affect stock prices and \n     customer confidence. In a survey published in July by the \n     National Counterintelligence Center, 42 percent of the \n     responding corporations said they never reported suspected \n     incidents of economic espionage to the government. At the \n     same time, 74 of 173 companies that responded to the \n     survey reported a total of 446 incidents of suspected \n     economic espionage.\n\n\n                              culturebound\n\n       The methods used to acquire economic-related data are often \n     culturebound. ``The Chinese and Japanese flood you with \n     people collecting all sorts of things in different areas,'' \n     says a former FBI official. ``For the most part, it is \n     absolutely legal,'' he said. ``The Japanese don't invest a \n     lot of money in trade craft. They just send lots of people \n     out talking and pick up trade secrets in the process,'' says \n     the retired official. The Russians and French, on the other \n     hand, use both legal and illegal means to target specific \n     intelligence, experts say.\n       Targeting economic data can take many forms. In two \n     separate incidents in the early 1990s, French nationals \n     working at Renaissance Software Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif., \n     were arrested at San Francisco International Airport for \n     attempting to steal the company's proprietary computer source \n     codes. Marc Goldberg, a French computer engineer, had worked \n     at the company under a program sponsored by the French \n     Ministry of Foreign Affairs that allows French citizens to \n     opt out of military service if they are willing to work at \n     high-tech U.S. firms. He was fined $1,000 and ordered to \n     perform 1,000 hours of community service. The other \n     individual, Jean Safar, was released soon after his arrest by \n     the FBI. ``They said they did not have the power to do \n     anything,'' recalls Renaissance's former president, Patrick \n     Barkhordarian. The company, in fact, had received start-up \n     funds from two French brothers, Daniel and Andrew Harari. In \n     return for their investment, they received positions on the \n     company's five-member board of directors. When an internal \n     dispute erupted in 1992, the Harari brothers were able to \n     place a third French citizen on the board. ``They converted \n     the company to a French company,'' said Barkhordarian. Safar \n     was told by the company, claims Barkhordarian, to take the \n     source codes to France. There was nothing illegal about it. \n     Renaissance was acquired by a publicly held U.S. company last \n     fall.\n       Even when the collection methods are legal, the results can \n     hurt. In the summer of 1994, a film crew from Japanese public \n     television visited dozens of U.S. biotech corporations, \n     including California biotech giant Amgen, while filming a \n     documentary on the industry. William Boni, Amgen's security \n     director, was warned by a DECA agent that the FBI suspected \n     the film was a cover for intelligence collection. Still, Boni \n     allowed the visit, partly because the director of the film \n     said this would help Amgen break into the Japanese biotech \n     market. Once at Amgen, film crew members photographed every \n     document they possibly could, including company production \n     numbers. ``This was a very clear-cut case of benchmarking \n     America's best practices for their industry,'' says Boni. \n     ``They ran their vacuum cleaner over the U.S. biotech \n     industry.''\n       Some efforts are not so subtle. In one case, an Amgen \n     employee attempted to steal vials of Epogen, a genetically \n     engineered hormone that controls the production of red blood \n     cells and is one of two patented items in the company's \n     product line. Security chief Boni was tipped to the threat \n     by an anonymous letter, which said that the employee was \n     planning to open up a black market in Epogen in his home \n     country in Asia. The employee confessed. He was fired, but \n     no charges were filed. Had the theft attempt succeeded, \n     the rogue employee and an accomplice could have made a \n     fortune. In 1995, Epogen sales amounted to nearly $1 \n     billion.\n       Neither of the two prongs of the U.S. attempt to combat \n     such threats is simple. Like his predecessors, Directories of \n     Central Intelligence John Deutch has provided clear marching \n     orders to the CIA and other agencies that gather intelligence \n     overseas. The agencies are to inform U.S. policy makers if \n     foreign competitors are winning business abroad through \n     bribery or other illegal means. In 1994, Boeing Aerospace, \n     McDonnel Douglas and Raytheon Corp, won two multibillion-\n     dollar contracts from Saudi Arabia and Brazil after President \n     Clinton complained to those governments about bribes that \n     rival French companies had paid to win the contracts, the \n     information on the bribes came from U.S. intelligence \n     agencies, President Clinton strongly endorses such action. \n     ``You uncovered bribes that would have cheated American \n     companies out of billions of dollars,'' he told a gathering \n     of CIA employees last July. Over the past three years, the \n     CIA has reportedly saved U.S. corporations $30 billion as a \n     result of those efforts.\n\n\n                           Threat information\n\n       Deutch has made it clear that, unlike the foreign \n     intelligence services of at least 50 other nations, America's \n     spy services are forbidden to engage in economic espionage \n     for the benefit of corporate America. That's clear enough, \n     but in today's global, multinational economy, it is often \n     difficult to distinguish American from foreign corporations. \n     The FBI, in fact, makes no such distinctions and provides all \n     corporations operating in the United States with threat \n     information regarding economic expionage.\n       The other mission of the CIA and its sister agencies that \n     operate abroad is to provide economic intelligence to U.S. \n     policy makers. Last spring, the intelligence community helped \n     U.S. trade officials learn of Japanese negotiating positions \n     during automobile trade talks. This was perfectly legal under \n     U.S. law, but the press disclosure prompted a firestorm of \n     criticism from Capitol Hill, prompting some intelligence \n     officials to grumble that such activities were more trouble \n     then they were worth. Last year, several CIA officers were \n     expelled from France for engaging in an intelligence \n     operation to obtain information on France's position on \n     global telecommunications talks. The CIA's inspector general \n     investigated the matter, and a report is expected shortly.\n       Given the ratio of risk to potential reward, many \n     intelligence officials argue that America's espionage \n     agencies should not be used to acquire economic information \n     secretly when so much can be obtained from open sources. \n     ``What you try to gain covertly,'' says Charles Emmling, a \n     former CIA case officer who recruited Soviet agents from \n     1968 to 1991 and now teaches businesses how to protect \n     their corporate trade secrets at Aegis Research Corp., \n     ``becomes less and less important.'' Robert Steele, a 20-\n     year veteran of the CIA's clandestine service, says the \n     agency relies on cloak-and-dagger techniques out of habit. \n     ``Don't send a spy,''\n\n[[Page S12210]]\n\n     Steele says, ``where a schoolboy can go.'' That was \n     precisely the mistake the CIA made last year in France, \n     critics say.\n       The second prong of the U.S. effort, playing defense, is \n     also more complicated than ever. Kenneth Geide, the head of \n     the FBI's new economic counterintelligence unit, says that \n     there are a host of ways to go after a target and that often \n     ``foreign governments are hiding their collection \n     [activities] within legitimate activities.''\n       But some former law enforcement and intelligence officials \n     fear that legal collection of information may be investigated \n     simply to determine if illegal methods are being used. They \n     argue that the onus of protecting proprietary information \n     should remain on the shoulders of industry, not government. \n     ``It is our responsibility to protect this [information], and \n     it is our liability if we don't,'' contends a former \n     intelligence official now in the private sector. There is \n     still debate on the proper balanced role of law enforcement \n     in countering this new threat within government as well. ``We \n     don't want the FBI in our bedrooms or our boardrooms,'' quips \n     a senior administration official.\n       The FBI defends its approach and has vowed not to overstep \n     its bounds. How to meet such a varied threat? ``We don't \n     intend to, want to and can't investigate all foreigners,'' \n     Geide says. The threat to America's national security from \n     spies seeking economic secrets has increased significantly, \n     but Geide says: ``We don't want to be alarmist about it. It \n     deserves a measured approach.''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                    The Growth of Economic Espionage\n\n                          (By Peter Schweizer)\n\n       Shortly after CIA officer Aldrich ``Rick'' Ames began \n     selling secrets to the Soviet KGB in 1985, a scientist named \n     Ronald Hoffman also began peddling classified information. \n     Ames, the last known mole of the Cold War, received $4.6 \n     million for names of CIA informants before he was apprehended \n     in early 1994. But Hoffman, a project manager for a company \n     called Science Applications, Inc., made $750,000 selling \n     complex software programs developed under secret contract for \n     the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Hoffman, who was \n     caught in 1992, sold his wares to Japanese multinationals--\n     Nissan Motor Company, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy \n     Industries, and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries--that \n     wanted the information for civilian aerospace programs.\n       Ames received the more dramatic and sensational coverage, \n     as he should have, given that his betrayal led to the loss of \n     life. But the Hoffman case represents the future of \n     intelligence. While one spied for America's chief military \n     rival, the other sold information to a major economic \n     competitor. Perhaps it should induce an epiphany of sorts \n     that these two cases occurred in near congruence.\n       As economic competition supplants military confrontation in \n     global affairs, spying for high-tech secrets with commercial \n     applications will continue to grow, and military spying will \n     recede into the background. How the United States elects to \n     deal with this troubling issue will not only determine the \n     direction of the American intelligence community, but also \n     set the tone for commercial relations in the global \n     marketplace.\n\n\n                       the new currency of power\n\n       Most economic agents systematically collect economic \n     intelligence using legal means. Major corporations collect \n     business intelligence to read industry trends and scout the \n     competition. Many nations track global and regional economic \n     trends and even technological breakthroughs to aid \n     policymakers. But a growing number of states have become \n     very active in gathering intelligence on specific \n     industries or even companies and sharing it with domestic \n     producers. Indeed, economic espionage, the outright theft \n     of private information, has become a popular tool as \n     states try to supplement their companies' competitive \n     advantage. This is sheer folly, threatening to restore \n     mercantilism through the back door.\n       The United States has devoted increasing attention to \n     intelligence on economic issues, sometimes with diplomatic \n     consequences. French Interior Minister Charles Pasqua \n     summoned U.S. Ambassador Pamela Harriman to his office on \n     January 26 of this year to protest U.S. spying on French \n     commercial and technological developments. According to Le \n     Monde, CIA agents flush with 500-franc notes tried to bribe a \n     member of the French parliament to reveal France's \n     negotiating position on the nascent World Trade Organization. \n     A senior official in the Ministry of Communications was \n     offered cash for intelligence on telecommunications and \n     audiovisual policy. A technician for France Telecom, the \n     national telephone network, was also approached. All three \n     immediately notified the French Directorate of Territorial \n     Surveillance, which ordered them to play along with the \n     Americans and lay a trap.\n       More recently, an October 15 story in The New York Times \n     disclosed that American intelligence agents assisted U.S. \n     trade negotiators by eavesdropping on Japanese officials in \n     the cantankerous dispute over car imports. U.S. Trade \n     Representative Mickey Kantor and his aides were the reported \n     beneficiaries of daily briefings by the CIA, including \n     information gathered by the CIA's Tokyo station and the \n     National Security Agency's vast electronic network. How \n     useful this information was remains open to debate. After \n     all, the agreement the United States and Japan ultimately \n     reached was hardly an unambiguous victory for Washington.\n       These reports, which appear to be accurate, indicate that \n     the United States is following the model for economic \n     intelligence several recent CIA directors have proposed. In \n     1991, believing that the CIA could make a ``unique \n     contribution'' by uncovering foreign economic espionage in \n     the United States and gathering information about the \n     attempts of other governments to violate international trade \n     agreements and ``other basic rules of fair play,'' Robert \n     Gates called for a deeper look at applying the tools of \n     intelligence to economic matters. By 1993, James Woolsey had \n     declared no more Mr. Nice Guy and promised that the CIA would \n     sniff out unfair trade practices and industrial espionage \n     directed against American firms.\n       Even with all this heightened activity and interest, the \n     United States is far less involved in economic espionage than \n     most of its major allies and trading partners. Spying on \n     trade negotiators and attempting to obtain commercial \n     information to assist government policymakers is economic \n     espionage at its most benign level and should be expected. \n     The United States has yet to surmount the critical firewall \n     of passing purloined information to domestic companies \n     competing in the global marketplace. It is in this area that \n     the most damage is done to the international trading system \n     and where most major industrialized countries have operated.\n       Over the past 15 years, the FBI has chronicled numerous \n     cases involving France, Germany, Japan, Israel, and South \n     Korea. An FBI analysis of 173 nations found that 57 were \n     covertly trying to obtain advanced technologies from U.S. \n     corporations. Altogether, 100 countries spent some public \n     funds to acquire U.S. technology. Former French Intelligence \n     Director Pierre Marion put it succinctly when he told me, \n     ``In economics, we are competitors, not allies. America has \n     the most technical information of relevance. It is easily \n     accessible. So naturally your country will receive the most \n     attention from the intelligence services.''\n       Recent data indicate that American industry has felt the \n     effects of such unwanted attention. A 1993 survey \n     commissioned by the American Society for Industrial Security \n     found a dramatic upswing in the theft of proprietary \n     information from corporate America. The number of cases \n     increased 260 percent since 1985; those with foreign \n     involvement shot up fourfold. A 1993 study by R. J. Heffeman \n     and Associates noted that an average of about three incidents \n     every month involve the theft of proprietary information from \n     American companies by foreign entities. These estimates are \n     probably conservative. Companies prefer not to admit they \n     have been victims. An admission can depress the price of \n     their stock, ruin joint ventures, or scuttle U.S. government \n     contracts.\n       The sort of espionage that threatens U.S. corporations \n     varies with the national characteristics and culture of the \n     perpetrators. France possesses a well-developed intelligence \n     service, one of the most aggressive collectors of economic \n     intelligence in the world. Using techniques often reminiscent \n     of the KGB or spy novels, the French in recent years have \n     planted moles in U.S. companies such as IBM, Texas \n     Instruments, and Corning. Japan lacks a large formal \n     intelligence service such as the CIA or Direction Generale de \n     la Securite Exterieure (DGSE) but remains an active acquirer \n     of business information. A public-private partnership has \n     evolved between the Ministry for International Trade and \n     Industry and the Japan External Trade Organization, \n     supplementing and nurturing the already well-developed \n     commercial intelligence networks created by Japanese \n     corporations. These commercial networks rival the \n     intelligence services of medium-sized nations. Matsushita's \n     intelligence operations in the United States, for example, \n     occupy two full floors of a Manhattan skyscraper, according \n     to Herb Meyer, special assistant to CIA Director William \n     Casey during the Reagan administration.\n\n\n                          the gains from theft\n\n       That so many states practice economic espionage is a \n     testament to how profitable it is believed to be. Marion \n     boasts that during his tenure, France won a $2 billion \n     airplane deal with India thanks to the work of the DGSE. The \n     late French spy chief Count De Marenches typified the French \n     view when he wrote in his memoirs that economic espionage is \n     ``very profitable. . . . In any intelligence service worthy \n     of the name you would easily come across cases where the \n     whole year's budget has been paid for in full by a single \n     operation.''\n       Economic espionage threatens to unhinge certain post-Cold \n     War goals such as arms control. On-site inspections, a \n     necessity for some agreements, create institutional \n     opportunities to engage in espionage. The Chemical \n     Manufacturers Association, for example, fears that a chemical \n     weapons treaty with a rigid on-site verification regime could \n     subject 50,000 industrial sites in the United States to \n     systematic international inspection and monitoring. Officials \n     from any number of countries would have access to sensitive \n     information about the American chemical industry, including \n     plant layouts, production levels, perhaps even formulas.\n       Intelligence collection is a proper function of the state--\n     protecting the national interest and informing statecraft. \n     But collecting proprietary information and sharing it with \n     domestic producers in an entirely different\n\n[[Page S12211]]\n\n     matter. That kind of economic espionage ought to be called \n     what it is: at best a subsidy to well-connected domestic \n     companies, at worst theft on a par with piracy. Economic \n     espionage can grossly disrupt trade and corrode a nation's \n     science and technology base. It is a parasitic act, relying \n     on others to make costly investments of time and money. And \n     to destroy the rewards of investment is to destroy the \n     incentive to innovate.\n\n\n                        the quaint united states\n\n       This is a decidedly minority point of view in the world \n     marketplace. The rest of the world does not share the \n     American capitalist ethos of vigorous but open competition. \n     In both Europe and Asia, the American law that bars U.S. \n     corporations from bribing foreign officials is viewed as \n     quaint. Antitrust laws are likewise dismissed as an American \n     idiosyncrasy. The semi-corporatist cultures of continental \n     Europe and Asia view the state-business relationship very \n     differently than does the United States. There is a popular \n     old joke in American business circles: ``What are the nine \n     scariest words in the English language?'' ``I'm from the \n     government and here to help you.'' This quip would hardly \n     garner a smile in Tokyo, Paris, or Berlin.\n       Early indications are that Russia is more likely to embrace \n     the semi-corporatist view than the American laissez-faire \n     model. The transition from communism to capitalism means only \n     that Russian intelligence will have a greater business \n     orientation. Russian intelligence officials speak of \n     nonbudgetary resources for defense and security policy. \n     And as James Sherr of Oxford University pointed out in the \n     winter 1994-95 National Interest, Russian intelligence \n     officials are blurring the distinction between, if not \n     merging, state policy and private pursuits. The newly \n     created Federal Agency for Government Communications and \n     Information indicates this trend. Encompassing the former \n     KGB's communication's assets, it is both a ``strictly \n     classified organization'' and a business, with the right \n     to contract with foreign investors, invest in foreign \n     commercial entities, and set up companies abroad.\n       As economic strength in part replaces military might as the \n     currency of national power, one can only expect this trend to \n     continue. Trade talks have supplanted arms control as the \n     most acrimonious, demanding, and headline--grabbing form of \n     diplomacy, a certain sign of changing priorities. \n     Consequently, most intelligence organizations around the \n     globe are all too willing to serve as a competitive tool to \n     protect budgets in lean times.\n       The current interregnum between the Cold War and the new \n     era of economic conflict provides an opportunity finally to \n     address this issue. Fissures or disagreements within the \n     Western alliance no longer have the dangerous consequences \n     they might have had at the height of the Cold War. The United \n     States needs to treat economic espionage no only as an \n     intelligence issue, but as the competitiveness and economic \n     issue it has become. Until it does, the American response \n     will be spotty, and the results minimal.\n       In 1991 the FBI began a quiet shift from the traditional \n     focus of its counterintelligence policy. The country criteria \n     list, which identified nations whose intelligence services \n     needed watching, has been replaced by the national security \n     threat list, which identifies key American technologies and \n     industries that should be protected. This is an important \n     first step. But even a successful counterintelligence \n     operation will accomplish little unless there are \n     consequences for those who are caught. In the past, ensnared \n     thieves usually receive a slap on the wrist. When prosecuted \n     in a court of law, it has usually been under statutes that \n     make it illegal to transfer stolen goods across state lines. \n     This is a difficult legal standard, particularly since some \n     judges believe that information is not a good.\n       Changes in U.S. law and greater diplomatic fortitude offer \n     the best hope for grappling with this problem. When Hitachi \n     admitted in court that its employees tried to purchase stolen \n     ``Adirondack'' computer design workbooks from IBM, the judge \n     in 1983 fined the company a whopping $10,000. The U.S. \n     government did not blink an eye. Several months after the \n     trial, Hitachi reportedly won a major contract to equip the \n     Social Security Administration with computers. (Ironically, \n     the losing bid was submitted by IBM.) When it was disclosed \n     that between the early 1970s and late 1980s the French DGSE \n     had planted agents in Texas Instruments, IBM, and Corning and \n     shared the purloined information with Compagnie des Machines \n     Bull, the U.S. government merely sent a letter of diplomatic \n     protest. Likewise, when Israeli intelligence officers stole \n     valuable technological data from Illinois defense contractor \n     Recon Optical, no penalties were imposed. Selling SDI \n     computer software programs did get Ronald Hoffman a six-year \n     prison term, but the Japanese companies that purchased the \n     data faced no sanctions. This state of affairs should be \n     unsatisfactory.\n       The United States should consider changing its privacy \n     laws. The data protection laws of countries such as Austria, \n     France, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Denmark, \n     Norway, and Luxembourg define ``persons'' to include \n     corporations for protection of privacy purposes. Their laws \n     provide a much higher level of protection for corporate \n     information, treating business secrets as equivalent to the \n     private data of individual citizens. Under much more firmly \n     defined privacy statutes, thieves could be prosecuted.\n       When diplomats are involved, the United States should be as \n     aggressive and vigorous as it was when dealing with Soviet \n     spying, or at least as firm as France was last January. \n     Instead, diplomatic personnel have simply been asked to leave \n     quietly, a gesture with little punitive effect. Foreign \n     corporations involved in the theft of American technology or \n     corporate information should face real monetary costs for \n     their crimes. Until there is a price to be paid, companies \n     will not think twice about purchasing and using stolen \n     information, and foreign governments will not blink at \n     stealing American proprietary business information.\n       How the United States chooses to deal with this problem \n     will set the tone internationally. Some, such as former CIA \n     Director Stansfield Turner, have proposed an American \n     economic espionage program, in effect imitating foreign \n     competitors. But this path is fraught with peril. There is no \n     groundswell of support for such a course in either corporate \n     America or the intelligence community. Ask intelligence \n     professionals what they think about the idea and they are \n     likely to tell you, ``I will risk my life for America, but \n     not General Motors.'' An economic espionage program could \n     also have a corrupting influence on the U.S. intelligence \n     community, as officials might be enticed by bribes from \n     companies seeking particularly useful information. Likewise, \n     American companies are nervous about getting entangled with \n     the intelligence world and the strings that are likely to be \n     attached to any such program. Rather than wanting to imitate \n     its competitors, corporate America seeks a level playing \n     field and protection from industrial thieves.\n       The goal of the United States should be a world in which \n     governments do not try to outspend one another on stealing \n     each other's corporate secrets. But that goal cannot be \n     reached until the United States decides to grow up and face \n     down the threat. Ignoring economic espionage will not make it \n     go away.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today, we pass the Economic Espionage Act, \nwhich is based upon legislation drafted by Senator Specter and me and, \non the House side, by Representatives McCollum and Schumer. In a \nCongress marked by so much partisanship, this legislation marks a \nsignificant bipartisan accomplishment. With this new law, we penalize \nthe theft of vital economic information.\n  Since the end of the cold war, our old enemies and our traditional \nallies have been shifting the focus of their spy apparatus. Alarmingly, \nthe new target of foreign espionage is our industrial base. But for too \nmany years, we were complacent and did not heed these warnings. And we \nleft ourselves vulnerable to the ruthless plundering of our country's \nvital information. We did not address this new form of espionage--a \nversion of spying as dangerous to our national well-being as any form \nof classic espionage. Today, that complacency ends.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is crucial. Most Americans probably \ndo not realize that anyone with the wherewithal to do it can walk out \nof a company with a computer disk full of its most important \nmanufacturing information and sell that information to the highest \nbidder with virtual impunity--and no criminal penalties.\n  This problem is even worse when foreign governments have specifically \nfocussed on American companies in order to steal information from them. \nAmerican companies are not prepared or equipped to fight off this kind \nof systematic targeting.\n  The executive vice president of Corning, James Riesbeck, has said \nthat:\n\n       It is important to understand that State-sponsored \n     industrial espionage is occurring in the international \n     business community. It is very difficult for an individual \n     corporation to counteract this activity. The resources of any \n     corporation are no match for industrial espionage that is \n     sanctioned and supported by foreign governments.\n\n  A report of the National Counterintelligence Center [NCIC] in 1995 \nindicated that biotechnology, aerospace, telecommunications, computer \nsoftware, transportation, advanced materials, energy research, defense, \nand semiconductor companies are all top targets for foreign economic \nespionage. These sectors are aggressively targeted according to the \nreport. That report identified 20 different methods used to conduct \nindustrial espionage. The traditional methods include recruiting an \nagent and then inserting the agent into the target company, or breaking \ninto an office to take equipment and information. According to the \nreport, computer intrusions, telecommunications targeting and \nintercept, and private-sector encryption weaknesses account for the \nlargest portion of economic and\n\n[[Page S12212]]\n\nindustrial information lost by U.S. corporations.\n\n  But even as American companies are attempting to respond to foreign \nespionage, they also have to address theft by insiders. A survey by the \nAmerican Society for Industrial Security [ASIS] of 325 companies in \n1995 found that almost half of them had experienced trade secret theft \nof some sort during the previous 2 years. They also reported a 323-\npercent increase in the number of incidents of intellectual property \nloss. A 1988 National Institute of Justice study of trade secret theft \nin high-technology industries found that 48 percent of 150 research and \ndevelopment companies surveyed had been the victims of trade secrets \ntheft. Almost half of the time the target was research and development \ndata while 38 percent of the time the target was new technology. Forty \npercent of the victims found out about the theft from their \ncompetitors.\n  Norman Augustine, the president of Lockheed Martin Corp., told us at \nour February hearings that a recent survey of aerospace companies \nrevealed that 100 percent of them believe that a competitor, either \ndomestic or international, has used intelligence techniques against \nthem.\n  And, Mr. President, make no mistake about it, economic espionage \ncosts our country dearly. In 1992, when a representative of IBM \ntestified at a House hearing on this issue, he told us that economic \nespionage had cost his company billions of dollars. The NCIC report \nconcluded that industry victims have reported the loss of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, lost jobs, and lost market share. The ASIS survey \nconcluded that the potential losses could total $63 billion a year.\n  Because of the gap in our laws, Senator Specter and I introduced two \ncompanion measures that became the Economic Espionage Act earlier this \nyear. This legislation will be used to go after the foreign \nintelligence services that take aim at American companies and at the \npeople who walk out of businesses with millions of dollars worth of \ninformation.\n\n  I will only briefly explain what we have done here because the \nmanagers' statement and the House and Senate committee reports fully \nand completely describe this act. This legislation makes it illegal to \nsteal trade secrets from companies. It enhances the penalties when the \ntheft is at the behest of a foreign government. With the help of \nSenator Hatch and Representatives McCollum and Schumer, we have \ncarefully drafted these measures to ensure that they can only be used \nin flagrant and egregious cases of information theft. Moreover, trade \nsecrets are carefully defined so that the general knowledge and \nexperience that a person gains from working at a job is not covered.\n  Mr. President, we do not want this law used to stifle the free flow \nof information or of people from job to job. But we built in a number \nof safeguards to prevent exactly these problems. They are elaborated on \nin the managers' statement and our committee reports.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the managers' \nstatement be printed in the Record. It reflects our understanding on \nthis measure.\n  There being no objection, the managers' statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n     Managers' Statement for H.R. 3723, The Economic Espionage Bill\n\n       This legislation is based upon two bills, S. 1556, ``The \n     Industrial Espionage Act of 1996,'' and S. 1557, ``The \n     Economic Security Act of 1996,'' which were introduced by \n     Senators Specter and Kohl. This Managers' Statement is \n     intended to clarify portions of the legislation and to \n     supplement the Committee reports already issued on these two \n     measures. It also explains how the House and Senate version \n     of the legislation were reconciled.\n\n\n               DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SECTIONS 1831 AND 1832\n\n       This legislation includes a provision penalizing the theft \n     trade secrets (Sec. 1832) and a second provision penalizing \n     that theft when it is done to benefit a foreign government, \n     instrumentality, or agent (Sec. 1831). The principle purpose \n     of this second (foreign government) provision is not to \n     punish conventional commercial theft and misappropriation of \n     trade secrets (which is covered by the first provision). \n     Thus, to make out an offense under the economic espionage \n     section, the prosecution must show in each instance that the \n     perpetrator intended to or knew that his or her actions would \n     aid a foreign government, instrumentality, or agent. \n     Enforcement agencies should administer this section with its \n     principle purpose in mind and therefore should not apply \n     section 1831 to foreign corporations when there is no \n     evidence of foreign government sponsored or coordinated \n     intelligence activity.\n       This particular concern is borne out in our understanding \n     of the definition of ``foreign instrumentality'' which \n     indicates that a foreign organization must be ``substantially \n     owned, controlled, sponsored, commanded, managed, or \n     dominated by a foreign government or subdivision thereof.'' \n     Although the term ``substantially'' is not specifically \n     defined, it is a relative term that connotes less than total \n     or complete ownership, control, sponsorship, command, \n     management, or domination. Substantial in this context, means \n     material or significant, not technical or tenuous. We do not \n     mean for the test of substantial control to be mechanistic or \n     mathematical. The simple fact that the majority of the stock \n     of a company is owned by a foreign government will not \n     suffice under this definition, nor for that matter will the \n     fact that a foreign government only owns 10 percent of a \n     company exempt it from scrutiny. Rather the pertinent inquiry \n     is whether the activities of the company are, from a \n     practical and substantive standpoint, foreign government \n     directed.\n       To make out a case under these two provisions (sections \n     1831 and 1832), the prosecution would have to show that the \n     accused knew or had reason to know that a trade secret had \n     been stolen or appropriated without authorization. This \n     threshold separates conduct that is criminal from that which \n     is innocent. Thus, for example, these sections would not give \n     rise to a prosecution for legitimate economic collection \n     or reporting by personnel of foreign governments or \n     international financial institutions, such as the World \n     Bank, because such legitimate collection or reporting \n     would not include the collection or reporting of trade \n     secrets that had been stolen, misappropriated or converted \n     without authorization.\n\n\n                         WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION\n\n       Several federal statutes already include the requirement \n     that information be taken ``without authorization.'' The most \n     notable is 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1030, which is amended in this \n     measure by the National Information Infrastructure Protection \n     Act introduced by Senators Leahy, Kyl and Grassley. That \n     provision essentially deals with authorization in relation to \n     computer systems. However, in this legislation the nature of \n     authorization may be slightly different since this measure \n     involves information ``whether or how stored.'' But the \n     principle remains the same: authorization is the permission, \n     approval, consent, or sanction of the owner.\n\n\n                    PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT NOT COVERED\n\n       It is important to note that a person who develops a trade \n     secret is not given an absolute monopoly on the information \n     or data that comprises a trade secret. For example, if a \n     company discovers that a particular manufacturing process \n     must be conducted at a certain ambient temperature and that a \n     more than 10 percent deviation from that temperature will \n     compromise the process, that company does not have the \n     exclusive right to manufacture the product at the key \n     temperature (assuming that this is not otherwise patented or \n     protected by law). Other companies can and must have the \n     ability to determine the elements of a trade secret through \n     their own inventiveness, creativity and hard work. As the \n     Supreme Court noted in Kewanee Oil Co. v. Bicron Corp., 416 \n     U.S. 470 (1974): ``If something is to be discovered at all \n     very likely it will be discovered by more than one person. . \n     . . Even were an inventor to keep his discovery completely to \n     himself, something that neither the patent nor trade secret \n     laws forbid, there is a high probability that it will be soon \n     independently developed. If the invention, though still a \n     trade secret, is put into public use, the competition is \n     alerted to the existence of the inventor's solution to the \n     problem and may be encouraged to make an extra effort to \n     independently find the solution this known to be possible.'' \n     Id. at 490-91.\n       This legislation does not in any way prohibit companies, \n     manufacturers, or inventors from using their skills, \n     knowledge and experience to solve a problem or invent a \n     product that they know someone else is also working on. Thus, \n     parallel development of a trade secret cannot and should not \n     constitute a violation of this statute. This includes the \n     situation in which an individual inventor, unsolicited, sends \n     his or her material to a manufacturer even as the company \n     itself is in the midst of its own parallel development. In \n     the first place, this wholesale disclosure of material likely \n     breaches the requirement that a trade secret owner take \n     reasonable measures to protect the information's \n     confidentiality. But more importantly, many companies \n     regularly receive such ideas and inventions and do not use \n     them. Some of these unsolicited ideas and inventions may \n     overlap with work being done within the company already. \n     Both the individual inventor and the company are \n     conducting parallel work, pursuing the same line of \n     inquiry. Neither can be subject to penalty under this law.\n\n\n                          REVERSE ENGINEERING\n\n       Some people have asked how this legislation might affect \n     reverse engineering. Reverse engineering is a broad term that \n     encompasses a variety of actions. The important thing is to \n     focus on whether the accused has committed one of the \n     prohibited acts of\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\n     this statute rather than whether he or she has ``reverse \n     engineered.'' If someone has lawfully gained access to a \n     trade secret and can replicate it without violating \n     copyright, patent or this law, then that form of ``reverse \n     engineering'' should be fine. For example, if a person can \n     drink Coca-Cola and, because he happens to have highly \n     refined taste buds, can figure out what the formula is, then \n     this legislation cannot be used against him. Likewise, if a \n     person can look at a product and, by using their own general \n     skills and expertise, dissect the necessary attributes of the \n     product, then that person should be free from any threat of \n     prosecution.\n\n\n                      DEFINITION OF TRADE SECRETS\n\n       Unlike patented material, something does not have to be \n     novel or inventive, in the patent law sense, in order to be a \n     trade secret. Of course, often it will be because an owner \n     will have a patented invention that he or she has chosen to \n     maintain the material as a trade secret rather than reveal it \n     through the patent process. Even if the material is not novel \n     in the patent law sense, some form of novelty is probably \n     inevitable since ``that which does not possess novelty is \n     usually known; secrecy, in the context of trade secrets \n     implies at least minimal novelty.'' Kewanee Oil Co., 416 U.S. \n     at 476. While we do not strictly impose a novelty or \n     inventiveness requirement in order for material to be \n     considered a trade secret, looking at the novelty or \n     uniqueness of a piece of information or knowledge should \n     inform courts in determining whether something is a matter of \n     general knowledge, skill or experience.\n       Although we do not require novelty or inventiveness, the \n     definition of a trade secret includes the provision that an \n     owner have taken reasonable measures under the circumstances \n     to keep the information confidential. We do not with this \n     definition impose any requirements on companies or owners. \n     Each owner must assess the value of the material it seeks to \n     protect, the extent of a threat of theft, and the ease of \n     theft in determining how extensive their protective measures \n     should be. We anticipate that what constitutes reasonable \n     measures in one particular field of knowledge or industry \n     may vary significantly from what is reasonable in another \n     field or industry. However, some common sense measures are \n     likely to be common across the board. For example, it is \n     only natural that an owner would restrict access to a \n     trade secret to the people who actually need to use the \n     information. It is only natural also that an owner clearly \n     indicate in some form or another that the information is \n     proprietary. However, owners need not take heroic or \n     extreme measures in order for their efforts to be \n     reasonable.\n\n\n      GENERAL KNOWLEDGE NOT COVERED BY DEFINITION OF TRADE SECRETS\n\n       In the course of reconciling the Senate and House versions \n     of this legislation, we eliminated the portion of the \n     definition of trade secret that indicated that general \n     knowledge, skills and experience were not included in the \n     meaning of that term. Its elimination from the statutory \n     language does not mean that general knowledge can be a trade \n     secret. Rather, we believed that the definition of trade \n     secrets in itself cannot include general knowledge. Thus, it \n     was unnecessary and redundant to both define what does and \n     what does not constitute a trade secret.\n       Our reason initially for putting the exception in was to \n     state are clearly as possible that this legislation does not \n     apply to innocent innovators or to individuals who seek to \n     capitalize on their lawfully developed knowledge skill or \n     abilities. Employees, for example, who change employers or \n     start their own companies should be able to apply their \n     talents without fear of prosecution because two safeguards \n     against overreaching are built into the law.\n       First, protection is provided by the definition of ``trade \n     secret'' itself. The definition requires that an owner take \n     objectively reasonable, proactive measures, under the \n     circumstances, to protect the information. If, consequently, \n     an owner fails to safeguard his or her trade secret, then no \n     one could be rightfully accused of misappropriating it. Most \n     owners do take reasonable measures to protect their trade \n     secrets, thereby placing employees and others on clear notice \n     of the discreet, proprietary nature of the information.\n  In addition, a prosecution under this statute must establish a \nparticular piece of information that a person has stolen or \nmisappropriated. It is not enough to say that a person has accumulated \nexperience and knowledge during the course of his or her employ. Nor \ncan a person be prosecuted on the basis of an assertion that he or she \nwas merely exposed to a trade secret while employed. A prosecution that \nattempts to tie skill and experience to a particular trade secret \nshould not succeed unless it can show that the particular material was \nstolen or misappropriated. Thus, the government cannot prosecute an \nindividual for taking advantage of the general knowledge and skills or \nexperience that he or she obtains or comes by during his tenure with a \ncompany. Allowing such prosecutions to go forward and allowing the risk \n     of such charges to be brought would unduly endanger \n     legitimate and desirable economic behavior.\n       As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court noted in Spring Steels v. \n     Molloy, 400 Pa. 354, 363 (1960):\n       ``It is not a phenomenal thing in American business life to \n     see an employee, after a long period of service, leave his \n     employment and start a business of his own or in association \n     with others. And it is inevitable in such a situation, where \n     the former employee has dealt with customers on a personal \n     basis that some of those customers will want to continue to \n     deal with him in [that] new association. This is . . . \n     natural, logical and part of human fellowship . . .''\n       This legislation does not criminalize or in any way hamper \n     these natural incidents of employment. The free and \n     unfettered flow of individuals from one job to another, the \n     ability of a person to start a new business based upon his or \n     her experience and expertise, should not be injured or \n     chilled in any way by this legislation. Individuals must have \n     the opportunity to take advantage of their talents and seeks \n     and accepts other employments that enables them to profit \n     from their abilities and experience. And companies must have \n     the opportunity to employ these people. This measure attempts \n     to safeguard an individual's career mobility and at the same \n     time to preserve the trade secrets that underpin the economic \n     viability of the very company that would offer a person a new \n     job.\n       The second safeguard is provided by the bill's use of the \n     term ``knowingly.'' For a person to be prosecuted, the person \n     must know or have a firm belief that the information he or \n     she is taking is in fact proprietary. Under theft statutes \n     dealing with tangible property, normally, the thief knows \n     that the object he has stolen is indeed a piece of property \n     that he has no lawful right to convert for his personal use. \n     The same principle applies to this measure--for someone to be \n     convicted under this statute he must be aware or \n     substantially certain that he is misappropriating a trade \n     secret (although a defense should succeed if it is proven \n     that he actually believed that the information was not \n     proprietary after taking reasonable steps to warrant such \n     belief). A person who takes a trade secret because of \n     ignorance, mistake or accident cannot be prosecuted under the \n     Act.\n       This requirement should not prove a great barrier to \n     legitimate and warranted prosecutions. Most companies go to \n     considerable pains to protect their trade secrets. Documents \n     are marked proprietary; security measures put in place; and \n     employees often sign confidentiality agreements.\n\n\n                      MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY\n\n       We have been deeply concerned about the efforts taken by \n     courts to protect the confidentiality of a trade secret. It \n     is important that in the early stages of a prosecution the \n     issue whether material is a trade secret not be litigated. \n     Rather, courts should, when entering these orders, always \n     assume that the material at issue is in fact a trade secret.\n\n\n                          VICTIM COMPENSATION\n\n       We are also concerned that victims of economic espionage \n     receive compensation for their losses. This legislation \n     incorporates through reference existing law to provide \n     procedures to be used in the detention, seizure, forfeiture, \n     and ultimate disposition of property forfeited under the \n     section. Under these procedures, the Attorney General is \n     authorized to grant petitions for mitigation or remission of \n     forfeiture and for the restoration of forfeited property to \n     the victims of an offense. The Attorney General may also take \n     any other necessary or proper action to protect the rights of \n     innocent people in the interest of justice. In practice, \n     under the forfeiture laws, victims are afforded priority in \n     the disposition of forfeited property since it is the policy \n     of the Department of Justice to provide restitution to the \n     victims of criminal acts whenever permitted to do so by the \n     law. Procedures for victims to obtain restitution may be \n     found at Section 9 of Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       In addition to requesting redress from the Attorney \n     General, any person--including a victim--asserting an \n     interest in property ordered forfeited may petition for a \n     judicial hearings to adjudicate the validity of the alleged \n     interest and to revise the order of forfeiture. Additionally, \n     forfeitures are subject to a requirement of proportionality \n     under the Eighth Amendment; that is, the value of the \n     property forfeited must not be excessively disproportionate \n     to the crimes in question.\n       Finally, we have required that the Attorney General report \n     back to us on victim restitution two and four years after the \n     enactment of this legislation. We have heard from some \n     companies that they only rarely obtain restitution awards \n     despite their eligibility. We wish to carefully monitor \n     restitution to ensure that the current system is working well \n     and make any changes that may be necessary.\n\n\n                            FINES PROVISION\n\n       In the original Senate version of this measure, we included \n     a provision allowing courts to impose fines of up to twice \n     the value of the trade secret that was stolen. This specific \n     provision was eliminated because it was unnecessary in light \n     of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3571(d). We have not used the specific \n     exemption available under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3571(e). We, \n     therefore, fully expect that courts will take full advantage \n     of the provision in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3571(d) allowing for fines \n     of up to twice the gain or loss resulting from the theft of \n     trade secrets and that courts will opt for the larger of the \n     fines available under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3571(d) or the fines \n     provisions of this statute.\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\n                    DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OVERSIGHT\n\n       The Senate version of this measure included a requirement \n     that all prosecutions brought under the statute receive the \n     prior approval of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney \n     General or the head of the Department of Justice's Criminal \n     Division. That provision was eliminated in the measure that \n     the House returned to us. We have not reinserted it based on \n     the assurances of the Department of Justice. The Department \n     of Justice will insert a requirement in the U.S. Attorney's \n     Manual that prosecutions continue to be approved and strictly \n     supervised by the Executive Office of the United States \n     Attorney. The Attorney General has written a letter to us to \n     that effect which we will insert into the record. We expect \n     to review all cases brought under this Act in several years \n     to ensure that the requirement is being enforced and to \n     determine if it needs to remain in place.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3723, the \nEconomic Espionage Act of 1996. This bill makes the theft or unlawful \nappropriation and conversion of ``proprietary economic information'' a \nFederal felony. It is an important bill to all of Federal law \nenforcement, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  In today's technology revolution, the Congress has recognized the \nneed to develop meaningful legislation that has real teeth to stop a \nburgeoning criminal enterprise. Such enterprise targets the cutting \nedge research and development of our Nation's industries, often on \nbehalf of a competitor or foreign state. Until now, there has been no \nmeaningful deterrent to such activity. Victims were often forced to \nresort to State civil remedies as their only redress. I am confident \nthat all of my colleagues will agree that H.R. 3723, a bill which we \nhave crafted and has undergone minor House modification, is a strong \nand meaningful deterrent to criminals considering engaging in economic \nespionage.\n  There is one provision in the bill originally passed by the Senate \nbut deleted from the House which requires clarification. The original \nbill passed by the Senate contained a provision that required Attorney \nGeneral approval prior to the initiation of a prosecution under this \nlegislation. The bill returned to the Senate by the House deleted this \nrequirement. It was my intent to attach an amendment to this bill, \nreinserting the prior authorization requirement. After numerous \ndiscussions with administration and industry officials, a compromise \nhas been reached which will allow this bill to be passed by the full \nSenate as approved by the House.\n  We have a letter from the Attorney General which memorializes an \nagreement we have made concerning this prior authorization requirement.\n  This agreement provides that the Department of Justice shall \nimplement regulations that require that an indictment can be pursued \nunder this legislation only upon the express prior approval of the \nAttorney General, Deputy Attorney General, or Assistant Attorney \nGeneral-Criminal Division. This agreement shall remain in effect for a \nperiod of 5 years from enactment. During that timeframe, the Attorney \nGeneral will be required to report to the Senate or House Judiciary \nCommittees, any prosecutions carried out under this bill which did not \nreceive such prior authorization. It shall also subject the U.S. \nAttorney or Justice Department official authorizing such prosecution, \nto appropriate disciplinary sanctions.\n\n  I am confident that the Department of Justice will act in good faith \nand carry out its terms.\n  I would like to mention three other provisions included in this bill. \nThe first, included as a floor amendment by myself and Senator Kohl, \nauthorizes $100 million in grants to the Boys and Girls Clubs of \nAmerica to establish clubs in public housing and other distressed areas \nacross the country. The Boys and Girls Clubs have an outstanding track \nrecord of reducing crime and drug use in the communities they serve, \nand this legislation will help them extend their reach into the \ncommunities that need them most.\n  Second, I am pleased that this bill included another amendment I \noffered during Senate consideration, transferring to the Attorney \nGeneral custody of certain Federal inmates hospitalized at St. \nElizabeth's hospital. This provision will ensure that these persons, \nhospitalized because of not guilty by reason on insanity verdicts in \nFederal courts, receive appropriate care in safe, secure facilities.\n  Finally, I would like to note that this legislation includes an \namended version of technical corrections legislation to fix errors that \nhave, over time, crept into the Federal criminal code. The continued \nintegrity of the criminal laws depends on making these corrections from \ntime to time, and I am pleased that we have addressed this matter here.\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to fully \nsupport H.R. 3723.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referenced earlier from the \nAttorney General be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Justice,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1996.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: Thank you for your support of the \n     Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (``Act''). The need for this \n     law cannot be understated as it will close significant gaps \n     in federal law, thereby protecting proprietary economic \n     information and the health and competitiveness of the \n     American economy.\n       The Department shares your concerns that the legislation be \n     implemented in accordance with the intent of Congress and \n     therefore will require, for a period of five years after \n     implementation of the Act, that the United States may not \n     file a charge under Chapter 90, or use a violation of Chapter \n     90 as a predicate offense under any other law, without the \n     personal approval of the Attorney General, the Deputy \n     attorney General, or the Assistant Attorney General for the \n     Criminal Division (or the acting official in each of these \n     positions if a position is filled by the Acting official). \n     This requirement will be implemented by published regulation.\n       Violations of such regulations will be appropriately \n     sanctionable. Any such violations will be reported by the \n     Attorney General to the Senate and House Judiciary \n     Committees.\n       Once again, thank you for your leadership in this critical \n     area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is today \ntaking the important step of passing the Economic Espionage Act and the \nNational Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996 [NII \nProtection Act].\n  The NII Protection Act, which I have sponsored with Senators Kyl and \nGrassley, was sent to the House as S. 982, after passing the Senate \nunanimously on September 18, 1996. The NII Protection Act has come back \nto the Senate for final passage as part of a package of bills including \nH.R. 3723, the Economic Espionage bill. These bills are complimentary. \nThe economic espionage bill will impose criminal penalties on those who \nsteal valuable trade secrets from the U.S. Government and those doing \nbusiness in our country, without regard to the means used to effect the \ncrime.\n  Spying on American companies in order to obtain their trade secrets \nand confidential proprietary information is--to put it bluntly--\nstealing. Although the estimates of how much this stealing costs our \nNation's business and our economy are rough, the range is in the \nbillions of dollars per year.\n  Unfortunately, the problem appears to be growing. The increasing \ndependence of American industry on computers to store information and \nto facilitate communications with customers, suppliers and farflung \nsubsidiaries, presents special vulnerabilities for the theft of \nsensitive proprietary information.\n  I have long been concerned about this vulnerability. That is why I \nworked with the Department of Justice, and my colleagues, Senators Kyl \nand Grassley, on introduction of the National Information \nInfrastructure Protection Act. This bill will increase protection for \ncomputers, both government and private, and the information on those \ncomputers, from the growing threat of computer crime. Our dependency on \ncomputers and the growth of the Internet are both integrally linked to \npeople's confidence in the privacy, security, and reliability of \ncomputer networks. I have worked over the past decade to make sure the \nlaws we have in place foster both privacy and security, and provide a \nsound foundation for new communications technologies to flourish.\n  Both the NII Protection Act and the Economic Espionage Act reflect \nsignificant efforts to better protect our\n\n[[Page S12215]]\n\nindustrial lifeblood--the imaginative ideas and the special know-how \nthat give American companies the edge in global competition.\n  The NII Protection Act will help safeguard the privacy, security and \nreliability of our national computer systems and networks and the \ninformation stored in, and carried on, those networks. Those systems \nand networks are vulnerable to the threat of attack by hackers, high-\ntechnology criminals and spies.\n\n  Every technological advance provides new opportunities for legitimate \nuses and the potential for criminal exploitation. Existing criminal \nstatutes provide a good framework for prosecuting most types of \ncomputer-related criminal conduct. But as technology changes and high-\ntechnology criminals devise new ways to use technology to commit \noffenses we have yet to anticipate, we must be ready to readjust and \nupdate our Criminal Code.\n  The facts speak for themselves--computer crime is on the rise. The \nweek before Senate passage of the NII Protection Act, on September 12, \na computer hacker attack, which shut down a New York Internet access \nprovider with thousands of business and individual customers, made \nfront page news, and revealed the vulnerability of every network \nservice provider to such an attack. The morning after Senate passage of \nthis legislation, on September 19, computer hackers forced the CIA to \ntake down an agency Web site because obscenities and unauthorized text \nand photograph changes had been made to the site and unauthorized links \nhad been established between the CIA Web site and other sites. The \nComputer Emergency and Response Team [CERT] at Carnegie-Mellon \nUniversity reports that over 12,000 Internet computers were attacked in \n2,412 incidents in 1995 alone. A 1996 survey conducted jointly by the \nComputer Security Institute and the FBI showed that 42 percent of the \nrespondents sustained an unauthorized use or intrusion into their \ncomputer systems in the past 12 months.\n  While the NII Protection Act may not address every form of computer \ncrime or mischief, it closes a number of significant gaps in the \ncomputer fraud and abuse statute. This legislation would strengthen law \nenforcement's hands in fighting crimes targeted at computers, networks, \nand computerized information by, among other things, designating new \ncomputer crimes, and by extending protection to computer systems used \nin foreign or interstate commerce or communications.\n  For example, while our current statute, in section 1030(a)(2), \nprohibits misuse of a computer to obtain information from a financial \ninstitution, it falls short of protecting the privacy and \nconfidentiality of information on computers used in interstate or \nforeign commerce and communications. This gap in the law has become \nonly more glaring as more Americans have connected their home and \nbusiness computers to the global Internet.\n  This is not just a law enforcement issue, but an economic one. \nBreaches of computer security result in direct financial losses to \nAmerican companies from the theft of trade secrets and proprietary \ninformation. A December 1995 report by the Computer Systems Policy \nProject, comprised of the CEO's from 13 major computer companies, \nestimates that financial losses in 1995 from breaches of computer \nsecurity systems ranged from $2 billion to $4 billion. The report \npredicts that these numbers could rise in the year 2000 to $40 to $80 \nbillion worldwide. The estimated amount of these losses is staggering.\n\n  The NII Protection Act would extend the protection already given to \nthe computerized information of financial institutions and consumer \nreporting agencies, to computerized information held on computers used \nin interstate or foreign commerce on communications, if the conduct \ninvolved interstate or foreign communications. The provision is \ndesigned to protect against the interstate or foreign theft of \ninformation by computer.\n  Computer hackers have accessed sensitive Government data regarding \nOperation Desert Storm, penetrated NASA computers, and broken into \nFederal courthouse computer systems containing confidential records. \nThese outside hackers are subject to criminal prosecution under section \n1030(a)(3) of the computer fraud and abuse statute. Yet, this statute \ncontains no prohibition against malicious insiders: Those government \nemployees who abuse their computer access privileges by snooping \nthrough confidential tax returns, or selling confidential criminal \nhistory information from the National Crime Information Center [NCIC]. \nThe NCIC is currently the Nation's most extensive computerized criminal \njustice information system, containing criminal history information, \nfiles on wanted persons, and information on stolen vehicles and missing \npersons.\n  I am very concerned about continuing reports of unauthorized access \nto highly personal and sensitive Government information about \nindividual Americans, such as NCIC data. For example, a ``Dear Abby'' \ncolumn that appeared on June 20, 1996 in newspapers across the country \ncarried a letter by a woman who claimed her in-laws ``ran her name \nthrough the FBI computer'' and, apparently, used access to the NCIC for \npersonal purposes.\n  This published complaint comes on the heels of a General Accounting \nOffice [GAO] report presented on July 28, 1993, before the House \nGovernment Operations Committee, Subcommittee on Information, Justice, \nAgriculture, and Transportation, on the abuse of NCIC information. \nFollowing an investigation, GAO determined that NCIC information had \nbeen misused by ``insiders''--individuals with authorized access--some \nof whom had sold NCIC information to outsiders and determined whether \nfriends and relatives had criminal records. The GAO found that some of \nthe misuse jeopardized the safety of citizens and potentially \njeopardized law enforcement personnel. Yet, no federal or state laws \nare specifically directed at NCIC misuse and most abusers of NCIC were \nnot criminally prosecuted. GAO concluded that Congress should enact \nlegislation with strong criminal sanctions for the misuse of NCIC data.\n  This bill would criminalize these activities by amending the privacy \nprotection provision in section 1030(a)(2) and extending its coverage \nto Federal Government computers. If the information obtained is of \nminimal value, the penalty is only a misdemeanor. If, on the other \nhand, the offense is committed for purposes of commercial advantage or \nprivate financial gain, for the purpose of committing any criminal or \ntortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United \nStates or of any State, or if the value of the information obtained \nexceeds $5,000, the penalty is a felony.\n  The current statute, in section 1030(a)(5), protects computers and \ncomputer systems from damage caused by either outside hackers or \nmalicious insiders ``through means of a computer used in interstate \ncommerce or communications.'' It does not, however, expressly prohibit \nthe transmission of harmful computer viruses or programs from abroad, \neven though, a criminal armed with a modem and a computer can wreak \nhavoc on computers located in the United States from virtually anywhere \nin the world. This is a significant challenge in fighting cybercrime: \nthere are no borders or passport checkpoints in cyberspace. \nCommunications flow seamlessly through cyberspace across datelines and \nthe reach of local law enforcement.\n  Indeed, we have seen a number of examples of computer crimes directed \nfrom abroad, including the 1994 intrusion into the Rome Laboratory at \nGriffess Air Force Base in New York from the United Kingdom and the \n1996 intrusion into Harvard University's computers from Buenos Aires, \nArgentina.\n  Additionally, the statute falls short of protecting our Government \nand financial institution computers from intrusive codes, such as \ncomputer ``viruses'' or ``worms.'' Generally, hacker intrusions that \ninject ``worms'' or ``viruses'' into a Government or financial \ninstitution computer system, which is not used in interstate \ncommunications, are not Federal offenses. The legislation would change \nthat limitation and extend Federal protection from intentionally \ndamaging viruses to Government and financial institution computers, \neven if they are not used in interstate communications.\n  The NII Protection Act would close these loopholes. Under the \nlegislation, outside hackers--including those using foreign \ncommunications--and malicious insiders face criminal liability \n\n[[Page S12216]]\n\nfor intentionally damaging a computer. Outside hackers who break into a \ncomputer could also be punished for any reckless or other damage they \ncause by their trespass.\n  The current statute protects against computer abuses that cause \ncomputer ``damage,'' a term that is defined to require either \nsignificant financial losses or potential impact on medical treatment. \nYet, the NII and other computer systems are used for access to critical \nservices such as emergency response systems, air traffic control, and \nthe electrical power systems. These infrastructures are heavily \ndependent on computers. A computer attack that damages those computers \ncould have significant repercussions for our public safety and our \nnational security. The definition of ``damage'' in the Computer Fraud \nand Abuse statute should be sufficiently broad to encompass these types \nof harm against which people should be protected. The NII Protection \nAct addresses this concern and broadens the definition of ``damage'' to \ninclude causing physical injury to any person and threatening the \npublic health or safety.\n\n  Finally, this legislation address a new and emerging problem of \ncomputer-age blackmail. This is a high-technology variation on old \nfashioned extortion. One case has been brought to my attention in which \na person threatened to crash a computer system unless he was given free \naccess to the system and an account. One can imagine situations in \nwhich hackers penetrate a system, encrypt a database and then demand \nmoney for the decoding key. This new provision would ensure law \nenforcement's ability to prosecute modern-day blackmailers, who \nthreaten to harm or shut down computer networks unless their extortion \ndemands are met.\n  Confronting cybercrime with up-to-date criminal laws, coupled with \ntough law enforcement, are critical for safeguarding the privacy, \nconfidentiality, and reliability of our critical computer systems and \nnetworks. I commend the Attorney General and the prosecutors within the \nDepartment of Justice who have worked diligently on this legislation \nand for their continuing efforts to address this critical area of our \ncriminal law.\n  In sum, the NII Protection Act will provide much needed protection \nfor our Nation's critical information infrastructure by penalizing \nthose who abuse computers to damage computer networks, steal classified \nand valuable computer information, and commit other crimes on-line.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I am sure the distinguished leader would \nacknowledge the work that Chairman Murkowski has performed in \nreconciling the interests of this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia is exactly \ncorrect. I worked for hours today alone with the Senator from Alaska. \nBut, as the Senator from Virginia knows, the Senator from Alaska has \nbeen working on this bill for years--for years. And there are countless \nhours that have gone into putting this package together. It is not \nsomething that has been hurried up and put together in the last days. \nThis is a culmination. It has a lot of bills together.\n  Some may ask, ``Why is that?'' Senators objected to having any bill \ngo through. So all of the bills ended up combined. That is unfortunate. \nWe should not legislate that way. But the objection, frankly, was on \nthe Democrat side of the aisle. It should not have happened. Hopefully \nin the future we will be able to pass land bills individually as they \nare reported out of the authorizing committees. It didn't happen in \nthis case. We will have to work hard to see that it does not happen in \nthe future.\n  But most all of these projects that are in this bill have been hashed \nout for months, most of which have unanimous support in the Senate. And \nmy guess is that when we get to a vote on the bill--we may well vote on \nit tomorrow. We may pass it by voice vote. If we have a recorded vote, \nI would venture to say that we would have 90-some percent of the \nSenators voting in favor of that package.\n  So, hopefully we will get it through both Houses and have it for the \nPresident's signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/10/02/senate-section/article/S12216-3", "month": "10", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
