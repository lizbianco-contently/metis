Mr. President, leaders' time has been reserved.\n  Mr. President, today we will be awaiting a possible House action on \nmaybe one or two measures on returning Federal workers and also paying \nFederal workers who have not been paid.\n  We do not expect rollcall votes to occur during today's session. We \ndo not know precisely what the form of the legislation will be when it \ncomes from the House. We hope to be able to pass it by unanimous \nconsent. So if anybody wants to object, they ought to be letting us \nknow early because we will have to give 24-hour notice to get our \ncolleagues back here sometime tomorrow for that vote.\n  I know that some indicated that they would have objected to the last \nUC while they were hundreds of miles away. So I want to be sure those \npeople who may be out and around the country today understand that \nthere may be another request for a unanimous consent, and if they wish \nto object, they had better hustle back here and do so.\n  I hope, with the House apparently trying to come together on a couple \nof proposals that would enable Federal workers to return to work with \npay, that we would not engage in rhetoric here today that might \ndiscourage positive action by the House.\n  So it would be my hope that we would dwell on other matters, if \nnecessary, and let the Senate then stand in recess subject to the call \nof the Chair awaiting House action. I do not think it is going to help \nanything if some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle find \nit necessary to beat up House Republicans. It will only make it more \ndifficult, and it should make it more difficult, frankly. So I hope we \ncan avoid that rhetoric today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S73-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S73]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ORDER FOR RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I again wish to thank the distinguished \nmajority leader for his leadership throughout this situation. I find a \nray of encouragement here that Federal workers can return to work with \npay.\n\n  I want to state for the record that the majority leader has stood \nsteadfast on seeing that Federal workers who have been furloughed, and \notherwise their pay stopped, will receive this pay.\n  It is an obligation of the United States of America and all citizens \nto see that those who have contracted with our Federal Government to be \ngainfully employed be compensated because they are in no way--\nabsolutely no way--at fault on this situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S73-6", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S73-S74]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE RIPPLE EFFECT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Also, Mr. President, I wish to inform my colleagues that \nthroughout my State, and in many other parts of the United States, this \nproblem is now working its way by ripple effect into the private sector \nsuch that many, many gainfully employed persons in an infrastructure \nsupporting not only the Government but other private sector support are \nbeginning to feel most severely this situation.\n  This morning on television here in the Nation's Capital was a picture \nof \n\n[[Page S74]]\nan entrepreneur who runs a small business--simply a bakery--which \nprovides food for individuals, and they had to furlough three-quarters \nof their work force today. But that is by the tens of thousands \nthroughout Virginia in the private sector.\n  The tragedy, Mr. President, is that there is no back pay coming to \nthose private sector employees who are being laid off as a consequence \nof this partial shutdown of the U.S. Government.\n  So I extend to my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate a most fervent \nplea that they allow the Senate leadership, most particularly the \nmajority leader, to pass today those matters that will be coming from \nthe House by a voice vote such that they can become law after the \nPresident's signature.\n  It is my fervent hope that the President will recognize the problems \nthroughout this Nation today and that he will come forward with a \nbalanced budget, as is his obligation, so that we can quickly come to \nclosure on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Virginia leaves \nthe floor, I wanted to just ask in a very straightforward way if he had \nany more information than I have been able to get about what might be \nin the bill which would be coming to the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives on several different issues. And I would ask the \nPresident pro tempore at this time if the Senator from Virginia would \nbe able to respond to my question on this issue.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the answer to that rests in a meeting that \nis now taking place by the Speaker of the House together with the \nRepublican colleagues. I would not want to venture any speculation as \nto what might emerge. I think the reports today in the press are \nreasonably accurate as to the framework of what would come about by \nthis.\n  So I have been in consultation with the Republican Members of the \ngreater metropolitan area of Washington, primarily Congressmen Davis \nand Wolf and Congresswoman Morella, this morning. As yet, I would not \nwant to try to speculate as to the final action.\n  I know essentially it is in two parts. One is to try to restore the \nGovernment across the board in terms of people returning to their work \nwith pay for the future and backpay, and then the possibility of \ncoupling another provision which would be contingent on the President \nof the United States being forthcoming with a balanced budget, which \nhas always been the bottom line. It seems to me that it is a very \nreasonable request by the Republican leadership of the House and the \nSenate.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate that response.\n  I guess what caused me to come to the floor today was an article \nwhich came out in our paper in New Mexico today saying that ``The \nFederal budget deadlock has caused depleted drug cupboards at the \nVeterans Administration hospital in Albuquerque. The hospital's \nprocurement division has warned pharmacists that drug stocks soon will \nbe exhausted.''\n  Then they go on to say, ``What is the Government thinking about these \npeople who fought for their country?''\n  I was wondering if the funding in the bill that would come from the \nHouse would provide money to the Veterans' Administration to buy drugs \nfor the VA hospital in our State. I have a one-page summary of what \nmight be passed by the House. It says here veterans' compensation, \npensions, and education programs would be covered. But it does not say \nanything about the VA hospital functions and the expenses for drugs for \nveterans. I do not know if the Senator from Virginia has any \ninformation on that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time I do not have the specific \nanswer to my distinguished colleague, who, by the way, serves with me \non the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I, like the Senator from \nNew Mexico and, indeed, the Presiding Officer, feel very strongly about \nthis Nation's obligation to its veterans. I will try to get a very \nprompt answer.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if the Senator would be able to get \nanswers to two other questions, I will just pose those and then yield \nthe floor.\n  One pertains to our Department of Labor in New Mexico. This is \nanother article that was in our papers there. It says that the \nDepartment of Labor employs State workers but they use Federal funds to \npay their salaries. I gather that is a normal practice all around the \ncountry in the Department of Labor. They operate the unemployment \ncompensation program and a variety of programs there, and the State \nworkers are paid with Federal funds.\n  Does the bill which is being considered in the House contemplate that \nthere would be funds to pay the State workers who are paid with Federal \nfunds as well as the Federal workers, or does the Senator from Virginia \nknow?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do not have the specific answer. I will \nget it and provide it to the Senator. But I hope that this measure \nwould cure that situation because a great many State workers are \ndependent on some Federal source as a means of being able to continue \nwith the performance of their duties.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  There is a similar article about the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nactivities in our State and how that agency has had trouble buying \nfood, heating oil, trucks, and other equipment in order to perform \ntheir responsibilities on the reservations.\n  I hope we can get information as to whether or not those items would \nbe covered by this kind of a bill which is coming to us.\n  I say to my colleagues, the information that I have been given is \nthat there would not be funds made available for anything other than \nthe salaries of the Federal workers. Obviously, that becomes a problem \nif your job as a Federal worker requires you to drive a vehicle and you \nhave to have funds to buy gasoline for that vehicle.\n  The other issue on which I hope we can get an answer relates to an \narticle I saw that the Government shutdown has delayed the construction \nof a fence at the United States-Mexican border. I had the occasion a \nfew weeks ago when I was in Dona Ana County in my State near El Paso to \nget a tour of the area for the planned construction of a fence that \nwould go along the southern part of the Anapra area between the United \nStates and Mexico. This is a priority for the law enforcement officers \nof that region. It is a law enforcement issue. They feel the incidence \nof crime across the border has increased very dramatically and they \nneed to get this fence up. The article I saw indicated that because \ncontract officers responsible for obtaining building materials have \nbeen furloughed, work on that project has had to stop.\n  I hope very much that when we get the bill from the House of \nRepresentatives it will contain funds, authorization and appropriation \nof funds, for those items as well. So I will not delay the Senate \nfurther at this point, Mr. President. I do think that there are a great \nmany activities going unattended, a great many needs going unaddressed \nwhich I hope this House action today will correct.\n  Again, I have spoken several times on the Senate floor this week \ncommending the majority leader and other Senators, all Senators, \nRepublican and Democratic Senators, for the continuing resolution that \nwas passed earlier this week and sent to the House. In my opinion, that \nwas the correct and responsible way for us to proceed. It demonstrated \nand reflected the recognition that the Congress as well as the \nPresident have a shared responsibility to maintain a functioning \nGovernment. I think that is the essential issue: Do we agree that we in \nCongress share in that responsibility to maintain a functioning \nGovernment? I feel very strongly that we do. I think all Senators \nindicated their belief that we do by agreeing to that continuing \nresolution. I hope the action by the House reflects the same \nrecognition of that responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S73-7", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S74-S75]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner).

That is the one that directs the President for a continuing \nresolution if he lays down a budget that is certified by the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Speaker of the House.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, it is my understanding, and I think the \nunderstanding of most of the Senators present, that the majority leader \nand the minority leader are at the White House at this moment once \nagain meeting with the President as we try to unravel and resolve the \nbudget issue that we are now in that has brought a portion of our \nGovernment to a standstill.\n  I, like many of my colleagues, am tremendously frustrated by the \nprocess of the last several weeks which has failed to produce a \nresolution that appeared to be a resolution committed to by the White \nHouse some weeks ago, that we would negotiate on the terms of a 7-year \nbalanced budget reviewed by CBO figures. That simply has not \nmaterialized. And, of course, over the course of the last several \nweeks, with well over 200,000 Federal employees unemployed by failure \nto act, it is now time for the Congress to move to the issue of those \nFederal employees and resolve it.\n  As many of us know, the House earlier today passed a resolution that \nwould allow those employees to come back to work for a period of time \nwhich results hopefully in the ability then of the Congress to move \ntoward a balanced budget and resolve that issue and for us to be able \nto conclude the budget and get on with the business of operating this \nGovernment as I think the American people expect us to do.\n  I find it ironic that we are yet fumbling with the issue of a budget \nwhen we are nearing a statutory deadline that the President must agree \nto for the submission of a 1997 budget.\n  Here we are having failed to complete a 1996 budget that is balanced, \nthat honors the commitment that we believe we hold with the American \npeople to produce a balanced budget over the course of the next 7 \nyears, and it will be on February 5, exactly 1 month from today, that \nthe President by law is responsible for submitting the 1997 balanced \nbudget, a product of the 1974 Budget Act.\n  Why are we in this dilemma at this moment? I think, except for the \nHHS, Education appropriations bill that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle have refused to allow us to debate and to bring to a vote \nand to send to the President, the Congress has done its homework. It \nhas done what it is responsible for doing under the Constitution in \nsubmitting to the President the appropriate appropriations bills.\n  The President's only action has been to veto, veto, veto the bills \nthat would have kept the veterans' hospitals fully up and running, that \nwould have kept the veterans' programs alive and operative; instead of \nbeing subject to the criticism we now hear, that the pharmaceutical \nshelves at some of our veterans' hospitals may be growing empty if we \nfail to act responsibly in a short period of time.\n  The President's actions, if he had not vetoed, would have kept the \nnational parks and the forests and the museums opened and would have \nfunded the Department of Justice and given law enforcement block grants \nto the States, would have allowed numerous agencies to continue and to \ncomplete their obligations to small business contractors and suppliers \nand provide passport services, and so on and so forth.\n  That is exactly what has happened. We have watched this President as \nhe \n\n[[Page S76]]\nhas vetoed these bills in an attempt to use rhetoric to place the \nburden on the shoulders of the U.S. Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \na dialog that occurred on CNN last night between Judy Woodruff, the \nanchor, and Brooks Jackson, a special assignment correspondent, that I \nthought would be appropriate to be in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Executive Shutdown Statistics Miss the Mark\n\n       JUDY WOODRUFF, Anchor. If you are not one of the Federal \n     workers staying home and worrying about bills, just how \n     harmful are the effects of the partial government shutdown?\n       Our Brooks Jackson has some eye opening details.\n       BROOKS JACKSON, Special Assignment Correspondent. The \n     shutdown--President Clinton calls it an unnatural disaster, \n     but how bad is it? Let's check some facts.\n       The president ticked off some dire sounding consequences.\n       Pres. BILL CLINTON: This week, the Meals on Wheels Program \n     for senior citizens will run out of money.\n       BROOK JACKSON: Federal money, yes, but in fact meals are \n     still being delivered to seniors almost everywhere, paid for \n     by state money or vendors extending credit.\n       Pres. BILL CLINTON: Yesterday, the Environmental Protection \n     Agency shut down toxic waste clean-ups at 32 sites across \n     America.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: This time Clinton underestimated. In fact, \n     more than 450 clean-ups, including this one in Virginia are \n     being halted. But there are 1,283 clean-up sites and work is \n     continuing at many, maybe more than half, including the \n     roughly 100 sites that pose any immediate threat.\n       Pres. BILL CLINTON: Funds to pay for drugs, food and \n     supplies at veterans' hospitals run out today.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: Funds ran out but not the food. Patients in \n     veterans hospitals are still being fed, still getting \n     medication. The Veterans Administration says patients are \n     unaffected and vendors are still working figuring they'll get \n     paid eventually.\n       Pres. BILL CLINTON: Ten states have run out of the funding \n     they use to run our unemployment insurance program and 15 \n     more will soon do so.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: But, in fact, not a single jobless person \n     has yet missed an unemployment check. The Labor Department \n     confirms. Kansas did shut its offices briefly, but then came \n     up with state money to continue benefits as other states are \n     doing. Clinton was just wrong on one point.\n       Pres. BILL CLINTON: Half the Head Start Programs in the \n     country will run out of money within the month.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: In fact, Head Start officials say only 200 \n     programs will lose funding at the end of the month out of a \n     total of more than 1,400, so it's way less than half. The \n     Justice Department got one of its facts wrong too.\n       JAMIE GORELICK, Deputy Attorney General: There are \n     companies that provide credit cards for gasoline, are \n     starting not to honor those credit cards.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: Turns out, Federal drug agents in South \n     Florida tried to use a card that expired in 1995--nothing to \n     do with the budget fight. The White House said the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency might be unable to recall some \n     furloughed workers if an earthquake hit.\n       MIKE McCURRY, White House Press Secy.: --some of those \n     employees because they can't pay their bills and don't have \n     phone service.\n       BROOKS JACKSON: FEMA says phone service has been cut off \n     for about half a dozen Washington employees, but admits their \n     bill paying problems probably began long before the budget \n     deadlock.\n       Of course, a longer deadlock will produce more serious \n     consequences, but for now, the shutdown looks less like a \n     national disaster than it does a political fiasco.\n       Brooks Jackson, CNN, Washington.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is an interesting dialog, Mr. President, because it \nconfirms some of the things that I have been talking about and that \nhave concerned a lot of Members of this Congress as to the rhetoric of \nthe White House and what to believe over the course of the last good \nmany weeks, when the President has seemed to be a constantly changing \nand moving target on the issue of the budget, to agree some weeks ago \nto a 7-year, CBO-targeted budget, now not to want to present it or not \nto appear to be interested in presenting it.\n  The dialog that the anchor at CNN last night went through with Brooks \nJackson was interesting in the sense that it said the President said \nthis, but in fact this is the case, the President said that, but in \nfact something else is the case. I think it goes along to show that the \nshifting sands at the White House are extremely difficult for this \nCongress to work with at this moment to try to resolve these kinds of \nissues. I thought it would be important that that become a part of the \nrecord because simply they have not, in my opinion, kept their word.\n  So it is important tonight for the Congress to intervene, as we are \nnow doing. I use the word ``intervene'' to pull, if you will, these \nFederal employees off the hostage roster and put them back to work \ndoing what they are responsible for doing and bringing them back into \nthe real world because they have been in limbo, and that has created \ngreat frustration. And it should not be allowed to happen.\n  I am one for some weeks that has been critical of using our Federal \nemployees as hostages, if you will, or pawns in this budget battle that \nwe are in, and that, Mr. President, in no way lessens my interest or \nthe interest of this Congress in achieving a balanced budget.\n  I have been an advocate for well over a decade that the Congress face \nthe reality of their spending habits and balance the budget. I have \npushed for a balanced budget amendment, and of course we know the \nhistory of that whole debate here in the House and in the Senate for \nthe last good number of years.\n  But without question, the battle that we are engaged in is extremely \nfundamental. It is not business as usual, as some news reporters and \nobservers of the Congress would argue that it is. We have not phonied \nthe numbers. We have not used smoke and mirrors, because if we had, we \nwould not be in session right now, we would be in adjournment, and we \nwould have told the American people that the work of the Government was \ndone and that the 1996 budget was in place, and that all was well with \nthe world.\n  That simply has not been the case. And it should not be the case. We \nare dealing with real figures right now, trying to downsize the overall \ngrowth of Government or the rate of growth. And you, Mr. President, \nhave been directly involved, as have others of our colleagues, in \ntrying to face the reality of these tough choices. Now we are just \nsimply trying to get the White House to face the reality of tough \nchoices. And they have simply passed on occasion after occasion to do \nthat.\n\n  What we are trying to say at this moment, and what I am pleased the \nHouse has been willing to say, is let us at least take the Federal \nemployees out of this battle and set them to the side, allow them to do \nthe work they were charged with doing. I hope we can get that done.\n  Now, that was the first CR that was passed. I hope that we would be \nable to consider a second resolution or continuing resolution that was \npassed by the House today. That would allow all of the Government to \nopen up for at least a period of time through January 26. The reason I \nsay that is important is because while we are allowing, I hope, the \nFederal employees to go back to work, we may not necessarily be giving \nthem the tools to do their work.\n  Of course, that would be a bit of a hollow argument that we are \nallowing Government to continue to operate and turning as it should \nwithout giving them the total tools to do so. The House recognized \nthat, but they have put a requirement on the President. That \nrequirement is that the President send forth a balanced budget, scored \nby CBO, and that budget be in balance in the 7-year timeframe that the \nRepublican Congress has asked and required by their actions, and that \nthe same funding levels of the CR that expired on December 15, funds \nrequired at 75 percent of fiscal year 1995 levels, would operate the \nsignificantly impacted programs.\n  I hope that we can look at that continuing resolution tonight and \nthat our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would agree with us \non that. Then we could clearly say Government is fully back in \noperation, while we work with the White House to resolve this issue by \nthe 26th of January.\n  Mr. President, those are key and important issues critical to all of \nus, but more importantly critical to our country. I think that the \nAmerican people expect us to be able to operate the Government in a \nresponsible way, but they have said very clearly that part of our \nresponsibility is to bring this Government in balance, that a near $5 \ntrillion debt and a $200 billion-plus deficit as \n\n[[Page S77]]\nfar as the eye can see are no longer acceptable, that while we must be \nconcerned about programs that fund the present, we must also reflect \nour concern by our actions on programs that impact the future of our \ncountry.\n\n  That, of course, is what we attempt to do tonight. So, Mr. President, \nI hope that within minutes our leadership will be in place and we can \nconsider these important CR's to move the Government forward, to allow \nthe Federal employees out of hostage, if you will, and back to work by \nMonday morning.\n  I think it is important for our country that we do so. But while we \ndo it, let us not lose focus on the reason we are here; and that is \nthat the White House has flatly refused to produce a balanced budget. \nThat is now their obligation to do so. We have done so. We have done so \nin a responsible manner. It may not be a balanced budget that all of us \nagreed to, but it was one that clearly for the first time in decades \ndemonstrates the priorities of Government under the kind of spending \nlimitations that we believe are clearly necessary to get our debt and \nour deficit under control.\n  I hope the Senate will act responsibly tonight, as I believe the \nHouse has done this afternoon. With those comments, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S75-5", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S77-S78]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FUNDING THE OPERATION OF THE GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I was interested in listening to my good \nfriend from Idaho. And, you know, the devil is in the fine print. I \nhave heard that earlier in my life: The devil is in the fine print. You \ncan talk about the CR that comes over here. That is the continuing \nresolution that pays employees. I hope that we will put Federal \nemployees back to work. Well, that is fine. I want them to go back to \nwork, too.\n  I do not think anybody likes to pay people for not working. That was \nwhat the majority leader said the other day, that he grew up in Kansas, \nand he felt like if you worked you got paid, if you did not work, you \ndid not get paid. So I support his position.\n  But in this continuing resolution that is coming over here we are \ngoing to pay the employees retroactively, and we are going to pay them \nfor coming to the office. But we are not funding the necessary \ningredients for them to work.\n  They talked about the DEA agent. They had a drug bust, and he wanted \nto go. They needed him--several of them. They did not have any money to \nbuy gasoline to put in the car under this continuing resolution. That \ndoes not make sense to this country, boy, that you say, ``Go back to \nwork. We're going to pay you, but you can't do anything.''\n  Look at the schedule of the leadership in the next 25 days: Iowa, New \nHampshire, Minnesota, Texas, Florida, all over the country. I do not \nthink that is working here, trying to work out the budget.\n  Let us just be sure that the American people understand what this \ncontinuing resolution does. It sends Government employees back to the \noffice. It pays them retroactively, to sit there and do nothing. \nEmployees cannot make a long-distance phone call, cannot buy gasoline \nfor a car, cannot do the things that the American people would like for \nthem to do, that they have been shortchanged in the last 21 days. In my \nopinion, I have never heard so much of a continuation of the same \nthing, same thing, same thing.\n  I watched the House as they spoke this afternoon, and all the \nPresident has to do is agree to a 7-year balanced budget with CBO \nfigures and everything will be all right. Well, the President has \nagreed to a 7-year budget, balanced budget in 7 years. He has agreed to \nthat. No. 2, he has agreed to CBO figures. There is no problem with \nthat.\n  Now, what is the problem? The problem is, how do you get there?\n  My Republican friends want to cut or reduce--however you want to say \nit--Medicare by $270 billion. We think that is wrong. They want to \nreduce Medicare, want to reduce education, want to reduce the \nenvironment. To do what? To get to the point of giving a $245 billion \ntax cut. That is the whole fight--to give a $245 billion tax cut.\n  Now, who is going to get it? If you owe taxes, as I understand it, \nand you have children under 18, you can get a credit. But if you do not \nowe any taxes, you do not get any refundable tax. Therefore, you do not \nget anything. If you make too much money--hopefully, we will give some \nkind of tax break to those under $100,000. We stood here on the floor \nnot too long ago and asked if you would put a limit in the bill giving \na tax break to those that made a million or less. We even lost that.\n  Now, when you send the budget to the President, when he has agreed to \nbalance the budget in 7 years, to be using CBO figures, but to get to a \n$245 billion tax cut, you put 80 percent of the cuts on 20 percent of \nour population, the lowest 20 percent, and you give 80 percent of the \nhelp to the upper 20 percent of income, Mr. President, as we say down \nin my part of the country, something about that ``ain't'' right.\n  I want to tell you, the so-called middle income--I know a family \nwhere the man worked for the railroad. He retired. They shifted that to \na Social Security payment rather than a railroad retirement payment. He \nhad a few thousand dollars in the bank, had a house with no mortgage on \nit, and Social Security checks coming for he and his wife. He thought \nhe was in pretty decent shape. Lo and behold, he and his wife both had \nto go to a nursing home. They had too much money to draw Medicaid. So \nthey kept paying and kept paying and kept paying, and finally they had \nnothing left. Nothing. They had to go on Medicaid.\n\n  Now, in this budget that the Republicans are attempting to pass and \nsay the President ought to accept, it says to their children, ``You use \nup all your money to pay for mom and dad before we trigger in \nMedicaid.'' A lot of people around this country, Mr. President, that \nare making $35,000 to $45,000 a year, they have children, they are \ntrying to educate them and all that, and lo and behold, their parents \nare in the nursing home, they are drawing Medicaid, they get the Social \nSecurity check. You take about all of it, with the exception of $10 a \nweek for personal items, which is all the individual has left out of \nthe Social Security check. You say to them that your kids have to pay, \nand they are trying to educate their children, trying to make ends \nmeet, trying to pay a mortgage on the house and all that--the \nRepublican budget did that. To get to what? For a $245 billion tax cut \nthat will go to the upper 20 percent of income.\n  If that is the kind of budget that you want the President to sign, \nthen I hope he never does, because there are too many people out there \nthat would be hurt by this type of budget.\n  I represent Kentucky, born and bred there, and proud of it. We had a \nSenator that came here that made quite a mark. His name was Henry Clay. \nHenry Clay was called ``the Great Compromiser.'' He knew how to \ncompromise. But Henry Clay said that compromise was negotiated hurt--\nnegotiated hurt. If you are going to hurt a little bit, let everybody \nhave a little bit of hurt instead of some having a whole lot and others \nnot having any. Negotiated hurt--let everybody hurt a little bit. I do \nnot think you would have any objection to that.\n  Just take the farmers in the next 5 years. The Senator from Idaho \nunderstands farming very well. But the President has offered a $4 \nbillion cut and the Republican budget takes about $14 billion. Just \ntake $10 million off of the tax cut, you still have $235 billion; \ninstead of taking a $270 billion reduction in Medicare, just take the \n$89 billion that the President offered.\n  Talk about real numbers, let us put real numbers in front of real \nfaces and real places. That is how you are going to understand the \nnumbers. It is all numbers. It is all dollars. What will you do to the \nindividuals and the families, the young and the elderly, by just \nlooking at numbers? There are faces and places behind those numbers, \nand we have to have that part of the discussion when we come to talking \nabout the budget.\n\n  When you talk about real numbers, let us talk about real people. Let \nus talk about real places. Let us talk about real hurt. Let us talk \nabout being fair. Let us talk about being compassionate. That is the \nkind of country we are. That is the reason we are strong. We reach out \nnot only to our own but to others. That has made us the leader of the \nworld.\n  To come in here and say we are going to say to the President that we \nwill \n\n[[Page S78]]\ngive him a clean CR when he sends us a budget that is certified \nbalanced by CBO and signed off by the Speaker of the House, I know what \nSenator Dole would say if he was President of the United States, and a \nDemocrat Speaker over there--I know what he would tell him. I think you \ndo, too.\n  So let us look at the budget that the Republicans gave us. If you \nwere not using Social Security, you would be $106 billion short--$106 \nbillion short--in the year 2002. But when you dig in and use the Social \nSecurity numbers, you get down to--I do not want to answer any \nquestions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FORD. Happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The question is, have not the Democrats used the Social \nSecurity trust fund figures in numbers just the way the Republicans are \ncurrently using them? We learned----\n  Mr. FORD. Not for the last 12 years.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, you have, Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. The President of the United States signed--the President is \nresponsible for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators will address through the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. It is awful hard to address through the Chair.\n  Here on December 15--Mr. President, we talk about never wanting to \noffer anything. What bothers me is that on December 15, the President \noffered some numbers based on a budget he had submitted previously. He \neased toward the Republican side on December 15; the Republicans eased \ntoward the President on December 15. They moved closer to each other on \ndiscretionary cuts, on Medicare, on Medicaid, on welfare and EITC. I \nthought that was negotiation. That was on December 15.\n  Mr. President, we have agreed to a 7-year balanced budget. We have \nagreed to the CBO certification. Now let us get down to trying to \nfigure out how we help our young kids and give them an education.\n  They talk about increasing the Pell grants. Sure they did, but they \nforget to tell you they cut off the bottom half. It is the way you use \nthe words. So you increase Pell grants by $100, but you cut off from \n$600 down. A lot of people get by on $600. That is all they need. That \nis all they should be given. But if they do not need more than that, \nthey do not get anything. They want to get an education; just need a \nfew dollars.\n  So this is the kind of budget that the President of the United States \nhas said no to, has said no to.\n  So, I hope we will just leave this rhetoric behind us and look at \nwhere we need to work, and that is Medicare, that is Medicaid, that is \neducation, that is the environment; and that we put a face on it \ninstead of the numbers and we put a place instead of the numbers. And \nonce we decide the faces we want to help and the places we want to \nsecure, then we can put the numbers with them. I think then we will \nhave a budget.\n  But the President, in my judgment, is trying to protect those people \nwho are being hurt so severely by the Republicans saying ``We won't \ngive.'' It is not here, it is over on the other end of the Capitol \nBuilding, but ``We won't give unless we get the $245 billion tax cut.'' \nIn April the Speaker of the House said, ``We're going to shut \nGovernment down.'' Lo and behold, it did. But we have had bills vetoed \nbefore under Republican Presidents and we have offered a continuing \nresolution, we have continued Government while we sat down and \nnegotiated those things that were objectionable to the Republican \nPresidents and we finally arrived at something that could be sent to \nthe President that we agreed upon and he could sign. That is where we \nought to be now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished President pro tempore, the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1643, \nwhich will return all Federal Government employees to the workplace, \nand restore their paychecks. This bill will also reopen many important \nGovernment services which were closed due to President Clinton's veto \nof various appropriation bills.\n  It is regrettable that the President has permitted the budget \nsituation to deteriorate. Let me remind my colleagues that this \nCongress enacted a balanced budget plan which the President also \nvetoed. At that point, he assumed an obligation to provide the Congress \nwith his budget proposal. Yet despite his many promises to do so, and \nthe statutory requirement of November 20, 1995, President Clinton has \nfailed to submit a real balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, for years I have made speeches in this great Chamber, \nand cast my vote in support of a balanced budget. I have introduced \nbalanced budget amendments in numerous sessions of Congress, including \nthe 104th Congress. On July 12, 1982, a balanced budget amendment was \nbrought to the floor. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I was \npleased to sponsor and guide that important measure to passage. On \nAugust 4, 1982, 69 Senators voted in favor of the resolution. While a \nmajority supported it in the House, it failed to receive the necessary \ntwo-thirds vote. In March 1986, the Senate voted on another balanced \nbudget amendment. It was unfortunate that the Resolution failed by one \nvote. Last session, the balanced budget amendment again failed by one \nvote. However, I am confident that we will yet pass the balanced budget \namendment during the 104th Congress and call on the President to \nsupport that effort.\n  With or without a constitutional amendment, this Congress will enact \na budget which protects the security, health and safety of our Nation, \nprovides quality Government services, and eliminates harmful deficits.\n  Mr. President, this bill brings employees back to work with back pay. \nIt also provides targeted appropriations, through the end of fiscal \nyear 1996, for critical Government services. Enactment of this measure \nwill remove the issue of the Federal Government shutdown and allow us \nto focus on the larger objective of the balanced budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I commend the majority leader, Senator \nDole, and Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for \ntheir leadership and continuing efforts to resolve this important \nissue. I call on the President to keep his promise, to stop the \ngimmicks, and do the right thing for the future of our great Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S78-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S78-S79]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMUNICATIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate hopefully will be hearing from \nthe distinguished majority leader and Democratic leader, as they are \nnow returning from the White House. I am continuing to review the \nactions taken by the House. I am hopeful that these actions will reach \na compromise, a position whereby the Government can return to provide \nthe services to the people of this Nation. But I am going to withhold \nmy approval until I read each word and study every comma and period in \nit. I am still working through that. But I felt at this time it would \nbe appropriate for me to have printed in the Record a number of \ncommunications, just a sampling of the communications that I have \nreceived throughout this day in my office, together with, I think, some \nvery fine editorial review by the newspapers in my State.\n  I will first include a letter written by a Mr. Paul T. Gernhardt, who \nwrites:\n\n       I know you and your staff are quite busy so I will keep \n     this short and to the point. I am not at all pleased with \n     your handling of the budget process. You are not helping \n     anyone's cause and are directly responsible for a great deal \n     of unnecessary harm. People are beginning to lose their \n     businesses, homes, and financial standing as you squabble \n     between yourselves. As a business owner I just cannot \n     understand your actions--there is no justification \n     whatsoever.\n       As ``constitutional officers'' you have certain privileges, \n     benefits, and opportunities (including protecting your own \n     pay). However, you also have obligations. These include \n     conducting the business of government in a professional and \n     competent manner. At this point you are not fulfilling the \n     responsibilities you agreed to assume. One of your primary \n     duties is to pass a budget. This is not something that came \n     up suddenly--waiting until well past the last moment solely \n     for political gains is undignified and unprofessional.\n\n  I have to accept my share, as a Member of this body, of such \ncriticism. I \n\n[[Page S79]]\nstill believe, however, that this debate has focused the Nation's \nattention on the need to get a balanced budget within a period of 7 \nyears using certain criteria, namely the Congressional Budget Office \nfigures in which the Congress of the United States places, I might say, \na great deal of faith and credit. I am hopeful the final drafts, of \nwhat may be acted upon here momentarily, will make specific reference \nto that need, that the President should be forthcoming with such a \nbudget using the 7-year criteria as well as CBO figures.\n  I hope we can resolve this tragic situation which has impacted my \nState, the Commonwealth of Virginia, as severely certainly as any other \nState, and in my judgment probably more severely than any other State \nin the Union, given the fact that we are privileged--and I say that--we \nare privileged to provide a home for so many Federal employees, a \nworking place and an infrastructure to accommodate their needs, not \nonly here in the northern Virginia area but, indeed, throughout the \nTidewater of Virginia where we have the largest naval base in the \nworld, one of the largest Air Force bases, several of the large Army \nbases, and, indeed, the industrial base which supports so much of our \nnational defense.\n  As I have said here day after day on the floor, we are not only \naddressing the tragic plight of certain Government employees who have \nbeen furloughed, or others who are working but without pay. Also, the \ninfrastructure that serves these Government employees--and vice versa, \nthey serve the infrastructure, it works both ways--has been severely \ncrippled. It has a ripple effect all throughout my State.\n  To compound the tragedy of the private sector, many of these \nemployees being laid off in the private sector do not have any \ncertainty that their loss of pay and benefits or other job security \nwill ever be the subject of restitution.\n  Throughout this controversy I have worked with the distinguished \nmajority leader. He has provided a letter to this Senator, as well as \nother Members of the House delegation from the greater metropolitan \narea of Washington, assuring us that he would fight very hard to see \nthat all Federal pay is received eventually. As a matter of fact, S. \n1508, the legislation which I cosponsored with Senator Dole and the \nPresiding Officer, the senior Senator from Alaska, so provides \nspecifically.\n  So, Mr. President, I really take very seriously these many \ncommunications. I myself have gone to our phones and received a number \nof the calls from my constituents, coming in from all over the State.\n  Let me mention another organization called Resource Applications, \nInc. This is dated January 3, 1996.\n\n       Dear Senator Warner: As the partial shutdown continues into \n     its third week, the economic damage is spreading fast, and \n     the situation is becoming painful. The Government shutdown is \n     having a ripple effect on people and is devastating their \n     lives. Yesterday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) sent home 2,400 of its Superfund workers and stopped \n     work at over 600 sites across the Nation, throwing tens of \n     thousands of contract employees out of work.\n\n  The letter goes on to explain the impact on his particular firm, \nResource Applications, Inc. It says:\n\n       As President of RAI, an environmental firm, I am like a \n     father figure for our employees; they look to me for job \n     security. With the majority of RAI's business with EPA, I am \n     seriously concerned about the financial welfare of more than \n     100 people and their families. While I agree with your stand \n     on issues that are morally and ethically good for our people, \n     particularly the elderly, and the integrity of the \n     environment, I want to tell you, the situation is becoming \n     very difficult for the working people. An early resolution of \n     the budget impasse and Government shutdown issues would be in \n     the best interest of the country.\n\n  Yesterday, I had the head of the Environmental Protection Agency in \nto see me on wide range of issues, Carol Browner. I serve on the \ncommittee which has oversight for that Agency, and I had to bring to \nher attention, among other issues, the fact that our State very proudly \nhas a large manufacturing plant operated by the Ford Motor Company. \nThey are turning out a brand-new pickup truck which is eagerly being \nawaited all across the United States. As a matter of fact, I purchased \nmy pickup truck from the same plant in Norfolk in 1989. It has been \nvery useful to me on my farm, and I have enjoyed it, and I am going to \nkeep driving it. But I must say I am quite envious of this new model. \nBut, Mr. President, the new model cannot go into circulation for the \nreason that the Environmental Protection Agency has not had the staff \nwith which to make the proper certifications as to the fact that this \ntruck, this particular new model, can meet the environmental standards. \nThat is an important thing to do--to have the truck meet those \nstandards before it goes on the road.\n  So that is just another example of the many problems that the State \nof Virginia is facing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Roanoke Times of \ntoday be printed in the Record, a very balanced analysis of the \nproblem.\n  And, again, it concludes with the last paragraph:\n\n       Dole was right, however, in judging the shutdown a poor \n     means of exacting concessions. The House should end it today.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Roanoke Times, Jan. 5, 1996]\n\n                        Time To End the Shutdown\n\n       Political fault-lines underlying the partial shutdown of \n     government shifted and rose closer to the surface this week, \n     as the shutdown's effects began rippling more ominously \n     across the land.\n       As if to confirm his reputation as one of Washington's \n     grown-ups, Majority Leader Bob Dole on Tuesday pushed \n     legislation through the Senate that would have reopened the \n     government until Jan. 12, while Congress and the White House \n     continued their budget talks.\n       The Senate reasonably, overwhelmingly approved the measure. \n     Yet, egged on by a GOP vanguard of freshman militants, the \n     House on Wednesday turned it down.\n       Now there's word the GOP leadership is changing its tune, \n     and none too soon.\n       Keep in mind: Federal employees who were furloughed, as \n     well as those working without pay, in the end will be paid. \n     In the claimed pursuit of austerity, the shutdown is costing \n     taxpayers, on top of other costs, huge sums to pay employees \n     for work they weren't allowed to do.\n       Give credit, therefore, to Reps. Rick Boucher and L.F. \n     Payne for their vote Wednesday to end the partial shutdown. \n     Rep. Bob Goodlatte unfortunately joined with the GOP's House \n     majority, initially refusing to consider the Senate-passed \n     measure.\n       ``Bob Dole made a huge miscalculation,'' grumbled one of \n     the GOP tough guys, John Shadegg of Arizona. The partial \n     shutdown, he and other House Republicans argued, is their \n     best leverage for getting the White House to accept the \n     basics of their balanced-budget plan. Shadegg called Dole's \n     support for ending the shutdown ``an act of betrayal.''\n       But if Dole betrayed his party's zealots, he hardly \n     betrayed his country--or his chances for the presidency. On \n     Thursday, House leaders were conceding theirs was the \n     miscalculation.\n       The shutdown has gone on long enough. Indeed, it is more \n     likely getting in the way of, than moving along, the budget \n     talks. Clinton might have discerned a self-serving political \n     interest in continuing the standoff rather than try to end \n     it.\n       ``It is wrong * * * to shut the government down while we \n     negotiate, under the illusion that somehow that will affect \n     the decisions that I would make on specific issues.'' Clinton \n     said. He's right.\n       It is wrong to hold Americans hostage to budget bargaining \n     and partisan charade; Meals on Wheel clients, nursing-home \n     residents. Head Start youngsters, vendors waiting to be paid, \n     citizens wanting to visit national parks or to travel \n     overseas, Americans depending on unemployment assistance or \n     water-quality monitoring--not to mention 760,000 unpaid \n     federal workers.\n       Congress has proposed measures that Clinton is right to \n     veto--mean-spirited, counterproductive measures. But House \n     Republicans are right when they criticize the president for \n     failing to specify how he would balance the budget in seven \n     years, given a common set of fiscal assumptions.\n       To bargain in good faith--while still sticking to \n     principles that, in most cases rightly, he says he'll stand \n     by--Clinton needs to be more forthcoming.\n       Dole was right, however, in judging the shutdown a poor \n     means of exacting concessions. The House should end it today.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let us hope that the relevant document \ndelivered to the desk in the Senate by the Clerk of the House of \nRepresentatives contains the legislative initiatives that will enable \nus to resolve this.\n  Mr. President, seeing the distinguished majority leader, I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S78-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S79-S80]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGRICULTURE POLICY\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for the past several weeks, America has \nfocused its attention on the budget talks \n\n[[Page S80]]\nin Washington, and on the Government workers who have been hostages in \nthis debate.\n  However, one of the faces not shown on the evening news as a hostage \nin these talks is that of the American farmer.\n  As I travel around rural America, farmers remind me that they are \ntaxpayers too. And as taxpayers, farmers want a balanced budget.\n  Rural America realizes what this balanced budget means for them. For \nagriculture alone, spending on interest with a balanced budget is \nprojected to decline by $15 billion over 7 years. And for a lot of \nfamily farmers who struggle to make ends meet, the money saved by \nreduced interest payments could make the difference between success and \nfailure.\n\n  In addition, the Balanced Budget Act would provide much needed tax \nrelief to millions of rural Americans; including an increase in \nexpensing limits, death tax relief, an increased deductibility for the \nhealth insurance cost of the self employed, a capital gains tax cut, \nand operation of a medical savings account.\n  Mr. President, along with putting America on course to a balanced \nbudget, there is something else that Congress must do to be fair to \nAmerica's farmers.\n  I believe we have an obligation to announce by the end of February, \nif not sooner, the details of a farm bill so farmers can prepare this \nyear's crop. Kansas farmers have already planted their winter wheat \nwithout knowing any program details.\n  In my view, Mr. President, Congress has three options from which we \ncan choose.\n  Option No. 1 is to do nothing, and to simply let the 1990 farm bill \nexpire, which would mean that permanent law would be in effect.\n  Anyone who knows anything about permanent law realizes such \naction would be bad for farmers and bad for America. Farm prices would \nreach parity levels which to many may sound attractive. However, the \nlong-term ramifications to the marketplace and U.S. Treasury would be \nsignificant. Farmers would produce for the Government and not the \nmarketplace.\n\n  Option No. 2 is to pass an extension of the 1990 farm bill. This in \nmy view, would also be the wrong road to take.\n  Those who are advocating this choice are unwilling to modernize \nAmerican agricultural policy as we prepare to move into the next \ncentury. The world population will grow by 50 percent by 2025. We must \nprovide American agriculture with the tools to unleash our Nation's \nproductive capacity to meet a growing world demand. An extension of \ncurrent farm policy without addressing changes that have occurred and \ncontinue to occur, is unacceptable to a majority of farmers in this \ncountry.\n  If we are going to have an extension, it has to be at least for a \ncouple of years. You have to give farmers flexibility, and you have to \nremove production controls.\n  Option No. 3--which is the correct choice--is to adopt the farm bill \nproposals contained in the Balanced Budget Act.\n\n  One year ago, I spoke to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual \nmeeting in St. Louis. While there, I outlined some of my goals for the \n1995 farm bill. These goals included providing farmers with full \nplanting flexibility, elimination of set-asides, program simplicity, \nand a farm policy that transitions farmers into the next century \nwithout disrupting the farm economy or land values. All of these goals \nare reached in the language contained in the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Unfortunately, that act was vetoed and we must now address how to \nbest proceed. I am hopeful that provisions contained in the Balanced \nBudget Act can be retained and can be passed before the end of \nFebruary.\n  Mr. President, American agriculture does not operate in a vacuum. \nRural Americans share the Republican conviction that Congress must \nbalance the budget. Rural Americans realize that there are important \npolicies outside the farm bill that greatly affect their bottom lines. \nRepublicans are actively working to provide the needed relief that \nrural Americans are asking for. And we will not stop.\n\n  Mr. President, there are those who claim there has been no public \ninput into the agricultural provisions included in the Balanced Budget \nAct.\n  I disagree. Last year, the Senate and House Agriculture Committees \nheld 33 hearings on the 1995 farm bill with over 350 witnesses. In my \nview, the public input has been significant.\n  I also hear some colleagues talk about the need for a vote on the \nSenate democratic proposal which would reduce the agriculture savings \nand provide and increase in marketing loans.\n  I would simply point out that Senator Harkin offered this amendment \nduring Senate consideration of the reconciliation bill. The vote failed \n31 to 68 with 15 Democrats voting with Republicans to defeat the \namendment.\n  The fact is that we have debated farm policy. And adopting the \nagriculture provisions contained in the Balanced Budget Act is right \nfor our farmers and the right path for America.\n  Mr. President, I point out to my colleagues that the suggestion has \nbeen made that maybe there is an alternative plan. We had a vote on \nthat plan, offered by Senator Harkin. We voted 68 to 31 in opposition \nto that proposal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I did not have the opportunity to hear \neverything that the majority leader said. I understand he spoke about \nagriculture.\n  Let me just say that I do not know what the solution is, but I think \nthe majority leader and I both agree that we have to do something. We \nhave a lot of farmers who have already planted everything that they are \ngoing to plant for their winter wheat, for their crops. That will be \nready for harvest by spring or late spring. We have to do something. If \nwe cannot do it in 1 year, maybe a 2-year extension is something that \nwe ought to look at. But I do not think that doing nothing ought to be \nan option that either party agrees to.\n  While there is very little support on the other side of the aisle for \nthe so-called marketing loan concept, that marketing loan would allow \nfarmers to be given at least the confidence that they are going to have \na plan out there that is market-sensitive; that costs less for the \nGovernment; that provides us with the kind of opportunity in the farm \nprogram that many farmers feel they need. Virtually every national farm \norganization has said they support it.\n  So I hope we can work something out. I know that in working with \nmajority leader in good faith, we can find a way to resolve what may \nnow appear to be some very difficult challenges in agreeing on a farm \npolicy. But we have to do it. I hope we can do it as early as next \nweek. We cannot wait much longer.\n  Again, while I did not hear what the majority leader said, I am sure \nhe shares the need to be as expeditious as possible in finding some \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, let me indicate to my colleague that is sort \nof what I pointed out. There are, as I see it, three options. We talked \nabout it to some extent today at the White House. But I appreciate \nthat.\n  Of course, we need to do something because, as the minority leader \nindicated, our winter wheat farmers have already planted their wheat. \nThey do not know what the program is going to be. They are taking a \nchance, as they do from time to time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S79-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S80-S81]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOPEFUL SIGNS BETWEEN SYRIA AND ISRAEL\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I wish to offer my strong support for the \nadministration's recent, extraordinary efforts to broker a peace treaty \nbetween Israel and Syria.\n  I cannot overemphasize the importance of bringing Israel and Syria \ninto a peaceful, normal relationship. Their conflict is virtually the \nlast remaining obstacle to a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. If \nSyria and Israel are able to overcome their differences, sign an \nagreement, and establish diplomatic relations, it is nearly certain \nthat other Arab states--Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Gulf countries--\nwould soon follow suit. From that point forward, the region's prospects \nfor political, economic, and social advancement would become almost \nlimitless.\n  It is a sad irony that the peace talks being held in Wye, Maryland \narose out \n\n[[Page S81]]\nof the tragic assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. If \nthe Wye talks succeed in producing an agreement, it will surely add yet \nanother dimension to the Prime Minister's legacy as a peacemaker. I \nonly lament the fact that the price would have been so dear.\n  It is too early to tell what result these talks may have, but already \nthere have been suggestions from the participants that they are \noperating in an unprecedented environment of comity, seriousness, and \ncreativity. While a positive atmosphere does guarantee success on the \nimportant questions of substance, it does lend hope to those who \nwatched the failure of the previous, stale rounds of discussions.\n  In the next few weeks, it is expected that the Syrian and Israeli \ndelegations will consult with their governments, Secretary of State \nChristopher will shuttle to the capitals of the Middle East, and the \ntalks will reconvene. At the same time, everyone associated with the \ntalks knows that the Israeli and American electoral cycles afford \nprecious little time for a deal to be concluded. Under these \ncircumstances--a high level of activity, a small window of opportunity, \nand a new spirit of cooperation--progress is likely to occur quickly or \nnot at all.\n  Secretary of State Christopher and his Middle East peace team clearly \nunderstand their opportunities and their limitations, and have made \nevery effort to steer Israel and Syria in the proper direction. While \nultimately it remains the decision of the parties themselves to make \npeace, there is indeed a place for American leadership and engagement. \nSecretary Christopher, Ambassador Dennis Ross, and their colleagues at \nthe State Department deserve the Nation's highest respect and gratitude \nfor the energy, devotion, and intellect they have brought to the peace \ntable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S80-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S81]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

ARLEIGH A. BURKE, U.S. NAVY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on Thursday, January 4, 1996, the Nation \npaid its final tribute to a naval hero and patriot whose profound \ninfluence spanned more than 70 years and who laid down the blueprint of \ntoday's balanced fleet almost 40 years ago. I want to take this \nopportunity to honor the truly vital contributions made by that man, \nAdm. Arleigh A. Burke, who died on January 1, 1996, at the age of 94. \nHe was buried on the grounds of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD \nwhere he graduated in 1923. At sea and on land he was among the finest \nleaders that our country has produced. He stood watch on active service \nto our country for more than 40 years, rising from a meager farm at the \nfoot of the Colorado Rockies to serve as Chief of Naval Operations for \nan unprecedented 6 years during the bleakest days of the cold war.\n  Admiral Burke defined himself by an unwavering commitment to making \nthe most of every opportunity presented and giving the best he had to \nevery challenge that confronted him. When reminded of his earliest days \nof commissioned service, leading cleaning teams through the bilges of \nthe USS Arizona (BB 39), he once observed, ``You have only one job. \nVery seldom do you get the job you want. Do the best you can with the \njob you have. If it isn't very important, do it better. When you do a \njob well, it makes itself important.'' This straightforward approach to \nlife, combined with an unwavering commitment to those with whom he \nserved, produced an exceptional naval officer and leader who, in the \nwords of our current Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Boorda, ``--\ndefined what it is to be a naval officer: relentless in combat, \nresourceful in command, and revered by his crews.'' He was a man who \nreceived all the honors a grateful nation could bestow during his \nlifetime, yet chose for his burial marker the simple phrase ``Sailor'' \nto capture the sum and substance of his life.\n  As commander of Destroyer Squadron 23, ``The Little Beavers'', during \nWorld War II, he carried the fight to the Japanese navy night after \nnight in the Solomon Islands, earned the nickname ``31 Knot Burke'' \nfrom Admiral Halsey, and did as much as any man to turn the tide of \nbattle against an Imperial Japanese Fleet that was flushed by an \nunbroken series of victories. Over a sustained campaign of 4 months, \nhis squadron turned the tide of battle in the Solomons at Empress \nAugusta Bay, off Cape St. George. In ``The Slot'' and in 22 desperate \nengagements they produced a rich harvest of sunken ships and downed \naircraft.\n  As commander of the ``Little Beavers,'' Admiral Burke showed a \nremarkable ability to absorb the lessons of experience and then distill \nthem into battle orders and combat tactics that inspired his men and \ntook maximum advantage of every weapon at his disposal. He taught his \nsquadron to fight at night, to fight with stealth through the use of \ntorpedoes over guns, to strike quickly with maximum power, and to seize \nthe initiative in battle and never let it go. He instructed his \ncommanders concisely that, ``The difference between a good officer and \na poor one is about 10 seconds'' and set their priorities clearly, ``If \nit helps kill the enemy it is important. If it will not help kill the \nenemy it is not important.''\n  Serving on the Chief of Naval Operations staff after World War II, \nArleigh Burke played an extraordinary and vital part in clearly \nexplaining the pivotal role the Navy could have in preserving national \nsecurity during the cold war. He was not a controversial man by nature, \nbut he never shunned it when the needs of the Navy and our country made \ntheir demands. During a postwar period of intense and bitter \ninterservice rivalry that almost cost him his career, Arleigh Burke was \na clear voice of logic and sanity in stating the case for a Navy that \ntime and again responded to emerging cold war crises worldwide.\n\n  It was my great privilege to have served as a member of the Armed \nServices Committee and worked with Admiral Burke during his tenure as \nChief of Naval Operations. I speak from first hand experience when I \nreflect on the vision, forcefulness, intellect, and leadership that he \nbrought to bear on his duties. From his razor sharp mind came the \nconcepts of a balanced multi-mission Navy that could deal with crises \non short notice yet stay for the long haul when needed, antisubmarine \nwarfare and tactics as a top priority, the tremendous potential of \nnuclear power for naval ships, Polaris missiles at sea as an essential \nelement of nuclear deterrence, and an unwavering commitment to \n``training as we'll fight and fighting to win.''\n  Many able naval leaders have served our country well since Admiral \nBurke retired in 1961. I have worked with them all. They have been men \nof great talent and commitment, but they have all had the advantage of \nfollowing a course that was clearly charted for them by Arleigh Burke, \ncombat hero of World War II, a great naval leader of the cold war, a \nman who stepped down willingly when offered a remarkable fourth term as \nCNO to make way for younger men. He was a ``sailor's sailor.''\n  The Navy shares my admiration. It honored him in his lifetime by \nnaming the most powerful class of surface combatant in the world, the \nArleigh Burke class destroyer, for him. His legacy to the crew of the \nfirst ship was the simple observation, ``This ship was built to fight, \nyou had better know how.''\n  I want to express my condolences to Mrs. Roberta Burke, Admiral \nBurke's widow and wife of 72 years. She cherished and sustained her \nhusband in peace and war, a ``Sailor's Wife''. She has set a standard \nof service and commitment for thousands of naval families who must \ndaily endure the stress of family separation that accompanies service \nat sea. Without the sacrifices that Mrs. Burke and many other spouses \nhave shouldered, our Navy could not have been the force for freedom \nthat has helped guard this country and support our allies for so many \nyears.\n  I had the privilege of working with Arleigh Burke for several years. \nI came to admire him immensely. I always \n\n[[Page S82]]\nknew where he stood and what he stood for. I was struck anew by his \nsimple eloquence when I read the following words in his funeral \npamphlet: ``Life has been good to me. I didn't did young. I wasn't \nkilled in the war. I did most everything I wanted to do, and some \nthings I didn't want to do. I had a job I liked and a woman I loved. \nCouldn't ask for more than that.'' Such a powerful summation of an \nextraordinary life.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the time and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S81-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S82-S83]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   VICTOR RIESEL AND WALTER SHERIDAN--``IN DEFENSE OF HONEST LABOR''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the New York Times Magazine began a \ntradition a year ago of devoting its year-end issue to essays on the \nlives of some of the most interesting people who died during the year. \nThe December 31, 1994 issue of the magazine contained reflections on 51 \nmen and women who died last year. I commend all of these essays to my \ncolleagues for their eloquence, grace, and insight. They make excellent \nand inspiring reading.\n  One of the essays, by Pete Hamil, paid tribute to Victor Riesel and \nWalter Sheridan for their leadership on behalf of American workers and \nthe integrity of the American labor movement. Walter Sheridan worked \nwith my brother Robert Kennedy in the Justice Department in the 1960's, \nand later spent many years on the staff of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee as one of the finest investigators the Senate has \never had. I believe the essay will be of interest to all of us in \nCongress who knew Walter, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essay was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           [From the New York Times Magazine, Dec. 31, 1995]\n\n                       In Defense of Honest Labor\n\n                            (By Pete Hamill)\n\n       They spent many years fighting the same fight; trying to \n     give the American worker a fair shake and keep the unions \n     clean. 1913-1995 Victor Riesel, in his newspaper column that \n     run for more than 40 years and on his radio show, fearlessly \n     exposed labor corruption (and paid dearly for it). 1925-1995 \n     Walter J. Sheridan, as a government investigator with Robert \n     Kennedy in the Senate and in the Justice Department, helped \n     send Jimmy Hoffa to prison. In the end, neither Riesel nor \n     Sheridan was able to stem the downward slide of the labor \n     movement, but it can't be said that they didn't try.\n       When they died within days of each other in January, Victor \n     Riesel and Walter Sheridan seemed like figures from a lost \n     America. In their separate ways, they were shaped by that \n     brief, romantic time when millions of Americans still \n     believed that the labor movement would serve as the cement of \n     the social contract.\n       The theory was relatively simple. Unions--not government--\n     would establish hard limits on the powerful. Braided together \n     into a mighty national force, unions would guarantee lives of \n     security, decency and personal pride to ordinary citizens. \n     Unions would provide a sense of community. And unions would \n     be the ethical watch-dogs of the society, casting cold eyes \n     on slippery politicians and predatory businessmen. Those \n     ambitions were paid for with the blood of union members, from \n     Ludlow, Colo., to Flint, Mich., and in hundreds of other \n     places where a picket line was seen as a moral necessity.\n       By the time Riesel and Sheridan followed their separate \n     trails into our social history, the union movement was a \n     sewer. They knew it better than almost all others, for Riesel \n     and Sheridan were among the few Americans who carried torches \n     into that sewer and came back to tell us what they had seen.\n       Riesel was better known than Sheridan because for most of \n     his adult life he was a labor columnist, first at The New \n     York Post, where he began in 1942, and after 1948 at The New \n     York Daily Mirror, with syndication in some 300 newspapers. \n     It is one measure of how much our society has changed that \n     even the job description ``labor columnist'' sounds as rare \n     now as that of blacksmith.\n       Riesel came to his life's work with superb credentials. He \n     was born in 1913 on Manhattan's Lower East Side, that nursery \n     of union organizers, artists, prize-fighters and hoodlums. \n     His father was a union activist whose work carried the family \n     on the familiar journey to the more serene precincts of the \n     Bronx when Victor was 13. He graduated from Morris High \n     School just as the Great Depression was beginning and \n     immediately went to work. Over the next decade, he managed to \n     earn a bachelor's degree in the night school of the City \n     College of New York, while working in hat factories and lace-\n     makers' lofts and steel mills. He learned journalism on \n     college and union newspapers.\n       As Riesel was starting his labor column, when American \n     industry was gorged with wartime profits, the hoodlums were \n     everywhere. Lepke Buchalter and Gurrah Shapiro had corrupted \n     and terrorized the garment industry. The leaders of the \n     waterfront unions were brutal and cynical in their alliances \n     with the men who controlled the East Coast ports. Other \n     unions were run as businesses by faceless men protected from \n     scrutiny by the death of union democracy. Union treasuries \n     were looted; pension funds were eaten by the mob. Dissidents \n     had their heads broken or were dropped in swamps in New \n     Jersey. In the postwar boom, union leaders began buying \n     yachts. They played a lot of golf. They had become an \n     oligarchy, as remote from the rank and file as the men who \n     ran the great corporations. Riesel went after them in his \n     column and on his radio program and would eventually pay a \n     severe price.\n       If Riesel was formed by the Depression, Walter Sheridan's \n     character was shaped by World WAr II. he was born in 1925 in \n     Utica, N.Y. His father ran a small hotel called the Monclair \n     and a restaurant named Sheridan's, and though the Sheridans \n     were far from rich, the Depression did not force them into \n     soup kitchens. At the Utica Free Academy, a public high \n     school, Walter was senior class president and quarterback of \n     the football team. He joined the Navy, quickly volunteered \n     for the submarine service and was on board the U.S.S. Pargo \n     in the Sea of Japan on the day the war ended.ter the war, he \n     came to New York City and enrolled at Fordham on the G.I. \n     Bill. In 1948, while a student, he married Nancy Tuttle; they \n     had met in high school in Utica (and would go on to have 5 \n     children and 14 grandchildren). After graduation in 1950, \n     Sheridan briefly tried law school in Albany, then decided to \n     enter the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he would \n     spend four disillusioning years. The F.B.I. was then in the \n     iron control of J. Edgar Hoover, whose anti-Communist \n     obsessions, private intelligence files and bureaucratic \n     genius made him as permanent, a fixture in Washington as the \n     average union leader was in Bayonne. I once spent an hour \n     with Sheridan during Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 campaign and \n     asked him casually why he'd left the F.B.I.\n       ``Because Hoover was more interested in guys who were \n     Communists for 15 minutes in 1931,'' Sheridan said quietly, \n     ``than he was in guys who were stealing New Jersey.''\n       After resigning from the F.B.I., Sheridan joined the \n     National Security Agency, where he refined his skills as an \n     investigator. These included a willingness to endure tedium, \n     a stoical tenacity when faced with dry holes or \n     disappointment and, above all, an ability to gaze at often \n     purposefully obscure documents and discover a story line. \n     Most great investigators have two other qualities: a passion \n     for anonymity and a belief in the righteousness of the \n     enterprise. Sheridan, by all accounts, was a great \n     investigator.\n       In 1957, his life was permanently changed when he was \n     recruited by Robert Kennedy to join the staff of the Senate \n     Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or \n     Management Field, better known as the McClellan Committee. \n     The chairman was Senator John McClellan, a Democrat from \n     Arkansas. John F. Kennedy was a member of the committee, and \n     Robert Kennedy was the chief counsel. Sheridan established \n     almost instant rapport with Bobby. They laughed when they \n     discovered they were born on the same day--Nov. 20, 1925. \n     Kennedy quickly recognized in Sheridan characteristics he \n     admired in others who joined his team: tenacity, courage, a \n     respect for detail and hard work and an absence of self-\n     importance.\n       The basic task of the committee was to dig into the mob \n     takeover of the unions. It quickly began to focus on the \n     complex, gifted and corrupt Jimmy Hoffa and the Teamsters, \n     which, with almost two million members, was the nation's \n     largest and richest union. The hearings had been called, in \n     part, because of widespread national revulsion the year \n     before at what had been done to Victor Riesel.\n       On April 5, 1956, on his late-night radio show, Riesel \n     attacked racketeering in Local 138 of the International Union \n     of Operating Engineers, based in Long Island. He singled out \n     William C. DeKoning Sr., recently released from prison after \n     doing time for extortion, and his son, William C. DeKoning \n     Jr., who had inherited the presidency of the local when his \n     father was sent to jail. Riesel had also attacked Hoffa, who \n     was maneuvering from his Middle Western base to take over the \n     national leadership of the Teamsters.\n       After the broadcast, Riesel went to Lindy's, the most \n     famous of the late-night Broadway restaurants of the era. He \n     stepped outside at 3 a.m., was fingered by a shadowy figure \n     and then a young man stepped up and hurled sulfuric acid into \n     Riesel's face. He was permanently blinded.\n       The police learned that the acid thrower was a 22-year-old \n     apprentice hoodlum named Abraham Telvi, who disappeared for a \n     while. They arrested a second-level labor hoodlum--and Hoffa \n     crony--named John DioGuardia (better known as Johnny Dio) and \n     charged him with ordering the attack. But witnesses suddenly \n     developed amnesia and Johnny Dio went free. When Telvi, who \n     had been paid $1,175 by middlemen to do the job, understood \n     the importance of his victim, he demanded more money. He was \n     murdered on July 28 on the Lower East Side, not far from \n     where Riesel grew up.\n       There is no record of Riesel and Sheridan working together, \n     but in Sheridan's 1972 book, ``The Fall and Rise of Jimmy \n     Hoffa,'' he relates a tale told to him by an honest \n\n[[Page S83]]\n     teamster named Sam Baron, who was in a hotel room with Hoffa one night \n     in 1956:\n       Hoffa went into another room to take a phone call and then \n     came back into the room where Baron * * * and others were \n     gathered. According to Baron, Hoffa walked up to him and \n     poked his finger in his chest, saying, ``Hey, Baron, a friend \n     of yours got it this morning.''\n       ``What do you mean?'' Baron asked.\n       ``That son of a bitch Victor Riesel. He just had some acid \n     thrown on him. It's too bad he didn't have it thrown on the \n     goddamn hands he types with.''\n       Despite his blindness, Riesel continued writing his \n     syndicated column until his retirement in 1990. Sheridan, who \n     moved to the Justice Department when Robert Kennedy became \n     Attorney General, continued pursuing Jimmy Hoffa, and the \n     Teamsters leader finally went to prison in 1967. He served 58 \n     months before being released by Richard Nixon. None of this \n     was simple. The ``Get Hoffa'' squad, commanded by Sheridan, \n     often seemed obsessive; even some liberals objected to its \n     relentlessness. But Sheridan always denied that he and \n     Kennedy were engaged in a vendetta. ``For Kennedy to have \n     done less than he did,'' he wrote in his book, ``would have \n     been a violation of his own public trust and a dereliction of \n     duty.''\n       By the time Sheridan wrote those words, John and Robert \n     Kennedy had been murdered. A few years later, on July 30, \n     1975, Jimmy Hoffa went to meet a guy in a restaurant outside \n     Detroit and was never seen again. The labor movement hasn't \n     vanished, of course, but by any measurement, it is greatly \n     diminished. Not even the most giddy union idealist offers \n     hope that it can become in the future what it should have \n     been before the hoodlums cut into its heart. We do know this: \n     Victor Riesel and Walter Sheridan spent years of their lives \n     trying to save the labor movement from the enemy within, \n     trying to help thousands of people who would never know their \n     names.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       Pete Hamill's journalism career began in 1960 at The New \n     York Post, a union shop. ``Piecework,'' a collection of his \n     articles, is being published this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S82-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S83]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO THE LATE MARSHALL B. WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last week, as most people visited family \nand friends, enjoying the especially festive days between Christmas and \nNew Year's, hundreds of South Carolinians, including myself, were \nsaddened to learn of the death of a truly remarkable and legendary \nperson--Marshall B. Williams. For almost 50 years, this man faithfully \nserved the people of the Palmetto State as a member of the South \nCarolina House of Representatives and the South Carolina Senate. His \neasy going style and desire to build consensus among his colleagues \nmade him an especially effective legislator and helped to ensure his \nre-election year after year. As a matter of fact, his longevity in the \nSouth Carolina Senate earned him the distinction of not only serving as \nthat body's President pro tempore, but the Nation's longest serving \nState official.\n  While I have known the Williams family much of my life, I did not \nreally come to know Marshall until 1928 when he visited his sister who \nlived in Ridge Spring, SC. About 20 years later, in 1947, we both found \nourselves serving in State government. I had just been elected as \nGovernor of South Carolina and Marshall was in his first term as a \nmember of the House, being close in age as well as single, we quickly \nbecame good friends. It was a friendship that I valued and one which \nliterally lasted a lifetime.\n  Marshall was born of a different era and was the product of the \nvalues and traditions of the Old South, where manners and civility were \nstressed, and kindness was not an aberration. Such characteristics \npersonified Marshall throughout his personal and public lives, he \ntreated everyone with whom he came in contact with respectfully and \nkindly. His geniality and desire to build alliances and friendships \nearned him the respect and admiration of the men and women with whom he \nserved, his constituents, and citizens throughout South Carolina. It \nalso helped him to become an effective and strong leader within the \nSouth Carolina State House, where he chaired some of the most important \nand influential committees in the Senate. He was a figure who commanded \ndeference and respect, both because of his position and seniority, and \nalso because he accorded others those same courtesies.\n  With his bow tie and gentle manners, someone who passed Marshall on \nthe street might confuse him for a professor or a retired accountant \nrather than a strong and capable political leader. During his tenure in \nthe South Carolina Legislature, Marshall helped to create an era of \nunprecedented growth and change for our State, helping South Carolina \nbecome one of the leading centers for commerce and industry in the \nSoutheast. It takes an especially unique man to be born in an era when \nmost of the citizens of our State had little formal education and \nearned their living by farming, and in later years have the vision to \nhelp prepare South Carolina to compete in the high-technology global \nmarketplace of the 21st century. It was the work of a handful of \nleaders--of which Marshall Williams was one--in the public and private \nsectors, that prepared South Carolina to meet the challenges of the \nfuture and Marshall can be proud of the legacy he left.\n  Mr. President, this past Saturday over 1,000 people gathered in \nMarshall's hometown of Orangeburg, SC, to pay their last respects to \nthis man. I was among those who had the honor of eulogizing him and I \nbegan my remarks by noting that ``A giant has fallen''. This truly \ndescribes Senator Marshall Williams, he did so much for the State and \nNation that created him. I know that his wife Margaret, and his \nchildren, his grandchildren, and a large circle of friends will miss \nMarshall a great deal, and I certainly join them in their mourning for \nthis very special man. He touched the lives of thousands through his \nwork and efforts, and South Carolina will never be the same place as a \nresult of his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S83-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S83-S84]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE IMPACT OF THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the irresponsible Government shutdown has \nbrought havoc to the lives of millions of working Americans.\n  For the past 3 weeks, House Republicans held the Government hostage \nin an effort to force harsh and excessive cuts in Medicare, education, \nthe environment, and other vital programs in order to pay for their \nlavish tax breaks for the wealthy.\n  From coast to coast, the repercussions from the shutdown were felt \nnot only by Federal workers but by contractors who depend on the \nGovernment for their income, and by large numbers of other citizens and \nfirms who depend on the Government for their livelihood.\n  Massachusetts was hit hard by the shutdown. Over 15,000 of the \nState's 32,000 Federal employees had either been furloughed or were \nworking without pay since December 15.\n  The various stop-gap funding bills the Senate is now adopting will \nease some, but far from all, of these problems. It will pay Federal \nworkers through January 26 and permit a number of essential programs to \nresume. But many other important Federal services, which families have \nalready paid for with their hard-earned tax dollars, will not to be \nfunded under today's stop-gap bills.\n  The stop-gap bills still provide no funding for Head Start, which \nserves 2,000 children in Massachusetts. Nor does it provide assistance \nto low-income families to insulate their homes. The Foster Grandparents \nProgram, community health centers, the Ryan White AIDS Program, and \nclean water inspection will also continue to go unfunded.\n  At the same time, the stop-gap bills will send thousands of Federal \nworkers back to work--without the funding to administer these programs. \nRepublicans talk about making work pay, but under their stop-gap \nfunding bills, far too many Federal employees will be forced to sit \nidle at their desks while taxpayers demand these important services.\n  Republicans claim that they want to reduce the deficit and balance \nthe budget, but the Office of Management and Budget has found that over \nthe 3 weeks the Government has been closed, the Federal Treasury has \nlost $945 million--or $45 million a day. If that's not inefficient, I \ndon't know what is.\n  Instead of these defective stop-gap bills, we should have passed an \nhonest bill to reopen the Government while the budget negotiations \ncontinue. Responsible Republican leaders have tried in good faith to \nend this irresponsible shutdown, and I wish they had been more \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. DOLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll. \n  \n[[Page S84]]\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S83-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S84]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Is there objection to the request by the \nmajority leader?\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 38\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I have a fourth \nresolution I ask to be considered as part of this series, en bloc. I \nwill simply read the resolution.\n\n       The President and the Congress shall enact legislation in \n     the 2nd session of the 104th Congress to achieve a balanced \n     budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office, and the President and the \n     Congress agree that the balanced budget must protect future \n     generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare, and \n     provide adequate funding for Medicaid, education, \n     agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the environment. \n     Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax policies to help \n     working families and stimulate future economic growth.\n       The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office based on its most recent current \n     economic and technical assumptions, following a thorough \n     consultation and review with the Office of Management and \n     Budget, and other government and private experts.\n\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me indicate we hotlined this on this side. As far as I \nknow nobody has indicated any objection. I wanted to be sure we did \nthat because after the action we took last week I know the Senator from \nTexas, Senator Gramm, said he would have objected had he been here. I \nunderstand the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, and the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Senator Coverdell, made the same indication. I am not \ncertain about the Senator from Mississippi, Senator Lott.\n  But everybody has been notified. If they want to make any objection \nnow, wherever you are, now is the time to be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the majority leader?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I need some \nexplanation because of the resolution. Am I correct in my understanding \nthat the so-called clean CR that has the proviso that says that when \nthe President sends or submits a balanced budget in 7 years with CBO \nfigures and is certified by the Speaker, then the clean CR would be \nreleased, that that legislation stays here and does not go to the White \nHouse until such time as the President submits that budget?\n  Mr. DOLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. So therefore that piece of your unanimous-consent agreement \nwill not go to the President, but it will stay here?\n  Mr. DOLE. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the leader. I will not object.\n   Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nlatest version of a continuing resolution, and I commend the Majority \nLeader for his diligence in trying to bring an end to the budget \nimpasse.\n  It's long past time to send government workers back to work, and \nensure they receive full pay on time. We can wait no longer for the \nPresident to make good on his promise to submit a 7-year balanced \nbudget. It's clear he never intended to honor this commitment. But we \nsimply cannot hold our Nation's elderly, who depend on Meals on Wheels; \nour veterans, who depend on their monthly benefit check; those who need \npassports to travel; children, who depend on federal assistance; or \nfederal workers, to name a few, hostage to the President's refusal to \ncarry through on his commitment.\n  As chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, my patience with this administration has completely \nexpired. The White House has shown no willingness to negotiate in good \nfaith to resolve their concerns with the VA-HUD bill. While I have \nexpressed my willingness time and again to negotiate a compromise, the \nWhite House does not seem to understand the art of compromise.\n  Last month, OMB prepared a list totaling $1.9 billion which at the \ntime represented the administration's list of what they wanted in \nadditional spending for the VA-HUD bill. Earlier this week, I saw a new \nlist which OMB had prepared, which had grown to almost $2.5 billion. \nMr. President, this doesn't represent a good faith attempt to resolve \nthe current budget crisis! The size of the list is going in the wrong \ndirection!!\n  Let me highlight just a few items on the administration's so-called \n``wish list'' for the VA-HUD Subcommittee which would make the bill \n``acceptable'' to the President.\n  The list contains several pork barrel projects, including $62 million \nfor the first phases of two brand new VA hospitals--at a time when the \nveteran population is declining, VA's existing 173 hospitals are \nunderutilized, and GAO says these facilities are not needed.\n  The list includes $50 million for a new $280 million EPA laboratory, \na project we just cannot afford at this time.\n  The list includes $1 million for the obsolete Office of Consumer \nAffairs, when we have 2 other consumer agencies which can take over \nOCA's activities at far less expense. While the President has said he's \nfor streamlining and eliminating duplication, when the time comes to \nactually do it, he refuses.\n  For EPA's environmental technology initiative, the White House says \nwe must put in another $62 million--despite the fact that this program \nhas been a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and there is nothing to \nshow for the millions we've already spent over the past 2 years.\n  For Boston Harbor, the White House says we need another $75 million, \nin addition to the $25 million included in the VA-HUD bill and on top \nof the $530 million already appropriated over the past several years \nfor this pork barrel project. I say to the President, enough is enough! \nIt's time to get real and begin good faith negotiations.\n  While my frustration with this administration is mounting even as I \nspeak, I do not believe it's right to allow the American people, who \ndepend on services provided by their Federal government, to be the \nvictims of the President's intransigence.\n  Therefore, I support passage of this continuing resolution, returning \nworkers to their jobs, and providing full year spending authority for \nsuch critical activities as veterans benefits, Meals on Wheels, child \nwelfare programs, passport and visa services, and locally financed \noperations of the District of Columbia.\n  As chairman of the VA-HUD subcommittee, I'm particularly pleased that \nthis continuing resolution will enable the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to provide payments to needy and disabled veterans in a timely \nmanner. It will enable VA to pay its hospital workers--who have been \nworking without pay for the past 3 weeks--and pay those who supply \nmedicine, food, and \n\n[[Page S89]]\nother critical supplies to its hospitals. This is extremely important \nand I strongly support the inclusion of this provision in the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Let me make clear that while I support this measure, it is in no way \na solution to the budget stalemate. There are many, many activities \nwhich will not be carried out even if this legislation is enacted. For \nexample, while VA can begin processing new claims again, VA will not be \nable to make payments to new beneficiaries. EPA Superfund cleanup \ncontractors will not get paid. FEMA's emergency food and shelter \nprogram will not receive funds--meaning that hundreds of people who \nfind themselves in need of temporary housing assistance will not get \nhelp. And States will not receive grants to run their environmental \nprotection programs or for the construction of wastewater treatment \nplants.\n  Mr. President, this measure also will not address a major problem \nwith contractor provided services, particularly those provided by small \nbusinesses which typically have limited financial resources with which \nto weather-out delays in payments. This is a very large problem because \nover the last decade the Federal Government has emphasized contracting \nout of activities which could be more efficiently carried out by the \nprivate sector. Many activities which formerly were conducted by \nFederal employees have been converted over to the private sector. The \nemployees of these contractors have been furloughed just like the \nFederal Government counterparts, but under the terms of this bill, they \nwon't be returning to work. And, even when they do return to work, it \nwon't be with the assurances of reimbursement that Federal employees \nare being given for their lost pay.\n  As Chairman of the Small Business Committee, I am particularly \nconcerned over the adverse impact this budget impasse is having on cash \npoor small business contractors. These businesses cannot draw readily \nupon pre-existing lines of credit or cash reserves that large \ncorporations usually have available. So even where the Federal \nGovernment has determined that a function carried out by a contractor \nis critical or related to health and safety, the Government's inability \nto make timely payments jeopardizes the very existence of these small \nbusinesses.\n  While the VA-HUD bill Congress passed in December would have funded \nevery one of these activities, the President decided the bill was not \ngood enough and he vetoed it. He vetoed it because we could not breech \nthe budget constraints and appropriate another $2 billion. If he had \nsigned it, he could have sought supplemental funds in negotiations with \nthe Congress and all of the hardships his veto caused could have been \navoided.\n  But we are left with no choice but to enact this stop-gap measure. I \nurge the President and his advisors and all those involved in \nnegotiations on the budget, to work in good faith to come to an \nagreement as soon as possible.\n  In conclusion, I again commend the Majority Leader for his hard work \non this matter, and I urge its expeditious adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the majority leader as amended by the minority leader?\n  Hearing none, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  So the motion to concur in the amendment of the House to H.R. 1643 \nwas agreed to.\n  So the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 131) was agreed to.\n  So the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 38) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 38\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the President and the Congress shall enact \n     legislation in the 2nd session of the 104th Congress to \n     achieve a balanced budget not later than fiscal year 2002 as \n     estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, and the \n     President and the Congress agree that the balanced budget \n     must protect future generations, ensure Medicare solvency, \n     reform welfare, and provide adequate funding for Medicaid, \n     education, agriculture, national defense, veterans, and the \n     environment. Further, the balanced budget shall adopt tax \n     policies to help working families and stimulate future \n     economic growth.\n       The balanced budget agreement shall be estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office based on its most recent current \n     economic and technical assumptions, following a thorough \n     consultation and review with the Office of Management and \n     Budget, and other government and private experts.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. That takes care of the Senator's request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. DOLE. I think the Senator from Alaska wants to comment, too. I \nthink the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, has some concern about this process. In fact, \nI think the Senator from Alaska talked to the Senator from Oregon. But \nlet us proceed. We need to work on some of these things.\n  Has anybody determined, once they look through the list--NIH will be \napproved for an entire year, in fact, a number for an entire year, some \nMarch 15. That takes those provisions out of other bills that may be \npending or may have been vetoed. I think it does present some \ndifficulty for the appropriators, particularly those who might be \nconferees when they try to salvage the rest of those proposals and get \nthem passed. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Alaska for \nfurther comments. I know he talked to Senator Hatfield.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  It is my understanding that this bill is now for the full year for \nall of the subjects mentioned.\n  Mr. DOLE. In the second, yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The difficulty is--I have not spoken directly with the \nSenator from Oregon, but he has sent to me his concerns as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee that what this does is it pulls out of \nsome bills, as the leader said, provisions that may disturb really the \nsynergy of the whole bills when we come back and try to get them \nfinally adopted and sent to the President.\n  So he does really express great reservation to the procedure that is \nbeing used. So he wants me to indicate that the Appropriations \nCommittee on this side will not pursue this procedure again.\n  Mr. DOLE. I do not disagree, obviously, with the Senator from Alaska \nor the Senator from Oregon. I think in the event we should reach an \nagreement with the President on a balanced budget we can take care of \nall the appropriations bills that are still around here, but otherwise \nit is going to present a real problem. But I would just say the House \ninsisted that they be for 1 year or they not be included at all. So you \nhad to make a judgment because some of these are very sensitive \nprograms, very important programs.\n\n  So we yielded to the wishes of the House appropriators in this case. \nBut I understand the Senator's concern.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, just one comment further. It is my \nunderstanding that the figure is the House figure on those disputed \nitems which are in conference with the Senate. That is the Senator from \nOregon's real objection to this procedure.\n  Mr. DOLE. Some are the House figures and some are the conference \nfigures. But the Labor-HHS, since that has not been completed that is \nthe House figure in Labor-HHS.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Right.\n  Mr. DOLE. Let me thank all my colleagues. The House is still debating \nwhat we have completed. But we are going to--in case there should be \nany amendment, the Democratic leader and I agreed we would be here \ntomorrow so we could concur on any additional amendment, if we agree on \nit, concur in that amendment, because we want to be certain on Monday \nthe money is available for whatever may be in that text that I sent up.\n  I do not think there will be any amendments adopted on the House \nside, but if so that will be taken care of tomorrow. And we will \ncondition coming in tomorrow on whether or not there are any amendments \nadded. If there are no amendments added, we will not be in session \ntomorrow, we will not be in session Sunday, we will come in about 2 or \n3 o'clock on Monday, probably about 3 o'clock Monday.\n  I want to thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. In my view, \nwe have a resolution now of a very thorny problem and one that unfairly \npunished a lot of good people, Federal employees in particular who were \nbeing paid for not working, not because they do not want to work--they \nwere willing to \n\n[[Page S90]]\nwork--but they could not go to work. And this will see that they are \npaid.\n  In addition, we have provided money for a number of programs, as \npointed out in the two sort of targeted appropriations bills that we \npassed this evening. Of course, the President now, if he decides to lay \ndown a balanced budget, scored by CBO, over a 7-year period, then \neverything is going to be open until January 26.\n  I think by that time we will either have reached the budget agreement \nor not. That gives us 3 weeks in which to do that. And I hope that if \nwe cannot come to some agreement that we are not going to go through \nthis process again with a Government shutdown or partial shutdown. I \nknow that the Speaker is working on some language that in the event \nthis should happen again that I think every Federal worker would be \ndeemed essential so they would still be coming to work, and some other \nprovisions they are working on on the House side so there would not be \na repeat of the 21- or 22-day shutdown, following the earlier 7-day \nGovernment shutdown or partial shutdown.\n\n  So I want to thank the Democratic leader. And I want to thank my \ncolleague from Virginia who has been on the floor all week long, and \nothers who have an interest in this matter, as we all do. I think now \nthat we have completed action we can tell everyone to go back to work.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I share the satisfaction expressed by the \nmajority leader about the opportunity now to send Federal workers back \nto work with pay, apparently now giving them also the authority and \nfunding to do at least some of the things that they are being paid for. \nBut I share the reservations expressed by the Senator from Alaska and \nthe Senator from Oregon. This is not the way to run a Government.\n  The majority leader had it right on January 2. On January 2 this body \npassed a clean continuing resolution that did all that we should do. \nNow we are picking and choosing. Now we are picking winners and losers. \nNow we are still leaving unfunded a lot of very important programs \nincluding Head Start, JOBS, cops on the beat, virtually all the \nprograms at the Commerce Department, NASA operations, the social \nservices block grants, Violence Against Women grants, entire divisions \nof the Department of Justice--including the criminal, civil rights, and \nenvironmental divisions, among others--all Environmental Protection \nAgency contractor operations, low-income housing vouchers, and \nvocational rehabilitation. Many more agencies and activities, very \nimportant functions of Government, are still left without any funding, \nstill left without any standing as we enter this new session of \nCongress in this new calendar year. American taxpayers have paid for \nthese services, yet they will not be receiving them.\n  So no one should be misled. We have not solved everything here. We \nhave solved only part of the problem. As I have said all day, we have \ncome to the agreement that something is better than nothing. And \nnothing is what we would have had if nothing passed tonight. And so I \nam somewhat encouraged that we made some progress in all of this, \nalthough I wish we had done again tonight what we did on January 2--\npass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the entire government and \nrestore some normalcy to our governmental processes.\n  As for the 7-year budget issue, the reason we added the fourth \nmeasure to this en bloc unanimous consent request agreement is that the \ncommitment to a 7-year balanced budget, Mr. President, was only half of \nthe agreement Democrats and Republicans both made last November.\n  The other half of the agreement was that we were going to protect \npriorities. We all agreed we would negotiate toward a balanced budget \nif we could agree to one within a 7-year period of time, scored by CBO \nonce finalized--after there was consultation with the Office of \nManagement and Budget. But what we also agreed to was that we would \nprotect those priorities that Democrats and some Republicans have \nindicated are very important if we are going to achieve a balanced \nbudget: all the priorities I read earlier.\n  Those priorities include Medicare and making sure that people have \nevery confidence that in the Medicare Program they are going to be \nprotected. They include Medicaid and education and the environment. \nThey include agriculture and veterans affairs--priorities that we feel \nevery bit as strongly about as we feel the need to balance the budget \nin 7 years. We are unwilling to use those pools of resources to pay for \ntax cuts for those who do not need them.\n  So we felt the need to recommit ourselves and our colleagues to those \npriorities that we all agreed to last November.\n  Mr. President, I know others want to speak. Let me just close by \nreading a letter that I got from Amanda Munroe a couple of days ago. \nAmanda Munroe is a sixth grader from Sturgis, SD. She wrote a letter \nthat is as poignant and as straight to the point as anything I have \nread. It is probably appropriate tonight that it be read and shared \nwith my colleagues:\n\n       I am 12 years old and in the 6th grade at Sturgis Williams \n     Middle School. My mom and dad both work at Fort Meade \n     Veterans Medical Center. Many kids at Sturgis Williams Middle \n     School have parents that work at Fort Meade.\n       In school I learned that the Government is of the people, \n     for the people, and by the people. I thought the Government \n     was supposed to make choices that help the Nation. The \n     furlough does not only hurt Federal workers, it hurts the \n     children also. I thought the children were the future.\n       I think that the Democrats and the Republicans should each \n     give a little and pass the budget. It would make the future \n     of Federal workers and their children much brighter.\n       Thanks for being the grinch that stole our Christmas.\n\n  There are a lot of children and others out there who did not have a \nvery rosy Christmas as a result of an extraordinary experience they \nhave had to endure. Let us hope it is now over. Let us hope at long \nlast Federal workers can go back to work, pay their bills, run the \nGovernment and do the things that we have asked them to do. We will all \nbe better for it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first want to express my great respect \nand appreciation for the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. In the \n200-plus years that this institution has been serving the public of \nthis great Nation, I doubt if there has been a chapter with parallel \nand complexity and such seriousness as the one we witnessed here of \nrecent days.\n  The leadership exhibited by Senator Dole throughout has earned him an \nindelible place in the history of this institution and in that category \nso named as a profile in courage for what he has done.\n  I join with Senator Dole in his expression of appreciation to the \nminority leader and his leadership, together with the minority whip and \nhis leadership. I have had the privilege here of being on the floor \nthroughout the week with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and \nwhile we may have had differences of views, we have tried our very best \nto maintain a bipartisan approach to the solution, and I think that was \nachieved.\n  I also want to pay special recognition to Members of Congress from \nthe greater Metropolitan Washington area: Congressman Davis, \nCongressman Gilchrest, Congressman Wolf, Congresswoman Morella. We have \nbeen meeting regularly, together with Congressman Bateman, who \nrepresents another section of the State of Virginia, to try and provide \nthe leadership of the Senate and the House with our best judgment as to \nhow this matter may be resolved.\n  I also wish to thank the Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from \nAlaska, a known expert on the complexity of appropriation measures. We \ncounseled together throughout the evening on various aspects of the \nlegislative messages coming from the House, and, indeed, I think \nthrough his wisdom, one or two problems were corrected at the last \nminute. I wish to commend him for the service he has rendered the \nSenate in that capacity this evening. Time is short and there was a \nneed to move forward on this.\n  I know there are other Senators anxious to speak. I shall yield the \nfloor. Again, my expression of appreciation to all the colleagues who \nworked together as a team, together with a very competent staff of this \ninstitution to make this possible and to put back to \n\n[[Page S91]]\nwork these individuals who were caught in the crossfire, in a very \nunfair manner, caught in a crossfire--not only those who are Government \nemployees, but indeed the ripple effect throughout our State and other \nparts of the United States which involved either directly or indirectly \nmany members of the private sector.\n\n  I hope we have learned by this experience, Mr. President, we have \nlearned a lesson such as it will not be repeated again in the future. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I join in the remarks of Senator Warner \nrelative to the majority leader and minority leader and the minority \nwhip, Senator Ford, and the person who has been serving somewhat of a \nsimilar capacity, Senator Warner, on the floor, as well as other \nleaders, including the chairman of the Budget Committee in the Senate.\n  I think the Senate, basically, has endeavored to act very reasonably \nin approaching this issue pertaining to the shutdown of the Government, \ngetting the Federal employees back on the job. I think Senator Dole's \nspeech on ``enough is enough'' was a remarkable speech and a remarkably \ncourageous statement.\n  I think in the Senate we have shown that we can get together, be \nreasonable, work out these matters. We have differences as to what a \nbalanced budget over 7 years should be comprised of, and a lot of \ndifferences. Nevertheless, there is a spirit here of cooperation in \nendeavoring to try to work together, to try to solve the problems that \nconfront the Nation at this particular time.\n  I was really concerned about the bills that were coming over from the \nHouse relative to it, because in effect they were authorizing the \nemployees to go back to work but in effect restricting what they could \ndo by the use of funds. I sort of referred it to one of my friends as, \nyou are sending them back to work, but you are putting them in a thumb-\ntwiddling situation where they just have to sit around and twiddle \ntheir thumbs and they cannot do anything because of the restrictions. \nThat still applies to a large number of the agencies and departments \nthat are not covered. I am delighted that there is this second targeted \nappropriations continuing resolution and it takes care of a number of \nvery important agencies and departments in Government.\n  During the day when we first started out, this was omitted, and I \nbegan to talk to a great number of people pertaining to a number that I \nfelt were essential, that they ought to be continued, such as the \nNational Institutes of Health. I talked to the Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health during the day. Of course, there were real \nproblems there that they would have on continuation of research, vital \nresearch, and the grants. He told me they had something like over a 3-\nmonth period, around 4,000 applications that they had to process.\n\n  There is also a very unusual program where people with rare diseases \ncome within the ambit of the National Institutes of Health and are able \nto be treated, and they are given special treatment and special drugs. \nIt has saved the lives of numerous individuals, and this would have had \nto be shut down.\n  The Center for Communicable Diseases and the Centers for Disease \nControl were in a situation where Senator Nunn made a very telling \nspeech and very informative speech about yesterday. To me, it was \nessential that we continue to operate at full force and with full \neffectiveness the Centers for Disease Control. Monitoring flu, you \nnever know exactly what is going to happen. There are diseases that \noccur and epidemics that could take place. This is extremely important.\n  To me, another very essential aspect was the conduct of the courts of \nthe land. Our judiciary needed to be protected. I did some \ninvestigations and under the proposals that would have occurred until \nthis last second targeted appropriations bill has now been approved by \nthis body and will be brought up before the House later--and, of \ncourse, if they pass it, it will be deemed to have been adopted by the \nSenate under our resolution. There are an average of 4,500 individuals \ncharged with Federal felonies each month. If the criminal trials are \nnot held, public safety will be jeopardized, because under the Speedy \nTrial Act, criminal trials must be held within 70 days from the date \nthe defendant is indicted or arrested, or charges are dismissed and the \ndefendants will be released back into the community.\n  As evidenced by the bombing at Oklahoma City, and in recent instances \nin Chicago involving the murder of a court security officer, an \nattempted mail bombing, the safety of judges and judicial employees is \nalso at great risk.\n  The lack of Federal funds to pay the contractors who operate the \nscreening equipment and assist the U.S. marshals in providing security \nin Federal courthouses would result in undetected guns, explosives, and \nother weapons getting into courtrooms. Judges, especially those in \nhigh-risk areas, will not jeopardize the safety of court personnel, \njurors, witnesses, and the public by holding trial in the absence of \nproper security. This could result in the possible dismissal of cases \nand release of defendants back into the community.\n  And then jury trials: No funds would have been available to pay \njurors in civil and criminal trials. As a result, courts will be faced \nwith the choice of either delaying important trials or compelling \ncitizens to serve under the threat of imprisonment or fine without any \npromise of timely pay. Trials would be canceled or delayed because 60 \npercent of the court reporting and half of all of the court \ninterpreting is performed by outside contractors. Court-appointed \nprivate attorneys, who represent almost half of all criminal \ndefendants, would not be paid, jeopardizing the holding of criminal \ntrials for their clients. This would lead to possible dismissal of \ncases and release of defendants back into the community.\n  Public safety throughout the country would be seriously impaired due \nto a lack of Federal funds to pay for drug testing, drug and mental \nhealth treatment, halfway house placement, home confinement monitoring, \ncommunity supervision by judicial employees of 114,000 convicted \ncriminals, the majority of whom have served sentences of incarceration, \nand those charged with Federal crimes and so on. I could go on. Even in \nthe bankruptcy court there are matters that would have to be looked at, \nand this would cause problems relative to this.\n  I am delighted to see that the Department of Justice crime programs--\nthe FBI, DEA, prisons, U.S. marshals, U.S. attorneys, U.S. Marshal \nService, organized crime, and drug enforcement--are taken care of in \nregards to that. But there are other areas in the Department of Justice \nthat are not taken care of.\n  So, I think we still have to look at this, in this situation of where \npeople go back to work, but then, in effect, they are so restricted \nthey cannot carry out their duties, raises the question of how rational \nand how wise such a measure is. Nevertheless, it is better than what we \nhave had.\n  Again, I thank the leadership of the Senate for their work relative \nto this and in the reasonable approach they have used. Hopefully, some \nof that reasonable approach has rubbed off on the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe late on a Friday evening, with \nvery few of the public listening or watching, the Congress of the \nUnited States is about to accomplish an extraordinary feat. We have \npassed, or are about to pass automatically, a series of resolutions \nwhich will solve the immediate crisis before us, a crisis in the day-\nto-day administration of many of the agencies of our Federal \nGovernment. It is that crisis, of course, which has occupied the minds \nand hearts and the time of many Members of Congress, of almost all of \nour Federal employees, and of much of the administration over the \ncourse of the last several weeks. And it is an accomplishment in \nitself, given the controversial nature of the issues before us.\n  From the perspective, from the point of view of the long-range \ninterests of the people of the United States, however, that \naccomplishment pales by comparison with the near commitment we now have \nto a proposed balanced budget from the President of the United States, \na goal we have sought unanimously on this side of the aisle, a goal \nsought by many on the other side of the aisle, for an extended period \nof time, for at least all of calendar year 1995. It is a goal which \nwas, of course, not attained by the original budget the \n\n[[Page S92]]\nPresident of the United States submitted to Congress, by the revisions \nlast summer, or by any of the further revisions which have taken place \nduring the course of this debate during the fall and winter of 1995 and \nin 1996.\n  Now, however, the full restoration of the administration of various \ndepartments of the United States depends upon the submission by the \nPresident of the United States of just such a balanced budget. These \nproposals do not require any particular content in that balanced \nbudget, but they do require, and I believe will obtain, a set of \nproposals from the President which can be compared at that point by \nMembers of Congress, by the news media, and by the people of the United \nStates, with the various proposals the Republicans have made, including \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995 recently vetoed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Just why it has taken this extended period of time, why the President \nhas so resisted meeting us on common ground, a common ground from which \nwe all hope a valuable compromise can be reached, is difficult to \nunderstand. Clearly Members of the Democratic Party can meet the \nchallenge of proposing a balanced budget using honest figures which \npresumably meets each of the priorities on which they place so much \nweight with respect to health care, the environment, education, and the \nlike. Conservative Democrats in the House produced such a budget many \nweeks ago. The leadership of the Democratic Party here in the Senate \nmade such a proposal before the Christmas recess.\n\n  Now, much of the debate has revolved around the insistence of \nRepublicans on a balanced budget using figures provided by the \nCongressional Budget Office. The overwhelming attention of the White \nHouse and of many of its supporters has been toward a list, included in \nthe last balanced budget requirement, respecting adequate funding for \nMedicare, Medicaid, education, the national defense, and a number of \nother activities of the Federal Government.\n  But there is a very real distinction between those two parts of that \nNovember resolution. The determination of whether or not a proposed \nbudget, whatever its specific content, is in fact balanced under the \nprojections of the Congressional Budget Office is a pure question of \nfact. Either it is or it is not.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, basing its judgment on certain \nassumptions, makes a series of mathematical calculations and tells us \nwhether, in its view, in the year 2002, the budget will be balanced. \nThe answer is yes or no. There is, given the nature of the requirement, \nno valid difference of opinion as to whether or not a particular budget \nis balanced. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 included such a balance. \nLater proposals by the Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, are balanced in that fashion.\n  The so-called bipartisan proposal set forth by Senators Chafee and \nBreaux and a number of others reaches such a balance. The Democratic \nleadership proposal reaches that balance, as does conservative \nDemocrats' budget in the House of Representatives. Whether or not a \nparticular budget adequately funds Medicare, Medicaid, education, the \nnational defense, or does the right thing with respect to taxes, with \nrespect to working Americans, however, is a question of opinion. It is \nthe view of this Senator and the view of the Senator from New Mexico \nthat each of those goals was and is appropriately met by the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995.\n  Members on the other side of the aisle and the President do not \nagree. Presumably, they feel that each of those goals is met by the \nDemocratic leadership budget proposal. They feel, evidently, that it \ndeals appropriately with the tax burden on middle-class working \nAmericans, even though that proposal increases taxes overall in order \nto reach balance. I disagree with that proposition as they disagree \nwith my views on various spending programs. But these are matters of \nopinion; these are matters which obviously are subject to compromise.\n  What we have gained at this point is the implicit agreement that the \nPresident of the United States, now for the first time, will join the \nconservative colleagues in his party in the House, his leadership in \nthe Senate, and make his proposal, presumably with specific policy \njudgments with respect to each of these spending items--to the national \ndefense, to our tax structure --that will meet the objective \nrequirements of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Only when we have these figures is there any real chance that we will \nsucceed in reaching a middle ground that will objectively lead to a \nbalanced budget by the year 2002 and subjectively, presumably in the \nminds of those Members of Congress who vote for it in both parties and \nthe President who signs it, meet these other policy objectives as well.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not here to apologize and say that this is \nthe best job we could do. I find it at least slightly amusing that we \nare accepting lock, stock, and barrel what the House of Representatives \nhas proposed with respect to the specific language in these various \nresolutions. But, on the other hand, I think it is safe to say that we \nprobably would not have reached this conclusion this quickly had it not \nbeen for the actions earlier this week and late last week by the \ndistinguished majority leader in saying that we had to get out of the \ndilemma in which we found ourselves.\n  It does seem to me, however, that given the nature of the immediate \ncrisis we face, as well as our overall goals of balancing the budget, \nthat we have not done a slap-dash job, we have not done a second, or \nthird-best job. We have done the job right. We will have solved the \nimmediate crisis, and we will have made a gigantic step toward that \nmagnificent goal of balancing our budget; of ending the practice of \nspending money today on things that we want and sending the bills to \nour children and grandchildren; of giving them higher incomes, as now \nis almost a common opinion of economists throughout the United States, \nby lowering the burden of debt which they will be required to carry; by \nmaking their futures brighter and making their futures brighter our own \nas well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S84-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S92]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT--MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are here tonight to talk about two \nimportant issues--one is the short-term outlook for the operation of \nthe Federal Government, and the other is the long-term economic future \nof the Nation.\n  The Senate is now considering a continuing appropriations resolution \n[CR] that will reopen the Federal Government and put our Federal \nemployees back to work with pay. This CR will operate the Federal \nGovernment for 3 weeks through January 26 and give the congressional \nleadership and the President the opportunity to again try to agree on a \nbalanced budget plan.\n  This CR has a reasonable requirement that the President should now \npresent a budget plan that reaches balance over 7 years using CBO \nestimates. The President committed to this goal when he signed the \ncontinuing resolution last November (H.J. Res. 122 Public Law 104-56), \nbut he has yet to submit a balanced budget by CBO scoring.\n\n\n                           chronology for bba\n\n  Mr. President, the President submitted his fiscal year 1996 budget to \nCongress on February 6. At the same time, the new Republican Congress \nwas undertaking the long overdue task of balancing the Federal budget.\n\n[[Page S93]]\n\n  Congress has worked for over a year now, Mr. President, to bring that \ngoal to a reality. The Senate Budget Committee, which I chair, held 22 \nhearings on the budget through early August.\n  The Senate Budget Committee held 4 days of markup and considered 36 \namendments in fashioning the balanced budget resolution. The Senate \ndebated the budget resolution for the full 50 hours over 6 days during \nwhich time 76 amendments were offered.\n  To carry out the reconciliation instructions of the budget resolution \nto develop the Balanced Budget Act, 11 Senate committees drafted \nlegislation. The reconciliation bill was considered by the Senate for \n45 hours over 3 days, during which 66 amendments were offered.\n  After a conference on this significant legislation, the House and \nSenate approved the conference agreement on the Balanced Budget Act \nbefore Thanksgiving, and the President came back and vetoed the bill on \nDecember 6.\n\n\n                            bba negotiations\n\n  Mr. President, I am not one to give up on a difficult task, and the \nPresident's veto did not deter me. Since the veto, I have met with \nWhite House officials and congressional leaders to try to find common \nground on a Balanced Budget Act.\n  I am not alone in this effort. Republicans have been willing to move \ntoward the President's position on many major issues. In a proposal \nRepublicans made to the President, we proposed providing another: $24 \nbillion to medicare; $16 billion to medicaid; $12 billion to welfare-\nrelated programs, including the EITC; and $25 billion in funding for \neducation, the environment, and other domestic priorities.\n  In total, Republicans offered to add back $95 billion to move toward \nmeeting some of the President's concerns about the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Republicans have also made it clear that all issues are on the table \nfor the negotiations. We have had discussions with the White House on \nthe tax cuts included in the Republican BBA.\n\n\n                                medicare\n\n  Medicare spending in the Republican Balanced Budget Act grows at an \naverage rate of 7.4 percent a year over the next 7 years, that's well \nmore than twice the rate of inflation. Just 2 years ago, the President \nsaid that if you slow the growth of Medicare to twice the rate of \ninflation, you are not cutting Medicare.\n  Our Medicare savings are down from $226 billion over 7 years under \nCBO's reestimate of the BBA to $202 billion in our latest negotiations \nwith the President. We would spend $1.7 trillion over the next 7 years \non Medicare under this proposal.\n  In addition, the President expressed concern about the Medicare part \nB premium, and we have offered him a compromise on that issue.\n  Our goal is to make the entire Medicare Program sustainable in the \nlong run, and Republicans believe our plan makes a significant start on \nthis path. Under our plan, the Medicare part A trust fund would be \nsolvent past the year 2017. Our plan would also slow the growth of part \nB spending to move it toward a sustainable path.\n  In all of these negotiations we have indicated our willingness to \nfurther discuss with the President the changes we propose to make to \nthe Medicare Program to ensure its solvency.\n\n\n                                medicaid\n\n  Medicaid under the Balanced Budget Act that the President vetoed, \nwould grow at an average annual rate of 5.2 percent over the next 7 \nyears. This translates into Federal spending of $700 billion over the \nnext 7 years. When you add in State spending, that doubles to $1.4 \ntrillion.\n  I think the issue in Medicaid is not the level of savings or the \ngrowth rate of Medicaid spending, but how much flexibility we are going \nto give the States to innovate within their own Medicaid programs.\n  The President says we are cutting Medicaid, but he ignores the fact \nthat spending for Medicaid will go up each and every year under our \nbudget plan.\n  The President has expressed concern about the need for Medicaid \nfunding to adjust for changes in population and for economic \nfluctuations. I think the President has a good point, and I think it is \nworth looking at modifications to our Medicaid plan that can meet these \nneeds.\n\n\n                             welfare reform\n\n  On welfare-related programs, Republican's have added back $10 billion \nplus another $2 billion for the EITC.\n  For welfare programs, as for Medicaid, the President wants to keep \nmore control here in Washington; we want to give that power back to the \nStates and allow them to meet the real needs of their citizens by \ndesigning their own welfare and Medicaid plans.\n\n\n                           other budget plans\n\n  In addition to the modified Republican BBA, the House Coalition, Blue \nDogs Group, has offered its own balanced budget proposal, which meets \nthe CBO test.\n  Senate Democrats have offered their own BBA--Daschle, Simon, and \nConrad--as has the Bipartisan Senate Group--Chafee, Breaux, and \nothers--that all reach balance under CBO scoring--see attached table.\n  In addition 2 days ago, Senator Moynihan offered his own balanced \nbudget proposal, which would also get us to a balanced Federal budget.\n  Mr. President, the only party that has not met this challenge is the \nPresident of the United States.\n  It is now time for him to come forward, to present a balanced budget \nplan under CBO's scoring, to sign this continuing resolution to reopen \nthe entire Federal Government, and join Congress in serious \nnegotiations to balance the Federal budget for the Nation's future \neconomic well-being.\n\n\n                            fiscal dividend\n\n  A balanced Federal budget is good for the country. In CBO's December \nupdate of the budget and economic outlook, CBO finds lower interest \nrates and more robust economic growth generated by a balanced budget \nyielding $282 billion in deficit reduction over and above specific \npolicy savings.\n  Additional deficit reduction is generated because: real GDP will grow \n0.1 percent per year faster than it would absent a balanced budget; \ncorporate profits will reach 8.2 percent of GDP by 2002 compared to 7.1 \npercent without balancing the budget; short-term interest rates on \nTreasury bills will drop from a 1995 level of 5.5 percent to a 2002 \nlevel of 3.9 percent. Under the status quo, they would be 5.1 percent \nin 2002; and long-term interest rates on Treasury notes will fall from \na 1995 level of 6.7 percent to a level of 5.5 percent. Without a \nbalanced budget, the rate will remain at 6.7 percent.\n  Mr. President, this is only a broad brush of the CBO update, however, \nthe new assessment represents a $112 billion increase over the $170 \nbillion fiscal dividend included in the balanced budget resolution.\n  A balanced budget is good for all Americans. It will provide lower \ninterest rates for home mortgages, college loans, car loans, and so \nforth, an increase in savings rates spurring real, job-producing \ninvestment, increased productivity, higher standards of living, a lower \nnational debt and therefore lower Government interest costs, and less \nreliance on foreign borrowing.\n  It is time for Congress and the President to renew efforts to reach \nagreement on a balanced Federal budget by the year 2002 under CBO's \nscoring.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two tables and an explanation of how \nAmerican families benefit from a balanced budget be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           CHANGES TO BALANCED BUDGET ACT OF 1995 \\1\\--GOP OFFER NO. 1                          \n                                            [In billions of dollars]                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1996      1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDecember BBA reestimate.........       151       159       127        97        73        34        -3  ........\nChanges to BBA:                                                                                                 \n    Nondefense discretionary....         4         6         5         5         5  ........  ........        25\n    Medicare....................         3         6         5         4         3         3  ........        24\n    Medicaid....................  ........         2         5         4         4         1  ........        16\n\n[[Page S94]]\n                                                                                                                \n    Child care, social services,                                                                                \n     foster care, children's                                                                                    \n     SSI, family support, and                                                                                   \n     child nutrition............       \\3\\         1         2         2         2         2         2        10\n    EITC........................       \\3\\       \\3\\       \\3\\       \\3\\       \\3\\       \\3\\       \\3\\         2\n    Technical changes \\2\\.......        -2         1         1         1       \\3\\        -1        -2        -2\n    Revenues....................         6        -6       \\3\\        -1        -1        -2        -2        -5\n      Subtotal policy changes...        12        10        18        16        14         3        -1        71\nDebt service....................       \\3\\         1         2         3         3         4         4        17\nResulting deficits..............       164       170       146       115        90        41        -0  ........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ As reestimated by CBO, December 12, 1995.                                                                   \n\\2\\ Corrections of drafting errors, timing changes in FCC spectrum auction, foster care, and graduate medical   \n  education provisions.                                                                                         \n\\3\\ Less than $0.5 billion.                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                \nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Over the 30-year life of \n     the mortgage, the savings will total $64,860.\n       The value of existing home will grow by about 8 percent.\n       Household net worth will expand by $1.1 Trillion. The \n     increased home values will not make homes less affordable \n     because financing costs for a home will decline by 15 \n     percent.\n       Demand for homes will increase. Families will ``trade up'' \n     so existing home sales will rise by 11 percent by 2002. \n     Construction will increase as new housing starts grow by \n     65,000 units.\n\n                               Auto loans\n\n       Car loan payments decline by $180 annually, for a total \n     savings of $900 for a typical loan (assuming a 2-percentage \n     point drop in interest rates on a five year, $15,000 auto \n     loan at 9.75 percent).\n\n                             College loans\n\n       College loan payments will drop by $216 annually, for a \n     total of $2,617 for a typical loan (assuming an $11,000 loan \n     paid over 10 years starting at 8 percent).\n       Savings for these three loans total $2,558 annually (Car--\n     $180, Student--$216, Mortgage--$2,162).\n\n                             Interest rates\n\n       Federal funds rate lowered from baseline estimate of 5.2 \n     percent in 2002 to 3.5 percent in that year. Thirty year \n     treasury bond rates reduced from 7.2 percent to 4.5 percent \n     in 2002.\n\n                             National debt\n\n       In the current services baseline, outstanding national debt \n     rises to $7.5 trillion by 2002, with an annual debt servicing \n     cost of $290 billion. Budget Resolution would reduce total \n     debt to $6.5 trillion in 2002, with a debt service cost of \n     $182 billion. The savings in interest does half the work of \n     balancing the budget, which means the Congress only has to do \n     the other half.\n\n                              The economy\n\n       Inflation is essentially unchanged. Real gross Domestic \n     Product will increase relative to baseline by almost $100 \n     billion per year by 2005. Balancing the budget by 2002 has a \n     positive impact on the overall economy and the housing \n     market. Eliminating deficits allows interest rates to decline \n     and redirects the economy from government spending and \n     consumption toward savings and private investment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the hour is late. Much has been \naccomplished today.\n  I want to extend my congratulations to the distinguished majority \nleader, Senator Dole. The day before yesterday, all was not so pleasant \nfor there were many who were second-guessing our majority leader who \nused the phrase ``enough is enough,'' and proceeded to send to the \nHouse a targeted appropriations bill which broke the ice and which \nbrings us here tonight.\n  As I see it, we are now given 21 days without the problem of the \nFederal Government workers being out of work and unpaid--21 days, if \nthe President of the United States will submit his first balanced \nbudget using the Congressional Budget Office estimates. If he does \nthat, all of Government will be \n\n[[Page S95]]\nopen for 21 days, which means for the next 3 weeks congressional \nleaders from both sides--the executive branch, the President, and \nothers--can meet day and night if they like, as long and as hard as \nthey want to work, and Government will be open. The people of the \nUnited States can focus on what we are doing in our efforts to get a \nbalanced budget instead of on the current problems which, day by day, \ngrow worse for many innocent people, including many Federal workers who \nare hostage to this crisis.\n  I personally believe, as one who is in the middle of all of these \nnegotiations, that we can accomplish much more with the pressure of \nday-to-day problems of our Government being part closed, part \nfurloughed and part working behind us. I believe we have an opportunity \nto use our good judgment to see if we can really come to an agreement \nwith the Executive Branch and the Democrats on a balanced budget.\n  Mr. President, I have outlined the history of how we got to where we \nare tonight. I want to summarize a little bit of it.\n  First of all, after months of work, scores of hearings, scores upon \nscores of amendments on the floor of the Senate, both on a resolution \nand on a bill, we sent the President a balanced budget. He vetoed it. \nThe full impact of what happened on that ominous day of veto was lost \nbecause we were already in the crisis of Government being half \nshutdown, half furloughed, and the attention of the American people \ntaken away from that by the more daily crisis of our Government in \ncrisis, our day-to-day Government operations in crisis. But when that \nbudget was vetoed, we worked very hard to get the people back to work, \nand we passed a continuing resolution.\n  That continuing resolution we thought said that the President would \nproduce a balanced budget using the Congressional Budget Office \nconservative numbers. But the President and his people construed it \ndifferently, and construed it to mean that finally and ultimately when \nwe were all finished we would use the Congressional Budget Office. In \nthat resolution, the Democratic leaders and the President said there is \nanother part to it--that continuing resolution, that short \nappropriations for the continuation of Government--there is another \nportion of it that says you have to look at, or take another look at, \neducation, the environment, Medicaid, Medicare, and myriad things \namounting to about 10 specific items.\n\n  Mr. President, again, Republicans--and I was one that took the lead--\ndid not want to give up on the balanced budget that was vetoed. So what \nwe did was to ask the Congressional Budget Office at the particular \ntime of year that they are supposed to look again at budgets to take \nanother look.\n  Mr. President, they said the balanced budget has done such a good job \nthat there is actually a surplus of $135 billion that you did not \nexpect you were going to have because of changing economics and \nestimates. In response to that continuing resolution, we made another \noffer to the President of the United States. It got lost in the myriad \nof noises because the Government was in chaos.\n  What did we do with that? We took that $135 billion surplus and said, \n``Mr. President, we take you at your word. You want us to change some \nof our balanced budget, and we changed it, Mr. President.'' In fact, we \nput in sufficient money to take care of the education concerns of the \nPresident, and that should no longer be an issue. It is still being \ntouted, but we have already submitted an offer that puts back the money \nfor education, for the environment, and for other appropriated \naccounts. We already did that. We put back $5 billion in outlays in the \nyear 1996, which is more than has been sought for those particular \nprograms and others. And then, Mr. President, we said, let us look back \nthrough our proposals and use some of that $135 billion to change the \nsituation where it would move more in the direction of the President.\n  We put $25 billion into Medicare, $16 billion into Medicaid, $12 \nbillion into related welfare programs, including EITC, $25 billion was \nthe funding for education and environment, and other domestic programs. \nWhat was left of that $135 billion we put on the deficit, and we said, \nhere is a new proposal.\n  Again, there are not 10 people that know that occurred, but it did \noccur. So we did relate totally and respond totally to our commitment \nunder the continuing resolution that we would do better in these areas \nand at the same time have a balanced budget.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question, a \nserious question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. I am only going to be 5 more minutes. Is that \nyour question?\n  Mr. FORD. No. It is my understanding that when you related to figures \nthat you reduced the amount of reduction using $135 billion, that the \nWhite House on December 15th moved toward your figures--moved toward \nyour figures on discretionary, moved toward your figures on Medicare, \nmoved towards your figures on Medicaid, did not move toward your \nfigures on earned income tax credit--you did come down $12 billion on \nthat over the 7 years. I kind of thought that both sides were beginning \nto work together.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not arguing about whether we did or did not.\n  Mr. FORD. I am not arguing with you either. But I want to be clear. I \nworked Saturday. I worked Sunday. I put in what I thought were long, \nhard days, and we moved toward you. And I congratulate you, you were \nmoving toward us. I just thought we were on the right track rather than \ngetting into the mess that Senator Hatfield and others think we are in \nas it relates to appropriations bills.\n  Am I correct in my statement?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, the Senator is not correct.\n  Mr. FORD. What is wrong with it then, if I might ask?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever you submitted--and I do not have the numbers \nhere, but the one missing part of it was you never got to a balanced \nbudget. Whatever you submitted, you did not get to a balanced budget.\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator does not have one now either unless you use \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wait a minute now. I am not going to yield any longer. \nI yielded for a question.\n  Mr. FORD. That will be fine. But you are out here saying a lot of \nthings.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, I am not.\n  Mr. FORD. I apologize; the Senator is saying a lot of things that I \ndisagree with.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine.\n  Mr. FORD. I do not want to leave it without having some opportunity \nto defend our side of the aisle.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. To my knowledge, the Senate will be open here for a few \nmore minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I am going to take time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I welcome the Senator's remarks. I really do. I just \nwant to finish my thoughts because I wanted to get to a very simple \npoint, that we have modified our proposal and we are still in balance \nunder that proposal. And as my friend, Senator Gorton, who occupies the \nChair now, clearly said, not only did we resubmit another balanced \nbudget using the Congressional Budget Office, but the blue dogs in the \nHouse--that is a group of Democrats--have submitted one that gets to \nbalance. A group of Senators, 20 in number, 10 from each side, has \nsubmitted the framework for one that is in balance using the \nCongressional Budget Office. Senator Moynihan within the last 3 days \nhas submitted one. And frankly, I think the House did us all a service \nwhen they sent us a continuing resolution that will open all of \nGovernment if just one simple thing is done, and that is if the \nPresident will join this litany of different institutions within our \nframework that have produced a balanced budget using CBO. If he will \njoin us, then all of Government is opened and funded at reasonably good \nlevels for 21 days from today.\n  Now, having said that, I wish to make sure that everybody understands \nI am not trying to say everything my way. I will state it as I view it \nand the Democrats can state it as they want to. But when they submitted \na counterproposal, they did not move an inch on Medicare, an inch on \nMedicaid, in December from their June proposal.\n\n  That is the statement that I will stand by, and if the Senator can \ndig up a budget and say that that is not the case, then I will be glad \nto revoke this.\n  Now, I am here because I still believe the American people should \nknow that this is not a mere philosophical difference between Democrats \nand Republicans. This is an issue of whether we \n\n[[Page S96]]\nwant to make America a better place in the future by balancing our \nbudget sooner rather than later. It is a question of whether we want \ninterest rates to come down and stay down, save millions and millions \nof dollars for average Americans in houses they buy and mortgage, in \ncars they buy and mortgage, in school tuition where they borrow money, \nin every aspect of America's life, to make it easier and better and \nmake America grow stronger through the private-sector growth that a \nbalanced budget will permit us to accomplish.\n  That is what this whole debate is about. And frankly, tonight I am \ngrateful to our leader, Senator Dole, to Speaker Newt Gingrich, who \napparently had to argue loud and strong in the House to get these \nresolutions passed and get them to us here tonight, to rid us of the \nconfusion of a half-open, half-closed American Government. I believe we \nhave a real chance.\n  I do not know how close we are, Mr. President, and to those who are \nlistening, I do not know how close we are to getting a balanced budget, \nbut I tell you, everybody has to give. Everybody has to give. And I \nbelieve we are prepared to give. I will state once again that we \nalready put $95 billion more on the spending side into the budget that \nthe President vetoed--that is over 7 years--in areas that the President \nwas concerned about. That has already been done as another marker of \nour good faith, of our movement in the direction that we have been \nasked to move in. Now, in the next week, 10 days, we will see if there \nis additional movement both ways. I hope there is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico leaves the floor, I would like to express my views, and I think \nI express them for Senators on both sides of the aisle, not only to the \nSenator but the Senator from Nebraska, the ranking member on the \ncommittee, Senator Exon, for their leadership in this crisis. I have \nbeen privileged to be in a number of meetings with the Senator, the \nmajority leader, the Speaker of the House, and others, Mr. Kasich, his \ncounterpart in the House, and I wish to commend the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. When the history of this unusual chapter in the 206-year \nlife of the Senate, indeed, the Congress is written, there will be a \nprominent place for the Senator despite his humility.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may I join in. I do not want to leave the \nimpression that I do not feel the same way about the Senator from New \nMexico that the Senator from Virginia feels toward him----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. Personally, his effort, the long hours and how hard he \nworks. It is just like the distinguished Senator in the chair has \nindicated: We have a difference, and we need to let everything else go \non while we settle that difference. And I thought--and I still \nsincerely believe it--that there was an offer to move toward you. The \nSenator says no. I say yes. And that seems to be the budget problem \nhere.\n  But I do want people to know I like him personally. He is my friend. \nHe works hard, and we are very close to being together. So I did not \nwant the Senator to leave and the people viewing to think we had \nanything personal.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FORD. It was just a disagreement on how we are going to get to \nthe balanced budget. I thank the Chair and the Senator for giving me an \nopportunity.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, the feeling is \nmutual. I thank the Senator for his kind words, and I extend the same \nto him. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also wish to include Congressman Armey, who was in most \nof the meetings in which I joined.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S92-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S96]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ARMED SERVICES AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I wish to also pay special \nrecognition to the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, \nthe President pro tempore of the Senate, Senator Thurmond.\n  Just minutes ago, when I had the opportunity to be the Presiding \nOfficer, the Chair announced the appointment of conferees upon the \nreceipt of the message from the House, conferees to resume negotiations \nbetween the Senate and the House for hopefully the adoption of the \nauthorization bill for the armed services of the United States. Senator \nThurmond, together with Senator Nunn, has worked tirelessly to put \ntogether an excellent bill. It was vetoed, and I shall not review the \nreasons. The President had his reasons, many of which I continue, not \nall, to disagree.\n  Nevertheless, that is history. It is behind us. The veto message is \nback. The veto message was carefully considered by Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Nunn, myself, and other members of the committee here yesterday \nand again today. Staffs are now diligently working on an agenda to be \nconsidered by the conferees, and I am very optimistic that we can \nproduce a conference report which will be accepted by the Senate as \nwell as the House and eventually the President.\n  Again, I wish to commend the leadership of the distinguished senior \nSenator from South Carolina and, indeed, the ranking member, the \nSenator from Georgia [Mr. Nunn], in bringing this matter back up, such \nthat the second conference can hopefully produce a bill that will be \naccepted by the Congress and the President. It is essential to the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  There are key provisions in this bill, not the least of which are pay \nraises, well deserved by the men and women of the Armed Forces, key \nprovisions relating to new programs which are essential for the \nmodernization. And I want to express special tribute to the Secretary \nof Defense and members of his staff for informally working with the \nstaffs of members of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, for \nthe majority and minority, in giving us guidance on how this conference \nreport can embrace the views of both the President and the Congress \nsuch that it will become law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S96-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S96-S97]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           USING SOCIAL SECURITY FUNDS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. FORD. Every once in a while you worry about whether you remember \nthings right or not, and so you have to go back and check on it to be \nsure.\n  The distinguished Senator from Idaho and I were debating. I was \nspeaking, and I said something about this budget that the Republicans \nhad offered was not balanced in the year 2002 by $108 billion unless \nyou used Social Security. And he asked me, had not Democrats used that \nbefore, and I told him I had not known that, but for 12 years we had \nRepublicans who were President and they signed or vetoed legislation.\n  So now I have a little information I wish to put into the Record, or \nat least read into the Record, Mr. President. In response to Senator \nCraig on the use of Social Security trust funds, and more importantly \nfor future reference I think, the following points I think are \nrelevant.\n  It is the law--and let me underscore that now--it is the law. Both \nthe Social Security law--it is attached to title XLII, section 911--and \nthe Budget Act, title II, section 3631, mandate--and I underscore \nmandate--that ``the social security surplus shall not be counted in \nbudget deficit calculations by the Congress.''\n  That is why the budget resolution passed earlier this year showed a \ndeficit. You talk about honest figures. I have heard honest figures \nheld out in front of me until it dripped. That meant my figures were \ndishonest. I do not particularly like that. But it showed a deficit of \nmore than $100 billion under the Republican plan.\n  The Senate Democrats did--and I want to underscore did--offer a \nbudget plan to balance the budget without using the Social Security \nTrust Funds, and not one that the Republicans supported. It was a 9-\nyear budget, Mr. President, but we did not use the Social Security \nfunds.\n  Just take a look at the budgets submitted by Presidents Bush and \nReagan, \n\n[[Page S97]]\nall calculated with on-budget and off-budget deficits. We will not have \nan honest balanced budget until the on-budget deficit is zero. So the \nbudget that we are being told about here tonight is not an on-budget \ndeficit, so therefore it is not a balanced budget in the year 2002 \nwithout using $108 billion of Social Security surplus.\n  Let me read the Budgetary treatment of trust fund operations. That is \nunder Section 911(a)(1).\n\n       The receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund, and the Federal Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the taxes imposed under section 1401, 3101, \n     and 3111 of Title 26 shall not be included in the totals of \n     the budget of the United States Government as submitted by \n     the President or of the congressional budget and shall be \n     exempt from any general budget limitation imposed by statute \n     on expenditures and net lending (Budget outlays) of the \n     United States Government.\n\n  Under our budget act--I want to read that. I will just read one \nparagraph into the Record.\n\n       The concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 401 et seq.] or the related \n     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 in the \n     surplus or deficit totals required by this subsection or any \n     other surplus or deficit totals required by this subchapter.\n\n  Let me make one more point. The conference report on the budget that \npeople have been beating their chest about around here tonight that is \na balanced budget, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal \nyear 1996 and the conference report--all my colleagues have to do is \njust look on page 3.\n  Look on page 3 and see how you get a balanced budget. In the year \n2002, the year it is supposed to be balanced, you are using \n$108,400,000,000 out of Social Security Trust Funds in order to balance \nthat budget. I have heard enough about ``honest figures, honest \nfigures.''\n\n  The CBO is just as honest as they can be, I am sure. But OMB is too. \nI think about the private people out there that give industry an \nanalysis of the future. Are those dishonest figures? I do not think so. \nI think they are honest people giving their honest best projection.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted in the Record tonight that we have been \nhearing a lot about the balanced budget, but on budget the Republican \nbudget is not balanced. The on-budget deficit must be zero to have a \nbalanced budget, and not use $108,400,000,000 out of the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds to balance the budget in the year 2002.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would \nfund retirement and medical benefits through September 30, 1996 for the \nretired commissioned officers of the Public Health Service.\n  I do not know whether many of my colleagues know this, Mr. President, \nbut retired PHS commissioned officers have not received their \nretirement pay since our first continuing resolution expired on \nDecember 15, 1995. While retired members of the Federal Civil Service \nhave thankfully been able to receive their retirement checks during \nthis time period, the benefits of retired PHS commissioned officers \ncome through a direct appropriation contained in the Labor/HHS \nappropriations bill, a bill which we all know has not yet been approved \nby this body.\n  The roughly 3,600 beneficiaries of this program should not be victims \nof our budget battles, Mr. President. They served their country for \nmany years and their country has made a commitment to them. This bill \nwill allow us to meet the commitment.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 1517. A bill to make appropriations for the Black Lung Disability \nTrust Fund for fiscal year 1996; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n\n             the black lung disability program legislation\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would \nfund the Black Lung Disability Program administered by the Department \nof Labor through September 30, 1996, and the Black Lung Program \nadministered by the Social Security Administration through the first \nquarter of fiscal year 1997.\n  I was deeply disappointed that the limited continuing resolution \napproved by the House of Representatives earlier today did not include \nthe Black Lung Programs. They should have been included, Mr. President, \nbut they were not. When an effort was made to add funding authority for \nblack lung beneficiaries during floor consideration of the House bill, \nthat amendment was objected to by the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I've been told by the Department of Labor that unless \na continuing resolution which contains black lung funding is approved \nby January 12, 1996, the January 15 monthly payments to beneficiaries \nwould not be issued. It is my understanding that the Social Security \nAdministration needs a continuing resolution which contains \n\n[[Page S99]]\nblack lung funding to issue its February monthly payments as well.\n  Mr. President, as I introduce this bill, I know that efforts are \nunderway to bring a third continuing resolution to the House floor--and \nI sincerely hope that the Black Lung Programs are included in that \nmeasure. If that is the case, this legislation will be unnecessary.\n  These programs are vitally important to thousands of disabled miners \nand their families and survivors in my State of Virginia and many other \ncoal producing States. I hope we receive a continuing resolution from \nthe House later this evening which will allow us to uphold our historic \ncommitment to victims of black lung and their families and \nsurvivors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S98-4", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 837\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the names of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. Moynihan], the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], and the \nSenator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] were added as cosponsors of S. \n837, a bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in \ncommemoration of the 250th anniversary of the birth of James Madison.\n\n\n                                S. 1058\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1058, a bill \nto provide a comprehensive program of support for victims of torture.\n\n\n                                S. 1178\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from Indiana \n[Mr. Lugar] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1178, a bill to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of colorectal \nscreening under part B of the Medicare Program.\n\n\n                                S. 1419\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Kassebaum, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1419, a bill \nto impose sanctions against Nigeria.\n\n\n                                S. 1484\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1484, a bill to enforce the \npublic debt limit and to protect the Social Security trust funds and \nother Federal trust funds and accounts invested in public debt \nobligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S99-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S99]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 38--RESTATING THE COMMITMENT TO A 7-YEAR \n                            BALANCED BUDGET\n\n  Mr. Daschle submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, this week marks the 100th \nanniversary of the birth of one of the greatest leaders ever to have \nserved in this body, the late Senator from Illinois and former \nRepublican leader of the Senate, Everett McKinley Dirksen.\n  Everett Dirksen was born on January 4, 1896. He brought the small \ntown values and the sense of civility of his native Pekin to his work \nin the Senate, where he combined these qualities with some of the \nfinest oratorical and parliamentary skills that have been displayed on \nthis floor in his or any era.\n  The Senate has honored his memory by naming one of its office \nbuildings for him, and the Dirksen Congressional Center in Pekin \ncontinues his tradition of public service with its many ongoing \nresearch and in-service activities.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues to an insightful article about \nthe Dirksen legacy, written by retired editor Charles Dancey of the \nPeoria Journal Star, and I ask that the article be printed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Peoria Journal Star, Jan. 4, 1996]\n\n           Dirksen Brought Sense of Reality Wherever He Went\n\n                          (By Charles Dancey)\n\n       One hundred years ago, fathers might have dreamed that a \n     son born in a log cabin could become president. But no way \n     could Johann Dirksen have imagined Jan. 4, 1896, that his \n     baby boy's birthday celebrations one day would launch the \n     social season in the nation's capitol.\n       Yet, Sen. Everett McKinley Dirksen's birthday bash, usually \n     at the Mayflower hotel ballroom, was the opening ``must go'' \n     event of the social season each year in Washington, D.C., \n     even before he became minority leader of the Senate and a \n     national figure beyond the Beltway. Everybody who was \n     anybody, as the saying goes, attended from both political \n     parties and from the administration and the congress.\n       Those glittering parties were a long way from the \n     neighborhood in Pekin known as ``Beantown.'' Yet, growing up \n     in Beantown may have been an important part of ``Ev'' Dirksen \n     being the toast of the town in the nation's capitol.\n       Actually, the residents, themselves named it that--or \n     rather in their own language, ``Bohnchefiddle.'' They were \n     German immigrants who didn't indulge in euphemisms. They had \n     a strong sense of reality. And the reality was that rich \n     folks had flower gardens in their yards; immigrants grew \n     beans. They were who they were, and saw nothing wrong with \n     it. Beantown was just their American starting place.\n       In fact, most residents in Pekin, and millions more across \n     America, gardened their yards. Even a narrow small-town lot \n     was 50 feet front, 150 deep, and provided space for people \n     who didn't own a horse and didn't need a barn. There was \n     space for berry bushes along the lot line, half a dozen fruit \n     trees set wide apart, orderly squares of garden vegetables, \n     and a grape arbor.\n       There was a lot more than beans, and it all required care. \n     Many folks kept a small flock of chickens by the back porch \n     as well. At one time, in fact, the Dirksens raised a pig.\n       The bigger boys spaded the gardens and raked them smooth. \n     Before he was old enough for school, the youngest son, Ev, \n     could help punch holes in the prepared ground with the wooden \n     split pegs used as clothespins keeping a straight line along \n     the board on which he knelt.\n       Keeping clothes as clean as possible was important when \n     washing them was a major weekly chore. As the produce grew, \n     ripening in sequence, much of it had to be ``put up'' for the \n     winter in fruit jars and glasses, sealed with hot paraffin or \n     special lids, after being well cooked. Cabbage was chopped \n     and salted and then pounded and pounded until it was soaked \n     in its own brine to be kept for winter--sauerkraut.\n       The Dirksen boys took part, and it was the boys who peddled \n     surplus vegetables door to door. The basics of life to the \n     German families were food, clothes, shelter from the cold and \n     cleanliness. So, before he learned to read and write, Everett \n     Dirksen became part of a family team, doing his share in \n     providing those basics, and grew up knowing from whence came \n     the necessities of life. Somebody had to do the work to \n     produce it.\n       Their father had a stroke in 1901 when Ev, the youngest, \n     was only 5. By the time Ev was 9, Dad was dead. The boys were \n     raised by their mother, and the team game of survival that \n     they played put a solid foundation under his whole life.\n       In those circumstances and in the absence of radio, \n     television, telephones or computers, he found school and \n     learning downright fun. Learning was an adventure and a kind \n     of game. He loved reading. He loved to discover a new big \n     word and roll it off his tongue. In books, he could explore \n     the far reaches of this world and of the world of ideas.\n       Thus in his youth, and progressively thereafter, Everett \n     Dirksen combined those wonderful opposites, the \n     contradictions of idealist and a realist. It fit the Lincoln \n     tradition of central Illinois.\n       With his older brothers grown and earning money, the family \n     could let young Everett go off to college. He worked nights \n     while schooling at the University of Minnesota, until World \n     War I interrupted.\n       Three years of ROTC there gave him a leg up on a \n     lieutenant's bars. In France, he was an artillery man. His \n     job was to ride a wicker basket under a rough, hydrogen-\n     filled balloon, held by a cable and linked by a primitive \n     telephone to the gun batteries, overlooking the battlefield. \n     There he observed the fall of the artillery shells his \n     battery mates were firing and tell them how to adjust there \n     fire to bring it on target.\n       Of course, such balloons like his were sitting ducks, even \n     for the primitive planes of the time.\n       When the war ended, the army found his ability to speak \n     German useful and kept him in Europe. He remained overseas \n     for 18 months in all much of the time interpreting for \n     others, or dealing directly with the local German population. \n     He also knew Paris, Berlin, other German cities, and visited \n     England and Ireland. In Rome, the ambassador asked him to \n     join his staff, but Ev was homesick for Pekin.\n       Thus, young Lt. Dirksen returned to Pekin and Bohnchefiddle \n     at age 24, with an extraordinary range of experiences. He was \n     now a college man, a combat veteran and an ex-officer who had \n     traveled, often in very sophisticated circles, in postwar \n     Europe.\n       Back home, he married a Pekin girl and launched his \n     remarkable political career as the youngest person ever \n     elected to the Pekin City Council.\n       As city councilman, he was a young man dealing with a \n     rapidly changing world. Streets needed to be paved for the \n     growing numbers of those new motor cars. The fire department \n     needed trucks to replace the horse-drawn rigs. The aging \n     streetcars, one car running back and forth on a single track, \n     needed replacement with bus service.\n       Power plants were under construction, bringing electricity. \n     The Edison revolution was on, and radio was waiting in the \n     wings. These were not hypothetical or abstract problems to be \n     solved abstractly for the young councilman. He was intimately \n     involved with the reality of finance for technology and the \n     even tougher reality of the effects and demands new \n     technology and dramatic change made on the city workers, and \n     the public.\n       When he grappled with these problems as a councilman, he \n     also worked delivering his brothers' bread to 50 small \n     groceries scattered about town. Everybody knew his route, and \n     at many a stop he confronted people with problems to take to \n     their councilman. Before he went to the national macrocosm, \n     this man had a thorough and heavy dose of the microcosm.\n       Thus, the nature of the man was well-founded long before he \n     became one of that city's best-loved figures, before he \n     crated the Civil Rights Bill of 1964 and brought over the \n     votes to pass it with him, before he won a Grammy for \n     recording ``Gallant Men,'' before he was the confident of \n     presidents both Republican and Democrat, and before he became \n     a darling of the once-skeptical Washington press corps.\n       He brought to Washington the prestige of being the \n     Congress' best orator, a skill founded and practiced in Pekin \n     and which largely won for him his original seat in the House \n     of Representatives in the first place.\n       He also brought the attention to detail, the realism, of \n     Bohnchefiddle, and was, undoubtedly, the most skilled \n     parliamentarian in the Senate of his time. He knew how the \n     system worked in every detail, and he knew who was the person \n     that counted, the person to talk to, not only in the Senate \n     but in every department of the national administration.\n       Finally, he made many friends and no enemies in the best \n     tradition of the small town where he grew up, and where some \n     of his local political foes were also lifelong personal \n     friends.\n       When Everett Dirksen died, the president of the United \n     States gave the eulogy--proclaiming that Sen. Everett \n     McKinley Dirksen had more impact on history than many \n     presidents.\n       That he was, and he didn't learn that in Washington. That \n     was the boy from Bohnchefiddle.\n     \n[[Page S101]]\n\n\n                        ADMIRAL ARLEIGH A. BURKE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, our Nation has lost one of its \nmost distinguished Naval heros, Adm. Arleigh A. Burke. Had World War II \ncontinued beyond September 2, 1945, I might have served in the Pacific \nunder ``31 knot Burke,'' as he was nicknamed for his exploits against \nthe Japanese. Admiral Burke was awarded 13 decorations, including the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Navy Cross, the Legion of Merit, the \nSilver Star, and our Nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of \nFreedom. In 1991, for the first time in Navy history, the man for whom \na ship--U.S.S. Arleigh Burke--was named was on hand to see her \ncommissioned.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the obituary of Arleigh A. Burke from the \nNew York Times of January 2, 1996, be included in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 2, 1996]\n\n        Arleigh A. Burke Dies at 94; Naval Hero of World War II\n\n                        (By Robert D. McFadden)\n\n       Adm. Arleigh A. Burke, a battle-decorated Chief of Naval \n     Operations whose combat exploits against Japanese naval \n     forces in the South Pacific made him the Navy's most \n     celebrated destroyer squadron commander of World War II, died \n     yesterday at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Bethesda, Md. He was \n     94 and lived in Fairfax, Va.\n       Admiral Burke, who retired in 1961 after 42 years in the \n     Navy, including a record six-year tenure as the Chief of \n     Naval Operations in the Administration of President Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower, died of complications of pneumonia, said a Navy \n     spokesman, Lieut. Comdr. Ed Austin.\n       In a career that took him from Annapolis to Washington via \n     the high seas, Admiral Burke, a stocky pipe smoker with an \n     easy smile, served in battleships and aircraft carriers, was \n     a member of the United Nations truce negotiations team in the \n     Korean War and in Washington became a strong advocate of a \n     powerful nuclear fleet for the Navy, including its missile-\n     launching Polaris submarines.\n       But he was best known as ``31 Knot Burke,'' a nickname \n     supplied by Admiral William F. Halsey, for his exploits as \n     the commander of Squadron 23, a pack of eight destroyers that \n     staged high-speed torpedo attacks that devastated enemy \n     warships in the Solomon Islands in late 1943 and early 1944.\n       ``Stand aside! Stand aside! I'm coming through at 31 \n     knots,'' Mr. Burke, then a Captain, radioed darkened American \n     troop transports as his squadron, named Little Beavers for a \n     comic-strip character, steamed up the slot at boiler-bursting \n     speed to attack a Japanese task force off Bougainville on the \n     night of Nov. 1, 1943.\n       In a widely heralded action, the squadron covered the \n     landing of thousands of American troops while attacking enemy \n     vessels and aircraft. When the battle of Empress Augusta Bay \n     ended the next day, the Japanese toll was horrendous. A \n     cruiser and four destroyers lay on the bottom, and two \n     cruisers and a pair of destroyers had limped away heavily \n     damaged.\n       Later that month, the squadron engaged another Japanese \n     task force off Cape St. George, New Ireland, and sank three \n     destroyers without taking a hit. In 22 engagements from \n     November 1943 to February 1944, the Navy said, Capt. Burke's \n     squadron was credited with sinking one cruiser, nine \n     destroyers, one submarine and nine smaller ships, as well as \n     downing approximately 30 aircraft.\n       Later, Mr. Burke became a chief of staff to Vice Adm. Marc \n     A. Mitscher, whose carrier task forces attacked the Japanese \n     at Iwo Jima, Okinawa and Tokyo. Mr. Burke was aboard the \n     flagship Bunker Hill and later the Enterprise when they were \n     hit by Japanese suicide planes off Okinawa.\n       In 1949, during interservice disputes that followed the \n     unification of the armed forces, Mr. Burke fell into disfavor \n     with some officials of the Truman Administration by heading a \n     group of high Navy officers that campaigned for supercarriers \n     and against a strategic reliance on the Air Force's B-36 \n     bombers.\n       His role in what was called the Admiral's revolt seemed to \n     scuttle his chances for promotion. But his name went back on \n     the lists a year later, when he became a rear admiral, and in \n     1951, he became a member of the allied cease-fire commission \n     in Korea for six months.\n       In 1955, he was selected by Eisenhower over 92 more senior \n     officers to be Chief of Naval Operations. In that post, he \n     advocated a balanced and versatile fleet, new antisubmarine \n     technology, the development of Polaris submarines and other \n     nuclear systems, and new aircraft designs. He served three \n     two-year terms, but insisted on retiring in 1961, when \n     President John F. Kennedy offered him a fourth term.\n       Arleigh Albert Burke was born on a farm near Boulder, \n     Colo., on Oct. 19, 1901. his parents were of Swedish and \n     Pennsylvania Dutch stock, his paternal grandfather having \n     changed the name from Bjorkegren. He graduated from the \n     United States Naval Academy in 1923, and after five years of \n     sea duty, earned a degree in chemical engineering at the \n     University of Michigan in 1931.\n       He was an inspector at a naval gun factory in Washington \n     when World War II broke out. He immediately applied for sea \n     duty, but his application was not granted until 1943, when he \n     was sent to command destroyers in the Solomons. For his \n     ensuing exploits, he was awarded 13 decorations, including \n     the Distinguished Service Medal, the Navy Cross, the Legion \n     of Merit and the Silver Star.\n       In January 1977, he was awarded the nation's highest \n     civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, by President Gerald R. \n     Ford. In 1984, the Navy named a class of missile-launching \n     destroyers for him. And in 1991, it launched the U.S.S. \n     Arleigh Burke, an $864 million destroyer, and for the first \n     time in Navy history, the man for whom a ship was named was \n     on hand to see her commissioned.\n       Mr. Burke is survived by his wife, the former Roberta \n     (Bobbi) Gorsuch, to whom he was married for 72 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S100-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         LANDMINES: A DEADLY PERIL TO ALL THE WORLD'S CREATURES\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have often spoken of the danger \nlandmines pose to civilians and combatants around the world. There are \nan estimated 100 million of these hidden killers in over 60 countries, \neach one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep.\n  The State Department estimates that 26,000 people are killed or \nmaimed by landmines annually. That is 72 people each day, or one every \n22 minutes. The overwhelming majority are innocent civilians, who if \nthey are lucky enough to survive face a lifetime of physical and \npsychological trauma. American service men and women are also the \nvictims of these indiscriminate killers. It is no surprise that the \nfirst American casualty in Bosnia was from a landmine. There are 3 to 5 \nmillion landmines there, hidden under snow and mud. After our troops \nleave, millions will remain for years, taking their toll among the \ncivilian population. Few people know that landmines caused a third of \nthe American deaths in Vietnam, a quarter of the American deaths in the \nPersian Gulf war, and over a quarter of American deaths in Somalia.\n  Landmines are a global humanitarian catastrophe, but humans are not \nthe only victims. Any living creature, wild or domestic, that weighs as \nmuch as a small dog, is a potential landmine victim. There have been \nmany instances when a family lost its only means of livelihood when a \ncow or water buffalo stepped on a landmine, but there are undoubtedly \ncountless other instances of wild animals that have died from mines. \nVirtually any animal that triggers a mine suffers terrible injuries and \ndies from loss of blood.\n  Mr. President, this may seem unimportant, but it is not. Landmines \nare insidious because they indiscriminately kill and maim the innocent, \nand that includes animals as well as people. There have even been \nreports that the Pentagon is considering using sheep to clear mines, by \nsending them into minefields to trigger the mines. Not only would this \nfail to detonate all the mines, but anyone who has seen the horrifying \ninjuries landmines cause would be repulsed by the sacrifice of \ndefenseless animals that way.\n  Mr. President, landmines are causing a humanitarian catastrophe. Even \nif not a single new mine were laid the 100 million unexploded mines in \nthe ground would go on killing for decades. We must do all we can to \nlocate and remove them. I have sponsored legislation to appropriate \nfunds to improve the technology for doing that, and to help support \nmine clearing efforts around the world. Those funds are being used. It \nis not enough, not nearly enough, but it is a start.\n  To those who care about innocent life, whether human or non-human, \nlandmines are a scourge that must be rid from the world. Ultimately, \nthe only way to do that is to ban them altogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S101-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S101-S102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A SPECIAL HOLIDAY SEASON IN NEW YORK\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the true \nspirit of the holiday season and pay special tribute to Trans World \nAirlines (TWA) for its generosity in helping to make Christmas a truly \nspecial time for one of my constituents, Mr. Mouris Astafanous.\n  To have a chance of survival, doctors told Mr. Astafanous that he \nwould need a bone marrow transplant. Tests had indicated that his \nsister, Ms. Wedad Astafanous of Cairo, Egypt, met the incredible 20,000 \nto 1 odds of finding a \n\n[[Page S102]]\nperfect match. However, State Department red tape prevented Ms. \nAstafanous from flying to America to help her brother. Because of these \nbureacratic hurdles, Ms. Astafanous was being denied the opportunity to \nhelp save her brother's life. At the request of the Astafanous family, \nI contacted the American Amdassador in Cairo who guaranteed his \npersonal assistance in helping Wedad, and less than 24 hours later, she \nwas granted the necessary visa.\n  Once a visa was secured, it was necessary to obtain an airline ticket \nfor the trip to New York. TWA responded to my request for help in this \nsituation. TWA CEO and president, Jeff Erickson, ensured that Ms. \nAstafanous' travel plans were arranged in a proper and timely manner. \nTWA then flew Ms. Astafanous from Egypt to New York so that she would \nbe able to give her critically ill brother one of the greatest gifts of \nall, the gift of hope. Mr. Erickson's actions, along with the \ncooperation of TWA employees, have helped to provide the support the \nAstafanous family needs in this critical time.\n  Ms. Astafanous arrived in New York on the morning of Christmas Eve \nand immediately went to her brother's hospital bedside for a joyous \nreunion. Mouris' spirits have been immeasurably lifted by the arrival \nof his sister as have the spirits of all who have been touched by this \nwonderful family. I have had the honor of meeting Mouris and the entire \nAstafanous family. They are a family of great strength and courage. My \nprayers, and I am sure the prayers of all my colleagues, are with \nMouris Astafanous, his sister Wedad, and the entire Astafanous family.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S101-2", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MR. DAVID COLE\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Mr. David \nCole for his outstanding 34-year career with the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service.\n  Mr. Cole is currently Officer in Charge at the I office in \nMemphis. I was recently informed that he will be retiring very soon. In \nfact, I believe his retirement party is set for January 13. I wanted to \ntake this opportunity to thank David Cole for the outstanding work he \nhas done in this difficult and often frustrating profession.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the public discourse on immigration and \nimmigrants is largely negative. We do not hear enough about the success \nstories that occur everyday as a result of the hard work of people like \nDavid Cole.\n  David Aaron Cole began duty as an Immigration Patrol Inspector on \nAugust 15, 1961, at Laredo, TX. Following several years of front-line \nwork, Mr. Cole was promoted and transferred to Boston, MA, as a records \nand information specialist. In 1970, he assumed the post of officer in \ncharge at Memphis, where he has worked to the present day.\n  Although the Memphis office does not directly serve Arkansas, I know \nthat David Cole's work has impacted my State. Mr. Cole has helped \nhundreds of impoverished immigrants get their new lives off to a \npostive start. I would guess that a good number of those immigrants \neventually made their way to Arkansas, where they have been productive \nmembers of my State.\n  Mr. President, the mission of the I is not just enforcement, it is \nnot just about keeping people out of the country. It is also about \nhelping the legal immigrants who come here to assimilate into American \nsociety. David Cole has always understood that mission, and we will \ncertainly miss his work at the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \nI know all my colleagues join me in wishing Mr. Cole the best of luck \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/01/05/senate-section/article/S102-1", "month": "01", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HARRY KIZIRIAN POST OFFICE BUILDING DESIGNATION ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to comment briefly \ntoday, as chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, on an important \nand, I think, non-controversial piece of legislation to extend the \neffective dates of certain legal authorities under which the Department \nof Veterans Affairs [VA] operates. Several of these authorities have \nexpired recently. Except as I will discuss in a moment, each of these \n``extender'' provisions was approved by the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, by a unanimous voice vote, when the Committee marked up S. \n991 on September 20, 1995, and ordered that that bill be favorably \nreported without written report.\n  In explaining this bill, Mr. President, let me first itemize the \nprovisions of the bill as reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee \non September 20, 1995. Then I will explain the amendments to those \nprovisions contained within a substitute amendment which I have offered \ntoday with the concurrence of the committee's ranking minority member, \nSenator Jay Rockefeller. To summarize, I introduced S. 991 as a ``by \nrequest'' bill on behalf of the administration on June 29, 1995. It was \nreported in amended form by the Veterans' Affairs Committee on \nSeptember 20, 1995. The bill would be further amended today--to \nincorporate, for example, extender provisions contained in legislation \nintroduced in the other body--in order to facilitate the other body's \napproval of this legislation before the current year ends.\n  As for the bill as approved by the Veterans' Committee on September \n20, the first section of that bill would extend through next year \nextant legal authorities which grant to so-called ``environmental \nveterans''--specifically, those who were exposed to ionizing radiation \nduring service; those who served in the Republic of Vietnam and who \nare, therefore, presumed to have been exposed to dioxin; and those who \nserved in the Persian Gulf war and who are thought, therefore, to have \nbeen exposed to toxic substances and other environmental hazards--to \npriority access to VA hospital care services. That section would also \nextend through this year a similar ``priority access'' provision \napplicable to outpatient care services that applies to Persian Gulf \nveterans due to the apparently extraordinary--and, to date, still \ninadequately understood--maladies suffered by those veterans.\n  The Veterans' Affairs Committee intends to hold extensive hearings in \n1996 on an issue that is commonly referred to as ``eligibility \nreform,'' that is, the proposed recodification--and, we hope, \nsimplification if possible--of very complex rules which presently \ngovern which veterans shall have priority access to which categories of \nhealth care services. A number of eligibility reform proposals have \nbeen advanced--by the other body; by the VA; and by Veterans Service \nOrganizations--all of which would, in some way, effect the relative \npriority given now to ``environmental veterans'' who have priority \naccess to VA health care services under the rules we would extend \ntoday.\n  My thinking on the question of moving now to change substantively the \neligibility rules for ``environmental veterans''--an action which the \nother body would apparently like to take now in isolation from other \neligibility reform issues--is this: the committee will be looking into \nthis question, and related questions, in considerable depth in 1996 \nwhen it takes up the broader issue of eligibility reform. That being \nthe case, it is appropriate for us now to extend for one year the \ncurrent rules as they are currently in force until we have a chance to \nstudy the House proposal to scale back special eligibility rules for \nsome, or all, ``environmental veterans.'' That study will be part of \nthe analysis which we will undertake on the entire gamut of health care \neligibility issues.\n  While I think it is appropriate to defer consideration of \nenvironmental veterans' eligibility rules for a period, I also think it \nwould be wholly inappropriate for the Congress now to allow some or all \nof these priority access rules to ``die a quiet death'' by simply \ndeclining to consider extending them further. Allowing these special \naccess rules to expire--or making significant amendments to them--may \nbe appropriate actions for the Congress to take. But they will not be \nappropriate until the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee has given such \nproposals the serious and thoughtful consideration they merit.\n\n  The Senate Committee will arrive at its own judgments on eligibility \nreform matters after it holds hearings, builds a record, and debates \nthe issues. It will not take up such issues prematurely. And it will \nnot take up such issues prematurely. And it will not take them up on a \npiecemeal basis. There will be time in 1996 to study the current rules \ngoverning access to VA health care by Persian Gulf, Vietnam and \nradiation-exposed veterans. In the interim, we should extend the \ncurrent standards until such time as that study can take place.\n  The other provisions of law which we would extend today are far less \ncontroversial than those pertaining to the relative access of some \nclasses of veterans to health care services. This bill would also, for \nexample, extend VA's legal authority to contract for drug and alcohol \nabuse treatment services. It would, in addition, extend a number of \nlegal authorities under which VA either itself provides, or contracts \nfor others to provide, health care and other services to homeless \nveterans. It would extend VA's current pilot program on \nnoninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care. Finally, it would \nextend: VA's Health Professional Scholarship Program; VA's authority to \nuse local pay surveys to determine the appropriate level of locality \npay for VA nurse anesthetists; and VA's authority to enter into certain \nproperty leasing transactions.\n  As I have noted, Mr. President, these provisions are relatively non-\ncontroversial. All on the Committee were willing, at minimum, to allow \nthe programs authorized by these provisions of law to continue--at \nleast for a period while they are subjected to further analysis. The \nSenate Committee is unwilling at this time to ``kill'' any such \nprovision of law, through inaction, as opposed to making an affirmative \ndetermination that the program ought to be terminated.\n  There has been, however, one unanticipated exception to the ``rule'' \nthat the Veterans Committee would not terminate programs or benefits by \ndeclining to extend legal authorities previously enacted. That \nexception is the extension of VA authority to guarantee adjustable rate \nhome mortgage loans (so-called ``ARMs'') which was approved by the \nCommittee at markup but which would be excised from the bill under the \namendment that I offer today.\n  The Congress approved a 3-year ``demonstration project'' in 1992 \nwhich authorized VA, for the first time, to include adjustable rate \nmortgages in its home loan guaranty program. It appears that the \nprogram has been a success, and I had hoped, therefore, to extend it. \nAs distinguished from the other body, however--which proposed to make \nVA's authority to guarantee ARMs permanent--I had proposed when I \nintroduced S. 991 to extend the ARM \n\n[[Page S104]]\n``demonstration project'' for 2 more years before considering giving it \npermanent status so that the committee might have an opportunity to \nview the performance of such loans over a wider range of interest \nrates. The Veterans' Committee concurred with that judgment when it \napproved such a 2-year extension on September 20.\n  When the committee acted, however, it was relying on a preliminary, \ninformal cost estimate provided by the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO]. That informal cost estimate indicated, in effect, that \nadjustable rate mortgages--at least the relatively conservative \nadjustable rate mortgages guaranteed by VA--are not significantly more \nlikely than fixed rate mortgages to go into default and that, \ntherefore, an extension in VA's authority to guarantee such loans would \nnot subject the Government to significantly higher exposure to loss--\nand, in turn, costs--than fixed rate home loans.\n  CBO, however, reconsidered its preliminary, informal view on the \npotential cost of VA guarantees of adjustable rate mortgage loans. By \nletter issued on October 25, 1995--which I request, Mr. President, be \nmade part of this Record in its entirety--CBO concluded as follows:\n\n       Adjustable-rate mortgages involve a greater subsidy cost to \n     the federal government than fixed rate mortgages (FPMs) \n     because they have a higher likelihood of default. ARMs are \n     more risky than FPMs, not only because interest rates can \n     rise, but because home buyers with a given amount of income \n     usually can qualify to borrow more money with an ARM than \n     with a FPM, thereby becoming more financially leveraged. \n     Thus, borrowers with the greatest risk can opt for an ARM \n     over a FPM. This greater risk results in higher delinquency \n     and foreclosure rates.\n\n  Based on this analysis, Mr. President, CBO estimated that an \nextension of VA's authority to guarantee ARMs would cost VA $36 million \nin fiscal year 1996 and $33 million in fiscal year 1997.\n  I was surprised, Mr. President, to learn of this cost estimate from \nCBO, especially since CBO did not so ``cost'' the legislation that \nenacted the ARM guarantee ``demonstration project'' just 3 years ago. \nAs I understand it, VA guaranteed ARMs have more conservative \nunderwriting standards than other ARMs. In addition, the monthly \npayments to be made by borrowers using VA guaranteed adjustable rate \nfinancing fluctuate less than payments under other ARMs since annual \ninterest rate increases on VA-guaranteed ARMs are ``capped'' at 1 \npercent, rather than at 2 percent as is common practice. In light of \nthese distinctions, the Veterans Affairs Committee has operated under \nthe belief that VA guarantee ARMs would ``perform'' better than other \nARM's--and that the Government, therefore, would not be exposed to \ninordinate loss. We had hoped to extend this ``demonstration project'' \nto see, through a review of VA's actual loss data, if that belief was \nwell grounded.\n  Be that as it may, Mr. President, CBO's cost estimate makes such an \nextension impossible for all practical purposes. If this legislation \nwere to propose an extension in this ``demonstration project,'' it \nwould also have to propose money-saving legislation to ``offset'' the \ncosts which CBO estimates would be incurred if the ARM extension were \nto be enacted. The committee has no such legislation to propose at this \ntime; all cost-saving measures the committee was able to approve are \nalready contained in the Veterans' Committee's portion of the budget \nreconciliation Balanced Budget Act now before the Congress. \nAccordingly, the chairman's amendment which I have proposed today would \nremove the ARM extender from S. 991.\n  There is another aspect of my substitute amendment that merits \nexplanation. As I have discussed, the substitute would remove one home \nloan provision--the one which would have extended VA's ARM authority--\nbut one which would have extended VA's ARM authority--but it would also \nadd to the bill four other home loan-related authorities. These \nprovisions are drawn from legislation introduced in the other body. \nThey are not controversial.\n  First, my amendment would extend for a 2 year period VA's authority \nto guarantee home loans having interest rates negotiated by the \nborrower with the lender. Until 1992, VA established, by administrative \naction, maximum permissible mortgage interest rates to be allowed on VA \nguaranteed mortgages are a given point in time. VA attempted to \n``track'' market-set interest rates, but despite its best efforts, \nthere often were differentials between market rates and VA-set rates, \nif only due to delays in administrative action.\n  Such differentials did not necessarily result in veteran-borrowers \ngetting a ``good deal.'' More typically, when VA ceilings were set \nbelow prevailing rates, the ``spread'' was offset by the charging of \nso-called ``points.'' Those points were assessed to the seller--not the \nveteran-borrower--but again, that did not mean that the veteran got a \n``good deal.'' Sellers' points were typically recovered by sellers \nthrough increases in the selling prices of homes. In short, they were \n``passed through'' to the veteran-buyer; veteran-buyers gained no \nadvantage, typically, even though the interest rates they were being \ncharged appeared to be ``below market.'' Rather, they paid for the \ninterest rate differential ``up front'' through higher purchase prices. \nMy amendment's extension of the allowance of market-set interest \nrates--as is the result when rates are negotiated by the borrower in \ntoday's competitive marketplace--eliminates such distortions.\n  My amendment, in addition, would extend VA authority to guarantee \n``energy efficient'' mortgages. Most would agree that improvements to \nhomes to achieve energy efficiency are desirable. Since 1992, VA has \npermitted the costs incurred in adding such improvements to a home--\nwhich improvements can, and often do, enhance the value of a property \nin the marketplace--to be ``rolled in'' to the mortgage loan-financed \ncosts of the home. This program appears to have had some social \nutility, and insofar as the committee has been able to determine, it \nhas not resulted in losses to the Government. Therefore, I propose \ntoday that this program be extended for 2 more years.\n  My amendment would, in addition, extend for 2 years VA's authority to \nallow lenders access to appraisals on the properties they finance. This \nprovision, of course, is only reasonable; there is no reason for \nlenders not to have access to such information.\n  All three of these extenders--an extension in VA's authority to \nguarantee marketplace-set interest rate loans; an extension in VA's \nauthority to guarantee ``energy efficient'' mortgages; and an extension \nin VA's allowance of access to property appraisals by lenders--seem, \nperhaps, to be ``no brainers'' to use a current vernacular. They are \nextensions of law, however, that rely on analysis that the Senate \nCommittee has not had opportunity to evaluate. In addition, they are \n``extenders'' which VA-proposed legislations--S. 991 as introduced by \nme on June 29, 1995, on the administration's behalf-did not request. I \nexpect that the committee will study these provisions over the next 2 \nyears. At that time, I expect that the committee will be in better \nposition to consider permanent authorizations. In the meantime, I would \nsuggest that these measures, which CBO has concluded would have no \nsignificant budgetary impact when it ``costed'' them for the other \nbody, ought to be extended for 2 years.\n  My proposed amendment would also extend, for a 1-year period, VA's \n``enhanced loan asset sale authority.'' This authority--which, in \nsummary, facilitates the marketing of instruments by which sales of \nforeclosed VA-owned properties are financed--has already been approved \nby the committee, and the Congress, as part of the Balanced Budget Act. \nThis provision, which will save the Government $35 million over a 7-\nyear period, will expire at the end of the year. We surely hope that \nthe Balanced Budget Act will be approved before then, and that that \nlegislation will affect an extension in this authority. Because, \nhowever, a lapse in such authority would be disruptive to VA's efforts \nto ``bundle'' and sell its mortgage-backed securities, my amendment \nwould extend that authority through this legislation while the Congress \nconsiders further changes in the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my amendment would modify four of the \nexpiration time frames approved by the Senate Committee when it \nconsidered this legislation in September. It would propose to extend \nthrough 1997--rather than through 1996, as approved by the committee--\nVA's pilot program for \n\n[[Page S105]]\nnoninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care. It would extend \nVA's authority to survey local communities for appropriate \ncomparability pay data for nurse anesthetists through 1997 rather than \nthrough 1999. It would extend VA's Health professional Scholarship \nProgram through 1997 rather than through 1996. And it would extend the \nMcKinney Act's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project through 1997 \nrather than through 1996.\n  The purpose of these modifications, Mr. President, is to conform our \nbill more closely to the time frames approved by the other body and, \nthereby, to promote the prospects for agreement. I might also note that \nthe fourth of these time frame modifications--the expansion of the \nMcKinney Act's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Project extension from \n1 year to 2 years--is a matter that I know is one of deep personal \nconcern to my good friend, the Senator from Minnesota.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me say that I hope the Senate will \napprove S. 991 as favorably reported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee \non September 20, 1995, and as further amended today. Let me say, as \nwell, that I hope the other body will approve it expeditiously. It is \ngood, sound legislation; there should be no controversy on it. Other \nmatters can be resolved in this new year--and they will be resolved--so \nlong as all who are concerned about the needs of the Nation's veterans \ncontinue to approach this serious business in the cooperative spirit \nthat has been so productive in the past.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time that has been afforded me.\n  I ask unanimous consent a CBO cost estimate and an October 25, 1995, \ncover letter from June O`Neill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 1995.\n     Hon. Alan K. Simpson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     has reviewed S. 991, a bill to amend title 38, United States \n     Code, and other statutes to extend VA's authority to operate \n     certain programs, collect copayments associated with \n     provision of medical benefits, and obtain reimbursements from \n     insurance companies for care furnished, as ordered reported \n     by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs on September 20, \n     1995.\n       The bill would affect direct spending and thus would be \n     subject to pay-as-you go procedures under section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. \n     The bill would not affect the budgets of state of local \n     governments.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n       1. Bill number: S. 991.\n       2. Bill title: A bill to amend title 38, United States \n     Code, and other statutes to extend VA's authority to operate \n     certain programs, collect copayments associated with \n     provisions of medical benefits, and obtain reimbursements \n     from insurance companies for care furnished.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs on September 20, 1995.\n       4. Bill purpose: The bill would extend certain expiring \n     authorities of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Contrary \n     to the title of the bill, it would not affect copayments or \n     reimbursements from insurance companies.\n       5.

Basis of estimate: The estimate assumes enactment of the \n     bill and appropriation of the authorized amounts for each \n     fiscal year. CBO used historic spending rates for estimating \n     outlays. The following section-by-section cost analysis \n     addresses only those sections of the bill that would have a \n     significant budgetary impact.\n\n\n                            direct spending\n\n       Section 1(d) would give VA authority to guarantee \n     adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) through 1997; previous \n     authority expired on September 30, 1995. CBO estimates that \n     this extension would cost $36 million in 1996 and $33 million \n     in 1997.\n       Adjustable-rate mortgages involve a greater subsidy cost to \n     the federal government than fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) \n     because they have a higher likelihood of default. ARMs are \n     more risky than FRMs, not only because interest rates can \n     rise, but because home buyers with a given amount of income \n     can usually qualify to borrow more money with an ARM than \n     with a FRM, thereby becoming more financially leveraged. \n     Thus, the borrowers with the greatest risk can opt for an ARM \n     over a FRM. This greater risk results in higher delinquency \n     and foreclosure rates.\n       CBO bases its esimate on recent loan delinquencies reported \n     by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), \n     the federal agency that has the most experience tracking the \n     performance of adjustable-rate mortgages. Although data \n     regarding the rate at which Fannie Mae forecloses on \n     mortgages are not available, the delinquency rate for the \n     ARMs Fannie Mae had purchased has been almost 2.5 times that \n     of fixed-rate mortgages over the past 12 months. Because of \n     VA's supplemental servicing program, the easy conversion \n     option to a fixed-rate program, and the lower cap on annual \n     interest rate increases (1 percent compared to 2 percent for \n     Fannie Mae), the difference in foreclosure rates between VA \n     ARMs and FRMs is likely to be less than the difference in \n     delinquency rates between Fannie Mae ARMs and FRMs. CBO \n     estimates that VA ARMs have a foreclosure rate 1.75 times the \n     rate for VA FRMs. We also assume that the percentage of ARMS \n     guaranteed by VA would be the same as it was in 1994, about \n     12 percent of all VA originations. Based on a baseline \n     foreclosure rate of 10.3 percent for FRMs for 1996, the \n     estimated foreclosure rate for VA ARMs would be 18 percent. \n     Thus, the subsidy cost for VA ARM loans would be about $36 \n     million in 1996 and $33 million in 1997 based on annual loan \n     volumes of 27,000 and 23,000 in 1996 and 1997, respectively.\n       VA has had the authority to guarantee ARMs only since 1993, \n     and as a result, the available data are not very useful for \n     projecting defaults. Recent data from the Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA), the model for the VA ARM program, shows \n     that the ARMs it guarantees have foreclosure rates similar to \n     those of FRMs it guarantees. Nevertheless, there is strong \n     reason to believe that this is a short-term phenomenon and \n     that FHA ARMs, like Fannie Mae ARMs, will prove to have \n     higher foreclosure rates than FRMs. First, the data from FHA \n     are too sparse to use for estimating relative foreclosure \n     rates. FHA has been guaranteeing ARMs for ten years but only \n     in the last few years have these loans made up a significant \n     portion of FHA's originations. Second, during this period, \n     mortgage rates have been quite low by historical standards.\n\n\n               spending subject to appropriations action\n\n       This bill contains several provisions that would be subject \n     to appropriations action.\n       Medical Treatment for Persian Gulf Veterans. Section 1(a) \n     would extend from December 31, 1995, to December 31, 1996, \n     VA's authority to provide medical treatment to veterans who \n     may have been exposed to toxic substances while serving in \n     the Persian Gulf War. Since 1992, about 180,000 veterans have \n     sought outpatient care for ailments believed to have resulted \n     from exposure to toxic substances while serving in the Gulf \n     War.\n       Based on estimates from VA, the cost of treating and \n     testing these veterans would be $60 million for the final \n     nine months of fiscal year 1996 and $20 million for the first \n     three months of 1997.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...      60      20       0       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............      52      28       0       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Drug and Alcohol Abuse and Dependence. For about 15 years \n     VA has been authorized to contract with third parties to \n     treat veterans suffering from alcohol and drug abuse. Section \n     9(b) would extend authority to provide contract care from \n     December 31, 1995 to December 331, 1997. At the discretion of \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, VA would be able to \n     contract with halfway houses and other community-based \n     organizations to provide short-term care and therapeutic \n     services to veterans with alcohol and drug dependencies. In \n     1994, VA spent almost $9 million on contracts with \n     organizations that helped veterans suffering from substance \n     abuse. Under this section, VA would spend over $6 million in \n     the last three quarters of 1996 and help more than 6,000 \n     veterans during the entire fiscal year.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...       7       9       2       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............       6       9       4       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S106]]\n\n\n       Noninstitutional Alternatives to Nursing Home Care. Section \n     1(c) would extend until December 31, 1996, a pilot program on \n     nursing homes that allows the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     to pay for alternatives to nursing home care. At present, VA \n     can contract with private and community providers of non-\n     institutional nursing home care to provide homemaker and home \n     health services to eligible veterans. Certain criteria must \n     be met by veterans in order to qualify for the program. In \n     general, veterans with a service-connected rating of more \n     than 50 percent and veterans needing nursing home care for \n     service-connected disabilities have priority in receiving \n     this care. Participants must be at least 75 years old and \n     meet other specific requirements pertaining to health and \n     ability to live independently. The cost of non-institutional \n     care cannot exceed 65 percent of what it costs VA to provide \n     each individual nursing care at its facilities ($32,371 in \n     1994).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...      18       5       0       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............      16       7       0       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In 1994, VA spent almost $10 million and provided \n     noninstitutional care to 1,500 veterans. The number of \n     veterans participating in the program is expected to grow to \n     2,700 in 1996 and would cost $18 million for that year.\n       Health Professional Scholarship Program. In 1994, VA \n     awarded scholarships to 374 VA nurses and other health \n     professionals. These competitive scholarships allowed VA \n     health care professionals to enroll in a full-time course of \n     study leading to either an associate, baccalaureate, or \n     master's degree. Award winners receive payments for tuition, \n     educational expenses, and a monthly stipend--all tax free. \n     The program helps VA recruit and retain nurses and other \n     health care professionals, particularly for health care \n     disciplines in which VA is experiencing recruitment \n     difficulties. In return for the award, recipients incur a \n     service obligation of two years to the VA.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...       8       3       0       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............       8       3       0       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Section 1(g) would extend the authorization of the program \n     from December 31, 1995, to December 31, 1996. For 1996, the \n     cost of the program would be almost $8 million for the last \n     nine months of the year. VA anticipates that this amount of \n     funding would pay for 427 awards.\n       Enhanced-Use Leases of Real Property. Section 1(h) would \n     extend for two years the authorization for VA to use \n     enhanced-use leases of real property and would result in no \n     significant costs. Enhanced-use leases of real property allow \n     VA to enter into contracts with private companies to develop \n     or employ underutilized land or other assets under the \n     control of VA. In most instances, VA would allow a private \n     developer to build on property owned by VA, and in return the \n     developer would allow VA partial use of the newly developed \n     facility at below market price. In the past, VA has \n     contracted for child care centers and cafeterias where VA \n     received below market prices for its employees who use the \n     facility.\n       With the exception of leases made to provide child-care \n     services, no more than 20 enhanced-use leases may be entered \n     into at any one time. Current law permits VA to make payments \n     only for those enhanced-use leases that provide space or \n     services for which funds have been appropriated in advance.\n       Community-Based Residential Care for Chronically Mentally \n     Ill Veterans. In 1994, VA spent just over $24.5 million to \n     provide 9,000 Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill (HCMI) \n     veterans community-based residential care. The HCMI program \n     began in 1987 and has been reauthorized periodically. The \n     program operates out of 71 VA facilities and targets homeless \n     veterans with psychiatric or drug abuse problems. VA \n     estimates that the number of homeless veterans on any given \n     night varies from 150,000 to 250,000. Case workers seek out \n     these veterans at homeless shelters or on the street and help \n     them find appropriate health care and social services. These \n     veterans are usually placed in community programs under \n     contract with VA. The average cost of providing this service \n     was $39 per day per veteran in 1994. The average stay was 71 \n     days.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...      28      29       8       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............      25      28      11       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       VA anticipates that in 1996 it would be able to help almost \n     9,700 of the several hundred thousand homeless veterans at a \n     cost of over $28 million. Section 1(i) would extend this \n     program through December 1997.\n       Compensated Work Therapy and Therapeutic Transitional \n     Housing (CWT). Section 1(j) would continue a demonstration \n     program aimed at helping eligible veterans with severe mental \n     illness and drug and alcohol problems return to mainstream \n     society. The program offers veterans treatment while employed \n     in the CWT program. This program differs from therapy \n     programs because veterans pay rent to offset the cost of \n     acquiring and maintaining the property in which they reside. \n     VA has purchased 46 residences which will have 404 beds when \n     fully operational. An additional four residences with a total \n     of 60 beds are planned. Expansion beyond 50 residences would \n     require a change in current law. To serve 316 veterans in \n     1994, VA spent about $3 million.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...       4       4       1       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............       3       4       1       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Grants for Assistance in Furnishing Services and Assistance \n     to Homeless Veterans. Section 1(k) expands VA's authority to \n     work with community and public groups to provide services to \n     homeless veterans. This program provides seven comprehensive \n     homeless shelters, authorizes placement of counselors in 12 \n     homeless shelters, allows for grants to public and community \n     organizations to provide transitional assistance to veterans, \n     and authorizes VA to make per diem payments to organizations \n     eligible to receive grants. This program would be authorized \n     until December 31, 1997. Reauthorization of the program is \n     needed only to continue the homeless grant and per diem \n     programs.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEstimated authorization level...       9       9       2       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............       7       9       4       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In 1994, $8 million was appropriated for this program, $5.6 \n     million of which was used for the grant program. The number \n     of veterans affected by the program is uncertain, and VA is \n     developing a plan to evaluate its effectiveness. CBO \n     estimates the cost of the program in 1996 would be about $9 \n     million.\n       Homeless Veterans Reintegration Projects. Section 1(l) \n     would authorize appropriations for Homeless Veterans \n     Reintegration Projects. The provision specifies an \n     authorization level of $10 million in 1996.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1996    1997    1998    1999    2000 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthorization level.............      10       0       0       0       0\nEstimated outlays...............       1       4       5       0       0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       7.

Estimated cost to State and local governments: None\n       9. Estimate Comparison: None\n       10. Previous CBO estimate: On October 5, 1995, CBO prepared \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 2289 as ordered reported by the \n     House Committee on Veterans' Affairs (HVAC) on September 20, \n     1995. The estimate included the cost of extending permanently \n     the VA ARM program and extending for three years the homeless \n     veterans job training program. CBO's cost estimate for H.R. \n     2353 as ordered reported by HVAC on September 20, 1995, \n     included estimates for several other provisions that are also \n     part of S. 991.\n       11. Estimate prepared by: Michael Groarke.\n       12. Estimate approved by: Paul N. Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director, for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to give its unanimous \nsupport to the pending measure, S. 991, legislation that would extend a \nvariety of veterans programs and authorities that have expired. The \nproposed extensions are relatively short-term ones--1 or 2 years--to \nensure that the program or authority remains in place while the \ncommittee takes the opportunity to review the various issues in more \ndetail.\n  Consideration of this measure was sought late last month so that it \nmight have been enacted before a number of the programs and authorities \nactually expired, but we were blocked from acting at that time by an \nobjection unrelated to any provision in the bill. I truly regret that \nthe Senate was delayed in considering this measure, but am pleased that \nwe are now about to act on it. My sincere hope is that our colleagues \nin the House will take it up as soon as possible so as to remove any \nquestion about the programs and authorities covered by this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, this measure was ordered reported, without written \nreport, by the Veterans' Affairs Committee on September 20, 1995, and \ncomes before the Senate today with an amendment offered by the \ncommittee chairman, Senator Simpson. The chairman's amendment, which I \nsupport, deletes one provision from the bill as ordered reported--\nrelating to VA's authority to guarantee home loans involving adjustable \nrate mortgages--because of unanticipated costs being attributed to the \nenactment of that provision by the \n\n[[Page S107]]\nCongressional Budget Office. In addition, his amendment adds four \nadditional extension provisions--all relating to VA's home loan \nguaranty program--that came to the committee's attention after the \ncommittee meeting in September.\n  There is no objection as far as I know to any of the provisions in \nthe bill as it will be amended, and I urge its swift enactment so that \nit can reach the House as soon as possible for action in that Chamber.\n\n\n                         SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. President, the bill, as amended, contains 16 provisions which \nwould provide for the following extensions of programs and authorities:\n  First, extend until December 31, 1996, the special eligibility for VA \ninpatient care which is accorded to certain veterans--those exposed to \nionizing radiation from nuclear weapons tests or the occupation of \nJapan following World War II; Vietnam veterans exposed to herbicides \nduring their service; and Persian Gulf war veterans exposed to \nenvironmental hazards during their service. Any care furnished to \nveterans exposed to radiation or herbicides pursuant to this authority \nbetween its expiration on June 30 of this year and the date of \nenactment of this measure would be ratified.\n  Second, extend until December 31, 1996, the special eligibility for \nVA outpatient care accorded to Persian Gulf war veterans.\n  Third, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to contract for \ncommunity-based drug and alcohol care.\n  Fourth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's pilot program of non-\ninstitutional alternatives to nursing home care.\n  Fifth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to guarantee \nloans which bear an interest rate negotiated between the veteran and \nthe lender.\n  Sixth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to guarantee \nloans that include costs related to making energy efficiency \nimprovements to the dwelling that is the object of the loan.\n  Seventh, extend until December 31, 1996, VA's enhanced loan asset \nsale authority pursuant to which VA guarantees the timely payment of \nprincipal and interest to purchasers of real estate mortgage investment \nconduits.\n  Eighth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to permit a \nlender who is authorized to make loans which are automatically \nguaranteed to review appraisals.\n  Ninth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to enter into \nagreements with nonprofit organizations and State and local governments \nwhereby such entities acquire real property, or the use of such \nproperty, from VA in order to furnish services to homeless veterans.\n  Tenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to use data on \ncompensation paid to nurse anesthetists who work on a contract basis \nfor non-VA entities in determining appropriate locality pay for nurse \nanesthetists who work for VA.\n  Eleventh, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's Health Professional \nScholarship Program.\n  Twelfth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to enter into \nenhanced-use leases with non-VA entities.\n  Thirteenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's program of \ncommunity-based residential care for homeless chronically mentally ill \nveterans.\n  Fourteenth, extend until December 31, 1997, VA's authority to carry \nout a demonstration program of compensated work therapy and therapeutic \ntransitional housing.\n  Fifteenth, extend until September 30, 1997, VA's authority to make \ngrants to entities for the purpose of furnishing services and \nassistance to homeless veterans.\n  Sixteenth, extend until September 30, 1997, the Department of Labor's \nhomeless veterans' reintegration projects and authorize appropriations \nof $10 million for this program.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation would extend a number of important \nauthorities and programs, and I urge all of my Senate colleagues to \nsupport it. As I noted at the outset, our consideration of this bill \nwas delayed because of unrelated concerns and it is vital that we act \nas quickly as possible to reauthorize the various programs and \nauthorities.\n  Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the chairman of our \ncommittee, Mr. Simpson, and all other members of the committee, for \ntheir work on this measure. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the Senate, as well as members of the House Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, on its enactment.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to give its unanimous approval to \nthis measure.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nI now send to the desk be agreed to, the committee substitute, as \namended be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, \nand the bill then be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3116) was agreed to as follows:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.
