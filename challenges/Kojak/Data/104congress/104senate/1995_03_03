Mr. President, the whip of our party has just made an \nexciting announcement, that my friend and a friend of most of ours, \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado, is today announcing that \nhe will become a Republican.\n  For a good number of years I have had the privilege to work with this \nSenator, both in the U.S. House of Representatives and now here in the \nSenate, and I must tell you that he is a man of great integrity. We \nhave worked on a variety of western issues that are common to both our \nStates and a broad base of our constituency, \n[[Page S3440]] and it is exciting for me to know that Ben is going to \nbecome one of us. I feel very privileged that he has made that choice.\n  I have asked for a special order this morning to do an analysis \nfollowing the vote yesterday of the balanced budget amendment and where \nwe stand as a Senate now on the threshold of making a decision as it \nrelates to how we will deal with this issue.\n  At this time I will yield to the Senator from Oklahoma--whom I know \nneeds to preside in the chair and will in just a few moments--for his \ncomments on this issue. Clearly, while in the House and now here in the \nSenate, he has been a leader on the issue of the balanced budget \namendment, and I yield to the Senator for what time he may use.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for yielding. This will be very \nbrief, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3439-7", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A PROFILE OF BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT SUPPORTERS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before we hear the analysis from the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho, I want to give you my own analysis. \nYesterday on the floor, yesterday afternoon, I reminded the President, \nI reminded our fellow Members, and hopefully many in America who might \nbe watching that those individuals who were fighting the balanced \nbudget amendment have a very interesting profile, some things in \ncommon. I pointed out and documented that all of those 41 individuals \nwho were the cosponsors of the right-to-know amendment to the budget \nbalancing amendment had a very liberal background. Each one of the 41 \nhad either a D or an F rating by the National Taxpayers Union. Each one \nof the individuals had voted for the very large spending program called \nPresident Clinton's tax stimulus program. And each one had voted for \nthe 1993 tax increase which has been characterized as the largest \nsingle tax increase in the history of public finance in America or \nanywhere in the world.\n  I announced that I suspected that the 33 Democrats who managed to \nkeep from allowing us to have that one more vote to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment yesterday would fit this same profile. I have analyzed \nthis. I did this personally last night and I will give you the results \nof that.\n  Of the 33 Democrats--and it only took one to come over to our side \nand to free the future generations from the shackles they are going to \nbe bound with--all 33 voted on the cloture vote in favor of the tax \nstimulus program, which was the big spending program. All 33 have a D \nor an F rating by the National Taxpayers Union. And 31 of the 33--all \nbut 2 of them--voted for the largest single tax increase in the history \nof public finance in America or any place in the world.\n  The bottom line is this. All this talk about Social Security, all \nthis talk about the right to know is bogus. The fact is those \nindividuals did not want to balance the budget. They are big spenders.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The distinguished Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3440-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3440-S3441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for that \nanalysis. Of course, that was the issue yesterday as we debated and \nfinally voted on House Joint Resolution 1. For over 5 weeks we had \ndebated the issue of a balanced budget and why this Government and why \nthe Congress of the United States ought to be held to the constraints \nof a constitutional amendment requiring us to balance the Federal \nbudget. While there were many arguments from a variety of perspectives, \nthere was one overriding influence that could not be ignored nor could \nit be denied, and that was, had this issue passed the Senate yesterday, \nit would have been sent to our 50 States to begin a ratification \nprocess that I believe would have moved very rapidly to gain the \nnecessary 38 States to bring about ratification.\n  In doing that, of course, the Congress knew that would begin a long \nand very difficult process to move us to a balanced budget by the year \n2002,\n but one the American people now demand and expect from us, and one we \nknow we can accomplish, if we can bring about the discipline but, more \nimportantly, the pressure and the kind of control that a balanced \nbudget amendment to our Constitution would result in.\n\n  There are so many who wrung their hands in the argument that this \ncould never be done. But I argue that those who argue that are the many \nof the past. They are the ones who still are stuck in the idea or the \nconcept that the Federal Government and its programs must manage and \ncontrol people and direct an economy of a country outside the \nmarketplace. That, of course, is exactly what the Congress of the \nUnited States has done for over 30 years, and we have seen results. We \nhave seen the results of a $34.8 trillion debt that remains totally out \nof control. We have seen the results of how interest on that debt \neroded any ability to spend both in discretionary and entitlement \nprograms and locks us into a straitjacket of program and time and \nspending.\n  But something else that is also, I think, reflective of that debate \nis that those who argue it argue the status quo. They argue government \nas if it were something static, that it will never change, or that the \nSenators and the Members of the House who are involved in governing \nthis country will always vote to have exactly the same programs, that \nwe will not eliminate an agency, that we will not reduce or change a \npriority, and that we will not shift the intent of the governing of \nthis country from one area to another.\n  That is a very false and phony argument. Certainly it is to the \nAmerican people because, if there is anything sure about our country, \nit is change, and it occurs on a constant and daily basis. It is the \nGovernment that finds itself incapable of changing. So simply to say we \ncannot balance the budget because we cannot get there is to clearly \nargue that it is going to be the same Government and the same kind of \nbudget, and we are going to ramp it up to 3, 4, 5, to 6 percent a year \non the average and heading as far as the eye can see in that direction.\n  Why do I say that? Because that is exactly what President Clinton's \nbudget demonstrated when he presented it here but a few weeks ago. Here \nis a President who came to town arguing that he must have the largest \ntax increase in history, and, if we gave it to him, that he would then \nbegin a very progressive approach toward a budget that would bring us \nto a balanced budget that would bring down the deficit and continue to \nbring it down. That is what he campaigned on. That is what he promised \nthe American people. That is what he, the President of the United \nStates, promised this Senate and this Congress less than 2 years ago as \nhe argued for and his party gave him the largest tax increase in \nhistory. Then in a most cavalier way, as he presented the budget just \nthis year, he not only showed that he would not control the deficit, he \nsaid let the Republicans make the cuts. Let us see what they want to \ndo. Let them make the cuts.\n  Mr. President, that is why we need a balanced budget amendment so \nthat the Executive of this country can be as responsible as the \nlegislative branch of this country, that budgeting becomes a \npartnership of cooperation where the President, the executive branch, \nbrings about a balanced budget just as much and just as responsibly as \nthe legislative branch of Government must do.\n  That is, of course, exactly what the constitutional amendment \nrequired as we looked at it the other day. That is why five of our \ncolleagues from the other side who had once voted with us turned tail \nand ran away from their commitment and their pledge to their \nconstituents. I am frustrated by that because they are honorable \npeople. All of us in our pledge to our constituency attempt to honor \nit, and yet that did not happen yesterday on five very distinct votes. \nThat is too bad.\n  We hope as we work this issue and continue to work this issue that we \ncan regain the support of those Senators who left us yesterday and left \ntheir constituency.\n  We have several others who want to speak this morning. Before I \nyield, let me make one other point that I think \n[[Page S3441]] is so fundamentally important as we debate a balanced \nbudget amendment and as we continue to work on this issue and as we \ncontinue to assure the American people that we will do all within our \npower to bring down the deficits and to control our debt structure for \nnow and for future generations.\n  Article V of our Constitution--that is the article that speaks to how \nwe amend the organic document--speaks very clearly about how it gets \ndone. It says that the Congress shall propose an amendment. That is in \nthe first part of article V.\n  The second part of article V allows the States to petition for the \nformation of a constitutional convention. Many of us are concerned that \na convention is not the right way to go and that the most responsible \nway is for the Congress of the United States to craft and propose an \namendment.\n  Yesterday, the vote that we cast here was not to pass a balanced \nbudget amendment; it was to propose a balanced budget amendment to our \nConstitution. And in so doing that, it then would allow the citizens of \nour country, the State legislatures, or, if they chose, the forming of \na convention to debate and ratify the amendment. That action to propose \nwas denied yesterday--not to pass but to propose--to send out to the \nStates, to conform with article V of the Constitution.\n  In essence, what Senators who opposed that process yesterday did was \nto say to their citizens, ``We will not give you the right to choose, \nwe will not give you the right to look at this issue, to debate it, to \nunderstand the process, and to decide whether you want your Government \nto live under a constitutional requirement for a federally balanced \nbudget.'' I find that an amazing testimony.\n  I really would like those Senators to go home and hold a press \nconference and tell their electorate, ``We did not think you were \nresponsible, we did not think you ought to have the right under the \nConstitution to decide,'' because that is exactly what they did. That \nin itself is a tragedy. But more importantly, what this is is a \nreaffirmation of something with which the American people have known \nfor a long while, and they spoke so clearly about it last November. \nThat was the arrogance of power that resides here on Capitol Hill, this \nall-knowing knowledge that somehow, if the wisdom does not emanate from \nCapitol Hill, it is unwise; that somehow the States and those who \nreside in the States cannot think for themselves, cannot make those \njudgments. That is absolutely the reverse philosophy from those who \nfounded our country and who wrote the Constitution and who got it \nratified. In fact, House Joint Resolution 1 that we voted on yesterday \nwas very much a part of the style and the type of constitutional \namendment that a Tom Jefferson would have put in the Constitution \nbecause it reflected that attitude of the power and the right of the \nindividual citizen and the power to the States and the ability of the \nStates to control their central government.\n  Yesterday, the Senators who opposed this said very clearly under all \nof the smokescreen and all of the excuses that they gave for not voting \nfor it--there were two fundamental things. They did not believe in the \nrights of the States to control their central government, and they \nwould not give the citizens of those States the right to choose that \noption. I think that is profound, and it is sad. But that is the \nreality of what happened yesterday.\n  It is very important that the American people understand that message \nin the coming days and weeks as we work to revisit this issue to gain \nthe necessary 67 votes or the two-thirds votes of this body to propose \nit and to send it to the States for ratification.\n  At this time, let me yield to my colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCoverdell, who has worked so closely with us on this issue, has worked \non a team of Senators who met daily over the course of the last 5 weeks \nto develop the issue and work with Senator Orrin Hatch here on the \nfloor, to build the debate. I think it was a remarkable task. I say \nthat because for well over 100 hours and for 5 long weeks we debated \nthis issue, and there was very little dead time, as we call it, or \nquorum calls because there truly was a message that came through loud \nand clear from this side of the aisle as to the purpose of a balanced \nbudget amendment, and part of that message was crafted by the Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n I am pleased to yield to him at this time for such time as he might \nconsume.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3440-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3441-S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE PRESIDENT IS NOT LISTENING TO THE PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you, Mr. President. I commend my colleague from \nIdaho and the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and also Senator Simon, \nwho is not present this morning, for the effort over the past 5 weeks \nthey have lent to the effort to create a historical change in the \ngovernance and the financial discipline of our country. I was talking \nwith my wife last evening, and I wish Senator Simon from Illinois was \nhere because she had a chance to watch his address to the Nation \nimmediately following the vote. She said it was most eloquent and even \nrecommended that I get a video of it so that I might see it. I missed \nit as I was in a press conference.\n  I was so saddened yesterday about the outcome, the narrow defeat of \nthe opportunity to move forward with the debate in the Nation about \nconstructing an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced \nbudget. It reminded me a little of when I was a youngster and the \nbattle in Korea had just begun. Each day I would pick up the paper and \nthe perimeter would shrink for U.S. forces trying to hold on against \nthe surge of the enemy. Every day was a little more sad, because that \nperimeter shrunk and shrunk and shrunk until finally it was a very \nsmall piece of that Korean Peninsula surrounding the city of Pusan. Lo \nand behold, the will of the country, the will of the alliance to put \nback an evil force that would do great damage to the future of the free \nworld ultimately prevailed. I think the analogy will be so here.\n  I think over these past 30 to 40 years, the Nation has awakened each \nmorning a little more worried about the state of the Union, a union \nthat has pushed away every evil aggressor across and away from our \nshores but is perilously close to losing the standing of this great \ndemocracy because of a lack of domestic will, a lack of a will to take \ncare of our own affairs and pay attention to our own financial health.\n  Maybe the beginning is in the press conference that will occur in \nabout 8 minutes. Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell came to this Senate on \nthe same day I did but 2 years ago. Both of us saw the revolution \ncoming. The Presiding Officer is a product of that revolution. I think \nhis decision--I have not spoken to him, but it has to be some way \naffected by the realization of what the American people are asking of \npolicymakers in their Capital City and the entrenched view to stand in \nthe way of the change that America is asking for.\n  I go back to the President's State of the Union Address. In the \nPresident's State of the Union, after the election--and no one has \nreceived a greater thrashing than the President in that election--it \ncaused great reflection, supposedly, in the White House, an analysis of \nwhat happened here. The President went back and read his speeches from \n1992, the new Democrat theory. He wanted to revisit. What went wrong? \nIn that speech, he said, ``The American people are not just singing to \nus, they are shouting at us.'' How right he was. But he has not heard \nthe shouts. Senator Campbell has heard the shouting, and he is doing \nsomething about it. The President has not heard the shouting, and he is \nstanding in the way of what America is seeking.\n  Yesterday was one of the most important votes ever to be cast in the \nhistory of the Senate. We were dealing with the core governance of \nAmerica, the core document by which we live. We were saying that to \nsecure the future of the Nation, we must have sound financial policy. \nWe must live within our means. We must stop spending money we do not \nhave because we impose a debt on future generations. Every child born \ntoday will get either a pink or blue wristband and attached to it will \nbe a $22,000 mortgage. Unbelievable. Unbelievable that we would consume \neverything we have--$5 trillion we do not have, 30 percent of the tax \nbase of the property taxes of the \n[[Page S3442]] United States through unfunded mandates, and now we have \neven taken the practice of spending the livelihood of our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  The Nation knows this must stop, which is why 80 percent of them said \npass a balanced budget amendment, which is why they overturned the \nCongress last November and sent new majorities here. What did they send \nthem here to do? They sent them here to change the way we do business \nin Washington. They did their level best to achieve it. Who was in \ntheir way? President William Clinton.\n  The defeat yesterday comes from the White House. There can be no \ndoubt that the amendment would have passed, and it would have passed \nwith 70-plus votes if it had not been for the President's decision to \nstand in its way. So what we have here is a classic division of the \npeople that sent messengers to Washington to ratify, to honor, to carry \nout the will of a nation and a President who, in the final analysis, \nchose to nullify.\n  Mr. President, as you know, in about 3 minutes a very historic event \nwill occur when Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell--I will put it in this \nlight--affirms and acknowledges and does honor to what he is hearing \nthe American people say. He will have chosen to leave the ranks of \nthose who would nullify, reject, and subject the view of the American \npeople.\n  It is hard for me to understand how anybody--particularly if you are \nin the White House as President of this great democracy--could miss \nwhat those people are saying out there. Every piece of data you pick \nup, it is either 7 out of 10 or 8 out of 10, it is overwhelming. This \nis almost like the last 2 years replayed. Last year, we were in a \nhistoric debate again and we were talking about health care. The \nPresident puts on the table a program that you could not even read and \nyou could not even put it on a chart, a Government takeover of \nmedicine.\n  The American people were telling him, in the loudest voice, they did \nnot want him to do that. They were worried about health care reform, \nbut they did not want the Government to take it over. They did not want \nto be taxed even more. Heavens, they were already working from January \nto July for the Government before they kept their first dime for their \nfamily's dream, so they could not understand what he was doing. By the \nend of this debate, 85 percent of the American people were saying, \n``Stop this nonsense. Don't do that.'' But the President pressed on as \nif he knew better, he knew more than this Nation of ours.\n  I am convinced that it was that battle over that great issue that \nmade it so clear to America what they wanted to do in the midterm \nelections. And that is why there is a new majority in the Senate and \nthat is why there is a new majority in the House, because the President \nkept trying to press on the country something that they were telling \nhim in every way they knew how they did not want.\n  So they picked the elections to tell him. They said, ``All right, if \nyou won't listen to us, we're going to change who the players are in \nthat city,'' and they sent a whole new class of Senators and a whole \nnew class of House Members.\n  And at the center, at the very epicenter of the message was: Manage \nthe financial affairs of the country. Make our country financially \nhealthy. Pass a balanced budget amendment. The same numbers, another 80 \npercent of the American public saying, ``Do this. Do this.''\n  This makes me step back for a minute and talk about a word that was \nused frequently over the last 2 years by the President called \n``gridlock.'' He kept saying, ``Gridlock. We can't get anything done.''\n  Well, I would say to the President that it is one thing to stand here \nand try to stop something that the people do not want--which is what \nthe Republican conference was doing on health care--it is another thing \nto stand in front of something that the whole Nation wants to do. That \nis the dilemma the President finds himself in on this balanced budget \namendment.\n  America lost yesterday. It was not a win-lose situation here in the \nSenate. We talked about the 33 that voted against it and all those 66 \nwho voted for it. This is not where the winning and losing took place. \nThe losing took place in Keokuk, IA; in Norman, OK; Atlanta, GA; Miami; \nand Anchorage. The Nation knows, without any equivocation, that we must \nchange the way we manage our financial affairs.\n  Mr. President, throughout the whole debate, the other side has \nbrought up one red herring after another, one amendment after the \nother. It was advertised that the effect of these amendments would be \nto protect somebody--a veteran, a Social Security recipient, a child. \nIt was almost shameful in the manipulation of the language, because, in \neffect, any set-aside would have made the whole effort moot.\n  In other words, if you had a balanced budget amendment, except for--\nit does not matter what name you put on it--then what would have \nhappened from that date forward is every spending proposal that is more \nthan we have would amend the exception. It would have made a nightmare \nout of whatever area of the law they tried to protect. They were not \nprotecting it. They were putting it in harm's way. Whether it was \nveterans' or children's programs or Social Security, to set anything \naside would have put it right in front of the pressure to spend and \nspend and spend with abandon. Every spending bill would have amended \nthe exception. And so the whole exercise would have been absolutely \nmoot. There would have been no reason to even go through the debate in \nthe Nation if it was nothing more than a charade.\n  To those innocent bystanders who looked at that, it may have appeared \nas if they were trying to be protected. But I am here to say--and there \nare many with me--that they were actually being put in harm's way, \nbecause it would have been the route by which all spending occurred. It \nwould have made a nightmare of any area of the law that was the set-\naside.\n  Furthermore, I would say this, Mr. President. This Nation--well, let \nme put it another way, Mr. President, in the form of a rhetorical \nquestion. Have any of us ever known an individual or a family or a \nlocal community, probably more specifically a business, that was ever \nable to take care of its employees, its needs, its health, if it was \nfinancially crippled? Is Orange County better off today? No. Is a \ncompany that is pushed into bankruptcy able to take care of its \nemployees, or are its employees facing a pink slip? Is a family that \nhas spent too much on the credit card, bought a house that was too big, \nare they going to be able to send their children to college?\n  Well, obviously the answer is no--no for the individual, no for the \nfamily, no for a local community, and no for a business.\n  It is also true for a nation. No nation--no nation--that is \nfinancially destabilized can care for its security, either \ninternationally or domestically. And every citizen of our country who \nis concerned because they are involved with a Government program, they, \nmore than any other, should ask for and demand a financially healthy \ncountry because, without that, we will never be able to take care of \nthe veterans or the children's programs, or an individual on Social \nSecurity. First, and foremost, we must be a healthy nation at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Georgia for \nthose extremely valuable words and astute observations to the problems \nwe face as a country today as it relates to the issue of our Federal \nbudget, our debt, and how that gets handled and what we intend to do \nhere as a new Congress, as a new Senate, to try to resolve that issue \nfor the American people.\n  One of the sets of figures that I think comes to mind to me most \noften as we try to deal with a balanced budget and a resolution of this \nphenomenal debt structure that we have created over the last 30 years \nare figures that go like this: $829,444,000 a day additional debt--\nadditional debt. That is almost the size of my State's entire operating \nbudget for 1 year. We are now just a little over $1 billion in the \nState of Idaho. And this is one day's debt for the Federal Government.\n  That is $34,560,000 an hour.\n  I mean, you and I, Mr. President, cannot envision that.\n\n[[Page S3443]]\n\n  We really cannot comprehend it. In fact, that is part of the problem \nwe suffer from, that we cannot understand the magnitude of the problem \nthat we are creating here on an hourly, daily, monthly basis.\n  Now I have asked for this special order for 1 hour, so I know that \ncosts $34 million. But 1 minute is $576,000, and 1 second is $9,600. It \ntruly is beyond the ability of this country and our people to \nunderstand.\n  Mr. President, oftentimes we reduce things that we understand to what \nwe can see or envision. We know that a car costs somewhere in the \n$20,000 to $30,000 range today for a certain type, and that houses cost \nso much. You can drive down the street and say, ``Look at that house. \nThat house is about a $200,000 home, or a $300,000 home.'' The average \nhuman can comprehend that. They can say, ``Boy, I cannot afford that,'' \nor ``I can,'' or ``That is within our budget.''\n  But can the average human comprehend $4.8 trillion, and what it takes \nto generate that or to pay for it? Or to begin to deal with it in a \nrational way? We cannot, as a country. Yet, every year here, first \nshowing up on the budget sheets that we call the Federal Government, of \n$3.2. That is not $3.20, but that is $3.2 billion--but it is just $3.2, \njust a list of figures. It does not make a lot of sense.\n  And yesterday, and for the last 5 weeks, we have tried to begin to \nturn that corner, to bring it under control, to begin to define it, to \nwork with the American people to understand it, and to say to them that \nthis debt structure of over $18,000 per American citizen is going to \nget under control because it does mean something and it does have \nimpact.\n  There has been a variety of approaches to control it. But my \ncolleague, who has just joined me on the floor from Arizona, while he \nhas been an outspoken supporter of the balanced budget amendment and \nhas brought about a lot of the energy behind that in the House and now, \nof course, here in the Senate as one of our leaders with the team that \nworked to deal with this issue over the last several weeks, has also \nfocused on spending reductions and spending controls, because that is \nreally what it is all about.\n  If we balance the Federal budget in 7 years, we have to set a course \nof spending controls. Stay within our limit, stay within the ability to \ncontrol, and to meet the target 7 years out in 2002.\n  At this moment, let me turn to the junior Senator from Colorado, or \nexcuse me, from Arizona, for his comments on this issue and others that \nhe might wish to address.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank you. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho.\n  He and I served in the House of Representatives together when he was \na leader in the fight for the balanced budget amendment there. He \ncarried that fight right over here to the Senate, and was one of our \nleaders in attempting to obtain passage of the balanced budget \namendment this year. I predict that he will be one of the key figures \nin securing its passage sooner or later.\n  It has been a pleasure for me to be of assistance to him and to bring \nwith me from the House of Representatives an idea actually which I \nbrought from my own home State of Arizona to achieve a balanced budget \nby spending limits rather than by raising taxes. That is what I wish to \ntalk about today.\n  Mr. President, if I could call time out for a second, the Senator \nfrom Idaho mistakenly referred to me as the junior Senator from \nColorado for a moment, and I know exactly why. In the background, there \nwas a deafening noise just a moment ago of loud applause for the junior \nSenator from Colorado, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, for his declaration \nthat as of today, he is a proud member of the Republican Party, and \nwill be a Member of the Republican Senate cadre. We are looking for a \nplace to put his new desk on this side of this Chamber.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield with that? We will find a place to \nput that desk.\n  Mr. KYL. And I suspect any others who may wish to join Richard Shelby \nand Ben Nighthorse Campbell in joining us on the Republican side.\n  Mr. President, we welcome these friends--former Democrats who are now \nRepublicans--not only because they are friends and we need their help, \nbut because their decision to join the Republican Party in both cases, \nas they said, was, as in Ronald Reagan's old phrase, a decision not to \nleave the Democratic Party, but because the Democratic Party had really \nleft them.\n  We have many friends here who proudly serve in the Democratic Party \nand uphold its traditions. From our point of view, one of those \ntraditions is being willing to spend too much of the taxpayers' money. \nPeople like Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Richard Shelby and Paul Simon \nfrom Illinois and others who remain in the Democratic Party have \nfinally said, ``We do not want to do that anymore. We have to balance \nthe Federal budget.''\n  It has not been comfortable for a Democrat to support us in that \neffort. The President of the United States was very much in opposition \nto the balanced budget amendment, and as the Senator from Georgia said \na short while ago, we can probably attribute the defeat of the balanced \nbudget amendment yesterday to the lobbying of the President of the \nUnited States. Five or six Democrats who had previously cosponsored and \nvoted for the balanced budget amendment--Democrats--decided this time \nnot to support it.\n  I think that handful of Democrats in support of the President, \nobviously, are the ones who will have to answer to the American people \nwhen the questions are asked, who defeated the balanced budget \namendment.\n  But today is another day. We have to move on. We are going to move \nforward as if the balanced budget amendment had passed and as if we are \ngoing to balance the budget by the year 2002. We will do it with or \nwithout the balanced budget amendment. It will be harder without that \nconstitutional limitation.\n  Yesterday's defeat of the balanced budget amendment, I suggest, is a \ncall to arms. The ballot was lost, but the war rages on. The balanced \nbudget amendment will ultimately pass--maybe later this year, maybe \nnext year, or perhaps the year after. But it will pass because the \nAmerican people demand that it pass.\n  Last fall, a political revolution swept Capitol Hill, a revolution \nfueled by the American people's anger with the Federal Government out \nof control, a Federal Government overregulating, overtaxing, and \noverspending. Although the American people swept new leadership into \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives, yesterday's vote \ndemonstrated that the vestiges of business as usual remain and that \nanother round of housecleaning is yet to come.\n  I will predict that those who stood in the way of a balanced budget \namendment yesterday will not be around when it is brought to a vote in \nfuture Congresses. The American people will, as I said, hold them \naccountable.\n  Our mission today, with or without the balanced budget amendment, is \nto immediately begin making the tough choices about what spending to \ncut and what programs to terminate in order to get the budget to \nbalance by the year 2002. Our responsibility is to put an effective \nenforcement mechanism into place to force the Congress to begin to \nprioritize, to separate wants from needs, just like families all across \nAmerica must do every day.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kyl pertaining to the introduction of S. 494 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for yielding \nthis time and, again, for taking a strong leadership role in the effort \nto get the balanced budget amendment passed and predict that through \nhis leadership eventually we will pass it.\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will not make that mistake again of \nreferring to my colleague as the junior Senator from Colorado. I have \nhad the privilege of serving with the Senator from Arizona for a good \nnumber of years, both in the House and now in the Senate, and I have \nalways appreciated his leadership and his energy that he puts to the \nissues that he is dedicated to and certainly the spending limitation \nprogram that he has just proposed, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor.\n  We will work to prove to our colleagues on the other side that there \nis a way to balance the Federal budget \n[[Page S3444]] and do so in a reasonable fashion without the draconian \nstyle arguments or comments that oftentimes come from the other side of \nthe aisle when they find that they are threatened with the concept of a \nbalanced budget. We know that can be done, and we know that there will \nbe tough choices to be made, but it must be done.\n  I would like, Mr. President, to mention another issue that I guess \nthe word disappointment comes to mind when I think of how it was used \nover the course of the last several weeks by several of my colleagues. \nAnd that was the issue of Social Security.\n  I am disappointed that every time Social Security is brought up on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate, it is used as a scare tactic, it is used \nto frighten dedicated American citizens who believe that their Federal \nGovernment has an obligation to them to assist them after they have \npaid into a system of income assistance known as Social Security, and \nthat somehow there is a devious scheme on the part of some politician \nin Washington to otherwise change that commitment that is clearly \nwritten into the Social Security law.\n  Mr. President, you and I and the American people know there is no \ndevious scheme, not at all; that you and I and others who serve in the \nU.S. Senate really serve as the board of directors of Social Security, \nInc., if you will. We are the ones charged under the law with the \nresponsibility of managing the Social Security system.\n  Whether you can argue that it has been managed well or not, the \nbottom line is it has never failed to meet the obligation that it has \nto the citizens of this country who have paid into it and find \nthemselves then eligible under the law to receive the benefits of it. \nYet, somehow over the last several weeks, those who needed to create a \nsmokescreen or a shield to back away from their previous support of a \nbalanced budget amendment because of their President's pressure, or for \nwhatever reason, begin to raise the ugly head and the old argument that \nsomehow the other side was manipulating a way to change or destroy the \nSocial Security system.\n  For the last 3 years, as we have debated the issue of the balanced \nbudget amendment, Senator Paul Simon, of Illinois, who has been one of \nthe leaders and certainly the prime sponsor and then the prime \ncosponsor this year of the balanced budget amendment, we have worked \nwith a fellow by the name of Robert Myers. Robert Myers for years was \nthe chief actuary of the Social Security system of the Social Security \nAdministration from 1947 to 1970 and then a deputy commissioner from \n1981 to 1982 and 1982 to 1983. He served as executive director of the \nNational Commission on Social Security Reform--I mean, this man is Mr. \nSocial Security.\n  I am quoting from a letter of February of this year that he sent to \nPaul Simon, when in essence he says the Federal debt is the threat to \nthe Social Security system, not the balanced budget amendment. If you \ndo not control the debt, you ruin the Social Security system and what \nis he saying in essence? He is recognizing the fact that if we bankrupt \nthis country, Social Security checks are not going to go out. There \nwill not be any money, whether it is in a trust fund or whether it is \ninside the general budget of our country.\n  The bottom line is if you have a busted government and a busted \ncountry, nothing goes out; everybody is equally bankrupt or poor at \nthat moment. The responsibility then of this Congress is to keep a \nbudget under control to move it toward balance, to bring the debt down \nso we can always honor the commitment of the Social Security system.\n  Well, it became the trust fund argument: Is it on, is it off? Is it \nin, is it out? We know from past experience that you manage the system. \nIn 1983, Social Security needed reform and the Congress came together, \nDemocrat and Republican alike, not in the kind of demagoguery that I \nfelt I heard on this floor in the last several weeks, but we came \ntogether united as a government to manage and stabilize the system, and \nwe did. Yet day after day, hour after hour, amendment after amendment, \nit was the ghost of the Social Security system or the mismanagement of \nit or some devious scheme under a balanced budget amendment to do so, \nand, Mr. President, that is just false. It is not true and, most \nimportantly, the American people know it is not true.\n  The Senior Coalition, one of the largest organizations of senior \ncitizens in this country, in a recent national survey--and I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the survey was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, March 2, 1995.\n     Re The American Association of Retired Persons and the \n         Balanced Budget Amendment.\n     To: All Interested Parties.\n     From: Kimberly Schuld, Legislative Analyst.\n       The AARP Commissioned The Wirthlin Group to conduct a \n     survey for them January 25-28, 1995 on a variety of questions \n     pertaining to the BBA. Since then, the AARP and the National \n     Council of Senior Citizens have been twisting the poll's \n     results and methodology to claim that public support for a \n     BBA is low--once Americans are told what the BBA will mean to \n     them.\n       The key word here is TOLD. The poll utilizes a series of \n     questions designed to lead people to a mis-informed and \n     generally incorrect impression of what the BBA will do. \n     Namely, the line of questioning implies that Social Security \n     and Medicare will face drastic cuts, and state and local \n     taxes will skyrocket as the federal faucet is turned off.\n       An AARP Press Release announcing the poll results states, \n     ``* * * most Americans do not understand the potential impact \n     of the Balanced Budget Amendment and are adamantly opposed to \n     using Social Security and Medicare to reduce the federal \n     deficit.''\n       Quite bluntly, the AARP has effectively provided a \n     political scare campaign for those members of Congress \n     wishing to avoid facing their constituents with the news that \n     they want to vote against the BBA. We all know the arguments \n     against excluding Social Security from the constitutional \n     amendment, but the AARP has electrified the ``third rail'' to \n     the political benefit (is it really?) of the White House.\n\n\n                   analysis of the aarp/wirthlin poll\n\n       The poll consisted of sixteen questions to 1,000 adults, \n     with a 200 oversample to adults 50 and older. The margin of \n     error is 2.8% at a 95% confidence level. A copy \n     of the questions is attached.\n       The poll starts off with a question about the direction of \n     the country and then asks:\n       ``Do you favor or oppose a balanced budget amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution that would require the federal government \n     to balance its budget by the year 2002?''\n       Favor: 79%\n       Oppose: 16%\n       The next question tests how people perceive the budget can \n     be balanced: spending cuts, taxes or both. This is followed \n     by a question on equal percentage across-the-board cuts in \n     every federal program.\n       The next two questions ask specifically if Social Security \n     and Medicare should be included in across-the-board cuts. As \n     could be expected, the respondents would favor exemptions for \n     both programs. A key element to these two questions (#5 and \n     #6) is the use of the word ``exempt''. The word ``exempt'' is \n     not used anywhere in the poll except in relation to Social \n     Security and/or Medicare. This sets up a connection in \n     people's minds that these programs may be in graver danger \n     than other government programs.\n       Question #7 sets up the respondent for the ``truth in \n     budgeting'' excuse the Administration has been spinning. When \n     offering people the choice between passing the BBA first, or \n     identifying cuts first, the poll throws in ``consequences'' \n     associated with cuts. The connotation is that there are going \n     to be dire ``consequences'' to balancing the budget. This \n     sets up the respondent to answer question #15 (open-ended) \n     with a negative response on how they think the BBA will \n     affect them personally.\n       Questions #8, #9 and #10 ask about whether respondents \n     think it is necessary to cut Defense, Social Security and \n     Medicare to balance the budget, or whether the budget could \n     be balanced without these programs. As could be expected, the \n     response for cutting Defense is overwhelming compared to SS \n     and Medicare. The group of questions sets up a ``good cop/bad \n     cop'' scenario in the mind of the respondent whereby they \n     identify Defense as the ``bad guy as well as being reminded \n     which parry tends to support Defense. It is also important to \n     remember that at the time this poll was taken, the newspapers \n     and network news broadcasts were full of stories about the \n     Republicans wanting to increase Defense spending in the \n     Contract With America.\n       Questions #11 and #12 address taxes; their role in the \n     budget balancing process and reform ideas. This also serves \n     to set up negative responses to question #15. In #11, 48% of \n     the people believe there will have to be tax increases to \n     balance the budget. Then in the next question, they are asked \n     to declare a preference for one of a variety of tax cuts. \n     This conflict sets up a negative impression that tax cuts are \n     good and the BBA is bad because there must be tax increases \n     to accomplish its goal.\n       Question #13 throws together ``programs for the poor, \n     foreign aid, and congressional salaries and pensions''. \n     Respondents are asked how far these programs COMBINED would \n     go toward balancing the budget if they \n     [[Page S3445]] were cut. By throwing these widely divergent \n     programs together, the pollsters are setting up the \n     respondent to believe that balancing the budget will mean \n     higher taxes and cuts in taxpayer-financed programs.\n       Question #14 is the keeper. Respondents are asked if they \n     still support a BBA with the following choices:\n       Social Security should be kept separate from the rest of \n     the budget and exempted from a BBA because it is self-\n     financed by a payroll tax.\n     or\n       Social Security is part of the overall government spending \n     and taxing scenario, thus should be subject to cuts along \n     with the rest of the budget.\n       The results of this questions dramatically flip the BBA \n     support from question #2:\n       BBA with SS Exempt: 85%\n       BBA that cuts SS: 13%\n       Question #16 now asks:\n       ``Do you favor or oppose the balanced budget amendment, \n     even if it means that your state income taxes and local \n     property taxes would have to be raised to make up for monies \n     the federal government no longer transfers to your state?''\n       Favor: 38%\n       Oppose: 60%\n       This question ends the phone call on a gross mis-\n     interpretation that dire consequences of doom and gloom are \n     on the horizon, all at the voter's expense. This is exactly \n     the type of question that re-reinforces the ``angry voter'' \n     complex of the middle class family.\n       These anti-BBA results are achieved by planting the seed of \n     doubt slowly but surely that:\n       1. It is the intention of BBA supporters to cut Social \n     Security and Medicare.\n       2. It is the intention of BBA supporters to beef up Defense \n     spending at the expense of everything else.\n       3. Taxes will inevitably go up with a BBA.\n       4. A BBA will have a negative direct impact on families \n     ``beyond the beltway.''\n       Any time a Senator, Congressman, reporter or lobbyist \n     starts to talk about poll results showing 85% of Americans \n     oppose a BBA unless it exempts Social Security, bear in mind \n     that the spin-meisters achieved this number by forcing the \n     assumption that draconian Social Security cuts are a foregone \n     conclusion.\n       Leaders from the Republican party, the Democratic party, \n     the Administration and the President himself have all gone to \n     great lengths to state that social security benefits are off \n     the table.\n       Any member of congress who contends NOW that the new \n     Republican leadership cannot be trusted to keep their hands \n     off Social Security is also implicating their own party \n     leaders and the President of the same un-trustworthiness.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in a letter to me and others who fought \nthis issue, they polled their constituents and of them a thousand \nregistered voters. That survey showed a confidence level of 95 percent \nthat the Senate was doing the right thing to pass the balanced budget \namendment.\n  When people were asked if they supported the Senate's passage, 79 \npercent overwhelmingly said yes, but the confidence level--and this was \na Wirthlin poll, this was not just a few phone calls, this was a \nprofessionally nationally respected polling company--found out that the \nseniors of America do support a balanced budget amendment. They know of \ntheir future and the future of their grandchildren, and they want it to \nbe bright. While they want their Social Security check, they do not \nwant to bust the future of the country and the future of their \nchildren.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, just before the Senator mentioned our \nchildren and grandchildren, I was going to make that precise point. I \njust got through with a statewide campaign. We conducted what we call \nback yard and living room meetings. In every one of these meetings, the \nquestion of the balanced budget amendment came up. Many of them were \nattended by seniors. I would ask these seniors--frankly, it was a way, \nMr. President, of bragging about my two grandchildren.\n  I would say, ``How many of you have children or grandchildren,'' and \nmost of the hands would go up.\n  ``Well, so do I, I have two beautiful grandchildren,'' and promised \nnot to talk about them.\n  But the point I am making is that these seniors love their children \nand grandchildren more than anything else in the world. And when they \ntalked about the balanced budget amendment and they talked about their \nneeds for Medicare and other expenses that they would have to bear in \ntheir remaining years, they always came back to the point that they \nwanted to leave a better future for their children and grandchildren, \nand the last thing that they wanted to do was to leave a mountain of \ndebt for these young kids to have to pay, because they instinctively \nknew that the future for these children and grandchildren will be a \nlower standard of living than we have enjoyed unless we get the Federal \nfiscal house in order. And so these senior citizens, consistent with \nthe statistics that the Senator from Idaho has just quoted, to a \nperson, were very much in favor of the Federal Government getting its \nfiscal house in order. They understood it was not only good for them \nbut it was essential for the people they love most, their children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Arizona for making those \nobservations because those are the facts. That is the truth that is \nshown in survey after survey. The seniors of this country among any \nsocioeconomic group understand the value of balancing budgets. They \ncame through the Great Depression. They know how tough things can be \nout there when a country and a government is in trouble and an economy \nhas collapsed, and they know that the future of their children and \ntheir grandchildren is at stake here. They do not want to see their \noffspring go through what many of them had to go through, on literally \nnothing through the course of a good many years because of a country \nthat was in deep financial trouble as a result of a Great Depression.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that a Great Depression is at hand, but I am \ntelling you that a $4.8 trillion debt uncontrolled and continuing to \nmount moves us toward the edge of a day when there will be a phenomenal \nfinancial reckoning in our country that could spell difficulties like \nthe kinds that we had in the thirties if we do not resolve the issue \nnow.\n  Let me yield to my colleague from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield for just an observation?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I just came from the press conference where Senator \nBen Campbell announced officially that he had joined the ranks of the \nRepublican Party. In his address, he spoke of the financial dismay. One \nof the key centers of it was the peril that he feared unless something \nis done, and soon. But as he was leaving--and I wanted to leave this \nwith the Senator--one in the mass of reporters leaned over and said, \n``Was there any particular event that crystallized your decision?'' And \nhe turned to the reporter and he said, ``Yes, the balanced budget \namendment'' result. And so, again, I think we see an American \nresponding to the dilemma that the Senator has characterized this \nmorning. I wanted to pass on that observation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Georgia for those observations. I \nhave had the privilege of knowing Senator Campbell all of his public \nlife here in Washington. He is a man of tremendous principle, and that \nkind of comment just does not surprise me at all. He is tremendously \ndedicated to the issue of a balanced budget amendment, and I know he \nwas terribly frustrated when he saw a good many of his former Democrat \ncolleagues back away from their strong support over the past few years \nfor this issue, and we had discussed this over the last good number of \ndays as he continued in his strong support for a balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue that now rests at the desk of the \nSenate, I am sure to be revisited again over the course of the next \nseveral months as we struggle to try to find a way, absent a balanced \nbudget amendment, to resolve our spending difficulties and establish a \ncourse for the Congress in working with the executive branch of \nGovernment to bring down our deficits and move us toward a balanced \nbudget.\n  My guess is that if we do not do that and we do not demonstrate to \nthe American people that we are capable of doing that, we are but a \nyear away or months away from revisiting the balanced budget amendment \nand passing it and causing the States and the citizens of this country \nthe opportunity to force us to do what we should have done yesterday, \nand that is to have the will and the resolve to allow the American \npeople to choose whether they wanted a balanced budget amendment to \nbecome a part of the organic law of \n[[Page S3446]] the land, to become a part of the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time assigned to the Senator from Idaho \nhas expired.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. \nLieberman] is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Laura \nPhilips, who is an American Institute of Physics Fellow, be allowed \nfloor privileges during morning business on this day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to sound an alarm for my \ncolleagues and my country about a clear and present danger to America's \nability to defend itself against foreign enemies in the future.\n   But first, a look back: throughout history, the time between major \nchanges in the weaponry of war was measured in centuries. Then came the \nindustrial revolution, and ever since the weapons of war have evolved \nwith exponential speed. Now we are in the technology revolution and the \npace is so furious that we would fight the gulf war today differently \nthan we did just 4 years ago, simply because weapons--and related \ntactics--have changed so much.\n   Nations that first perfect new weapons of war are best-equipped to \nwin wars. Those left behind the curve of change must scramble mightily \nto catch up--to close the gap--or else their vulnerability will be \nexploited.\n   At the beginning of this century there was the dreadnought gap. In \n1906, Britain's First Sea Lord, John Fisher, commissioned the H.M.S. \nDreadnought. It was a technological marvel in its time; bigger, faster, \nmore powerful than any other warship of its kind on the planet.\n   The Germans, recognizing their vulnerability, built their own \ndreadnoughts. The English, fearing a dreadnought gap because of \nGermany's industrial prowess, sped up production and built a total of \n15 over the next 6 years. Winston Churchill objected at first, \nbelieving there was no dreadnought gap. Indeed, such a gap never \nmaterialized. However, Britain's bigger navy provided a key margin for \nvictory in World War I and Churchill, writing in 1928, acknowledged \nthat he ``was absolutely wrong in relation to the deep tides of \ndestiny.'' He learned a lesson that served him and his nation well when \nthe time came to fight the Germans again.\n   In the middle of this century was the atomic bomb gap. At the end of \nWorld War II we were the only nation to have the atomic bomb. Russia \nscrambled to catch up, and that led to the so-called missile gap of the \nlate 1950's and early 1960's. Just as Germany and England rushed to \nbuild dreadnoughts after 1906, the United States and Russia rushed to \nbuild intercontinental ballistic missiles after 1957.\n   As we approach the end of the century, there is a new gap--a defense \ntechnology gap--and it is the gap between the technological \ncapabilities of our military forces and those of any other nation on \nEarth. The clear and present danger I foresee is the narrowing of that \ngap in the next 10 to 20 years by virtue of decisions being made under \nthe dome of this great Capitol building today.\n   The technology gap allowed us to defeat Saddam Hussein handily and \ndeters other despots from acting rashly against us today. Given the \nthreats we are likely to face tomorrow, I believe we must maintain and \nincrease that gap, not let it shrink.\n   But the closing of the gap began last week when the House of \nRepresentatives voted to cut the heart out of crucial new programs \ndesigned to advance American technology. Five hundred million dollars \nwere taken out of the Defense Department's technology reinvestment \nproject [TRP] and $100 million were removed from the related civilian \nAdvanced Technology Program [ATP]. The money is being shifted to pay \nfor military operations in Somalia, Haiti, Iraq, and Bosnia. Additional \ncuts in the Advanced Research Projects Agency [ARPA], which runs the \nTRP and other technology programs, are being considered for the 1996 \nbudget.\n   And just yesterday, a committee of the U.S. Senate cut more than \n$300 million from TRP and ATP and millions more from other technology \nprograms in the current 1995 budget.\n   Some in Congress are cutting military technology to pay for military \nreadiness. What they are really doing is shrinking a real technology \nmargin of victory to close an illusory readiness gap--a gap readiness \nexperts say does not exist.\n   Closing the defense technology gap is a tragic error we must avert. \nDisinvestment in military technology is the historical equivalent of \nGreat Britain scuttling its dreadnoughts before World War I or America \nchoosing not to build missiles after Sputnik. Cutting military \ntechnology programs is, quite frankly, one of the most thoughtless and \nharmful courses I have seen Congress contemplate in my 6 years in the \nSenate.\n\n\n                     The Nature of the Future Threat\n\n   Defense spending must meet not only current needs; it must take into \naccount the national security threats of our future. That future is \nless predictable than it was during the cold war, when we knew who, \nwhere, and how capable our enemy was at all times.\n   The end of the cold war has given us all hope that democracy and \nfree markets will spread around the globe. And there have been \ntremendous success stories to celebrate. But the absence of a single \nsuperpower rivalry has also unleashed a stream of aggression and \nhostility and countless thousands have died in this post-cold-war world \nat the altar of nationalism, ethnicity, race, religion, and plain, old \nanarchic terrorism.\n   Over the short term--5 to 10 years--the United States faces \npotential threats in the Persian Gulf and the Korean Peninsula. Known \nand unknowable challengers loom more ominously on a 10-, 15-, and 20-\nyear time horizon. The danger of a revived, nationalistic Russia is \nclearly a possibility.\n   Russia is still armed to the teeth, and the latest intelligence \ntells us it is moving ahead with major modernization programs in its \nmost advanced weapons systems--submarines and aircraft. It is resource \nrich with a highly educated population. In the hands of a dictatorial \ngovernment, it could resume a threatening world role once again. That \nis America's worst nightmare and, as unlikely as it seems to us today, \nconsider how many unlikely changes have occurred in world history in \njust the last 5 years.\n   China is taking Russia seriously with a major modernization program \nfor its military forces--a program that could make China a superpower \nin the next century. In response to the buildup in China, India is \nquickly developing its military. And Japan, in the next century, may \nwell be forced to do the same. Other nations in the Asian rim have \ngrowing economies, are technologically advanced, and thus are capable \nof emerging as a threat to the stability of that region and to our \ninterests there.\n   Add terrorist groups, the proliferation of ballistic missile \ntechnology, radical fundamentalist movements, despotic regimes, and the \npotential proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons to \nthe list, and it is easy to see that the future is fraught with perils \nfor our Nation.\n\n\n                        The Technology Deterrent\n\n   Given those dangers, and given the fact that the United States is \nthe biggest target in sight, how can we best protect ourselves?\n   Thanks to the lessons of the gulf war, we know a big part of the \nanswer lies in our advanced military technology, which can deter or, if \nnecessary, defeat any challenger, whether it be a superpower, a rogue \nnation, or a terrorist group.\n   But we cannot rest on our gulf war laurels, content that today's \nweapons are enough to protect us for decades to come. Our next \nadversary, for example, may have access to detailed satellite \nphotographs, making a tactic like General Schwarzkopf's ``Hail Mary'' \nmovement of troops around Iraqi forces much more difficult. Or the \nenemy may possess missiles more capable than the Scud. The next gulf \nwar will be far different than the last.\n  [[Page S3447]]  Those Members of Congress bent on cutting technology \nprograms are repeating the error of so many former great powers: with \ntheir emphasis on readiness to the detriment of technological research \nand development, they are preparing to fight the last war all over \nagain, not preparing for the enemies and wars of the future.\n   Our best defense is to stay as far ahead of any possible challenger \nas possible. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. \nWilliam Owens, says we need a high technology umbrella to protect us \nfrom the enemies of our future just as the nuclear umbrella protected \nus in the recent past. The nuclear umbrella deters other nuclear \npowers, like Russia, from attacking us. But because we are unlikely to \nuse nuclear weapons against a nonnuclear nation, it is the high \ntechnology weapons in our arsenal that can keep them at bay, or defeat \nthem if they strike.\n\n\n                      The Battlefield of the Future\n\n   And if they strike, we can defeat them with our technologically \nadvanced forces because we are changing the fundamental concept of the \nbattlefield. The struggle for information is supplanting the fight for \ngeographical position as the key goal on the battlefield, and that is \nwhere we can enjoy a huge advantage. Army Chief of Staff Sullivan says \nthat the new battlefield will be a digitalized battlefield, one that \ncan lift the fog of war for commanders and infantry alike.\n   Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Shalikashvili and Admiral Owens are \ncontemplating the development of an electronic integrated system-of-\nsystems to give us dominant battlefield awareness where real-time \nintelligence will lead to virtually instantaneous response. No more \nlengthy Scud hunts. No more service computers that cannot talk to each \nother.\n   The digitalized battlefield will also allow for decentralization of \ncommand, giving officers on the scene much greater ability to make the \nright decisions in response to the rapidly changing events of battle.\n   And that is just one of a hundred different technology avenues we \nmust pursue. We are on the verge of a revolution in defense technology \nthat will dwarf the impact of the dreadnought, the airplane, the tank, \nand the missile--a revolution that will not occur to our advantage if \nwe fail to invest in military technology today. For innovation cannot \noccur on demand. It is a long-term process--yet a rapidly changing \nprocess as well. That means even a 1- or 2-year interruption in \nresearch and development funding will have terrible consequences down \nthe road. A year is a lifetime in the field of high technology.\n\n\n                            ARPA and Dual Use\n\n   Our current technological superiority has not evolved accidentally \nor overnight. The Department of Defense's secretive Advanced Research \nProjects Agency [ARPA], one of the least known, yet most important \noffices in the Pentagon, has been successfully promoting new technology \nfor the military for the 37 years since President Eisenhower set it up.\n   In retrospect, it was a truly visionary Presidential accomplishment, \nand it is probably no accident that Eisenhower, like Churchill, \napproached this issue of military technology as a man who knew what it \nwas like to order other men into battle. He knew this investment in \ntechnology would one day save lives--and it has.\n   What has ARPA done? Most of its efforts are classified, and it has \npurposely never recorded its history. But, by carefully investing in \nthe private sector like a high-technology Johnny Appleseed, ARPA has \nhelped bring about supercomputing, desktop computers, the internet--\nformerly ARPAnet--stealth technology, composites, a global positioning \nsystem, laser technology, high resolution imaging, advanced acoustics, \nsmart weapons, and even the ubiquitous computer mouse, which has \nburrowed its way into millions of American homes and offices.\n   What is most obvious about this list is the multitude of ways in \nwhich military technology has been adapted for civilian use. In fact, \ntechnology developed for the military has revolutionized the lives of \nall Americans--the way we work, the vehicles we drive, the homes we \nlive in. Technology that was designed to protect our way of life has \nevolved to transform our way of life. That is what the term ``dual \nuse'' is all about--the use of technology for military and civilian \npurposes.\n   But times are changing--tables are about to be turned. President \nEisenhower founded ARPA, but also warned that a military industrial \nbase could swallow our economy. The opposite is now occurring. The \ndefense technology base that was spawned by defense investment is now \nbeing swallowed by our civilian technology base.\n   For example, the computer was invented to help the military design a \nbetter way to mount an artillery attack, and it was improved when we \nneeded to target our missiles. The military funded the development of \ncomputers and became the biggest market for computers. But today the \nDepartment of Defense has but a fraction of the computer market.\n   For the first time in human history advances in technology are \noccurring far more rapidly in the civilian sector than in the military. \nIn a sense, we have gone from beating swords into plowshares to \ncreating the plowshares first. Part of the reason is the widespread \ndissemination of technology among the population. The demand for new \nand better appliances, cars, and entertainment systems is enormous \ncompared to the demand for better jets, tanks, and ships. The existence \nof that demand opens the door for cooperation between government and \nindustry when a technology is of interest to the military and civilian \nmarkets.\n   Government dollars can be leveraged by private investment to produce \nmore than could otherwise be accomplished under the auspices of the \ndefense spending alone. In other words, potential civilian applications \nfor military technology creates a multiplier effect on every Federal \ndollar we invest. Economies of scale then drive down the cost of the \nproduct and the contributing technology. The bottom line is this: Dual \nuse literally gives us more bang for our buck. It is a genuine win- win \nsituation--a win for our economy and for the defense of our country.\n   Perhaps most important: if our Government fails to use some of its \ndefense spending to promote private sector technological development, \nthe momentum of change in the design of the tools of war stalls and \nshifts elsewhere, and we risk losing new advances to the defense \nestablishments of other nations, nations whose interests might be \ninimical to our own.\n   For the question is never, ``Will we be able to invent new weapons \nof war?'' The question is, ``Who will invent the new weapons of war?'' \nIf we cut back on technological investment, such as is happening in \nCongress today, we will not always be able to answer that question with \nthe words, ``Made in the U.S.A.''\n   This state of affairs can be summarized in three points:\n  First, the Defense Department must be involved in the exploding \ncivilian technology world to meet its military technology needs.\n  Second, the United States, for military and economic reasons, must \nhave the goal of maintaining the American advantage in civilian \ntechnology markets.\n  Third, collaboration between the civilian and military technology \nsectors can work because the applications for civilian and military use \nare easily transferable.\n\n\n                  The Technology Programs at Issue: TRP\n\n   The technology reinvestment project [TRP] has been the first victim \nof the technology disarmament now underway in the House and the Senate. \nDeveloped by ARPA during the Bush administration, TRP investments are \ncost shared at least 50-50 with industry, competitively selected, \nindustry-led and aimed at meeting civilian and military needs.\n   A brief review of current TRP investments gives us a clear idea of \nhow important they are to our national security:\n   Head mounted displays: Infantrymen cannot walk around with desktop \ncomputers. With lightweight, head-mounted displays they can retain full \nmobility but have a full computer display of the battlefield and \nrealtime intelligence and targeting data before their eyes. If you saw \nthe movie ``Aliens,'' you know what I am talking about. But this is an \nalien concept only if we cut \n[[Page S3448]] off funding and allow another nation to pick up the ball \nwe drop.\n   Uncooled infrared sensors: Desert Storm was launched as a night \nattack using infrared sensors as the basis for high-speed-attack \noperations. Our military needs to own the night and a new generation of \ncheaper, much more portable uncooled infrared sensors are an enabling \ntechnology being developed by a TRP team that will give us even greater \ncontrol of the nighttime battlefield than ever before.\n   Item: Advanced information flow: Military command and control must \nprocess an exploding amount of intelligence data immediately to the \nbattlefield for response. But limited communications capacity now clogs \nour ability to transmit, process, and act on that data. A TRP team is \ndeveloping digital communications command and control equipment to \nburst massive new amounts of data through the interpretation and \nresponse pipeline at 10 gigabits per second, a 400-percent improvement \nover today's best equipment. That could mean the difference between \nlife and death, victory and defeat on the battlefield.\n   Item: Single chip motion detectors: By reducing motion detection to \na single chip accelerometer which can withstand accelerations up to \n30,000 times the force of gravity, weapons guidance and navigation \nsystems can be made significantly lighter and more sensitive. This will \nlead us, for example, to newer, more advanced versions of the cruise \nmissiles and smart weapons that were so important to us in the gulf \nwar.\n   Item: Autonomous all-weather aircraft landing: The efficiency of \nmilitary aircraft is still limited by night and weather conditions. \nOperations at secondary fields are curtailed in these conditions if a \nfull ground control system is absent, or if these facilities are \ndisrupted or damaged. Basing aircraft at a small number of primary \nbases is not a good alternative because our command of the air becomes \nmore vulnerable. A TRP team is working on placing all-weather air \ntraffic and landing control systems into every cockpit, making aircraft \nindependent of ground control availability and weather conditions.\n   Item: Turboalternator: Army gas-guzzling battle vehicles require a \nvast and vulnerable logistics chain and limit battlefield operations. \nThe next war may not be fought next to Saudi oil refineries. A TRP team \nis developing a turboalternator so main engines can be switched off but \nall equipment and sensors can continue to operate during silent watch \nmodes. This multiplies fuel efficiency and also makes detection through \ninfrared emissions and engine noise much more difficult.\n   Item: Composite bridging: Military operations continue to be \ncontrolled by terrain: every stream or ravine that must be crossed \ncreates a potential strong point for enemy defenders and disrupts the \nmobility that gives U.S. forces much of their edge. Every time our \nengineer forces have to bring up cumbersome, heavy bridging equipment \nfor a crossing, enemy defenders can rally and our mobility is \ndisrupted. A TRP team is developing superlight, superstrong composites \nfor portable bridges to multiply the mobility of our battlefield \nforces.\n   Item: Precision laser manufacturing: Precision laser machining \ntechnology, by making aircraft parts microscopically precise, can make \naircraft engines much more efficient. A TRP team, working with higher \npower density, more focused laser beams, and variable pulse formats, \naims to double the life of military aircraft engines and sharply \nimprove fuel efficiency and therefore range. Other beneficiaries \ninclude shipbuilders, airframe makers, engine makers, and a wide range \nof manufacturing technologies.\n   These are some of the new technologies we need for future \nbattlefield dominance. And with a little imagination, we can envision \neven more revolutionary developments. Imagine a tiny helicopterlike \ndevice equipped with video cameras, flown by the dozens behind enemy \nlines, stealthily hovering throughout enemy territory, identifying the \nspecific location of artillery, sniper nests, tanks, and serve as a \nguide for smart bombs launched from far away.\n   Imagine a sublaunched, fast-moving robot that can find and \nneutralize enemy mines at sea, safeguarding and speeding up the \nmovement of our Navy.\n   Imagine lightweight, full body armor to make soldiers virtually \ninvulnerable to small arms fire, dramatically improving our ability to \ncontrol urban environments.\n   Such is the stuff of science fiction today, but like Leonardo Da \nVinci and H.G. Wells, we need to realize that what is today's fiction \ncan be tomorrow's fact. In fact, some Defense Department programs are \nlooking into aspects of the exotic technologies I just described.\n   We must admit to ourselves we are no longer in the age of the \nbackyard tinkerer when it comes to high technology weapons of war. No \nmore Wright Brothers working out of a garage. The new weapons will come \nonly after substantial investment by the Government and private \nindustry, working together to safeguard the economy and security of our \nNation's future.\n   That is why the drastic cuts in or cancellation of TRP, ATP, and \nother technology programs is akin to marching onto a field of battle \nand stripping our soldiers of their weapons. The survival of the \nsoldiers of our future--soldiers to be drawn from the ranks of our \nchildren and grandchildren--depends on the development of technologies \nto help them control the battlefields of our future.\n   Failure to develop those technologies can only provide comfort to \nfuture enemies.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n   The movement to slash defense technology is being led by the \n``techno-nothings.'' When it comes to the complex interaction between \nGovernment and the private sector in technological research and \ndevelopment, the techno-nothings do not understand the lessons of \nhistory and they do not see the perils and opportunities in our future.\n   They cannot see or touch a weapon of the future and so they cannot \njustify spending money to develop it. They say they do not like \nGovernment picking winners and losers, but they do not understand that \nwe need to have Government and business work together, sharing costs \nand talent, to bring about the defense and civilian technologies our \ncitizens will want and need in the future.\n   It is a good thing that our predecessors in this Capitol building \ndid not have to see a jet fighter before investing in its development, \nand did not decide to wait until the private sector invented it on its \nown.\n   They did not have to see or even understand the atomic bomb before \nspending millions on its creation, and did not decide to wait until \nscientists built one on their own.\n   They did not have to see and touch cruise missiles, Patriot \nmissiles, stealth fighters, radar, lasers, and the whole panoply of \nweapons we now possess before allocating resources to their research \nand development.\n   We owe our survival to their foresight. Will we lose our liberty to \nmyopia?\n   There is, I admit, not much of a constituency fighting for these \nprograms, because we are dealing with the future, not the present. That \nmakes investment in military technology a hard sell; not to the private \nsector, which wants the partnership, but to those political forces that \ncannot see much beyond the next election.\n   We need to go about the business of creating technological change \nthe way some of our ancestors created the great pyramids, cathedrals, \nand other monumental architectural triumphs of the past: They started \nthose works knowing they would not survive to see them finished, but \npressed on with the knowledge that generations yet to come would \nappreciate what they did.\n   We must press on with such knowledge ourselves, lest we be, as \nChurchill said, ``absolutely wrong in relation to the deep tides of \ndestiny.'' Those tides are now tides of technological change and it is \nour destiny--our duty--to recognize there can be no turning back.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader is \nrecognized under the previous order.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President.\n              [[Page S3449]] THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin this morning by going back \nto the debate yesterday and making a couple of remarks with regard to \nthose who spent the better part of an entire month on the floor \ndebating this issue.\n  The manager on the Republican side, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, was a gentleman. He did an outstanding job and gave everyone the \nopportunity to be heard, and to discuss the issue, in a way that I \nthink fits the Senate. It was, as the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia said yesterday, a very good debate, a rigorous debate, a \nbruising debate in many cases but, certainly, one that afforded \neveryone the opportunity to be heard, to present their case, to make \ntheir positions well known. That was due in no small measure to the \nmanner in which the distinguished Senator from Utah managed the \nlegislation the entire time that it was pending on the floor.\n  Let me also commend the distinguished senior Senator from Illinois \nfor his tenacious approach to the debate, and also for conducting \nhimself in a very admirable way. I know that often, as take our \npositions, we sometimes allow our own personal views to mask what in \nother ways would be a very legitimate discussion of issues. Certainly, \nthe Senator from Illinois, as he conducted himself throughout this \ndebate, did not allow whatever personal views he may hold with regard \nto the positions taken by other Senators to distract him from \nconducting himself in a way that I thought was extraordinary.\n  Certainly, the Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], and his leadership on \nthis issue was also extraordinarily commendable.\n  I hope that as we take on these issues, as difficult and as fractious \nas they become sometimes, we can maintain civility, and that we can \nfind ways with which to disagree without being disagreeable. I know \nthere are a lot of strongly held views and a lot of temptation \nsometimes to get personal, to be negative. But I think that the course \nof this debate was one of our better moments. It was an opportunity for \nus to debate the issues in a meaningful way, without getting personal, \nbeing negative, and without distracting from what is our real purpose \nin being here.\n  Mr. President, the vote we took yesterday may not be the last on the \nconstitutional amendment. The majority leader has indicated, as is his \nright, he is going to raise the issue again at some later date. \nRegardless of when that time may come, I think the real question now \nis: Can we as Democrats and Republicans work together? Can we find a \nway with which to put aside our differences on an amendment itself and \ncommit ourselves to doing what we say we must do? We need to recognize \nthat the clock is ticking, and to recognize that without some \ndetermination to take responsibility, to set forth a glidepath, we will \nbe right back where we were a month ago, with no real progress, with no \nreal substantive demonstration of our determination to resolve this \nmatter 1 year from now, 2 years from now, or 3 years from now.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is very important that we recognize \nthat the clock is ticking. We have 43 days, by law--43 days by law--to \nproduce a budget resolution. We did that last year. We hope very much \nthat we can do it again this year. It is tough. And for those who say \nwe do not need a constitutional amendment to do the job, I think it is \nall the more important that we demonstrate that we can; that we are up \nto the task; that we can meet our responsibilities to make it happen \ncorrectly, to make it happen in the way that was foreseen when we \npassed the laws setting up this budget process.\n  So within the next 43 days, we hope that a majority will come forth, \nand that we can work together to produce what we have called for on \nmany occasions, a glidepath to a date certain, a time within which we \nwill reduce the deficit to zero, a time within which we can be assured \nthat indeed we are going to take the reins of responsibility and \nproduce a balanced budget.\n  When that happens, we can look back with some pride at the way in \nwhich this whole effort was undertaken. I hope also that we will abide \nby the law passed some time ago that stipulates that we do so without \nthe Social Security trust funds. That is the law. We are required \nalready to keep Social Security off-budget. So that ought to be our \ntask. That ought to be the responsibility that we all grasp now as \nRepublicans and Democrats. Pro-balanced-budget amendment supporters and \nthose who oppose it must recognize that we have a timeframe within \nwhich we must produce, a timeframe that is a little more than a month \nlong, which requires us, by law, to set out a budget resolution that \nprovides the glidepath that we all say we want.\n  Let us make it a time certain. I am not wedded to a specific date \ntoday. But I would agree to a time certain, a time within which we can, \nwith some confidence, look to a decline of the deficit to the point \nwhere we can say with authority that we have taken Social Security out \nof the calculation, as the law requires; we have reduced the deficit \nannually, building on the 3-year record we have set out now, and we \nhave done it within the timeframe that the law requires.\n  I think the American people would look at this Congress in a very \ndifferent way. I think they would look at us with a great deal of \nadmiration if we said we are going to do what we all say we want to do. \nCertainly, this is the time to prove it. This is an opportunity for us \nto demonstrate real responsibility. It is an opportunity for us to \ndemonstrate real bipartisanship. It is an opportunity for us to set \npolitics aside and say this is our task, and there can be no more \nimportant responsibility. We are going to do it and do it in a way that \nwe all can feel proud.\n  So I sincerely hope, Mr. President, that everyone will accept that \ntask, and that everyone will take this responsibility seriously. I \nthink the majority is going to live up to their commitment. I am sure \nthey will produce a resolution. I hope they will produce that \nresolution in the time the law requires.\n  So our purpose in coming to the floor this morning is to say that the \nbalanced budget amendment debate, for now, is behind us. It is over. \nLet us get on with the real work of doing the job, doing what we say we \nare going to do. Let us get on with making sure that we do not miss \nthis opportunity. Let us get on with trying to do what we all have \nprofessed is the most important thing we can do, and that is set out \nthe glidepath to a balanced Federal budget at a time certain. That time \ncertain is in the next 43 days.\n  Mr. President, I know of several of my colleagues that have come to \nthe floor also to express themselves on this issue. I will yield \nwhatever time he may require to the Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year, I offered a balanced budget \namendment which excluded Social Security from the budget. When this \nbody again considered a balanced budget amendment 4 or 5 weeks ago I \noffered an amendment that excluded Social Security. After it was \ndefeated, I worked with others to ensure the Social Security trust \nfunds would not be looted to reduce the deficit. Of course, we know the \nresult of the vote yesterday. But, Mr. President, I feel no jubilation. \nI do not feel a sense of victory as a result of having my amendment \nbeing one of the principal--if not the principal--reason the balanced \nbudget amendment failed.\n  But, in fact, the day after the vote, I feel a sense of hope, perhaps \neven anticipation, that the debate that has taken place in this body \nover the past several weeks has established at least two things in my \nmind. No. 1 is that the accumulating debt this country has is serious. \nNo. 2, the American people recognize the seriousness of that debt, but \nthey do not want to balance the budget using Social Security trust fund \nmoneys.\n  We have heard several times on this floor that 80 percent of the \nAmerican people support a balanced budget amendment. That is true. If \nyou ask that same group of people, ``Do you support a balanced budget \namendment using Social Security to achieve a balanced budget?'' only \nabout 32 percent of those people say yes. In fact, most of the polls \nshow a number slightly lower than that.\n  Mr. President, what was the debate on this floor about as relating to \nSocial Security? Well, we established quite clearly that Social \nSecurity has not contributed one penny to the huge \n[[Page S3450]] deficits that this country is accumulating--not a penny. \nWe further established, without any refutation, that Social Security is \nnot a welfare program. Social Security, quite to the contrary, is a \nself-financing program where a person's employer pays 6.2 percent of \ntheir wages into a fund--we call it a trust fund--and the individual, \nthe employee, pays 6.2 percent of their wages into a fund. That is to \nbe accumulated during their working life, so that when they retire, \nthey will have a retirement income. The average around the country is \n$640 a month. That is not a lot, but certainly, for an individual, it \nis a difference between despair and the ability to live a decent life.\n  Mr. President, the issue now before us is to continue on a path of \ndeficit reduction until we get to balance. I want to show this body the \nfact that while we have not done a wonderful job, we have done a pretty \ngood job, and we have to do a lot better, recognizing that this will be \nthe third year in a row that we have had a decline in the deficit, the \nfirst time in 50 years.\n  We also recognize, Mr. President, that we have also had the lowest \nunemployment and the lowest inflation in 50 years, the highest economic \ngrowth since LBJ. And we have 120,000 fewer Federal employees than we \nhad 2 years and 2 months ago. We can do a lot better. But what if we \nhad not adopted the Democratic deficit-reduction plan? What would we \nhave had we not done that?\n  Well, Mr. President, this chart shows clearly what would have \nhappened. As a result of the deficit-reduction plan that worked, we \nhave had a declining deficit. It has not declined nearly enough, but a \ndeclining deficit. It levels off and this is, as seen on these lines at \nthe bottom of this chart, what happened as a result of the hard choices \nwe made.\n  Mr. President, I do not think it is wrong to mention to the American \npublic that we did not receive a single Republican vote to bring this \ndeficit down.\n  In fact, had we not adopted the tough program that we did, the \ndeficit would have been huge. This is what would have happened had the \nRepublicans prevailed, had the Republicans' deficit-reduction plan been \nadopted. It would not have been a deficit-reduction plan, it would have \nbeen a deficit increase. This red line shows what would have happened. \nAnd beginning next year, the budget we are adopting now, you can see \nwhere it would have skyrocketed.\n  So, Mr. President, we have not completely dropped the ball. We have \ndone some good things and the economy now is in good shape. The \nquestion is: Can we learn from our experiences? Can we learn from the \ndebate that has taken place on the Senate floor these past few weeks? I \nhope so.\n  I know, speaking from my perspective, I think the debate has been \nconstructive. I join in what the minority leader, the Democratic \nleader, has said. I think the majority has allowed us to have a full \ndebate on this issue. I commend and I applaud the senior Senator from \nKansas, the majority leader of the Senate. I think he has really done a \ngood job of moving this legislation through this body. I believe it has \nbeen a good debate. It is one that I hope we can learn from as we look \nto the future.\n  I look forward to seeing what budget is going to come from the \nleadership of Senator Domenici and Senator Exon. These are two \nexperienced legislators. I have not had the opportunity--I know that \nthe senior Senator from New Mexico has had a death in his family and I \nknow he has a lot on his mind. But I know that his experience, together \nwith Senator Exon, to whom I have spoken, is going to bring out a \nbudget, that will take into consideration what has been debated on this \nfloor; namely, that we need to bring the deficit down and we cannot and \nwe should not use Social Security to bring the deficit down.\n  Mr. President, I am willing to work with my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. I agree with my colleagues, we should have a \nbalanced budget. But, Mr. President, we can do that. Even though the \nbalanced budget amendment did not pass, we can still do that.\n  Section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act says that you are not \nsupposed to use Social Security. We should follow this law. Our numbers \nmay not look as good as we would like them in the newspapers, but we \ncould and we should have a balanced budget amendment. So, Mr. \nPresident, I repeat, our deficit is too big, but we also should not \nraid Social Security and try to justify using those moneys. I see my \nfriend from North Dakota. My understanding is that the leader wanted to \nyield time to the Senator from North Dakota under the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield time to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President I thank the minority leader.\n\n\n             Constitutional Amendment to Balance the Budget\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday, of course, we voted on a major \nproposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget. That was a \nvote that was difficult for a number of Members of the Senate. Most \nunderstood it was a very significant, serious issue, and a great deal \nof emotion existed on both sides. It was not an easy vote, I expect, \nfor virtually anyone. And I suppose there are some ruptured feelings \nand relationships, at least momentarily, about some of these issues.\n  But I was thinking about it last evening. In the middle of the debate \nthat we had for some weeks over the question of whether we should amend \nthe Constitution, a news item appeared one morning about America's \ntrade deficit. That news item disclosed that in the last year, when \nfigures for December were released and we had a full year's picture of \nAmerica's trade deficit, that we had the largest merchandise trade \ndeficit in the history of the world. The United States was running the \nlargest trade deficit in the history of humankind. We had gone, in a \nfew years--15 years--from being the largest creditor or the biggest \nbanker as a country to now the largest debtor in the world.\n  I thought about that in the context of the fractious debate on the \nissue of balancing the budget by a constitutional amendment. Because, \nwith respect to international trade and the question of how we as a \ncountry do, we are a team, all of us. The entire country's future is at \nstake. Our jobs are at stake, opportunities for our children are at \nstake. And it is an international competition that we must win. There \nought not be anyone in the congressional branch of Government that does \nnot understand that we are on this team together and that we need \npolicies that allow this team to win.\n  Well, then we come to domestic policies, including provisions that \nwould require a change in the Constitution. And what is a team, or what \nshould be a team, because we are all on the same side, in international \ncompetition in who will have the jobs, who will have the expansion, \nwhere will be the opportunity and that then breaks down into a debate \nin our Chamber. And, of course, what happens in the process of trying \nto make decisions about this, emotions run high and sometimes we have \nvery fractious debates. There are, it seems to me, no winners and no \nlosers in these kinds of debates. Certainly, when you are dealing with \na question of whether or how to change the U.S. Constitution one would \nexpect people to feel very strongly about their points of view.\n  I want to add to the comments by the Senator from South Dakota and \nSenator Reid and others that I have the greatest respect for Senator \nHatch and Senator Simon. I think both of them did an extraordinary job. \nI have great respect for their point of view.\n  My own view is that there is a right way and a wrong way to change \nthe Constitution. I feel very strongly that the question of how you \ncount receipts in the Constitution is very important to the future of \nthe Social Security system. Because the future of the Social Security \nsystem will not be a future that guarantees benefits to Americans who \ndeserve them and who are entitled to them unless we preserve the funds \nin the trust funds. And that \n[[Page S3451]] would not have been the case under this amendment.\n  If that had been changed, it would have passed yesterday with 75 \nvotes. So there is no joy in that vote. And the message in that vote is \nnot that the U.S. Senate does not want a balanced budget amendment. If \nthat amendment had been changed, the message would have been 75--\nprobably more, maybe 80 votes--in favor of a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget provided there was a guarantee that trust funds \nof Social Security be protected.\n  I noted that in the Washington Post this morning they editorialized \nabout this Social Security issue and said it is not an issue, because \nthe fact is Social Security is now one-fourth of all spending for other \nthan interest on the debt and that the deficit cannot be reduced \nwithout it.\n  I do not agree with that. If someone believes we should reduce the \nFederal deficit by cutting Social Security benefits, they would have a \nresponsibility to cut Social Security taxes because the only purpose \nfor which that tax is collected is to put it in a trust fund to be used \nfor only one program, and that is Social Security.\n  I think the Washington Post is all wet. I am surprised to see the \neditorial. Everybody has a right to think as they think. I just \ndisagree with them.\n  Now, the question of Social Security that we have discussed at some \nlength I hope could still be resolved. If we could resolve that, that \nconstitutional amendment can be brought back and will pass by a very \nsignificant margin.\n  I was probably 14 years old when I got a driver's license to drive my \nfather's pickup truck, and my way of making some money during high \nschool was to haul garbage. I would pick up the 50-gallon drums that \nhad been opened at the top, used oil drums that the widows in my \nhometown of 300 people used to put their trash in and burn their trash.\n  At the end of a week or two, their 50-gallon drums would be full of \nburnt trash, and somebody would have to haul it to the dump ground in \nmy small town. I borrowed my dad's pickup truck. When I was 14, I had a \ngarbage route. I picked up the drums and hauled the trash to the dump \nground for half a dozen widows in my hometown. That is the way I earned \na few dollars and got along in high school.\n  All of those widows in my hometown whom I was doing a little work \nfor--virtually all of them--lived on Social Security. That is about all \nthey had. The difference between them, then, and those who preceded \nthem 30 or 40 years prior to that, was that they reached that stage in \nlife where they were in their seventies or eighties, some in their \nearly nineties, and they had Social Security checks.\n  It was the difference between being impoverished at age 80 with \nnothing to live on, or having a little something to give you a decent \nlife and give you an opportunity. That is what Social Security meant to \nthem.\n  I saw it when I was a kid. That is why the Social Security system is \nstill important to me. I think it is the crown jewel of achievement in \nthe last 60 or 70 years in this country for us to have constructed \nsomething that works the way this works, to give an opportunity during \none's retirement years to draw on a stream of income that one \ncontributed to during one's working years.\n  We face challenges with Social Security, but the wrong way to \napproach those challenges is to say to somebody, ``You can take what is \nbuilt up in the trust fund or what we intend to build up in the trust \nfund to save for the future, and use it to balance the Federal \ndeficit.'' It is the wrong thing to do. I know the amendment might be \npopular, but there is a difference between right and wrong.\n  It seems to me here, notwithstanding the strong winds, you need to be \nprepared to stand and fight for what is right. I respect everyone's \nviews. Those who oppose me on this or dozens of other issues will not \nhear me denigrating the way they do business or the way they think. \nThere is great room for disagreement. I have enormous respect for those \nwho do disagree, but I also hope they will accord similar respect to \nthe kind of debate that we have had.\n  I think that we have a country in which people look at the \ncongressional branch of Government these days and they say, ``You know, \nI kind of wish they could just make progress and get things done.'' And \nthey probably know that there are many Members inside the institution \nwho feel the same way. We understand what the problems are.\n  Let Members find a way to coalesce to solve the problems. There is no \nreason that on the issue of a balanced budget, we cannot follow on from \nwhat we did in 1993. Yes, I voted for the Deficit Reduction Act of \n1993. That was enormously controversial. But I am glad I voted for it. \nIt was the right thing, and it is still the right thing to have done, \nbecause It reduced the Federal budget deficit. I am glad I did that. I \nam prepared to do more.\n  I hope there are many people on both sides of the aisle during the \nbudget and appropriations process who will join hands together in a \nbipartisan way. We are prepared to march up the hill. We do not need a \nconstitutional amendment to do that. No one needs a constitutional \namendment to build the steps to a balanced budget. Those are decisions \nof taxing and spending that are made individually, day after day, on \nappropriations bills and on the budget bill.\n  I guess my point today is to say there were conditions under which I \nwas fully prepared to vote for this, and I described what those \nconditions were. They were not able to be met, I guess. I was not able \nto vote for it. That does not mean that we should not march together \ntoward a balanced budget. Of course, we should. And we ought to start \nimmediately. Some of us started in 1993. And we are pleased we did. \nSome who decided to vote for that paid a very heavy price for it. But \nit was a vote well worth taking as far as I was concerned.\n  Now, the next question for all Members is, what are the subsequent \nvotes by which we can, together, begin to climb those stairs and make \nprogress toward balancing this country's budget, and not just balancing \nthe budget, but starting at some point to pay off the debt.\n  We need to create investment in this country. We need to create \ninvestment and growth opportunity. I started by talking about the trade \ndeficit, because ultimately we are involved in world competition for \nthe future. There will be winners and losers. I do not want this \ncountry to be a loser in the international competition. I want this \ncountry to win, because winners will be assigned new jobs, expansion \nopportunities, and hope, and losers will have the British disease of \nlong, slow economic decay because they believe what is important is \nconsumption, not production. That is another discussion for another \ntime.\n  I fervently hope that all Members can understand we wear the same \njersey. We are on the same team. In international competition, we are \nfighting the same fight for the future of this country. The answer--\nshould we balance this budget and should we start paying off the debt--\nis clearly yes, notwithstanding what constitutional amendment might or \nmight not be debated or discussed now or at any time in the future. The \nanswer is yes, that is our job. The sooner that we get that job done, \nthe better it is for the American people and for our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a happy day for my State of \nFlorida. One hundred and fifty years ago today, March 3, 1845, \nPresident John Tyler signed legislation which this Senate had passed 2 \ndays earlier making Florida the 27th State to join the Union.\n  I am pleased to stand on the Senate floor today and express my \nappreciation to America for having accepted our State as a member of \nthe United States and for the benefits that Florida has gained by that \nmembership.\n  Florida has a long history that predates its period of statehood. In \nfact, Florida was the first point in North America to be discovered by \nEuropeans when Ponce de Leon came upon the coast of Florida near what \nis now St. \n[[Page S3452]] Augustine at Easter time in 1513. He spent a brief \nperiod of time in the State, enough to declare it the fountain of \nyouth. In Florida, he looked for a place where one could bathe himself \nand receive eternal youth.\n  Not much longer, 1565, another Spaniard, Pedro Menendez de Aviles, \nestablished the first European city in North America in the location \nthat is currently St. Augustine.\n  Florida had a tumultuous history during its prestatehood/\npreterritorial days. In the 18th century, Florida was peripherally \ninvolved in what was called the French and Indian War in North America. \nFlorida was also involved in the Seven Years' War in Europe, at the \nconclusion of which, in 1763, the British Navy occupied Havana Harbor.\n  At the Treaty of Paris in 1763, the Spanish were given a choice. They \ncould either have the British remove their navy from Havana or they \ncould retain ownership of east Florida and west Florida--west Florida \nbeing the extension of the State from the Apalachicola River to the \nMississippi River.\n  The majority whip, who joins me on the floor today, should take pride \nin this discussion of Florida. For almost 300 years, the southern part \nof Mississippi was part of the territory of Florida.\n  The Spanish decided that they would prefer to keep Havana. So the \nFloridas were transferred to Great Britain.\n  Florida stayed a British territory throughout the period of the \nAmerican Revolution. At the end of the American Revolution in 1784, the \nSpanish had occupied Nassau, and the British received the same type of \noffer that they had made 21 years earlier: Would they prefer to have \nNassau or the Floridas?\n  The British decided they would prefer to have Nassau, and the \nFloridas reverted back to Spanish control. Floridians had to have a \nfairly high threshold to deal with rejection in the 18th century.\n  But by 1819, the citizens of Florida had decided that their future \nwas not with a European colonial power but was with the United States. \nThat decision was sealed in 1819. In 1821 Florida became a territory of \nthe United States of America and the two parts of Florida were combined \ninto a single territory. Tallahassee was selected by its first \nterritorial Governor, Gen. Andrew Jackson, to be the capital of the \nterritory of Florida.\n  In 1845, Florida's territory had matured, and the United States was \nprepared to extend full statehood to Florida. Today, we celebrate the \n150th anniversary of that statehood.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly comment on some of the changes \nthat have occurred in the 150 years since Florida joined the Union. It \nis said that the one constant in Florida is change. If you do not like \nsomething about the State today, just wait a while because it will \ncertainly be different tomorrow. That has certainly characterized our \nState during the last 150 years.\n  Maybe the most dramatic statement of that change is the sheer \ndemographic size of Florida. When Florida entered the Union 150 years \nago today, it was the smallest State in the Union with a population of \napproximately 55,000. Today, it is the fourth largest State with a \npopulation that now exceeds 14 million. Florida is projected to have a \npopulation of over 19 million by the year 2020 and by the middle of the \nnext century to have a population approaching 40 million.\n  Florida in 1845 was a State very much on the periphery of the United \nStates of America. It was a long way from almost anyplace in the \ncountry to Florida. And it was a long way from any one point in Florida \nto another. Legislators who represented the Florida Keys, in order to \nget to Tallahassee, had to take a boat to Philadelphia and then a train \nback to Thomasville, GA, from which they would take a carriage drive to \nget to Tallahassee.\n  Florida was remote. It was largely cut off from the mainstream of \nAmerican life in 1845. Today, Florida has become, in many ways, the \nlinchpin of our emerging relationships within the hemisphere. Florida \nhas become a central point for trade and commerce and cultural \nexchange, not only within the United States but particularly between \nNorth America, the Caribbean, and Latin America.\n  Florida has become a State which is living in the future that will be \nall America's in the 21st century. The population of our citizens now, \nparticularly the almost 19 percent over the age of 65, reflects what \nthe rest of America's population will be by the end of the first \nquarter of the 21st century.\n  Florida is leading in technology and arts and culture. It has become \na predictor of national trends. In 1845, Florida was a very homogeneous \nState. Most of our citizens had very similar backgrounds. Today Florida \nis one of the most diverse States in the Nation.\n  The list of countries from which schoolchildren and the largest \npublic systems in Florida is virtually a list of the nations of the \nworld. Florida is a State which has become, as some describe it, the \n``big paella'' of America. It is the place in which people from all \naround the world now live in large numbers. They are becoming \ncontributing members to our State and our Nation, but also with a \nfierce pride in their native culture.\n  Florida is becoming a model of the kind of cultural diversity that \nbenefits America. It was with great pride in December of last year that \nFlorida had the privilege of hosting the Summit of the Americas, the \nfirst gathering in a quarter of a century of the heads of government of \nthe Western Hemisphere. The summit was the first time in which all of \nthose present were democratically elected heads of government. The \nsummit is illustrative of the centrality of Florida in the new \nrelationship within our hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, Florida is helping the United States in establishing \nthis relationship with the other Americas, but maybe Florida's greatest \nrole for the 21st century will be as a model of how persons from \ndifferent cultural backgrounds, different ethnic, racial, and religious \nbackgrounds can live together in peace.\n  It has been suggested that the challenge of the 21st century will be \nthe challenge of whether Bosnia is our collective future. Will we live \nin a world in which people who are different than their neighbors will \nfind it impossible to live a life of dignity, respect, and peace?\n  While our State has not been immune from some of the abrasions of \ncultural diversity, we are proud of the degree to which we are building \na society from a diverse community.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a happy and celebratory day for our State \nof Florida. It comes, I hope, as an event which might serve to assuage \nsome of the contention that was felt here yesterday and maybe \nreverberates today. One hundred fifty years is a short time in the \nhistory of the planet but a long time in the political history of this \nNation. It illustrates the good decisions that were made in this \nChamber on March 1, 1845, when the Senate of the 54th Congress had the \nwisdom to enact the legislation that would create the 27th State of the \nNation. Our challenge today is to create a record that Americans will \nlook back on 150 years from now with pride.\n  So we thank America for allowing us to join the United States of \nAmerica. We are proud of what we have contributed. We are pleased to be \na full member of this greatest Nation in the history of the world. \nThank you.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell).

Mr. President, I had the honor earlier this morning of \nannouncing that Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, of Colorado, would be \njoining the Republican ranks in the Senate. And, again, I want to \nextend a welcome to him and say how proud I am of him for his \nconviction and his courage.\n  I am satisfied that his voting pattern will remain the same. He has \nthings he feels very strongly about. He does worry about where we are \nheaded with deficit spending in this country. He is \n[[Page S3453]] concerned about the Federal Government's abuse of public \nlands. He is concerned about private property rights. He has an \noutstanding record, one that I have observed for, I guess, 10 years \nnow, having served in the House of Representatives with him back in the \nmidsixties and now having watched him in the Senate for the past 2 \nyears. He is going to be an outstanding addition to the party. It is an \nhonor to the Republican Party to have him join us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his resume be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the resume was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Democrat, of Ignacio, CO; born in \n     Auburn, CA, on April 13, 1933; attended New England Mills \n     Grammar School, Weimar, CA; attended Placer High School, \n     Auburn, CA, 1951; quit high school to join Air Force (where \n     he got his GED); in 1991 attended Placer High School`s \n     graduation exercises and received a diploma; B.A., San Jose \n     State, 1957; attended Meiji University in Toyko, Japan, as \n     special research student, 1960-64; served in U.S. Air Force \n     in Korea, airman second class, 1951-53; jewelry designer who \n     has won more than 200 first-place and best-of-show awards; \n     rancher who raised, trained, and showed horses; All-American \n     in judo, captained the U.S. Olympic Judo Team, 1965; won the \n     gold medal in the Pan-American Games of 1963; elected to \n     Colorado State Legislature in 1982, serving 1983-86 on the \n     agriculture and Natural Affairs and Business and Labor \n     Committees; appointed adviser to the Colorado Commission on \n     International Trade and Colorado Commission on the Arts and \n     Humanities; voted by colleagues one of ``Ten Best \n     Legislators'' in the Denver Post-News Center 4 survey, 1984; \n     ``1984 Outstanding Legislator'' award from Colorado Bankers \n     Association; inducted into the Council of 44 Chiefs, Northern \n     Cheyenne Indian Tribe; member of Durango Chamber of Commerce, \n     American Quarter Horse Association, American Paint Horse \n     Association, American Brangus Association, American Indian \n     Education Association, Colorado Pilots Association, Aircraft \n     Owners and Pilot Association, senior technical adviser, U.S. \n     Judo Association; married July 23, 1966, to Linda Price; two \n     children: Colin, and Shanan; elected to the 100th Congress, \n     November 4, 1986; reelected to each succeeding Congress; \n     appointed to Committees on Agriculture, Interior and Insular \n     Affairs, and Small Business; elected to the Senate on \n     November 3, 1992 for the 6-year term beginning January 3, \n     1993.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, if I could move on to another subject, I \nlistened with a great deal of interest this morning to the \ndistinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle, of South Dakota, and I \nthink maybe his remarks will help to begin to get things back on the \nright track. The past few days have been very difficult here in the \nSenate. Some things, perhaps harsh things, have been said here on the \nfloor of the Senate and in the public arena, and I think we have to \nstop and take stock of how much damage was done by the debate and all \nthat went on during the discussion on the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I agree that we need a bipartisan effort to achieve a balanced \nbudget, and in fact if we had the will, we could achieve a balanced \nbudget without a constitutional amendment. But I have been in this city \nfor 26 years, as a staff member, as a House Member, and as a Senator, \nand it has not been happening. I do not believe it will happen without \na constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. I think we need \nthe additional leverage.\n  However, we took the vote. We were one vote shy. Any one of 34 \nSenators could have passed that constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget and send it to the American people for their legislatures to \nvote on that amendment. It did not happen. But we should go forward. We \nshould set a process in motion that would lead to deficit reduction \nthis year and next year. We cannot have a situation where for every \nyear as far as the eye can see President Clinton's budget would call \nfor $200 billion deficits.\n  So we need to make the tough decisions for the process to get there, \nand then we need to have the budget itself. So we will see what happens \nwhen we get to the tough votes on amendments and on the balanced budget \nresolution later on this year. We will have disagreements on both sides \nof the aisle. Every one of us will find that there is something we feel \nvery strongly about, and we will fight for it. That is the way it \nworks. But I have also watched over the years Members of Congress in \nboth bodies stand up and say, why, we want a balanced budget but not \nhere, not there, not in my State--in your State, somewhere else, some \nother day, some other time.\n  When we had the Gramm-Rudman process, when we got up to the lick log, \nso to speak, we moved the dates or we exempted this group and that \ngroup. When it started off, it was 3 or 4, and it was 21 the next thing \nyou know. So we will see if we can have a bipartisan effort to achieve \na balanced budget. And once again, I heard the minority leader say we \nshould exempt Social Security.\n  Republicans will have a budget resolution, a 5-year plan, that will \nmove us toward a balanced budget by the year 2002 without touching \nSocial Security. The leader said that. I have said it. Republicans have \nsaid it. Democrats have said it.\n  That is where we started getting in trouble this past week. We \nstarted showing evidence we did not trust each other. Our word is not \ngood enough anymore. When the leader stands here and says we are not \ngoing to touch Social Security benefits or raise taxes, that is not \ngood enough anymore. We had people making speeches about, oh, we have \nto do this to protect Social Security. Where were they last year when \nwe voted on the same, identical balanced budget amendment? Why were \nthey not worried then? Why is it now, all of a sudden, after all these \nyears with Social Security being in the unified budget, we had to take \nit off at that particular moment? Where were they last year when we had \nrelevant votes--actually, it was in 1993--when we had relevant votes on \nSocial Security?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this point \nthe votes that I refer to, a vote to table the McCain-Brown amendment. \nAnd I think there are six or seven of those.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The relevant votes are:\n       A vote to table the McCain/Brown amendment to the Omnibus \n     Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA 93), which would \n     have required that revenues from the increased tax on Social \n     Security benefits be credited to the OASDI trust funds (Vote \n     No. 184, June 25, 1993).\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I really do believe that was just a cover to use as a \nreason not to vote for the balanced budget amendment. But again, if we \ncan work together in a bipartisan way to get a glidepath toward a \nbalanced budget, certainly we should try to do that.\n\n\n                         Progress in the Senate\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also want to take this occasion to say \nthat I do not think the Senate has looked very good this year. I do not \nthink the length of the debate necessarily improves the quality of the \nlegislation. I think you need to have reasonable debate, adequate \ndebate, understand what is in legislation, but I think debate just for \ndebate's sake is not good legislating.\n  When I look at what we have done this year, we have been in session \nnow for the most part for 2 months, and \n[[Page S3454]] what do we have to show for it for the American people? \nWe got off, I thought, to a pretty fast start, although it took longer \nthan it should have. On the congressional coverage, we did say, oh, we \nare going to make the laws apply to us, and the vote was 98 to 1--98 to \n1. We got that one passed, and it went to the President.\n  That is the only bill--I believe this is correct--the only major \nbill, and maybe the only bill, that we have sent to the President for \nhis signature this year, in 2 months.\n  Now, we went then to unfunded mandates, a process to try to stop the \ncavalcade of unfunded Federal mandates we are putting on States--\noverwhelming support for it, but here in the Senate we spent 58 hours \nand 34 minutes discussing this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Mississippi \nhe has exhausted his 7 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for 2 \nmore minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For 58 hours and 34 minutes we talked about unfunded \nmandates. You would have thought this was really a controversial issue. \nNow, we needed time to look at the bill and, yes, to look at the report \nto make sure we fully understood it, but 58 hours and 34 minutes? And \nthen we got to a vote on final passage and it passed 86 to 10--86 to \n10. That is good. You would think, great, now we are on the move.\n  The bill has not gone to the President yet. It is still languishing \nin conference.\n  And then, of course, there was the balanced budget amendment --116 \nhours of debate. We covered a lot of territory in that debate. It \nranged far and wide, quite often far from the subject at hand--116 \nhours. And then we voted, and the vote was, in the final analysis, \nreally 66 to 34, although the majority leader changed his vote in order \nto offer the motion to reconsider--65 to 35.\n  I do not think the American people want the Senate to just react or \nact on what the House has done. But I think they have a right to expect \nthat the Senate would get the message of the election in 1994 as well \nas the House. I think the American people want us to act in an \naffirmative way. And sometimes they want us to act to stop and reverse \nsome of the policies of the past 20 to 40 years that have gotten us \ninto the difficulty we are in with our Federal debt. We do not seem to \nbe doing a very good job of moving forward that agenda, or any agenda. \nAnd when I say it that way I am assuming some of the blame on this side \nof the aisle, too.\n  So I guess my conclusion here today, as we run out of time, is yes, I \nhope we can run in a bipartisan way. There have been ruptures. I had \nlooked forward to working with the new leadership on the other side of \nthe aisle. I have known Senator Daschle, Senator Dorgan, Senator Breaux \nand Senator Kerrey for years and have a lot of respect for them. I \nthought we could cut out some of the acrimony and some of the \npartisanship, that we could talk and communicate and understand each \nother and have a schedule that the Members could rely on that would \nmake sense. I hope we can still do that. But we lost a little bit of \nthat opportunity in the past few days in my opinion.\n  I think the Senate needs to take stock of itself. Maybe this is the \nway it has always been done. I do not believe that. I have gone back \nand looked at history and I do not think necessarily what we have done \nin the last 2 months is the way it has always been done. But I have an \nanswer to that. If it has, so what? If it needs to be changed, if we \ncan do a better job, let us do it. Yes, I am a former House Member. No, \nI do not want to make the Senate a replica of the House. But can we \nmake the Senate a better legislative body, if we make some changes or \nwe work together in a way that provides--yes, more efficiency? I think \nit is worthy of effort. And I hope we will begin it next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenate as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the past several weeks there has been \nsignificant debate on one of the most fundamental issues facing America \ntoday. One which, frankly, divides the two parties in this country. At \ntimes the debate was heated. At times the debate appeared to indicate \nthe balanced budget amendment would pass. But, in the last days, it \nbecame clear that would not be the case and the balanced budget \namendment was defeated.\n  This morning, while Republicans were trying to recover from that \ndefeat, we were buoyed by the announcement that Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell was switching parties, changing from Democrat to Republican.\n  During the press conference this morning making that announcement, a \nquestion was raised by one of the reporters regarding a comment \nattributed to the minority leader of the Senate, suggesting of Senator \nCampbell, ``perhaps he should resign and run for reelection. * * *''\n  I assume the minority leader made that statement because Senator \nCampbell had changed parties. I would like to suggest that perhaps the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, should resign and run for reelection \nhimself, because clearly he changed his position on an incredibly \nfundamental issue which he not only voted for in the past, but made as \na central theme of his campaign in 1986.\n  Let me quote from one of his commercials:\n\n       The national debt. America is awash in red ink. But in \n     1979, Tom Daschle saw the damage these deficits could do to \n     our country. His first official act was to sponsor a \n     constitutional amendment to balance the budget. For seven \n     years, Tom Daschle battled party leaders and special \n     interests to cut waste and close loopholes.\n\n  Mr. President, using the same line of reasoning and logic that was \nemployed this morning by the Senate minority leader, Senator Daschle, \nperhaps he should follow his own advice. Perhaps he should resign and \nrun for reelection.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3454-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3454-S3455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to remind my colleagues of the \nwords of Benjamin Franklin, when he urged, ``Never leave that till \ntomorrow which you can do today.''\n  Good advice. But when is this Congress going to listen?\n  For too long, Congress has used the word ``tomorrow'' to repeatedly \navoid the responsibilities and obligations of today.\n  We will stop spending more than we take in--tomorrow.\n  We will safeguard our children's future by paying our own bills--\ntomorrow.\n  We will make the tough choices to get our fiscal house in order--\ntomorrow.\n  We will balance the budget--tomorrow.\n  The problem with tomorrow, of course, is that it never, ever gets \nhere--there is always another one waiting in the wings. \nResponsibilities are never met. Obligations are never fulfilled.\n  And yesterday's vote on the balanced budget amendment demonstrates \nonce again that--despite all the talk on Capitol Hill about change--\nCongress still operates under the notion that you should never do today \nwhat you can put off until tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this body put politics \nahead of promises in rejecting the balanced budget amendment.\n  Passage hinged on the votes of six Democrats who, just 1 year ago--\nMarch 1, 1994--voted for the balanced budget amendment. Yesterday, \nthose same six Senators voted ``no'' on a bill that was virtually \nidentical to the one they supported last year.\n  The balanced budget amendment is a beautifully simple piece of \nlegislation that makes so much sense to the voters \n[[Page S3455]] that 8 out of 10 of them asked us to make it law. What \ndo we go back home and tell them this weekend--sorry? Try again \ntomorrow?\n  No. Beginning today, with or without a balanced budget amendment, we \nneed to start laying out the glidepath that will lead us to a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002.\n  To my colleagues who said we can straigthen out the fiscal mess in \nWashington without meddling with the Constitution, it is time to stop \nmaking promises and start delivering on them.\n  The only way we will ever clean up the Federal books is to start \ntoday, not tomorrow, not next month, not next year, but today.\n  We have said again and again that balancing the budget will not be \neasy. But those who elected us do not care if we have a tough job. They \nexpect us to do that job.\n  Unlike the ancient plunderers who would pillage a town, then set it \nafire as they headed off toward their next conquest, we are not going \nto slash and burn the budget and leave it in shambles behind us.\n  The needs of this country will continue to be met. But if we are \nserious about bringing the budget into balance, the wants of this \ncountry will have to be closely scrutinized. Some will have to be put \non hold.\n  We need a balanced budget for another reason as well, Mr. President--\nso that we can begin to pay back our massive national debt.\n  We didn't accumulate this $4.8 trillion burden overnight, and we will \nnot pay it off overnight, either. But whether it takes 20 years or 40 \nyears, we have to start now.\n  The debt we are piling up and passing along to the next generation of \nAmericans is not just fiscally wrong--it is morally wrong.\n  George Washington could not have known the problems we would face in \n1995, but he cautioned us--198 years ago--about amassing a national \ndebt.\n  It was expected, he wrote in his Farewell Address, that in times of \ncrisis, the Federal Government would occasionally be required to spend \nbeyond its means. But in times of peace and prosperity the Government \nmust repay its debt, and not push its burdens onto the next generation.\n  We have been at peace and enjoying prosperity for 40 years. With the \nrecklessness of the past behind us, the burden that Congress bears \ntoday is ensuring the strength of this Nation tomorrow.\n  In conclusion, a balanced budget can be achieved by the year 2002 if \nwe begin laying out the path today. We will have to do it without a \nbalanced budget amendment, but make no mistake--this Congress must do \nit.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, let me indicate that round one of the \nbalanced budget effort has been disposed of. But there will be other \nrounds. Our new Republican colleague, Senator Campbell, when he was \ntalking to some of the reporters, was saying the thing that really made \nthe decision for him was the balanced budget amendment and the games \nthat are being played with the balanced budget amendment and those who \none year vote one way and the next year vote another way on the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  As I said in my remarks yesterday, it seems to me that this issue \nshould not and will not go away. We will proceed on the basis that the \nbalanced budget amendment will be passed. We will see how many are \nwilling to make the tough votes--we hope a majority on both sides of \nthe aisle--and we will see about Social Security and some of the other \nsmokescreens that were talked about during the debate.\n  But I would just assure my colleagues that this issue--and it is an \nissue and will continue to be an issue because 80 percent of the \nAmerican people have told us that they want a balanced budget \namendment. We have told them we do not care what you want, we know what \nis best. A minority of 34 knows what is best, even though a majority of \n80 percent have a different view.\n  So I am excited about the prospects of taking this case to the \nAmerican people for the next 3 months, 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, 10 \nmonths, a year, 16 months, whatever it takes because it is that \nimportant. Again, it is not a matter of partisanship, because I \ncongratulate the 14 Democrats who withstood the pressure from the White \nHouse and the leadership on the other side to vote consistently and to \nvote their convictions. This was a bipartisan effort, as it should have \nbeen. And I read the obituaries in the morning's paper about what it \nmeans for A or X or Y or Z. It is what it means to the American people \nthat makes the difference. And what it means to the American people is \nthat the U.S. Senate by one vote, one vote, has said wait. You have to \nwait. We will make these judgments for you. You do not understand. We \nunderstand all these complex issues.\n  But I must say traveling around the country when you make speeches \nand you talk about unfunded mandates, people say ``Well, I do not think \nI have had that.'' They do not really focus on unfunded mandates. You \ntalk about covering Congress like we cover everybody else. Most people \nsay that is a good idea. But I find the thing that the American people \nunderstand without any further explanation is when you say ``balanced \nbudget.'' They are doing it in their business. They are doing it in \ntheir homes. They are doing it in their offices, and they understand \nthe balanced budget. They also understand regulatory reform, which is \nanother issue that will be on this floor very soon.\n  So I do not know when this reconsideration will take place, but \nhopefully very soon. But if not, there is time to take the case to the \nAmerican people. I do not suggest that many of my colleagues were not \nproperly motivated. But I think in some cases it was a lot of politics, \nand that is not without precedent on either side of the aisle either, I \nwould say, because this is a political institution in a sense. But this \nissue is larger than any one Senator or larger than this institution. \nAs I have said, we do not amend the Constitution lightly around here. \nWe certainly had adequate debate.\n  I conclude by saying to all of my colleagues that we are going to \nhave to change our operating rules in the Senate because we are now \nstarting to report out some of the legislation.\n  So I just alert my colleagues to be prepared to be here almost every \nnight until 10 or 11 o'clock. There will not be any recesses in the \nSenate this year that I can see after the Easter recess. We have tried \nto accommodate our colleagues who want to spend 10 days on this, 3 \nweeks on this, 3 or 4 weeks on this. And I do not know of any other way \nto finish our work. But I think every Senator will accept that because, \nif we want to have these extended debates and we want to have this full \ndiscussion, then certainly we understand that it is going to take more \ntime. I do not have any objection to that except to say that we are \ngoing to try to complete our work this year. I do not see any other way \nunless there is some way that the Democratic leader and I could come \ntogether and figure out some way to do it. But if you look at what has \nhappened so far this year, we have had about 2 months now on three \npieces of legislation.\n And we have been in session almost every day. Maybe that is the way it \nis. On that basis, you would pass about 15 pieces of legislation.\n\n  I alert my colleagues that we are going to meet with the Democratic \nleader next week to try to outline a program for the next couple of \nmonths. I know that after legislation comes from the House it properly \ngoes to committees here and we have hearings and markups. The line-item \nveto will be on this floor by the end of next week, and we will stay on \nthe line-item veto and we will be here nights. We are not going to \nspend 30 days on the line-item veto. We will find out where the votes \nare when the President says he supports a line-item veto. We will see \nif \n[[Page S3456]] he really believes in it. If you are really going to \nwork for the line-item veto. We hope he does.\n  So I alert my colleagues that though many of us would like to have a \nlittle more time off these next few months, I do not believe it is \npossible. If it is, I will try to accommodate all my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     The Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard speeches this morning that \nsuggest because the balanced budget amendment has been defeated, we \nsomehow have to wait to balance the budget. I simply say that there is \nno need to wait. There is nothing that prevents us from moving to write \nbudgets that balance the budget. We can do that in the normal process \nof the Congress--and we should.\n  Mr. President, no one should use as an excuse that the balanced \nbudget amendment failed. Mr. President, we have an obligation--all of \nus, Democrats and Republicans--to now go to work to move this country \ntoward balance. And there is no time to spare, because we face a \ndemographic time bomb in this country; that is, when the baby boomers \nstart to retire and the number of people who are eligible for Medicare \nand Social Security doubles. That requires that we go to work and write \nbalanced budgets.\n  Mr. President, I want to just put in some perspective why some of us \nfelt so keenly that the balanced budget amendment that was before us \nwas flawed. I come from a financial background. I was a tax \ncommissioner of my State before I came to this body. In that position, \nI fought the looting of trust funds at the State level. We were faced \nwith it consistently because we had large energy trust funds and, \nrepeatedly, there were attempts by people in the legislature to raid \nthose funds. I thought it was wrong then. I thought it was wrong when I \ncame to this Chamber that we were doing the same thing with respect to \ntrust funds.\n  Mr. President, I think when people talk about a balanced budget \namendment, we ought to ask: What budget was being balanced? What budget \nwas being balanced with that amendment that we considered yesterday?\n  I remind my colleagues of the language of section 7, which defined \nwhat budget was being balanced. It said:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government except those derived from borrowing. Total \n     outlays shall include all outlays of the United States \n     Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.\n\n  Mr. President, this definition includes all Social Security revenue \nand all Social Security outlays. And the problem is, Social Security is \nnot contributing to the deficit; it is in surplus. So, by definition, \nthe amendment we were considering yesterday would have taken Social \nSecurity surpluses and applied them to other operating expenses of the \nFederal Government. That is what was wrong with the amendment we \nconsidered yesterday. In principle, that is what was wrong.\n  Mr. President, I understand fully that when you do not use Social \nSecurity surpluses, when you do not use trust fund moneys, that makes \nthe task more difficult. That makes the challenge greater. But I do not \nthink we should say to the American people we are balancing the budget \nwhen we are really looting and raiding trust funds in order to balance \nthe budget. That is a fraud. That should not be enshrined in the \nConstitution of the United States, because that would make it virtually \nimpossible to fix. And if we fail to fix it, the economic implications \nfor the future are far more severe. We will never be able to keep the \npromise to those who have paid the taxes on the promise that they will \nreceive retirement benefits, if we do not treat the Social Security \nsurpluses that are supposed to be treated as a trust fund in that way.\n  During the discussions, a number of the leaders who were proponents \nof the amendment came to me in an attempt to secure my vote and said \nthey would agree to stop using the Social Security trust fund surpluses \nby the year 2012.\n  Mr. President, this chart shows what they were suggesting. This chart \nshows the flow of funds in the Social Security trust fund. The year \n2012 is about here on the chart. So when they are saying they would use \nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses until the year 2012, they were \nsaying they would use most of the trust fund moneys, because you can \nsee that is about the high-water mark of the buildup of the trust fund. \nThen it starts to decline as the baby boom generation starts to retire. \nI said, no, I would not accept a proposal that would use trust fund \nmoneys until the year 2012. That is about $2 trillion that would have \nbeen used. They came back to me several moments later and said, ``How \nabout if we stopped using the Social Security trust fund money by the \nyear 2008?''\n  Mr. President, I said no to 2008 because after consulting on the flow \nof funds that moved through the trust funds or the projections of the \nflow of funds, my staff reported to me that it would be $1.3 trillion. \nMr. President, I think those exchanges confirm that those who were \nproponents of the amendment fully intended to use Social Security trust \nfund moneys to offset other Government operating expenses. I think that \nis wrong as a principle, just wrong. I do not think we should do that. \nI think it would be a mistake to do that. I understand that it makes \nthe job tougher.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to tell the American people we are \nbalancing the budget, then I think we ought to do it honestly. We ought \nto be really balancing the budget, not taking trust fund moneys to help \nbalance the budget. If that means we have to stretch out the time \nperiod so that we set an honest goal, then we should do that. And the \nreason I feel this so acutely is when we look at what the flow of funds \nwill be, or are projected to be, if we do not save that money, when we \nreach out here in 2025 and when we reach 2029, all of the money is \ngone. It is all gone by 2029. And that assumes that we allow the trust \nfunds to be built up. So I think it is imperative that we treat the \ntrust funds separately from the other operating accounts of the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, let me just go back to this final chart because it \nspeaks to the need for all of us to come together.\n  We have had high levels of partisanship in the last days, and perhaps \nthat was inevitable. I think some of the things that have been said \nthat question each other's motives are unfortunate. I think when \nMembers of Congress start name calling, that is uncalled for. None of \nus should engage in that. That demeans this institution.\n  Mr. President, we now do have an obligation to try to address what is \na serious crisis facing this country.\n  This chart shows why current trends are not sustainable. The green \nline here shows the revenues anticipated for the United States. It \nshows the history from 1970 to today and a projection out to the year \n2030. Revenue is pretty constant. The colored bars here show the \nexpenses. And we can all see what is going to happen because of this \ndemographic time bomb, the tremendous number of baby boomers who are \ngoing to retire and what that does to Medicare and Medicaid and Social \nSecurity. It explodes the costs. That has to be addressed. And nothing \nprecludes us from doing that.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to work together, to put aside \npartisanship to get the job done.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3455-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3456-S3459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SOCIAL SECURITY AND BALANCING THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I just want to make a couple of comments \nabout the arguments that are being made with respect to Social \nSecurity, not just by the Senator from North Dakota but many others, \nnot just today but for the last several days.\n  First, we should not use the Social Security trust fund for balancing \nthe budget. What does that mean? We should not use the Social Security \ntrust fund to balance the budget. Are we taking money out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund and spending it directly on other programs? No. No, \nwe do not take money out of the Social Security trust fund to spend it \non other programs.\n  Money in the Social Security trust fund is borrowed, for which we pay \ninterest on the money back to the Social \n[[Page S3457]] Security Administration, as we would with any fund that \nruns a surplus in the Federal Government.\n  We have surpluses in the highway trust fund. What do we do with the \nhighway trust fund money? Do we spend it on other programs? No, that \nmoney is in there. It is earning interest. We are investing it in \nGovernment bonds, just like we do the Social Security trust fund, just \nlike we do the aviation trust fund, just like we do with any other \ntrust fund that we have in the Federal Government that happens for a \nperiod of time to be running a surplus.\n  So to use the argument that we are using the Social Security trust \nfund to balance the budget is as fallacious an argument as it is to say \nwe are using the highway trust fund to balance the budget. The highway \ntrust fund has a couple billion dollars surplus in it. I did not see \nanybody run to the floor to protect our roads and bridges. They did not \ncome to the floor and say, ``We can't use the highway trust fund. That \nis not fair. It hid the deficit.''\n  It is not true. Let us be honest. Let us not hide it from the people.\n  Where were the highway trust fund advocates? Where were the aviation \ntrust fund advocates?\n  We were saying let us be truthful and honest in not hiding this from \nthe American people.\n  What is going on is in the fine spirit of hiding behind the apron of \nSocial Security when you cannot define your program in other ways. That \nis what is going on here. I had it happened to me in my election. Many \nof us have had it happen to us in our elections. When you are losing, \nwhen you know you cannot defend your record, when you know you cannot \ndefend your vote, you bring up the old red herring: Let us run behind \nSocial Security. Let us scare the public that we are going to get \nSocial Security and we will be OK. They will believe it.\n  We will never change this place, we will never change this place, \nuntil the American public has enough realization to know that there is \nnot any program that could ever compete in popularity and support--not \none program that can compete in popularity and support--with the Social \nSecurity program. If the Federal Government continues on its way and we \ncontinue to have to eliminate programs as the debt gets to be a bigger \nand bigger and bigger part of our Federal Government, the only program, \nif we have one program left, I will assure you, will be the Social \nSecurity program. Everything else will be gone. That will win. That \nwill always be maintained.\n  The American public has to stop being afraid that someone is going to \ncome in and raid their Social Security plan. It is not going to happen. \nWe promised it was not going to happen. Unfortunately, I guess the \npromise of the majority leader of the U.S. Senate is not enough; the \npromise of the Speaker of the House that we are not going to touch \nSocial Security is not enough. A vote of something like 90 to 10 in \nthis body that we will not cut Social Security or touch Social Security \nover the next 7 years is not enough. Because people are always afraid.\n  Is it not sad? Is it not sad what we have done to the people of this \ncountry? We have gotten them so addicted to Government that every time \nwe talk about changing it, they run. They get scared. They get scared. \nWe have made them dependent. We have succeeded here in Washington in \nthe first step to really control what goes on in America by having \npeople dependent upon us.\n  No one in this Chamber is going to take $1 of benefits away from any \nSocial Security recipients in this country to balance the budget. And \neveryone in this Chamber knows it. Everyone in this Chamber knows it.\n  This was partisanship. This was political. It is a lot of things. The \nreason six Members who voted for this exact amendment voted the other \nway and hid behind Social Security was one reason, and it was not \nSocial Security--partisan advantage. Stop the Contract With America, \nlet us not move things too fast now, let us not change the status quo \nin Washington.\n  We have a great opportunity before us in Washington today. We have a \nHouse of Representatives that continues to crank out and pass \nlegislation that was called for in their Contract With America that has \nthe support of the American public. And it is sitting over here in the \nSenate and it will continue to pile up and pile up until the people of \nAmerica send a message to their Senators that they want something done.\n  If you want something done in Washington, if you want a leaner, more \nefficient, smaller Government, if you want that power and freedom back \nto you, the American public, not centered here in Washington where we \ncan threaten you by pulling the rug out from under a program that you \nlike, but in fact to enable you and empower you to take those \nchallenges and responsibilities yourselves, when you believe that can \nhappen, you have to communicate that to the people here in the Senate. \nBecause if you communicate that, this place will change. And if it is \nnot in the next 2\\1/2\\ years, the 1996 election will make that change.\n  The opportunity is here. It is up to the American public as to \nwhether that is going to happen or not. It is up to you as to whether \nwe are going to succeed as a body in the Senate.\n  The rules are structured here--boy, I never knew--but the rules are \nstructured here so we pretty much cannot get anything done. That is the \nway they sort of crafted this place, so things slow down, so we do not \ndo a lot here.\n  Now, as Senator Lott said earlier, I do not want, as a former House \nMember, I do not want the Senate to be like the House. We need more \ndeliberation. We need to put the brakes on things and cool things off a \nlittle bit. I understand that. But, at the same time, we should not be \nobstructionists for the sake of being obstructionists.\n  I have here a table, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 FIRST SESSIONS--STATISTICAL COMPARISONS                \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         Days in                        \n                                         session      Time in    Record/\n            Year/Congress                through      session     votes \n                                         February                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1995/104th...........................           36     316'03''       97\n1993/103d............................           19      91'51''       20\n1991/102d............................           29     145'56''       20\n1989/101st...........................           16      43'10''       15\n1987/100th...........................           22      89'58''       29\n1985/99th............................           22     105'36''       17\n1983/98th............................           17      53'55''        2\n1981/97th............................           24      71'18''       25\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrepared by the Senate Daily Digest/Office of the Secretary.            \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object, as long as it would not be \nextended longer than the 2-minute period. We have a problem. The \nSenator from Michigan has to assume the chair, people have to catch \nairplanes.\n  In deference to the Senator, I will not object.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I will take 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just wanted to include this in the Record and comment \nthat in the 104th Congress, the Congress we are in right now, we have \nbeen in 36 days, 316 hours and 3 minutes of debate, 97 votes.\n  It is unprecedented the amount of time we have spent here in this \nbody to try to move things forward. We have cooled it off, we have \ndebated it, and we got two bills passed. Only one has been signed into \nlaw.\n  If you look at other Congresses through February, in the last \nCongress they were in 19 days, compared to 36, and only had 91 hours of \ndebate. In 1991, 29 days in session, 145 hours of debate; 1989, 16 days \nin session, 43 hours of debate.\n  The fact of the matter is we are working hard, we are debating long, \nand we are not accomplishing a whole heck of a lot. Cooling off is one \nthing; stonewalling is another.\n  What we need to do, I implore my colleagues and the American public, \nis to rally to the defense of what the voters in November asked for, \nand move some things forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask if I may yield to my colleague from \nMichigan for a statement, and I ask unanimous consent that I might \nyield for whatever short period he might need to my friend from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                 [[Page S3458]] IN MEMORY OF ED PRINCE\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, it is with great sadness and a deep sense \nof personal loss that I note the passing yesterday of a close friend, \nMr. Ed Prince of Holland, MI, a successful businessman, family man, and \nphilanthropist.\n  I had the privilege of knowing Ed Prince and his family for a number \nof years. Ed was a self-made businessman who took seriously his \nChristian duty to help his neighbors and others less fortunate than \nhimself.\n  After quitting his job as chief engineer at the local machine works \nin Holland, MI, Ed started his own automotive components company. Now \nthat company employs 4,500 people and is the Nation's largest producer \nof die cast machinery.\n  But Ed did not let concern with the bottom line take him away from \nhis Calvinist roots and family values. He devoted time and money to \nfamily causes on a local, State, and national scale. He was a major \ncontributor to his church, local charitable organizations, and such \nnational organizations as the Family Research Council and Focus on the \nFamily.\n  Perhaps Ed's greatest accomplishment, other than serving as an \nexemplary husband and father, is his commitment to his hometown of \nHolland. When downtown Holland began struggling financially, Ed and his \nwife Elsa came to the rescue. They bought a number of downtown \nbuildings, refurbished them, and sold or leased them back to small \nbusinesses. They even put heaters under the sidewalks so folks could \ncome downtown during Holland's severe winters without fear of slipping \nand falling or being disinclined because of the winter.\n  I also know the residents at the Evergreen Commons Senior Center a \nfacility which I have visited, will miss Edgar and his support. He gave \n$1 million to that organization so that Holland's senior citizens could \nmaintain their dignity while being helped in their old age. He also has \nbeen a major contributor to colleges in his area--both Calvin and Hope \ncolleges owe him a great debt of gratitude. As his pastor, David \nGuerrin, remarked, ``He used all of his resoruces--both personal and \nfinancial--not as an end in themselves, but always as a means of \nglorifying God.''\n  Those words constitute a fine tribute to a great man, a man to whom I \nalso owe a great debt of gratitude for the example he provided through \nhis generosity, strength of character, and spirit of fellowship toward \nhis community.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Will the Chair explain to the Senator, are we in morning \nbusiness, and are there time restraints on the amount of time that we \nare allowed to speak under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the order of business, and the time \nlimit is 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I will try to stay within that timeframe. I \nmight request an additional minute or 2 if I run out of time.\n  I want to start out, Mr. President, and briefly compliment my great \nfriend and colleague from West Virginia. There is no Member that I have \nserved more proudly with in the U.S. Senate than Robert Byrd. He is a \nvery learned individual, and I listened and I have listened before to \nhis great and persuasive arguments as to why the constitutional \namendment should not be placed in the Constitution. And he has made \nsome excellent points.\n  He did not change my mind, but he made me quiver a few times. I \nsimply say that I thought the statements, the way Senator Byrd, as \nusual, handled himself in a very professional, gentlemanly manner, made \nhis points very, very well, and I am proud to serve with him. I am \nproud to serve with all of the Members of this body, even those who of \ncourse did not agree with my vote yesterday in support of the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I think it has been a very healthy debate. Basically, \nthe reason this debate has been kept on track is because it has been \nthe herding, keeping the locomotive of straight talk on track, by the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Let me address some of the concerns I have. The main concern that I \nhave--and I would like to say despite the fact that the balanced budget \namendment did not pass yesterday, the world has not come to an end--I \nhope the comity and the understanding of Members on both sides of the \naisle and on both sides of this important and contentious issue is such \nthat we can move ahead in some kind of a proposition to bring our \nspiraling deficit and skyrocketing national debt under control.\n  We can lament the fact that the balanced budget amendment failed by \none vote yesterday. I think it is safe to assume that those Members who \nsupported the balanced budget amendment think little is served by \nwhipping or arguing at great length about maybe calling it up again \ntomorrow and turning it around. That is not going to happen. I will \nsimply say that I hope we can leave politics as much as possible out of \nthis debate.\n  Having said that, I simply say, as a person who has always voted for \na balanced budget amendment, I think that even with the great talents \nand arguments--many of them sound--that Senator Byrd and others \nadvanced, we probably would have carried the day on the balanced budget \namendment had it not been that politics got involved in this matter \nvery early.\n  Not long ago, the Republican National Committee, with their vast \nresources, decided they were going to put some pressure on Democratic \nSenators in certain States of the Union, and they went into those \nStates and in some cases enlisted the Republican Governor of those \nStates to attack publicly, at the expense of the Republican hierarchy, \nto bring pressure to bear.\n  The facts of the matter are that that backfired. The facts of the \nmatter are--and I am a pretty good vote counter in this body--I think \nthat that activity, as much as anything else, was a prelude to the \ndefeat of the balanced budget amendment yesterday.\n  There were some talks today, unfortunately, on the floor of the \nSenate about people resigning because they changed parties and all of \nthese kind of things, which brought a retort, of course, that possibly \nothers who had voted for this previously and did not vote for it this \ntime should resign.\n  I do not think that kind of debate contributes much to the basic \nunderstanding, to advise the people on what the situation is. Let me \nsay in the first place that I believe that there were mistakes made on \nboth sides. I have cited what I think was a critical mistake when \nobviously the hierarchy of the Republican Party decided to politicize \nthis debate, and if we look at the States where they advertised, we \nwill see what I think is proof positive that their actions were ill \nadvised, bad politics, and certainly bad strategy from the standpoint \nof passing the constitutional amendment.\n  Everywhere they tried, they failed. In fact, I happen to feel, in \nconversations I have had with several of my colleagues that were caught \nin that attack, that it probably caused them to swing against the \namendment, among other reasons. So it was counterproductive.\n  I will also say that one of the problems I had with the \nconstitutional amendment that I voted for was the fact that the hope \nwas held out--in fact, it was almost a promise--that if we passed the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, we would do so by the \nyear 2002. Well, the facts of the matter are that had we passed that \nconstitutional amendment yesterday, and had we not had a war between \nnow and the year 2002, or a serious downturn in the economy, if \neverything went according to schedule, we still would not have balanced \nthe budget the way most people think the balanced budget would have \nworked.\n  I simply say it would have been far better, it seems to me, had my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle, with whom I worked closely on \nthis, been more upfront and said, ``Yes, we would not have actually \nbalanced the budget by the year 2002 because we intend to use the \namount of money that we protect and are going to continue to protect \nthat is called the Social Security trust fund.''\n  So, therefore, it should have been said up front that if this \nconstitutional amendment passes, we will balance the budget of the \nFederal Government by the year 2002, except for counting \n[[Page S3459]] the surplus in the Social Security trust fund. I think \nthat is evident, and it is evident by the fact that it came up in \ndiscussion but has not been, I think, fully understood.\n  Having said that, I do not agree. I did not agree and I disagree with \nthose on this side of the aisle who, I think, made some very good \npolitical points by talking about the looting and the raiding of Social \nSecurity. Certainly, I think that was not the intent of all but one of \nthe Members on that side of the aisle who voted for the amendment. It \ncertainly was not the intent of this Senator. But I recognize that it \nwas a good political argument to make.\n  I do not believe that any of us who were supporting a constitutional \namendment--I can only speak for myself, but I have some knowledge of \nthe thinking that went on of others who were supporting this--that we \nwere simply saying we were not raiding anything. We were simply \nrecognizing the fact that some people do not understand; and that is \nthat the Social Security trust fund is presently invested in T bills, \nsecurities of the United States of America fully backed with the faith \nand credit of the United States of America, and there is no way that we \ncould or should raid those funds to balance a budget.\n  Another way of saying that is a bookkeeping procedure, because \nclearly the law says that we cannot invest trust funds, especially \nSocial Security trust funds, but all trust funds, we cannot invest them \nin the stock market or other speculative propositions, only in \nGovernment securities, basically T bills. So there was no raid on \nSocial Security in the actual sense of the word.\n  Let me simply ask, where do we go from here? It seems to me, although \nthe balanced budget amendment would have given us the discipline that I \nthink is necessary--it is not there for many and varied reasons--\ntherefore, that we should press on very aggressively to begin to \nbalance a budget now without the constitutional amendment, as most of \nus said we hope we could do.\n  I probably think the best way out of this is simply pass a resolution \nthat the Budget Committee should report out, according to present law, \nby April 1, a budget that will balance the budget by the year 2002, or \nwhenever. I will simply point out that the present law clearly states \nthat you cannot use the Social Security trust fund to balance a budget. \nSo I hope that possibly we could pass a resolution directing the Budget \nCommittee to come out with a balanced budget amendment, notwithstanding \nthe fact at least of now we are not going to put it in the \nConstitution, there is no reason why we should not press forward.\n  I simply say I think people of good will should put politics aside \nnow and try to work toward balancing the budget the only way we have \navailable to us at the present time, and that is the will, the good \nfellowship and support of the men and women who serve on the Budget \nCommittee; direct them to come forth with a balanced budget amendment \nby some period of year, hopefully 2002, that could balance a budget the \nway we have to balance a budget in the absence of a constitutional \namendment to do so.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham).

Mr. President, I would like to reflect on what I \nconsider a reality. It seems to me that we have managed to do it again. \nWe have put off taking the medicine necessary to correct the \naccumulated deficits that we have been running because we have again \nrefused to impose a balanced budget mandate in our Constitution. Let me \njust reflect a little bit on how this body seems to work with \nunsolvable problems.\n  We all remember the extended debate on base closures, the fact that \nwe could never agree whose base would be closed. So we finally \nconsented to bring about the creation of a commission staffed by \nknowledgeable people who would independently evaluate priorities of \nbase closures. The Commission would examine all relevant evidence \npresented by the individual military services and then make specific \nrecommendations on a package. Congress would then be given the \nopportunity to vote up or down on that package.\n  We saw what happened to that Commission yesterday. We voted \nunanimously to extend the Commission because it has worked. It worked \nsimply because the other alternatives did not work.\n  I am kind of a bottom-line person, Mr. President. It seems to me that \nwe have attempted to address our deficits by statute in the past. You \nremember back in 1985, we had Gramm-Rudman I. And it was our conviction \nthat this would bring about control of runaway spending and it would \nbring about an end to the continued deficits.\n  Under Gramm-Rudman I, we were going to have a zero deficit by 1991, \nat least we were supposed to. Then we had Gramm-Rudman II in 1987. That \nwas supposed to bring about a zero deficit by 1993. It did not work. \nThen we had the 1990 budget agreement and that was supposed to bring \nabout the decline of the deficits. Under that agreement, the deficit \nwas supposed to be $83 billion. In reality, the deficit for 1995 is \nmore than 100 percent higher--$205 billion.\n  If we look at our short history relative to trying to correct this \nmatter since 1985, one has to come to the conclusion that statutes do \nnot worked.\n  I was somewhat amused by the editorial in the Washington Post this \nmorning which suggested that amending the Constitution was the wrong \nway to do it; we have the capability to do it and, therefore, we should \ndo it. But the fact remains, Mr. President, we did not do it then and \nwe have not done it now. It simply is not going to be addressed. I \nthink the attitude of the American people is that we simply do not have \nthe self-discipline to reduce spending, we do not have the self-\ndiscipline to reduce the rate of growth of entitlements, we have simply \nleft the entitlements on automatic pilot.\n  I reached the conclusion some time ago--and this is the basis for my \nsupport of the balanced budget amendment--that since nothing else has \nworked, this obviously would bring about a mandate to the Congress, and \nthat mandate would be self-discipline.\n  There is one other factor that I think is important, and that is how \nthe American people are going to view this. Social Security has been \nmentioned, but it would seem to me that the people of retirement age \nthat are dependent on Social Security, and those who are about to be, \nhave a conscious awareness of the realities associated with the \nmonetary system of this country. We can look at Mexico and see what \nhappened--too much debt.\n  I do not know, Mr. President, if you have observed what is happening \nin Canada, but 29.6 percent--29.6 percent--of the Canadian budget is \ninterest on their debt. That is nearly one-third.\n  We are running deficits each year, Mr. President, but the difficulty \nwith it is that the interest on the accumulated debt now is more than \nthe deficit. So the reality of this action, or lack of action taken by \nthis body is really one that has to be addressed.\n  Mr. President, I think we have a situation where we have to recognize \nwe do not have the self-discipline to eliminate the deficit. Our \nmonetary system, as we know it, is very much at stake. We should have \ngiven the American people, through their State legislatures, the \nopportunity to decide whether the Constitution should be amended. It \ntakes 38 States to amend the Constitution. There would have been a \ngreat debate.\n  I think by not giving the American people the opportunity to be heard \non this matter, we have done a great disservice to them and to \nourselves, and we have not corrected the problem that has been \naddressed in this body over the last several weeks. I think that is, \nindeed, unfortunate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  [[Page S3460]] (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 496 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3459-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE MEXICAN PESO\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a situation that has \nbeen before us in the Chamber previously.\n  We were all caught with some surprise earlier this year when the \nSecretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board \ncame before a group of Members of Congress, House and Senate combined, \nto tell us of the crisis in Mexico and to ask for our support for a \nproposal to extend $40 billion in loan guarantees to the Mexicans.\n  My initial reaction to that proposal was one of support, as were the \nreactions of the leadership of both parties in both Houses. Mexico is \nenormously important to the United States, economically and culturally. \nIn addition, if we want to become crass about it, there are some \n750,000 American jobs that are in jeopardy if the Mexican economy \nshould collapse. It made sense for the United States to do what it \ncould to reach out to the Mexicans and try to support their economy, \nand I supported the administration's request.\n  As we got into the details of the deal, however, it became clear to \nme, as it did to a number of other Members of Congress, that the $40 \nbillion loan guarantee was not a good deal, and we advised the Treasury \nof that. We urged them to come up with some alternative proposals, and \nthey did. To their credit, they listened to the Congress and they \nproposed the second deal which I stood on this floor and endorsed in \nprinciple. It involved $15 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund \nand $5 billion under control of the Federal Reserve for a total of $20 \nbillion in American money and the rest from international sources.\n  I praised that deal because it increased the participation to include \nother governments besides our own, and it injected the expertise of the \nFederal Reserve Board into this circumstance which was not directly the \nsituation previously.\n  I was forced to come to the floor to express some reservations in a \nlater speech about how this deal was being put together. When it was \nfinally announced and the specifics were signed in the White House, I \nwas shocked, and quoted as being shocked in the national press, by the \nstatement by the Mexican Minister of Finance, Mr. Ortiz, who said we \nwill use this money to shore up our banks, to put more capital into the \nMexican banks. That was not what I had understood the deal was going to \nbe. I said I hope it works, but I still think the thing we should do is \nto get the Federal Reserve Board involved in extinguishing pesos.\n  Well, Mr. President, Mexico is back in the headlines with the news of \nthe arrest of President Salinas' brother, the accusation being that he \nprofited improperly and enormously from the privatization program that \nwent on under President Salinas, and then the occasion of his arrest on \nthe accusation that he had a hand in the political assassinations that \ntook place in Mexico that helped upset the stability of that nation.\n  I had dinner just the other evening of this week with people who are \ndoing business in Mexico who say that the economic conditions there are \nworse than they were in 1981. For those who may not remember the 1981 \ndevaluation, the peso prior to that devaluation was trading at 3 to the \ndollar. By the time they finally eliminated that peso and replaced it \nwith the new pesos, it was 3,000 to the dollar. And again I say, people \ndoing business in Mexico now are saying it is worse than it was in \n1981.\n  The Mexican Government is still printing pesos as if they had not \nlearned the lessons of 1981 and the lessons of the recent devaluation. \nI see no action on our part by the Federal Reserve Board to try to \nextinguish pesos. Perhaps that is logical. If the Mexicans are going to \ncontinue to print them, the Federal Reserve Board obviously should not \nbe involved in trying to soak them up.\n  More in sorrow than anger, I come to the floor now to say it is my \nopinion that this attempt, well meaning and one which I supported, to \naid the Mexicans in their hour of great distress is failing. I stand \nready, if the Treasury is interested, to make continued recommendations \nas to what might be done. But I hear these stories about the \nassassinations, the breakdown of Mexican political institutions, and \nthe information that the central bank and the Mexican Government are \ncontinuing to print pesos, and I find myself distressed and discouraged \nat the prospect. It is not a pleasant one. If our neighbors immediately \nto the south go back into the abyss of the economic disasters that they \nwent through in 1981, it is not just they who will suffer; we in this \ncountry will suffer, and I am filled, as I say, with distress and \nanguish that the American attempt to help them for whatever reason has \nfailed.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask that I be permitted 2 or 3 minutes \nto say to my distinguished colleague from Utah that I wish to associate \nmyself with the remarks he has just completed. I have been counseling \nwith him some several weeks now on this subject, and I would like the \nSenate to know how much time the distinguished Senator from Utah has \ndevoted to independent analysis and research of this subject. I, too, \nfrom the very beginning was deeply concerned with the propriety and the \nmanner in which the United States addressed this issue. To date, I have \nnot been able to ascertain enough facts to enable this Senator to reach \na final conclusion. However, I am concerned that the actions that our \nGovernment has taken will benefit many people who were involved in this \ntransaction from the beginning for purpose of making unusual profits as \na consequence of the high interest rates involved.\n  I also regret that Congress did not become more involved, that time \nwas not permitted to allow hearings so that we could have had a better \nunderstanding of the facts. I firmly believe that Congress should have \nparticipated in making the decision on this important matter.\n  I will continue to work with my distinguished colleague from Utah and \nothers to assess this situation in hopes that someday we can provide \nfor the American people and others a complete set of facts as to how \nthis crisis occurred, how it was addressed, and who was to profit and \nwho was to lose.\n  We have all expressed our compassion and concern about the people of \nMexico. Indeed, there is no one who does not feel a desire to help \nthem. That was expressed by the recent action of the Congress, and \nindeed the President, in certain trade agreements. However, this \nparticular situation still has a large element of mystery that must be \nresolved in a manner that the American people fully understand.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak out \nof order and that I may speak for not to exceed 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3460-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3460-S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE SENATE AND THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor and waited because \nother Senators wanted to speak, and they were conforming themselves to \nthe order providing that Senators may be permitted to speak for not to \nexceed 5 minutes. I did not want to attempt to go ahead of anyone who \nhad been waiting. I believe the time has come, now, when I will not be \nimposing on other Senators who have wished to speak.\n  I was also told that the distinguished majority leader wanted to come \nto the floor. I talked with the assistant majority leader and he \nindicated that he felt Senators would soon have completed speaking so \nthat I would have more time.\n  Mr. President, Kipling was a great British poet. One of his great \npieces of poetry is ``The Heritage.'' If I may at this moment just \nrecall a couple of verses of ``The Heritage.''\n\n     Our fathers in a wondrous age,\n     Ere yet the Earth was small,\n     Ensured to us an heritage,\n     And doubted not at all\n     [[Page S3461]] That we, the children of their heart,\n     Which then did beat so high,\n     In later time should play like part\n     For our posterity.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     Then fretful murmur not they gave\n     So great a charge to keep,\n     Nor dream that awestruck time shall save\n     Their labour while we sleep.\n\n     Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year\n     Our fathers' title runs.\n     Make we likewise their sacrifice,\n     Defrauding not our sons.\n\n  Mr. President, I feel very deeply that on yesterday the Senate rose \nto meet the test that was before it and, in doing that, it had in mind \nour posterity. I think it was a truly great moment in the history of \nthe Senate. I have, from time to time, seen the Senate rise to meet \nsuch an occasion, when the occasion demanded courage and perhaps some \nsacrifice.\n  We had a thorough debate on the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. It was not overly long. In terms of lengthy debates, my \nmind goes back to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That measure was before \nthe Senate 103 days--from March 9, when the motion to proceed was first \noffered--by Mr. Mansfield, I believe--until June 19, when the rollcall \non the last vote was completed. The motion to proceed took 2 weeks, and \nthen the bill itself was before the Senate for a total of 77 days, with \nactual debate thereon consuming 57 days, including 6 Saturdays.\n  I hear, from time to time, the tabulation of the number of hours that \nwe have spent in this Senate on this bill or that bill--100 hours, or \n115 hours and 43 minutes, or whatever it may be. I am somewhat--perhaps \nnot amused, but perhaps I regret that we view the role of this Senate \nand our responsibility as Senators in the context of how many hours we \nmay spend on a matter that is so vital to the Nation as is a \nconstitutional amendment, and especially the constitutional amendment \nthat we have been discussing over the past 33 days.\n  I have risen to express appreciation to the distinguished majority \nleader during these days, and to the distinguished manager of the bill \non the majority side, Mr. Hatch. I thought we had a good debate, and I \nhave no complaint concerning the time spent. I thought we had spent \nenough time, to inform ourselves and the American people, and it was, \ntherefore, time to vote.\n We had reached a point where minds and intentions were pretty much \nsolidified and it was time for a vote. That time was well spent, Mr. \nPresident. I do not think it is the role of the Senate to move \nlegislation through this body expeditiously for the mere sake of \nexpedition. We got started early in the year, as I have previously \npraised the majority leader for that. And we have not had any recesses. \nI have previously commended the majority leader for that. We have had \ntoo many recesses in recent years; too much accommodation of Members. \nWe do have to accommodate one another here. But we have had too much \naccommodation, often at the expense of thoroughness of debate.\n\n  I have been a Member of the Senate for a long time. Only one other \nMember of the body has been here longer. I have been here when there \nwere all-night sessions, long sessions, Saturday sessions. At times, \nthese are necessary. If it is necessary that we have lengthy sessions, \nwithout recesses, to get our work done, then I do not quarrel about \nthat. I feel it is my duty as a Senator to be at my post of duty, \nwhether it is 10 o'clock on Monday morning or 10 o'clock on Saturday \nnight. Duty calls, and I shall be at my post of duty.\n  Therefore, I am not overwhelmed by references to the number of hours \nor the number of minutes that we have spent on this or that bill. I \nthink we sometimes are prone to overlook the purpose of the Senate and \nof its being. I, too, came from the House of Representatives. I came \nfrom both houses of the West Virginia Legislature. Forty-nine years \nago, I first ran for office. So, my life--most of it--has been spent in \nvarious legislative bodies. The House of Representatives plays an \nimportant role. But the Senate was not meant to be a second House of \nRepresentatives. It was not meant to be a body in which speed in \nlegislating was the overriding standard by which we measure our \nactions.\n  I praise the Senate. The debate was a thorough one. We have had \nthorough debates too infrequently in recent years. Everything seems to \nhave been measured for the purpose of accommodating Senators' \nschedules. Unanimous-consent agreements have been entered into so \nmuch--I probably have arranged more unanimous-consent agreements than \nany other Senator in the history of the Senate, because for 22 years I \nwas in the leadership in this Senate in one position or another. Even \nunder my predecessor, Mr. Mansfield, who was a very fine Senator, and a \nfine leader, who served longer as majority leader than any other \nSenator has served, but he was perfectly happy to have me do the floor \nwork. And I did it. I stayed on the floor. If anyone wanted to know \nwhere Robert Byrd could be found at a given time, they could go to the \nfloor of the Senate. They would find him there.\n  Therefore, I for many years studied the rules and precedents of the \nSenate and its history. My reverence for the Senate grew as time went \nby. I do not claim that I walked into the Senate with it. The reverence \nthat I have, came as the years have come and gone. I revere the Senate. \nMy reverence was reinforced in this recent debate.\n  Let me read what Daniel Webster had to say about the Senate on March \n7, 1850.\n\n       Mr. President, I wish to speak today, not as a \n     Massachusetts man, nor as a northern man, but as an American, \n     and a Member of the Senate of the United States. It is \n     fortunate that there is a Senate of the United States; a body \n     not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to a just sense of \n     its own dignity, and its own high responsibilities, and a \n     body to which the country looks with confidence, for wise, \n     moderate, patriotic, and healing counsels.\n\n  I think that the Senate rose to its full measure of duty in the \ncourse of the recent debate. I can understand the emotions of different \nMembers in the Senate and their purposes for voting for or against the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. There are those who \nfelt deeply that by the amendment, the Social Security trust fund would \nhave been raided. I share that view to some extent. But, Mr. President, \nI hope that we do not lose sight of the fact that, at least in the \nopinion of some of us here, what was about to be raided, was the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  I have voted for constitutional amendments before, as I say. But on \nthis occasion, we were about to adopt a constitutional amendment that \nwould go to the very heart of our structure of republican government, \nwith its mixed powers, its checks and balances. Additionally, we were \nabout to write into that Constitution a fiscal theory or fiscal policy \nwhich, in the minds of many who are far more expert than I, with \nrespect to the economy and with respect to fiscal matters, would have \nbeen very destructive of this Nation's economy and would have resulted \nin economic chaos.\n  To me--to me--the greatest disaster that we in this body could bring \ndown upon our Nation and its republican form of government, would be to \nadopt a constitutional amendment such as was rejected on yesterday. And \nI hope now that we will get a little bit above and beyond talking about \nadditional efforts to write such an amendment into the Constitution--a \nConstitution that has served our Nation so well for 206 years and that \nwas created by men with great intellect, great wisdom, great \nexperience, great vision. I trust that we will not let politics govern \nus in our judgments here with respect to tampering with the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  We are all politically partisan to some extent. I do not envy the job \nof the majority leader or the job of the minority leader. Theirs is a \ntough job. When I became majority leader, I probably lost 10 points in \nWest Virginia. I had been accustomed to winning by 89 percent, or at \nleast very high percentages. When I became majority leader, and \nmajority whip before that, and even secretary of the Democratic \nconference before that, as I moved on and took over the main party \nleadership duties, I realized that I also had a constituency here in \nthe Senate whose ideologies ran the entire spectrum, from one end to \nthe other. Consequently, the duty of party leadership impacts on one's \nvotes and his way of seeing various issues and what his duties are. A \nleader has to remember that he has duties to his constituents who send \nhim here, duties to the Nation, \n[[Page S3462]] duties to his State, and duties to his constituent \ncolleagues here in the Senate who elect him to the party leadership \nposition which he has sought. I know the pressures that build on both \nleaders.\n  I do not envy those who carry such pressures. I worked with Mr. Dole \nfor a good many years in different capacities--as minority leader and \nas majority leader. I always worked well with him, and he with me.\n  As I look at our new leader on this side of the aisle, I admire him. \nI think he demonstrated true statesmanship in his leadership on the \namendment. It was difficult for him. But he rose to the needs of that \ncritical hour of yesterday, and he helped all of us to come together \nand to reach a decision. There were other profiles in courage--Senator \nHatfield, as I have previously mentioned, and others whose names I laid \ninto the Record on yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will put away the seductive attraction of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget as we try to deal with \nthis very serious problem that confronts our country. A constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, I suppose, would be, to some \nproponents, a political cover for serious actions that they very well \nknow are going to have to be taken if we are ever going to effectively \nreduce the deficits. They seek such a political cover to which they can \npoint when their votes are needed to raise taxes or to cut programs. \nThey can then point to a constitutional amendment that has been welded \ninto that organic law and say, well, that made me do it.\n  Mr. President, that is a terrible price to pay. We ought not seek \nthat cover, because it is purely a political cover and it comes at the \nprice of the Constitution. We ought not do that to our children and \ngrandchildren. We do owe it to our children and grandchildren to come \nto grips with this problem--the debt, the deficits, the interest on the \ndebt. And we have operated on a national credit card for the last dozen \nto 15 years.\n  There is going to have to be some pain involved in any deficit \nreduction plan, if it is to be truly effective. I deplore the current \ntalk of tax cuts. Having been a legislator now for almost half a \ncentury, I know how easy it is to vote for tax cuts. I know how hard it \nis to vote for tax increases. I have voted for some of both. But, Mr. \nPresident, we cannot face this terrible debt--it is almost $5 \ntrillion--this terrible deficit and the interest on the debt, and talk \nglibly about cutting taxes and balancing the budget, while keeping \ndefense and other programs off the table. It is a joke. We ought to go \nto the mirror and look ourselves in the face, look ourselves in the eye \nand ask, ``Do you really believe that we can get a handle on these \nterrible deficits and continue to cut domestic programs that are for \nthe well-being, security and happiness of our people, and, at the same \ntime, cut taxes when the economy is good and unemployment is down?'' I \njust cannot believe we are living in a real world. If anything, we are \ngoing to have to increase taxes. If we really mean business about \ngetting the deficits under control and balancing the budget by the year \n2002 or 2010, whatever, we have to understand that we are going to have \nto pay a price, and it is going to be painful.\n  I have heard the gauntlet thrown down today. We will see how many \nSenators will vote for tough proposals, it is said. But I note always \nthat nobody includes in those tough decisions the possibility or the \nprobability that we may even have to vote to increase taxes. If we \nreally mean to be serious about balancing the budget, we ought not \nleave possible tax increases off the table. It is certainly foolish to \ntalk about going in the other direction and cutting taxes in the \npresent climate.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that we will put yesterday behind us. I have \nalways tried to be magnanimous in defeat as well as in victory. It is \neasy to be magnanimous in victory. The test is, can one be magnanimous \nin defeat? We ought not look back. Lot's wife looked back and she \nbecame a pillar of salt. We ought not look back to yesterday. We ought \nnot rake over the old ashes of yesterday. I hope that the American \npeople will not perceive us as being Senators who put politics ahead of \nthe good of the Nation. Political party is important, but George \nWashington warned us against party and factions.\n  I am a Democrat. I grew up in a coal miner's home. They were \nDemocrats who raised me. I have never read a political party platform, \nState or national. I do not have any intention of ever reading a party \nplatform. Party is not first, last, and always with this Senator.\n  It is not the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end. There \nis life beyond political party. Party ranks with this Senator somewhere \ndown about here (pointing)--not up here. We will, of course, have \npolitical parties as long as the Republic stands, I am sure.\n  But I fear that the people must be discouraged, perplexed, and \nsaddened when they listen to some of the things that are being said \nhere about what happened yesterday. It is sad. The people must surely \nbelieve that party is everything to us politicians. Party is important, \nbut the people must not get the impression that some of us see the \nSenate as merely a crucible in which to mould the party's fortunes over \nthe next 50 to 100 years. Mr. President, that is a sad impression to \nconvey.\n  We hear a great deal about the so-called Contract With America. Mr. \nPresident, I, too, ran in the last election. The primary criticism that \nmy opponent used on me was that I had defeated a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. ``Vote Robert C. Byrd out of office and \nwe will get a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution,'' he \nurged. So that vote was used against me.\n  But I carried all 55 counties in my State. I am grateful for the \nfaith of Democrats and Republicans and Independents in West Virginia. \nThey gave me every county for the first time in the State's history. I \nhave carried every county in primaries before, but no candidate for \noffice in a statewide, contested general election in West Virginia has \never carried all 55 counties. I carried them all. I am not bragging. I \nam simply saying that this issue was used on me in the last election.\n  I voted for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget back in \n1982. I voted against a constitutional amendment to balance the budget \nin 1986. I voted against a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget in 1994.\n  So why did I change? I began to look at this issue and to study it. I \ncame to the conclusion that I had voted the wrong way in 1982. I have \nchanged my viewpoint and I will never--never, never--again vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I do not think such an amendment has any business being in the \nConstitution. Our Framers did not believe that fiscal policy or fiscal \ntheory should be written into the Constitution of the United States. \nThey believed, and rightly, that fiscal policy should be left to the \nelected representatives of the people, because, when one considers the \nvicissitudes of time and the vast vacillations in the economy, the \nchanging circumstances from month to month or year to year, then one \nshould surely perceive that fiscal policy is something that should \nremain flexible and outside the verbiage of the Constitution. It should \nnot be welded into the Constitution, where it would be inflexible and \nrigid and would result in chaos.\n  One cannot but conclude that this business about a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget has become the Holy Grail in the minds \nof many politicians. But we do the people of this country a great \ndisservice, in my judgment, when we lead them to believe that a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget will correct the fiscal \nills that confront us. Sooner or later, we will rue the day that we did \nit. It will be regretted.\n  Moving toward the goal of a balanced budget is a job that has to be \ndone. And sometimes, one may have to be willing to sacrifice his \npolitical career to achieve that goal.\n  One may say, ``Well, look at him. He's 77 years old. Perhaps he \ndoesn't have much of a political career left.''\n  But let us not be too quick to judge. I have taken difficult \npositions before in this body that have cost me votes.\n  Yet, when one stands on a principle in which he believes, and, \nconcerning which he has given the most serious study and reflection \nover a period of many years, then, he may say,\n\n     come one, come all! this rock shall fly\n     From its firm base as soon as I!\n[[Page S3463]] as did Fitz-James to Sir Roderick in Scott's ``The Lady \nof the Lake.''\n  One may so stand if he stands solidly on principle. Even those who \ndisagree with him will say, ``Well, I don't agree with him, but he says \nwhat he believes and\n that is what we want. He takes his stand.''\n\n  I do not hold myself to be a paragon of principle. But having been in \npolitics 49 years and having lived 77 years, I have learned a few \nthings along the way. One cannot compromise principle and expect to be \nable to defend his position with passion and with conviction.\n  Winning the White House is important. Winning control of the Senate \nis important. Winning control of the House is important. Winning \nreelection is important. But all this shall pass. In the final \nconclusion, when one walks out of this Chamber forever, he has to look \nin the mirror and he will say, ``Old boy, you stood the test.'' Or he \nhas to look at himself and in his own conscience know that, on the \ngreat national issues of the day, he failed to stand the test.\n  Conclusions on great national issues should always be reached by much \nstudy. And people sometimes reach different conclusions after much \nreflection. I say that this amendment is not worth the price--it is not \nworth the price--of shooting an arrow into the heart of the charter of \nthe people's liberties.\n  This amendment, in my judgment, would have brought about the \ndestruction of the constitutional system of mixed powers and checks and \nbalances. And that is the central pillar of the charter of our \nliberties.\n  That was the genius of the Framers of the Constitution. They were men \nof great experience. They knew about the history of Englishmen, who had \nshed blood for the liberties of Englishmen and for the right of the \npeople to elect their representatives to Parliament. The people of \nEngland, sometimes with the sword, found their way to what became the \ngreat British Constitution. It is not written, except in the form of \ncertain documents, certain statutes, the Petition of Right, \nconfirmation of the charters, the Magna Carta, court decisions, custom, \nand so on.\n  Our forebears knew about that great British Constitution. They knew \nthe history of the struggle of our forebears in the motherland. James \nWilson was born in Scotland. Robert Morris, who was the financier of \nthe revolution, was born in England. Their roots to the motherland were \nvery close to them. They also knew about classical Rome.\n  I have read that a certain Senator spoke derisively about my yen for \nRoman history and for taking up the time of the Senate to talk about my \nlittle dog Billy. Well, I only have this to say. If one does not study \nhistory, he is not likely to be remembered by history. As far as my \nlittle dog Billy is concerned, during my long life I have at times \nthought that the more I learn about dogs the less I think of some \npeople. There is no deceit in Billy. No deceit in a dog. No devious \nways in a dog. But I accept those criticisms and laugh about them.\n  Mr. President, the Senate did the right thing yesterday, and I make \nno apology for my part. We all at times get carried away and perhaps \nsay things, perhaps a little untactfully, but one cannot expect always \nto be absolutely perfect in his approach to things. I look at \nyesterday's passing as something that is gone. I hope other Senators \nwill look at things of the past in the same way.\n  We all have a job to do here. We ought to recognize that the American \npeople have reposed their confidence in us. This is an honor, Mr. \nPresident, that should weigh heavily upon every Senator. The American \npeople did not have to send me here. The people of West Virginia did \nnot have to send me here. They did not have to return me when I sought \nto be returned. They demonstrated the same faith in each of us, and \nthey expect us to carry out our responsibilities.\n  What the American people would like to hear from their \nrepresentatives is the truth. We do the people of this country a great \ndisservice when we play upon their emotions and when we play pure \npolitics with the vital concerns of a nation that confront us here.\n  Surely we must know that in our hearts. I hope we will turn our backs \non yesterday and that we will seek to come together, because achieving \na balanced budget will require bipartisanship. We can keep on pointing \nthe fingers and bickering and trying to jockey around and get the upper \nhand in a political squabble, looking to the next election. We can \npoint the fingers at those who voted this way or that way or some other \nway, but each time I point my finger at you, Mr. President, I point \nthree fingers at myself. I point three fingers at myself.\n  For God's sake, can we not forget politics once in a while? Does \npolitics mean everything? Does politics mean that we have to scramble \nand scratch and crawl over the bodies of other people to achieve \nvictory for a political party? The Framers did not know anything about \nthe Democratic Party or the Republican Party when they wrote that \nConstitution. It saddens me.\n  We are all politically partisan sometimes, but, Mr. President, we \nshould not pay just any price for political victory. Not just any \nprice. Every day that goes by, I feel a greater appreciation for this \nConstitution. I have read all of the 85 Federalist Papers. Five by John \nJay: the second, third, fourth, fifth, and 64th Federalist Papers; two-\nthirds of the papers, approximately, were written by Hamilton; and the \nremainder by Madison.\n  If one really wants to get a true understanding of this political \nsystem, and if one really wants to marvel at the genius of the men who \nwrote this Constitution, let him or her read the Federalist Papers. The \nFramers were well-acquainted with Plutarch, and Polybius, Tacitus, \nLivius, Suetonius, and other great ancient historians. They also knew \nthe history of England. They were familiar with Montesquieu, Locke, \nPlato, Aristotle, Cicero--they were men who counseled with history.\n  Yet, here we are, tinkering with their handiwork as though it were a \nplatform in some so-called Contract With America. I have not read the \nContract With America. I do not owe it any allegiance. None! I try to \nremind those who may feel a little perturbed by that, that I also do \nnot read any Democratic or Republican platforms. But I do read the \nConstitution. And it is too magnificent a piece of handiwork--by the \nmost illustrious gathering of men that ever met anywhere at a given \ntime in history--to risk destruction by an amendment to balance the \nbudget. Here we are, with our little feeble perceptions, attempting to \ntinker with that great document. Not only to tinker with it but to \ntinker in a way that would destroy the fundamental pillars of its \nstructural design.\n  There was never anything like it--never--in the history of the world, \nand we Pygmies, 206 years later, would assault, by way of a political \namendment--a political amendment to give ourselves cover--assault that \nConstitution. This was not a proposed statute yesterday we were talking \nabout. A statute can be changed, as we all know, by the same Congress \nthat enacted it, but not so with a constitutional amendment. Not a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Men have died and shed their blood to keep in place this fundamental \ncharter of liberties, unblemished, untarnished, and unstained. And \nhere, we go about glibly talking about a constitutional amendment to \nthat great document--a document so great that we refer to it from time \nto time as being immortal.\n  We should not look back on yesterday as a defeat. It was a victory \nfor the American people. They may not realize it, but it was a victory \nfor the American people. There were courageous men and women here who \nstood firmly against the amendment.\n  I do not denigrate those who voted the other way. A lot of those men \nand women have courage, too, and they have good intentions. But study \nthat Constitution! Study the Federalist Papers! Study the history of \nthe United States of America, study the history of England, study the \nhistory of Rome, study the history of the ancients, and then match the \nwisdom you have acquired with that of those who know little about \nhistory, who care even less, who know little about the Constitution, \napparently, and who put party--political party--ahead of everything.\n  There are many things above party--one's family, his duty to his \nMaker. That is first, and his duty to his oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  [[Page S3464]] Mr. President, I think we ought to try to bind up our \nwounds. We all ought to look ahead and work together with the goal in \nmind and in heart that we are going to reduce the budget deficits, even \nthough it hurts. I do not like to vote to increase taxes, and it is not \nbecause I am 77. Who knows, Abraham lived to be 175. I may be around \nawhile yet. No man knows how long he will be around, whether he will be \naround for the next election or not.\n\n       Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a \n     day may bring forth.\n\n  While we are here, let us be true to our oath, and let us be able to \nlook in that mirror when the last day comes and say, ``Old boy, you \ndidn't bend.''\n  So I hope we will move away from this talk that, well, I want to vote \nfor a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but this is just \nnot the right amendment. Mr. President, in my view, there is not any \namendment that is the ``right amendment'' to the Constitution when it \ngoes to the heart of the constitutional system of mixed powers and \nchecks and balances and when it comes to writing fiscal policy into \nthat great document. It has no place in the Constitution. Forget about \nit.\n  Let us move away from that plateau. That is a low plateau. Now that \nthe amendment has been rejected, let us get down to business and work \non the problem. Let us all be willing to take a little skin off the \nfinger or off the back of the head, or wherever. If it means cutting \nsome of my programs that I am interested in, well, we will just have to \ncut them. I took a cut yesterday in the Appropriations Committee, \nseveral million dollars in respect to something that is very vital to \nmy State, coal research. I said somebody has to give.\n  Now, let us take that attitude. I do not want to give on everything, \nbut we all have to give up something. Let us not challenge other \nSenators' courage by saying, ``We'll see if you vote for the tough \ndecisions'' unless we are also willing to lay on that table another \ntough option--the option of tax increases. Then the American people \nwill understand we mean business.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude, I have been in the minority and I have \nbeen in the majority. I have won at times, and I have lost at times. \nBut I have to face tomorrow, and the Senator who may be my opponent \ntoday may be my champion tomorrow. These things pass. But we cannot \navoid the real problem that faces us, and we all ought to do our level \nbest to play down party just a little bit. Not only those people out \nthere beyond the beltway will have to sacrifice; we are going to have \nto sacrifice, too. We may have to take a little political skin off our \nbacks.\n  Come what may, let us remember--I have heard much about children and \ngrandchildren around here in this debate. We all love our children, we \nall love our grandchildren, and we all want them to honor us as we have \nhonored our fathers. The greatest thing we can do in this difficult \nsituation is to preserve the Constitution for them,\n not put political careers or political parties ahead of the \nConstitution, and work hard to achieve a bipartisan plan to reduce the \ndeficits and balance the budget.\n\n  If I might be so immodest, I would like to repeat my own words which \nare written in ``The Senate 1789-1989,'' volume 2.\n\n       After 200 years, the Senate is still the anchor of the \n     Republic, the morning and evening star in the American \n     constitutional constellation * * *. It has weathered the \n     storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and the \n     attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength to \n     the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty, \n     panics and depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the \n     sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of \n     a political minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--\n     the great forum of constitutional American liberty!\n\n  Thank God for the Senate! Thank God for the Constitution! Thank God \nfor men and women who will rise above the sorry spoils of politics and \nstand for that Constitution! We can then say, with Longfellow:\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'T is but the wave and not the rock;\n     'T is but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights from the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee, are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, has time for morning business expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of S. 497 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3460-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3464-S3465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE WORDS WILL FLY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are obviously getting close to \nclosing up business for the day. Over the weekend, I am sure we are \ngoing to hear a lot about what took place in these Chambers these last \nfew days, about who was right, who was wrong, who was accused of \ndeception, who was taking the unique responsibility for being the one \nor the ones who wanted to tell the truth, who wanted to be honest with \nthe American people. The words will fly, Mr. President, at a fairly \nrapid pace.\n  I think one thing ought to be said, because I have been here now a \ndozen years. I came out of the business community, and I do not \nremember the people in the boardrooms where I spent some time, or \npeople in business conferences where I spent a lot of time, or people \nwho shared in the responsibilities in these companies--I very seldom \nheard a business leader, a CEO, a chairman of the board saying, ``I \nhave been fleecing my customers and I have been doing it for a long \ntime, but we do not have to do anything else.''\n  Around here, in these last days, I heard people suggest that we ought \nto tell the American people the truth, that we ought to stop the \ndeception, that we ought to come straight. I do not know who they were \ntalking about. I can tell you I resent it if the accusation includes me \nand some of the finest people I have ever known who worked hard here \ntrying to do their best, trying to always level with the public. Yes, \nwe could have a difference on either side of the aisle. We could have a \ndifference in the way the information is presented. We could have a \ndifference in the way the slant is tilted.\n  But I do not remember, in my angriest moment with someone with whom I \ndisagreed, saying that they are lying, or saying that they are telling \nuntruths because they disagreed with a position that I took.\n  I have heard rhetoric from the House that says we have been picking \nthe pockets of the American citizens way too long. I do not know who \ndoes that, Mr. President. Occasionally, there is someone in this \nCongress of ours who does commit a dishonest act or who breaks the \nrules. That is true. But it is wrong to suggest we collectively are \ndoing this purposefully to take advantage of the public.\n  Many are here at wages far less than they might earn in the outside \nworld, and take abuse far more than they might take in the outside \nworld. It is far more disruptive to family life than it would be in the \noutside world, when you know you can get home for dinner and review \nyour kids' lessons or say hello to your spouse and enjoy some moments \nof relaxation. It is not possible here. We all talk about the quality \nof life and how we would like to \n[[Page S3465]] make it better and how tough it is, when your home is in \nMinnesota or New Jersey or New York or Idaho, to be sitting here in \nWashington, which is our workplace for the most part, not our home \nState and not our house where family exists. So there is always that \nkind of thing to consider.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, those who serve here are not looking for \nsome particular advantage.\n  I believe that, even, again, with those with whom I most disagree, \nthey are here because they believe that we have a purpose; that this \ncountry of ours is such a valuable asset and we are so lucky to live in \nthis Nation that they want to serve and serve honestly.\n  Sometimes the rhetoric escapes and we start talking about things that \nare nonsense, about how we have been tricking the American people. It \nis not true.\n  We just had a vote on the balanced budget amendment that lost \ntemporarily, a balanced budget amendment to change our Constitution. \nThere are many who voted against the balanced budget amendment--almost \nevery one--who would like to see life made easier on our citizens and \non ourselves by balancing the budget, by getting our House in order.\n  Mr. President, we heard references so many times to the way \nindividuals, businesses, and States conduct their affairs. They say \nthey balance their budgets. Those who suggest that willy-nilly do not \nknow what they are talking about, because the average family is far \nmore in debt because they try to own a house or a piece of property \nthat they feel will be an asset to pass on to future generations, and \nthey leave far more debt when they pass on in a situation like that \nthan is being suggested as laid out in front because of the way we \nconduct business here.\n  Businesses borrow money constantly. I do not know of any company of \nsize--and I am a student of business, as well as a former business \nleader. I am considered a pioneer in the computing industry, one whose \nname is listed in the Data Processing Hall of Fame. It does not compare \nto my colleague, Bill Bradley's, identification with the Hall of Fame \nof Basketball, but it is a hall of fame, as small as it may be.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that there were many times \nwhen I discussed business problems with leaders and they talked about \ntheir borrowing and they talked about their indebtedness and they \ntalked about what they had to do now to plan for the future.\n  State after State, including my own that has a balanced budget \nrequirement, nevertheless, has the opportunity to borrow for capital \ninvestments and either put it up as collateral or go to the marketplace \nfor bonds to be paid off over a period of years. We do not have that \nsensible structure in Federal Government. And that is a point, I think, \nthough discussed many times, that is still not clear.\n  If we in the U.S. Government make the decision to build a building \nthat has a 50-year life and we can build it in 1 year and it costs $1 \nbillion, we charge off $1 billion in that fiscal year. If it were in \nthe business world, it would be written off at the rate of about \n$20,000 a year. Excuse me, I have not been doing arithmetic enough \nsince I have been out of the business world. But the fact of the matter \nis, it would be written off over a period of time. We do not do that \nhere.\n  In many ways, our financial house is in far better condition than \nmany here would admit.\n  Mr. President, we were looking for responses from those who supported \nthe balanced budget amendment in relation to Social Security and \nMedicare. What would happen if we did not use the Social Security trust \nfund to force a better balance on our books than we have? We asked for \nthose proponents to lay out a budget that would balance; let them do \nthe arithmetic.\n  It never happened, Mr. President, because we pretended that by force \nfeeding the process, that we could achieve something that we would not \ndo on our own even though our constituents sent us here specifically \nfor the purpose of watching out for their interests.\n  I can tell you, Mr. President, that the balanced budget amendment, \nhad it gone into place or if it goes into place, would severely impair \nlife and the economy in the State of New Jersey. We could be looking at \ntax increases of 17.5 percent to make up for the funds that we would \nnot be getting from the Federal Government. We would lose $2.1 billion \na year in funding for Medicaid. We would lose almost $200 million a \nyear in highway trust fund grants. We would lose almost $1 billion a \nyear in lost funding for education, job training, the environment, \nhousing, and other areas. To restate, New Jersey would have to increase \nState taxes by 17.5 percent across the board to make up for losses in \ngrants.\n  On the jobs side of things, the most critical index, according to the \nTreasury, by forcing Congress to raise taxes and/or cut spending in a \nrecession, the balanced budget amendment would substantially worsen the \neffects of economic downturn.\n  During the recession of 1990 to 1992, the unemployment rate in my \nState of New Jersey rose from 4.9 percent to a peak of 9 percent. Had \nthe balanced budget been in effect, unemployment in New Jersey would \nhave peaked at a much higher level, somewhere, it is estimated, between \n9.9 percent and 11.8 percent. Had the balanced budget been in effect, \nthe unemployment rate in New Jersey would have been punitive. Thus, Mr. \nPresident, the balanced budget amendment would not have done my State \nany good.\n  What will do my State good is if all of us get together and work to \nbalance the budget, whether it is in the year 2002 or 2010. The fact is \nif we put this on an ever-decreasing glidepath from where we are, we \nwill be substantially better off, better off than having a law that \nwould force feed our economy into an unnatural structure that could be \nthe most painful decision that this country has seen, perhaps, in its \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, I close by asking the question, where's the beef? \nWhere is the interest by those who propose the balanced budget \namendment, into presenting a budget that will, in fact, balance itself, \nreduce the deficit, ultimately wind up in a zero annual deficit.\n  Let them produce it. I am on the Budget Committee, Mr. President. I \nam more than willing to work with the distinguished leader of the \nBudget Committee and the ranking member to try and devise a budget that \nanswers that need. Right now, I do not see a willingness to tackle the \nproblem. I see an intent, rather, to do the politically satisfying or \nadvantageous thing.\n  It is regrettable, Mr. President, that we had the kind of bitter \nrhetoric that permeated this place in these last couple of weeks. I do \nnot think it does the Congress any good. I do not think it does the \ninstitution any good. I do not think it does the country any good.\n  Right now there is chaos in the currency markets across the world. \nThe dollar is dropping rapidly. I think much of it is due to the fact \nthat there was such dire forecasts made here that unless we balance the \nbudget, unless we took this artificial means of dealing with our fiscal \nresponsibilities that catastrophe would fall.\n  I hope that that is not true, Mr. President. As I said earlier, I \noften disagree with colleagues on the other side, sometimes with \ncolleagues on this side. I really believe that in this body, in this \ninstitution, there are people whose will is good, who want to do the \nright thing.\n  I would not accuse any of those who take a different position of \nlying to the public, of trying to deceive the citizens of the country. \nNo, Mr. President, I think we ought to cool the rhetoric and get on \nwith our responsibilities. I hope that in the next weeks we will do \njust that. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3464-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3465-S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n                      WAS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE?\n                       THE VOTERS HAVE SAID YES!\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to balance the Federal budget by fiscal year 2002 \nthrough the establishment of Federal spending limits; to the Committee \non the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, \npursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions that if one \nCommittee reports, the other Committee have thirty days to report or be \ndischarged.\n\n\n          the balanced budget/spending limitation act of 1995\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Rod Grams, \nSpencer Abraham, and Larry Craig to introduce the Balanced Budget/\nSpending Limitation Act of 1995, a bill designed to balance the budget \nby fiscal year 2002, through the establishment of Federal spending \nlimits and sequestration. An identical bill is being introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representatives Jim McCrery and Mel \nHancock.\n  The Balanced Budget/Spending Limitation Act establishes a mechanism \nto limit spending and enforce limits. It establishes a Federal spending \nlimit as 21.5 percent of the gross domestic product in fiscal year \n1996, declining one-half percent of GDP per year to 19 percent in \nfiscal year 2001.\n  In subsequent years, Federal spending would have to balance with \nrevenue but could not exceed 19 percent of the gross domestic product. \nAny excess of spending over receipts or the Federal spending limits \nwould be eliminated by sequesters, including a new fiscal year start \nsequester designed to hold a fiscal year's spending accountable for any \nactual deficit in the prior year.\n  The Federal spending limits in the Balanced Budget/Spending Limit Act \nare established in recognition of the fact, as the Senator from Idaho \nsaid a moment ago, that revenues have fluctuated only within the narrow \nbands of 18 to 20 percent of the gross domestic product for the last 40 \nyears, despite tax increases, tax cuts, economic contractions, and \nexpansions and fiscal policies pursued by Presidents of both parties.\n  In effect, the economy has already imposed an effective limit on how \nmuch revenue the Federal Government can raise--19 percent of the gross \ndomestic product, exactly the level of today. While tax rate increases \nand tax cuts may produce temporary surges and declines in revenue, \nrevenues always adjust at about 19 percent of GDP, and that is because \nchanges in the Tax Code affect people's behavior. Higher taxes \ndiscourage work, production, savings, and investment, slowing economic \ngrowth. And with less economic activity to tax, of course, revenues to \nthe Treasury are never as great as the tax writers expect.\n  On the other hand, lower tax rates stimulate work, production, \nsavings, and investment so revenues to the Treasury increase even at \nlower tax rates.\n  With that in mind, the only way that Congress really can ever balance \nthe budget is to ratchet spending as a share of GDP down to the level \nof revenues the economy has historically been willing to bear--19 \npercent of GDP.\n  Limit spending, and there is no need for Congress to consider tax \nrate increases. It would not be allowed to spend any additional revenue \nthat it raised. Besides, as reflected in historical trends, tax rate \nincreases are more likely to slow economic growth than produce \nadditional revenue relative to the gross domestic product.\n  Link spending to economic growth, as measured in terms of GDP, and a \npositive incentive is created for Congress to support pro-growth \neconomic policies. The more the economy grows, the more Congress is \nallowed to spend, although always proportionate to the size of the \nNation's economy. In other words, 19 percent of a larger GDP represents \nmore revenue to the Treasury and, thus, more than Congress is allowed \nto spend, than 19 percent of a smaller GDP.\n  The advantages of the Federal spending limits are thus threefold.\n  First, it will get us to a balanced budget by limiting spending, not \nincreasing tax rates; second, it will shrink Government relative to the \nsize of the economy; and third, it gives Congress a strong incentive to \nsupport policies that will keep the economy healthy and strong, \npolicies of less taxation, less regulation and less spending that the \nAmerican people are demanding anyway.\n  For those Members of the Senate who voted against the balanced budget \namendment saying Congress could do the job if it only had the courage \nand the will, well, here is your chance. For those who express concern \nabout Social \n[[Page S3467]] Security, this bill provides for protection of the trust \nfunds that we promised during the debate on the balanced budget \namendment. The balanced budget amendment will never be a threat to \nSocial Security.\n  Mr. President, with or without a balanced budget amendment, deficit \nspending must stop. We know that. The economic security of the Nation \nis at stake. The future of our children and our grandchildren is at \nstake as a result of the mountain of debt Congress is leaving behind.\n  This bill we are introducing today defines the glidepath and includes \nthe enforcement mechanism to get the budget to balance, and I am going \nto urge its prompt consideration by this body so that we can \nimmediately demonstrate to the State legislatures, to the people of \nthis country and, frankly, to many of our colleagues who did not \nsupport the balanced budget amendment yesterday that we mean business, \nthat we mean to balance this budget by the year 2002 and that we are \nprepared to begin the steps to achieve that goal. One of the first \nsteps should be the adoption of legislation such as this to establish \nthe framework for achieving our goal.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mrs. KASSEBAUM:\n  S. 495. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to stabilize \nthe student loan programs, improve congressional oversight, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the student loan evaluation and stabilization act\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I introduce the Student Loan \nEvaluation and Stabilization Act. Similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House by Congressman Goodling and others.\n  The provisions of this bill are designed to accomplish four main \ngoals:\n  First, to cap the direct loan program at 40 percent of student loan \nvolume;\n  Second, to correct problems in the budget scoring process which \nresult in an inaccurate accounting of the full costs of the direct loan \nprogram;\n  Third, to clarify congressional intent on a number of provisions of \nthe legislation which established the direct loan program; and\n  Fourth, to level the playing field with respect to direct loans and \nguaranteed loans so that they can be evaluated based on real \ndifferences in the administration, efficiency, and effectiveness \nbetween the two programs.\n  It is no secret that I have serious reservations and concerns about \nthe direct loan program enacted into law last Congress in the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act, otherwise known as OBRA 1993.\n  I am troubled that the President is proposing a further expansion of \nthis program in his fiscal year 1996 budget request. This proposal, \nwhich would institute 100 percent direct lending by academic year 1997-\n98, amounts to a total Federal takeover of a successful public/private \nsector partnership--the Student Loan Program. This approach stands in \nstark contrast to the ``reinventing'' Government message promoted by \nVice President Gore, where the focus is on privatizing more Federal \nfunctions and reducing the size of the Federal Government.\n  I can support a demonstration of a direct loan program, but I believe \nthat the small 5-percent demonstration included in the Higher Education \nAct Amendments of 1992 was adequate. I believe that OBRA 1993 went far \nbeyond a demonstration in allowing for the eventual replacement of 60 \npercent of the Federal guaranteed student loan program with a direct \nloan program.\n  Thus, my legislation would cap the direct lending program at the \nlevel specified in current law for the second year of the program--\npermitting up to 40 percent of the total student loan volume to be made \nthrough direct Government loans. All schools which signed participation \nagreements with the Department of Education in 1994 to enter the \nprogram in July of this year will be able to enter the program, but the \nprogram will not expand beyond this level until Congress authorizes \nsuch an expansion.\n  Restoring the direct loan program to a more appropriate demonstration \nlevel will allow for a more thoughtful evaluation and comparison of the \nguaranteed Federal Family Education Loan [FFEL] Program and the Federal \nDirect Student Loan [FDSL] Programs. It will allow both programs to \noperate with continued stability until Congress has enough information \nto determine which program is more effective and cost-efficient for \nstudents, institutions of higher education, and taxpayers.\n  Through the reconciliation process, the 103d Congress made a \nsubstantial change in the student loan program without the benefit of \ncomprehensive hearings or debate or of any evaluation results of the \ndirect loan demonstration included in the 1992 higher education \namendments.\n  This change was made in order to take advantage of the current budget \ntreatment of direct loans--which produces an inaccurate picture of its \ntrue budgetary consequences because certain direct loan costs are \nexcluded in the scoring. These distortions have been well-documented by \nthe Congressional Budget Office. It is unfortunate that serious policy \ndecisions were driven by a budget process which hid the true costs of \nthis program.\n  As evidence of this shell game, the Department of Education has \ncriticized the companion bill introduced by Representative Goodling \nstating that it would increase costs or budget outlays by $4.9 billion \nbecause the bill would change the budget scoring process. The \nDepartment's analysis notes that this change in the scoring process \n``does not change the long-term cost of the Direct Loan program, it \nonly changes when those costs are scored for budgetary purposes.''\n  This analysis illustrates the frustrating situation we face in \ngetting a handle on the real costs of direct lending. What the \nmaterials developed by the Department say, in effect, is that current \nscoring practices undercount $4.9 billion in costs for the current \ndirect loan program! Moving to 100 percent direct lending to claim more \nsavings, as proposed by the President, will only compound the problem. \nWe cannot and should not continue to operate in this type of budgetary \nFantasyland.\n  The Department's criticism is also disingenuous because a change in \nscoring would not increase costs or force the Congress to pay for the \nscoring change. It would simply allow the direct and guaranteed student \nloan programs to be scored in the same manner so we can truly compare \nthe costs of the two programs.\n  Therefore, I have included in this legislation an amendment to the \nCongressional Budget Act that would provide a more accurate comparison \nof direct and guaranteed student loans.\n  The bill also clarifies congressional intent with respect to several \nprovisions of the direct loan authorization legislation. Specifically:\n  First, my legislation specifies that direct consolidation loans are \nintended to be offered only to students with guaranteed loans who \ncannot obtain consolidation loans or income-contingent repayment from \nparticipating guaranteed loan lenders. This clarification is important, \nas the administration is in the process of developing a plan that could \nresult in transferring millions of dollars worth of guaranteed loans \ninto the direct loan program through the direct consolidation loan \nprogram. The magnitude of this program, as well as the circumstances \nunder which the administration envisions it would apply, goes far \nbeyond congressional intent in providing authority for consolidation \nloans.\n  Second, the bill makes clear that Department officials must calculate \ndefault rates for direct lending schools just as they do for guaranteed \nloan schools. To date, Department officials have not indicated how they \nwill calculate default rates for direct loan schools or for students \nthat select income-contingent loan repayment. Many schools with high or \nrising default rates entered the direct loan program because they saw \nthis as a way to escape penalties for high default rates or to reduce \ntheir default rates.\n  Third, in order to determine the effect of income-contingent \nrepayment on institutional cohort default rates, the bill also requires \nthe Department to report various data on loans being repaid through \nsuch repayment.\n  Finally, the bill clarifies certain provisions of the law which the \nDepartment has interpreted and implemented in a way that gives direct \nlending an edge over the guaranteed loan program. True comparisons \nbetween the two programs are not possible with such differences. Thus, \nmy bill levels \n[[Page S3468]] the playing field between the two programs.\n  Having described what my bill does, I would also like to clarify what \nthe bill does not do.\n  First, the changes that I am proposing will have no effect on student \naccess to Federal loans, on the costs of those loans to students, or on \nthe amount that students may borrow. There is a widespread \nmisconception that the direct loan program offers lower fees and \ninterest rates than those available to guaranteed loan borrowers. This \nis simply not the case.\n  The issue in this debate is who should be making the loans and \nproviding the capital--the Federal Government or the private sector. \nThe issue is not the availability or cost of loans to students.\n  Second, my legislation will not reduce the number of repayment \noptions available to students. The repayment options available to \nstudents in the guaranteed loan program are virtually identical to \nthose in the direct loan program. Students have multiple repayment \noptions available to them in both programs--including options to repay \nover longer periods of time or to make smaller initial payments which \ngradually increase over time as earnings increase.\n  In fact, my bill will increase the number of repayment options \navailable by permitting students in the guaranteed loan program to \nrepay their loans based on their incomes--an option now available only \nto students participating in the direct loan program. I would hope that \nstudents would exercise caution in selecting this option, given that it \ncould greatly increase the amount they end up repaying. However, I feel \nthe option should be made available to both guaranteed and direct loan \nstudent borrowers--many of whom may otherwise default on their loans.\n  As the legislative process continues, I will be keeping an open mind \nto other program changes designed to maximize the benefits of private \nsector participation in the Federal student lending program while \nholding down the costs to taxpayers. These changes could include steps \nsuch as increased risk-sharing by lenders and guaranty agencies--\ncoupled with relief from burdensome and unnecessary regulations.\n  It is my hope that Congress can act promptly to correct the problems \nI have identified, so that decisions regarding Federal student loans \ncan be made on the basis of sound policy rather than on flawed budget \nscoring procedures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 495\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Student \n     Loan Evaluation and Stabilization Act of 1995''.\n       (b) References.--References in this Act to ``the Act'' are \n     references to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     1001 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The current public/private student loan partnership is \n     fulfilling the mission set for it by Congress, delivering \n     loans to students reliably and in a timely fashion, and \n     should be preserved.\n       (2) The Administration's dismantling of the Federal Family \n     Education Loan (FFEL) Program which has begun in order to \n     replace it with an unproven direct Government lending \n     program, which increases the Federal debt, further enlarges \n     the Federal bureaucracy, adds major new financial oversight \n     activities to the already overburdened Department of \n     Education, and forces Congress to depend on estimated budget \n     savings which may prove illusory, needs to be stopped so that \n     a true and valid comparison of the student loan programs can \n     occur.\n       (3) The Federal Direct Student Loan (FDSL) Program pilot is \n     only now getting started and has proceeded fairly smoothly \n     when dealing with 5 percent of new loan volume. This slow and \n     cautious approach should be continued as the volume increases \n     to 40 percent.

The bill makes four findings upon \n     which the legislation is based. The findings highlight the \n     fact that the Federal Direct Student Loan Program (direct \n     loan program) is in its pilot phase and that a slow and \n     cautious approach toward implementing the program should be \n     continued. The findings further emphasize that the federal \n     debt, further enlarges the federal bureaucracy, adds major \n     new financial oversight activities to the Department of \n     Education, and forces Congress to depend on an estimated \n     budget savings that may prove illusory. In addition, the \n     findings note that reform of the Federal Family Education \n     Loan Program (guaranteed loan program) should be a continuing \n     priority of the Department of Education.\n       Section 3. Participation of Institutions and Administration \n     of Direct Loan Programs.\n       Subsection (a). Participation in direct loans is limited as \n     follows:\n       (1) five percent of new student loan volume for academic \n     year 1994-1995;\n       (2) for academic year 1995-1996 loans to those students and \n     parents of students attending institutions who have applied \n     and been accepted for participation in the direct loan \n     program on or before December 31, 1994.\n       Subsection (b). The authority of the Secretary to force \n     schools into the direct loan program is eliminated.\n       Subsection (c). Section 458 of the HEA is amended so that \n     administrative expenses for the direct loan program under are \n     made available on an entitlement basis to cover the full \n     administrative costs of direct loans made under Part D. These \n     costs are recognized on a net present value basis under the \n     Credit Reform Act amendment in section 11 of this \n     legislation.\n       This section also establishes ``funding triggers'' for the \n     release of funds under section 458. Funds may be obligated \n     only in such amounts and according to the schedules specified \n     under the Appropriations Act for the Department of Education \n     after submission of a detailed proposal for expenditures \n     under this section.\n       In addition, this section also directs the Secretary to \n     produce a detailed quarterly report of the expenditures of \n     monies under section 458.\n       Finally, this section mandates payment of an administrative \n     cost allowance to guaranty agencies based on the following \n     formula: .85 percent of the total principal amount of the \n     loans for which insurance was issued during the fiscal year, \n     or .08 percent of the original principal amount of the loans \n     guaranteed by the program that are outstanding at the end of \n     the previous fiscal year. Agencies elect which formula under \n     which to receive payment.\n       Subsection (d). References to the transition to the direct \n     loan program are eliminated from the HEA.\n       Section 4. Direct Loans Have the Same Terms and Conditions \n     as Federal Family Education Loans. The legislation clarifies \n     and strengthens Congressional intent that direct and \n     guaranteed loans have essentially the same terms, conditions, \n     eligibility requirements, and loan limits.\n       Section 5. Ability of Borrowers to Consolidate Under Direct \n     and Guaranteed Loan Programs.\n       Subsection (a). Borrowers of direct loans under Part D are \n     made eligible to consolidate such loans into a Federal \n     Stafford Consolidation Loan.\n       Subsection (b). The HEA is clarified to reflect \n     Congressional intent that a guaranteed loan borrower is only \n     eligible to obtain a direct consolidation loan when they are \n     unable to obtain a consolidation loan from a lender. The law \n     is also modified to limit eligibility of a guaranteed loan \n     borrower to those students who are unable to obtain a \n     consolidation loan with an income-contingent loan repayment \n     schedule from a lender.\n       This section also requires the Secretary to establish \n     appropriate certification procedures to verify eligibility of \n     borrowers and it prohibits the Secretary from offering \n     consolidation loans if the Department lacks the capacity or \n     if the projected loan volume would destabilize the \n     availability of guaranteed loans.\n       Section 6. Income Contingent Repayment in the Federal \n     Family Education Loan Program. The legislation authorizes \n     guaranteed student loan borrowers to repay their loans \n     through income-contingent repayment to lenders like in the \n     direct loan program.\n       Section 7. Reserve Fund Reforms. The legislation requires \n     due process procedures, including a hearing on the record, \n     for the return of guaranty agencies reserve funds. The \n     legislation further restricts the expenditure of such funds, \n     and those funds otherwise recovered by the Secretary, by \n     requiring the funds to be returned to the U.S. Treasury.\n       Section 8. Default Rate Limitations on Direct Lending. This \n     section clarifies the HEA to reflect Congressional intent \n     that the Secretary is required to calculate default rates for \n     direct lending schools and to terminate such schools if they \n     exceed the default rates established in the law as is done \n     currently for the guaranteed loan schools.\n       This section also requires the reporting of data on direct \n     loans being repaid through income-contingent repayment in \n     order to determine the effect of such repayment on cohort \n     default rates.\n       In addition, section 455 of the HEA is modified by \n     directing the Secretary to develop criteria for the \n     calculation of default rates for institutions participating \n     in the direct loan program. The methodology, criteria, and \n     procedures to be used in determining \n     [[Page S3471]] such default rates must be comparable to those \n     applied to schools participating in the guaranteed loan \n     program under Part B of the HEA. Such standards must be \n     promulgated no later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this legislation or the Secretary may no longer \n     make any new direct loans.\n       Section 9. Use of Electronic Forms. This section permits \n     the development, production, distribution and use of an \n     electronic version of the common application form by guaranty \n     agencies, lenders, and consortium thereof to expedite the \n     processing of student loans. Requires that the Secretary \n     approve the form to ensure it is consistent with the \n     requirements of the HEA. Allows the applicant to certify that \n     the output of the application is accurate in a subsequent \n     document. The legislation prohibits a fee from being charged \n     to students in connection with the use of this form.\n       Section 10. Application for Part B Loans Using the Free \n     Federal Application. Section 483(A) of the HEA is amended to \n     clarify that the application may be the Free Application for \n     Federal Student Assistance (FAFSA). The legislation also \n     clarifies that the application may be in an electronic or \n     other format in order to facilitate use by borrowers and \n     institutions. Finally, this section clarifies that data shall \n     be available to any guaranty agency authorized by an \n     institution.\n       Section 11. Credit Reform. The bill modifies section \n     502(5)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act to require \n     consideration of direct and indirect expenses associated with \n     Federal Direct Student Loans, including, but not limited to, \n     expenses arising from credit policy and oversight, credit \n     extension, loan origination, loan servicing, training, \n     program promotion, and payments to contractors. The amendment \n     would apply to all fiscal years beginning on or after October \n     1, 1995, and to statutory changes made on or after the date \n     of enactment of this bill.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Robb):\n  S. 496. A bill to abolish the Board of Review of the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n the board of review of the metropolitan washington airports authority \n                         abolition act of 1995\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on January 26, 1995, I joined with my \ncolleagues Senators McCain and Robb in introducing legislation in the \nSenate to abolish the Board of Review of the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority.\n  Mr. President, I have been involved for many years in seeking to \ndevise a legislative solution to the constitutional issues that exist \ndue to the decisions of the Congressional Board of Review.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, I have learned that the legislation \nwhich my colleagues and I introduced does include a provision which I \ndo not support. The provision is contained in section 3 of the \nlegislation which is the elimination of the perimeter rule with respect \nto certain nonstop flights.\n  After further review and analysis of this provision, and after \nconsultation with the Governor of Virginia and the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority, I have learned that adoption of such a \nprovision would be detrimental to the current and projected operations \nof Washington National Airport and Washington Dulles International \nAirport. Eliminating the perimeter rule could in the short term disrupt \nexisting air service patterns, with nonstop flights to cities within \nthe perimeter being canceled as flights are added to more distant and \neconomically beneficial destinations. In the longer term, both the \nairlines and the cities that could suffer a loss in nonstop service to \nNational could call for increases in the number of flights allowed at \nNational.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along with my \ncolleague Senator Robb, which will seek to abolish the Board of Review \nof the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\n  Mr. President, our legislation would: First, remove the \nunconstitutional sections of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Act; \nsecond, provide a savings clause to protect all actions of the \nAuthority taken under the old legislation; and third direct the \nSecretary of Transportation to amend the Authority's 50-year lease.\n  This legislation provides a necessary cure to a constitutional \ndeficiency as defined by the Federal courts, in the structure of the \nAirports Authority, which is operating and improving the two airports \nthat serve the Nation's Capital and the Washington region, Washington \nNational and Washington Dulles International.\n  In April 1994, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit found that the Board of Review, made up of current and former \nSenators and Members of Congress, violated constitutional separation of \npowers principles. This was the second time the courts have struck down \nthe Board of Review,\n which was designed to represent users of the airports and to preserve \nsome Federal control over them.\n\n  The court of appeals stayed its decision until the Supreme Court had \ntime to consider the issue. The Supreme Court decided not to hear the \ncase in January, and the stay expires March 31, 1995.\n  Therefore, I repeat, all Congress is required to do to keep the \nairports in operation is to pass this legislation. Such continued \nuninterrupted operations are essential to the travel requirements of \nMembers of Congress and their staffs.\n  If the Congress does not amend the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAct by that date, the Airports Authority Board of Directors will lose \nall its power to take basic, critical actions, including the ability to \naward contracts, issue more bonds, amend its regulations, change its \nmaster plans, or adopt an annual budget.\n  This shutdown could not come at a worse time. The Airports Authority \nis in the middle of a $2 billion construction program between two \nairports.\n  In 1986, the Congress transferred the airports to an interstate \nagency created by the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of \nVirginia. We did this because we recognized that an independent state-\nlevel authority could do what the Federal Government apparently could \nnot--issue revenue bonds and undertake the major construction that was \nso long overdue at both airports.\n  The Airports Authority has done a credible job carrying out \ncongressional intent. It has sold over $1.3 billion in tax-exempt \nbonds, and has multimillion dollar projects underway to double the size \nof the Dulles terminal and replace many of the National Airport \nfacilities with a modern new terminal building.\n  As of today, the Authority has already completed $331 million in \nconstruction projects, and has an additional $416 million under \nconstruction. The steel superstructure at National is visible to all; \njust this week, construction crews topped off the new 220-foot high air \ntraffic control tower there.\n  Thus, we cannot afford to interrupt this construction progress by \nCongress not acting by March 31, 1995. The Congress must pass this \nlegislation now.\n  Mr. President, recently the House Transportation subcommittee on \nAviation adopted H.R. 1036, the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAmendments Act of 1995. This legislation contains provisions which we \ncannot support at this time.\n  Specifically, the legislation imposes a reauthorization provision in \nwhich the Congress would reauthorize the Airports Authority every 2 \nyears. Also, the statutory freeze on the 37 slots under the high \ndensity rule would be repealed. This would mean that the Federal \nAviation Administration would be able to increase slots through a \nrulemaking process.\n  Mr. President, all the Congress must consider now--before March 31--\nlegislation to abolish the Congressional Board of Review. Any further \ndelays will result in slowing the schedule and increasing the costs of \nthe major construction projects at both airports.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 497. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to provide for \nthe protection of civil liberties, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                act to end unfair preferential treatment\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, momentarily I am going to send a bill to \nthe desk for introduction but I want to make a few remarks before I do \nthat.\n  First of all, this bill will simply get us started along a road that \nthe Senate ought to have taken a long time ago. Senator Dole may have a \nsimilar bill, in which case I will gladly serve as a cosponsor of his \nbill, and I feel sure that he will want to be a cosponsor of mine. \nThere may be others. But somebody has to start the ball rolling and \nthat is what I am doing here at about 18 minutes until 3 p.m. on \nFriday.\n  [[Page S3472]] Mr. President, unless I am badly mistaken, when the \nbill I shall offer today hits the hopper there is likely to be the \nusual outburst of usual phony demagoguery among our liberal brethren in \nthe political arena and in the news media. It always happens when a \nproposal is made to do away with any Federal program that was \nestablished in the first place to attract votes for liberal candidates \nand liberal issues.\n  The liberal brethren can begin their holier than thou lamentations, \nbecause here comes the bill that proposes to eliminate so-called \naffirmative action programs that have done more harm than good in terms \nof race relations, which have been exceedingly costly to the American \ntaxpayers, and worst of all, have been so burdensome for people trying \nto operate small businesses or, in fact, businesses of any size.\n  This legislation, which I shall send to the desk presently, is almost \nidentical to the California Civil Rights Initiative which proposes to \nerase several decades of State-sponsored preferential programs in \nCalifornia based on race, color, gender, or ethnic background. If you \nwant to call it the Helms bill that is fine, but I want to call it, \n``An Act to End Unfair Federal Preferential Treatment.'' And I hope \nthat hereinafter it will be known as that.\n  This bill's principal difference with the California legislation is \nthat I am proposing to eliminate the same kinds of discriminatory, \nexpensive, and counterproductive programs on the Federal level as \nCalifornia is attempting on the State level.\n  As I said at the outset, Mr. President, we are likely to hear and see \nthe customary antics by the liberal news media who always start tossing \nepithets around any time efforts are proposed to put an end to Federal \nprograms that do not work and that have done more harm than good--in \nthis case, the heavy-handed effort of Government to force so-called \naffirmative action down the throats of the American people of all \nraces.\n  But I say, here and now, that this legislation--indeed this issue--is \nnot about race--although an intellectually dishonest liberal media may \ntry to portray it as such. It is about fairness. It is about putting an \nend to reverse discrimination at the hands of ruthless bureaucrats.\n  Reasonable men and women may disagree about the wisdom of the \nGovernment's having gotten into the business of racial and other \nquotas, and affirmative action in the first place. But, now is not the \ntime to revisit that argument, or to attempt to unscramble that egg. \nAnd that is not what this legislation is all about.\n  Rather, Mr. President, this legislation is based on questions being \nraised by a vast percentage of the American people. For example:\n  First, with a Federal debt of $4.8 trillion, can Congress justify \nforcing the American taxpayers to continue paying for programs that are \ntoday no longer needed?\n  Second, should Congress--which so recklessly ran up this $4.8 \ntrillion debt--now act to do away with the social engineering \nfoolishness that is so harming the country?\n  Third, after 30 years of federally funded affirmative action \nprograms, it is now time to say enough is enough.\n  Fourth, should America return to the fundamental principles laid out \nprayerfully, and with specificity, by our Founding Fathers?\n  Is not the answer ``yes'' to each of these questions?\n  Of course it is.\n  You see, Mr. President, the American dream has been within the reach \nof citizens of all races, religions, and ethnic backgrounds because our \nNation has adhered for so many years to the principles of free \nenterprise, self reliance, personal responsibility, and, of course, the \nconcept that every citizen should be free to pursue his or her personal \ndream--based not on birthright, but rather on hard work, initiative, \ntalent, and character.\n  The now-entrenched, but nonetheless discriminatory system of \naffirmative action preferences established by Congress, the courts, and \nvirtually every Federal agency flies in the face of the merit-based \nsociety that the Founding Fathers envision, which is why my \nlegislation, aimed at removing these preferences, is called the ``Act \nto End Unfair Federal Preferential Treatment.''\n  Mr. President, I am convinced this legislation reflects the thoughts \nof countless citizens across America of every color and creed who \nstruggle each day to make the American dream become a reality--to own \ntheir own homes, raise their families, and provide educations for their \nchildren. But the all-powerful Federal Government somehow manages to \nget in the way at nearly every turn. This is the thing that we must put \nan end to.\n  Those familiar with the debate surrounding affirmative action and \nquota programs likely have heard of the California Civil Rights \nInitiative, which residents of that State will vote upon as early as \nnext March. For those unfamiliar with this initiative, it reads:\n\n       Neither the State of California nor any of its political \n     subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity \n     or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating \n     against, or granting preferential treatment to, any \n     individual or group in the operation of the State's system of \n     public employment, public education or public contracting.\n\n  As I stated previously, the Act To End Unfair Federal Preferential \nTreatment--which I will shortly send to the desk--differs in that it \nputs an end to taxpayer funding of such programs on the Federal level.\n  Mr. President, polls show that 73 percent of Californians support \nthis initiative to roll back racial and other quotas and preferences. \nBut California is not alone in this sentiment. According to a recent \nWall Street Journal/NBC News survey, 2 out of every 3 Americans--\nincluding half of those who voted for President Clinton--oppose so-\ncalled affirmative action.\n  This demonstrates, I believe, that the American people are once again \nfar ahead of their leaders in Washington. Americans recognize that such \nprograms are divisive, discriminatory, and in fact, harm the very \ncitizens they claim they want to help. In short, these programs pervert \nthe concept of equality. As Senator Malcolm Wallop, the great statesman \nfrom Wyoming, put it, ``Any government that is not strictly blind in \nmatters of race is quite simply un-American.''\n  Mr. President, we simply cannot afford to continue to pour money into \nineffective and ultimately destructive affirmative action programs when \nthe total Federal debt, as of March 1, stood at exactly \n$4,848,389,403,816.26. That is $18,404.57 for every man, woman, and \nchild in America.\n  Of course, those who pay taxes--because so many do not--will pay even \nfar more than that in the theoretical sense of how much it will cost to \npay off the debt.\n We must stop wasting the taxpayers' money on programs that \ndemonstrably cannot and will not work.\n\n  If the California initiative passes, one legislative analysis \npredicts that high schools and community colleges would save $120 \nmillion a year in administrative costs. Universities would save another \n$50 million a year. Think of the savings we could realize if Federal \nprograms are terminated nationwide. It boggles the mind.\n  Let me offer a few examples of Government-sponsored affirmative \naction programs that are so counterproductive and divisive they make me \nwonder how much more of this we can swallow. These few programs are \nonly the tip of the iceberg.\n  First, the State Department has been instructed that certain new \npositions must be filled with women and minorities rather than white \nworkers. The administration complained when a State Department list of \ncandidates for ambassadorial posts did not contain enough minorities \nand women. The White House returned the list to Secretary Christopher.\n  Second, the Federal Communications Commission has for years \nimplemented a program where women and minorities are given special tax \nbreaks and special incentives to enable them to acquire mass media \nfacilities, such as radio and television stations.\n  The most well-known example is the special tax break that Viacom, the \nworld's second largest entertainment conglomerate, is trying to use. \nUnder current FCC law, Viacom can defer $1.1 to $1.6 billion in taxes \non the sale of its cable operations simply by selling them to an \nAfrican-American buyer. And this buyer just happens to be the same man \nwho conceived the minority tax-break program while working on FCC \nissues in the Carter White House. \n[[Page S3473]] This minority buyer now plans to invest $1 million of \nhis own money in the acquisition. I ask you, Mr. President, is this \nsomeone in need of a Federal preference? I say no way, Jose.\n  Third, the Forest Service has a firefighter program where certain \npositions can be filled only with women or minorities. And a North \nCarolina constituent and Forest Service employee recently sent me \narticles regarding an internal Forest Service document that actually \nstates, ``Only unqualified applicants will be considered.'' This policy \nwas supposed to be a set-aside for women. So much for qualifications \nbeing important.\n  Fourth, and what about the Defense Department's special hiring \ndirective that said, ``special permission will be required for \npromotion of all white men without disabilities.''\n  Mr. President, I have it on good authority that there are more than \n160 such preference programs in place today in the Federal bureaucracy. \nThat is what this bill is aimed at. And who pays for them? That is \nright. The American taxpayers pay for them.\n  Citizens visiting my office frequently note on my office wall a \npicture of a man who was a friend of all of us who served with him, \nHubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Hubert was the author of the original \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. True enough, Senator Humphrey and I disagreed \non just about every policy issue but we disagreed agreeably. We were \nfriends, nevertheless. And I respected him for having the courage of \nhis convictions, wrong as I thought those convictions were sometimes. \nHe stated many times to me that my feeling about him was mutual, and I \nappreciated that.\n  In any event, Hubert Humphrey was exactly right when he stated during \na debate in this room over the Civil Rights Act of 1964:\n\n       * * * if there is any language [in the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964] which provides that any employer will have to hire on \n     the basis of percentages or quotas related to color, race, \n     religion or national origin, I will start eating the pages \n     one after another because it is not there.\n\n  Well, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, recently remarked,\n\n       Now we all have indigestion from living in an America where \n     the government too often says that the most important thing \n     about you is the color of your skin or the country of your \n     forefathers * * * that's wrong, and we should fix it.\n\n  I agree with Senator Dole. Bob Dole was on target, and hopefully the \nlegislation that I am introducing today will serve as a first step \ntoward fixing this problem.\n  As I said at the outset, I anticipate that Senator Dole may offer \nlegislation on this subject. I hope others will too so that we can all \nthink together and act together on a problem that should not be allowed \nfurther to beset the greatest country on Earth.\n  But, Mr. President, back to Hubert Humphrey. Hubert Humphrey hated \nthe idea of quotas and preferential treatment based on race. He knew \ninstinctively that such programs, if instituted, would turn America \ninside out--which is exactly what has occurred: there is much evidence \nthat so-called affirmative action programs have exacerbated racial \nproblems--not healed them. Former Secretary of Education William \nBennett put it this way.\n\n       Affirmative Action has not brought us what we want--a \n     colorblind society. It has brought us an extremely color-\n     conscious society. In our universities we have separate \n     dorms, separate social centers. What's next--water fountains? \n     That's not good, and everybody knows it.\n\n  George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center had this \nobservation regarding how divided a country America has become:\n\n       People have not grasped the extent to which the notion of \n     governmentally appointed preference groups is pernicious to \n     American democracy * * * They have not grasped what it means \n     to balkanize the United States. My guess is that there will \n     be a tremendous revolt against this.\n\n  Paul Sniderman of Stanford University and Thomas Piazza of the \nUniversity of California recently completed a book, ``The Scar of \nRace.'' These authors demonstrate that whites are more likely to view \nAfrican-Americans in a negative light if they are first asked questions \nabout affirmative action. Here's what Sniderman and Piazza found:\n\n       A number of whites dislike the idea of affirmative action \n     so much and perceive it to be so unfair that they have come \n     to dislike blacks as a consequence.\n\n  Parenthetically, Mr. President, that is an awful state of affairs, \nbut I believe it to be true. It should not be true, but it is. The \nauthors continued:\n\n       Hence the special irony of the contemporary politics of \n     race. In the very effort to make things better, we have made \n     some things worse.\n\n  Sharon Brooks Hodge, an African-American writer and broadcaster, \nperhaps summed it up best when she observed:\n\n       * * * white skepticism leads to African-American \n     defensiveness * * * Combined, they make toxic race relations \n     in the workplace.\n\n  And, as is the case with so many forays into social engineering by \nthe Federal Government, affirmative action and quota programs, have, at \nthe end of the day, harmed the very people their proponents designed \nthem to assist. Peter Schrag of the San Diego Union-Tribune hit the \nnail on the head when he asked:\n\n       To what extent will the real achievements of minorities be \n     diminished by the suspicion that they got some sort of break?\n\n  Although Federal agencies designed affirmative action programs to \nbenefit victims of discrimination at the lowest rungs of the economic \nladder, today they benefit chiefly educated, middle-class minorities. \nAs Linda Chavez, the Hispanic leader and President of the Center for \nEqual Opportunity and former staff director of the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights under President Reagan, observed today's government \naffirmative action programs benefit those who can make it on their own.\n  Mr. President, after 30 years of affirmative action, America now \nfinds itself a more racially ethnically divided society than ever \nbefore. The cohesiveness which once brought all of us together as \nAmericans first is slipping away.\n  After 30 years, it is obvious that this social experiment called \naffirmative action has outlived its usefulness. It is time for the \nFederal Government to scrap these programs, and restore the principles \nupon which our country was built--personal responsibility, self-\nreliance, and hard work.\n  Mr. President, that formula for achievement was the answer 200 years \nago and it is still the same today. And I might add, it is the only \nroad to reaching the American dream for all our citizens, whether they \nbe black, white, Hispanic or Asian, men or women. The Act To End Unfair \nFederal Preferential Treatment is the first step toward this dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following items be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks following the \ntext of the bill, an August 21, 1994, article by Peter Schrag of the \nSan Diego Union Tribune; a February 15, 1995, article by Linda Chavez \nin USA Today; and a February 13, 1995, article by Steven Roberts in \nU.S. News & World Report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                 S. 497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in \n     Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

That's What Affirmative Action Policies \n        Imply, Though You Won't Hear Its Liberal Backers Say So\n\n                           (By Linda Chavez)\n       Bethesda, MD.--For years I've suspected that many liberals \n     favor affirmative action because they believe blacks and \n     Hispanics can't measure up to the same standards as whites, \n     but it's been difficult to get any of them to say so \n     publicly.\n       Now Rutgers University President Francis L. Lawrence, a \n     staunch proponent of affirmative action throughout his \n     career, has let the cat out of the bag.\n       In comments to a faculty group discussing the school's \n     admission criteria, Lawrence referred to blacks as a \n     ``disadvantaged population that doesn't have the genetic, \n     hereditary background'' to score equally with whites on the \n     Scholastic Aptitude Test.\n       Lawrence has since apologized for his comments--which he \n     now says he doesn't actually believe--and students have led \n     angry protests demanding his resignation.\n       But the fact is that affirmative-action programs at \n     universities around the country operate as if Lawrence were \n     right.\n       They routinely apply lower admission standards to black and \n     Hispanic applicants, all the while pretending that such \n     double standards won't reinforce negative stereotypes and \n     stigmatize students admitted under them.\n       The University of California at Berkeley, for example, \n     admits black and Hispanic students with test scores and \n     grade-point averages significantly below those it requires of \n     both white and Asian students.\n       Berkeley is one of the few universities that has made \n     available such information, even on a limited basis.\n       In 1989, Berkeley turned away approximately 2,800 white \n     students with perfect 4.0 GPAs--straight As. But half of the \n     minority students it admitted that year had below a 3.53 GPA.\n       And contrary to the assumptions of many affirmative-action \n     supporters, students admitted on the basis of lower test \n     scores and grades aren't necessarily economically \n     disadvantaged graduates of poor inner-city schools.\n       At Berkeley, for example, the Hispanic student admitted \n     through the affirmative action program comes from a middle-\n     class family, and many if not most attended integrated \n     schools, often in the suburbs.\n       In fact, 17% of Hispanic entering freshmen admitted to \n     Berkeley in 1989 came from families that earned more than\n      $75,000 a year, as did 14% of black students.\n       Statistics like these make it increasingly difficult for \n     advocates to argue that affirmative action is intended to \n     benefit disadvantage minorities.\n       One Mexican-American student told researchers studying the \n     Berkeley program she was ``unaware of the things that have \n     been going on with our people, all the injustice we've \n     suffered, how the world really is. I thought racism didn't \n     exist, and here, you know, it just comes to light.''\n       No doubt she was referring to the political indoctrination \n     many minority students receive in such programs so they'll \n     know how ``oppressed'' they really are, despite attending one \n     of the world's elite institutions of higher learning.\n       But the comments that racism at Berkeley ``just comes to \n     light'' might just as well apply to the university's own \n     admission standards, which clearly do treat applicants \n     differently according to their race.\n       Affirmative action advocates can't have it both ways. A \n     system that depends on holding minorities to different--and \n     lower--standards than whites invites prejudice and bolsters \n     bigotry.\n       But it also sends a clear message to the intended \n     beneficiaries that those who claim to want to help minorities \n     don't really believe blacks and Hispanics can ever measure up \n     to whites.\n       Most supporters of affirmative action no doubt would be \n     horrified that anyone might interpret their intentions so \n     malignly. But their actions speak as loudly as words.\n\n\n                         what others are saying\n\n       ``We are happily at a time when a number of the \n     compensations that were earlier advanced to make up for \n     earlier discrimination are no longer needed.''--Calif. Gov. \n     Pete Wilson.\n       ``If the president respects the goal of affirmative action \n     as fully as he should, he might gain political support from \n     voters who believe in pursuing an integrated society. * * * \n     But if he ignores the subject and lets critics set the terms \n     of the debate * * * he's likely to be stuck with affirmative \n     action as a thin cover for nasty, race-minded politics--the \n     Willie Horton issue of 1996. And it's likely to contribute to \n     his loss.''--Lincoln Caplan, Newsweek magazine contributing \n     editor.\n       ``The people in America now are paying a price for things \n     that were done before they were born. We did discriminate. * \n     * * But should future generations have to pay for that?''--\n     Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.\n       ``We know that affirmative action has created problems, \n     abuses we didn't contemplate. But if you eliminate or \n     severely curb * * * then what?''--Calif. Lt. Gov. Gray Davis.\n       ``(It's) going to be hell. * * * You better make sure you \n     prepare for it.''--Franklyn Jenifer, president of the \n     University of Texas at Dallas, warning college administrators \n     of a backlash from minority students if affirmative action \n     policies are removed.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           [From the U.S. News & World Report, Feb. 13, 1995]\n\n Affirmative Action on the Edge--A Divisive Debate Begins Over Whether \n          Women and Minorities Still Deserve Favored Treatment\n\n       Affirmative action is a time bomb primed to detonate in the \n     middle of the American political marketplace. Federal courts \n     are pondering cases that challenge racial preferences in \n     laying off teachers, awarding contracts and admitting \n     students. On Capitol Hill, the new Republican majority is \n     taking aim at the Clinton administration's civil rights \n     record. On the campaign trail, several Republican \n     presidential hopefuls are already running against affirmative \n     action. And in California, organizers are trying to put an \n     initiative on next year's ballot banning state-sanctioned \n     ``preferential treatment'' based on race or gender.\n       This increasingly angry and divisive debate about the role \n     of race and gender in modern America could help the \n     Republicans unseat Bill Clinton in 1996 and change the way \n     many institutions allot jobs, business and benefits. A recent \n     Wall Street Journal NBC News survey found that 2 out of 3 \n     Americans, including half of those who voted for President \n     Clinton in 1992, oppose affirmative action. The Los Angeles \n     Times found 73 percent of Californians back the ballot \n     initiative. ``The political implications are enormous,'' says \n     Will Marshall of the Democratic leadership Council, a \n     moderate group. ``Obviously, a lot of Republicans look at \n     affirmative action as the ultimate wedge issue.''\n       The assault on affirmative action is gathering strength \n     from a slow-growth economy, stagnant middle-class incomes and \n     corporate downsizing, all of which make the question of who \n     gets hired--or fired--more volatile. Facing attacks on such a \n     broad front, women's groups, civil rights organizations and \n     other defenders of affirmative action are circling their \n     wagons. Women and minorities still need preferential \n     treatment, they argue, because discrimination still exists, \n     causing blacks and other minorities to lag far behind whites \n     in terms of economic status. ``If African-Americans are \n     taking all these jobs,'' asks Barbara Arnwine of the Lawyers \n     Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, ``why is there double-\n     digit unemployment in the African-American community?'' Adds \n     Patricia Williams, a professor at Columbia Law School: \n     ``There is this misplaced sound and fury about nothing. \n     Access is still very limited, and the numbers are still very \n     low.''\n       But the sound and fury are real. Affirmative action poses a \n     conflict between two cherished American principles: the \n     belief that all Americans deserve equal opportunities and the \n     idea that hard work and merit, not race or religion or gender \n     or birthright, should determine who prospers and who does \n     not. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson defended affirmative action by \n     arguing that people hobbled by generations of bias could not \n     be expected to compete equally. That made sense to most \n     Americans 30 years ago, but today many argue that the \n     government is not\n      simply ensuring that the race starts fairly but trying to \n     decide who wins it.\n       Moreover, many women and racial minorities are no longer \n     disadvantaged simply because of their race or gender. Indeed, \n     most of the young people applying for jobs and to colleges \n     today were not even born when legal segregation ended. ``I'll \n     be goddamned why the son of a wealthy black businessman \n     should have a slot reserved for that race when the son of a \n     white auto-assembly worker is excluded,'' says a liberal \n     Democratic lawmaker. ``That's just not right.''\n\n\n                             disheartening\n\n       The critics of affirmative action include some conservative \n     minority and women's leaders who believe it has a destructive \n     effect on their own communities. Thomas Sowell, the black \n     economist, argues that affirmative action has created a \n     process of ``mismatching,'' in which competition for talented \n     minorities is so fierce that many are pushed into colleges \n     for which they are not ready. ``You can't fool kids,'' says \n     Linda Chavez, a Hispanic activist. ``They come into a \n     university, they haven't had the preparation and it's a very \n     disheartening experience for some of them.\n       [[Page S3475]] Others say affirmative action causes co-\n     workers to view them with suspicion. ``White skepticism leads \n     to African-American defensiveness,'' says Sharon Brooks \n     Hodge, a black writer and broadcaster. ``Combined, they make \n     toxic race relations in the workplace.'' Glenn Loury, an \n     economics profession at Boston University, says proponents of \n     affirmative action have an inferiority complex: ``When blacks \n     say we have to have affirmative action, please don't take it \n     away from us, it's almost like saying, `You're right, we \n     can't compete on merit.' But I know that we can compete.''\n       William Bennett, former education secretary and a leading \n     GOP strategist, says that ``toxic'' race relations, \n     aggravated by affirmative action, have led to a damaging form \n     of re-segregation: ``Affirmative action has not brought us \n     what we want--a colorblind society. It has brought us an \n     extremely color-conscious society. In our universities we \n     have separate dorms, separate social centers. What's next--\n     water fountains? That's not good, and everybody knows it.''\n       But supporters of affirmative action maintain that \n     arguments like Bennett's are unrealistic--even naive. ``We \n     tried colorblind 30 years ago, and that system is naturally \n     and artificially rigged for white males,'' says Connie Rice \n     of the\n      NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``If we abandon \n     affirmative action, we return to the old-boy network.''\n       Voices on both sides of the debate are starting to discuss \n     a possible compromise that would focus eligibility on class, \n     instead of on race or gender. For example, the son of a poor \n     white coal miner from West Virginia would be eligible for \n     special help, but the daughter of a black doctor from Beverly \n     Hills would not. ``Some of the conventional remedies don't \n     work as one might have hoped,'' says University of \n     Pennsylvania law professor Lani Guinier, whose ill-fated \n     nomination as Clinton's chief civil rights enforcer sparked a \n     storm of protest from conservatives. ``Perhaps there is an \n     approach that does not suggest that only people who have been \n     treated unfairly because of race or gender or ethnicity have \n     a legitimate case.''\n       No one questions the sensitivity of the subject. For years, \n     the civil rights lobby, backed by Democrats in Congress, was \n     so strong that critics often felt intimidated. Even today, \n     Democrats who disagree with affirmative action are reluctant \n     to voice their doubts. ``The problem is political \n     correctness--you can't talk openly,'' says a member of \n     Congress.\n       Democrats are talking privately, however, urging the White \n     House to formulate a response to the antiaffirmative-action \n     wave before it swamps the president and the party. At the \n     Justice Department, chief civil rights enforcer Duval Patrick \n     is ready: ``We have to engage; we can't sit to one side.''\n       But despite the fact that the California initiative could \n     cost Clinton a must-win state in 1996, the administration \n     seems sluggish, even paralyzed. Laments a senior adviser, \n     ``We're going to wait until it's a crisis before reacting.'' \n     White House political strategists admit one reason for the \n     inaction: The issue is a sure loser.\n\n\n                                referee?\n\n       Caught between angry white males and the party's \n     traditional liberal base, White House advisers think the best \n     they can do is position the president as an arbiter between \n     two extremes. In a recent interview with U.S. News, the \n     president voiced his aim this way: ``What I hope we don't \n     have here, and what I hope they don't have in California, is \n     a vote that's structured in such a way as to be highly \n     divisive, where there have to be winners and losers and no \n     alternatives can be easily considered.'' Asked his views on \n     affirmative action, the president tried--as he often does--to \n     please both sides: ``There's no question that a lot of people \n     have been helped by it. Have others been hurt by it? What is \n     the degree of that harm? What are the alternatives? That's a \n     discussion we ought to have.''\n       But a senior administration official admits that the middle \n     ground will be an uncomfortable place: ``The civil rights \n     groups are going to say we're caving in if we make any \n     compromises. And the Republicans are going to shout, \n     `Quotas.''' That same tension is already developing within \n     the White House. U.S. News has learned that Chief of Staff \n     Leon Panetta is quietly asking friends on Capitol Hill \n     whether the president should simply endorse the California \n     initiative--a position sure to trigger outrage among the \n     president's more-liberal advisers.\n       Unsure how resolute the White House will be, civil rights \n     groups are looking for their own strategy to defend \n     affirmative action. One of their main jobs, they say, is to \n     debunk the ``myth'' that unqualified women and minorities are \n     being hired in large numbers. And some of the best salesmen \n     for affirmative action are big corporations that adjusted \n     long ago to the demands for a more-diverse work force, dread \n     bad publicity and fear the uncertainty change would produce. \n     James Wall, national director of human resources for Deloitte \n     & Touche LLP, a management consulting firm, says diversity is \n     good business: ``If you don't use the best of all talent, you \n     don't make money.''\n       Even so, the combination of old resentments, new economic \n     hardships and shifting political winds threatens to explode. \n     ``There's a great deal of pent-up anger beneath the surface \n     of American politics that's looking for an outlet,'' says \n     conservative strategist Clint Bolick of the Institute for \n     Justice. It's the same anxiety that helped pass Proposition \n     187 in California, which sharply restricts public assistance \n     to the children of illegal immigrants, and thwarted Clinton's \n     plan to push a Mexican aid plan through Congress. ``If there \n     is a squeeze on the middle class,'' says GOP pollster Linda \n     Divall, ``people get very vociferous if they think their \n     ability to advance is being limited.''\n       Some African-American leaders insist that this white-male \n     anger is being stirred up by demogogues who make blacks and \n     women into scapegoats. Says Derrick Bell, professor of law at \n     New York University: ``There is a fixation among so many in \n     this country that their anxieties will go away if we can just \n     get these black folks in their place.''\n       But the anxieties are strong and are coupled with a growing \n     belief that affirmative action is another aspect of intrusive \n     and inefficient big government. ``The real back-to-basics \n     movement is not in education but in politics,'' says William \n     Bennett. ``We're rethinking basic assumptions about \n     government.''\n       Accordingly, the fight over affirmative action is playing \n     out in four arenas:\n\n\n                               california\n\n       The real question is whether the civil rights initiative \n     will appear on the primary ballot in March of 1996 or on the \n     general-election ballot. If it appears in November, the \n     measure could seriously damage President Clinton's chances to \n     carry the nation's most populous state. That is precisely why \n     national Republicans are promising to raise money for the \n     effort--as long as organizers aim for November.\n       The initiative is the brainchild of two academics, Tom Wood \n     and Glynn Custred, who say they were alarmed by the \n     prevalence of ``widespread reverse discrimination'' in the \n     state's college system. The initiative has already attracted \n     some unlikely support: Ward Connerly, a black member of the \n     University of California Board of Regents, said last month \n     that he favors an end to racial and gender preferences. \n     ``What we're doing is inequitable to certain people. I want \n     something in its place that is fair.'' and Hispanic columnist \n     Roger Hernandez wrote: ``I've never understood why Hispanic \n     liberals, so sensitive to slights from the racist right, \n     don't also take offense at the patronizing racists of the \n     left who say that being Hispanic makes you an idiot.''\n       California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who is black, \n     opposes the initiatives as an attempt ``to maintain white \n     America in total control.'' But other Democrats are scurrying \n     for cover. ``The wedge potential is absolutely scary,'' says \n     Ron Wakabayashi, director of the Los Angeles County Human \n     Rights Commission. ``The confrontation of interests looks \n     like blacks and Latinos on one side and Asians and Jews on \n     the other.''\n\n\n                               the courts\n\n       The Supreme Court has generally supported race and gender \n     preferences to remedy past discrimination, but an \n     increasingly conservative bench has moved to limit the \n     doctrine. In 1989, the court struck down a program in \n     Richmond, Va., that set aside 30 percent of municipal \n     contracts for racial minorities, and that decision set off a \n     flurry of litigation. In the current term, the court already \n     has heard arguments in a key case: A white-owned construction \n     company is claiming that it failed to get a federal contract \n     in Colorado because of bonuses given to contractors that hire \n     minority firms.\n       In another case making its way toward the high court, a \n     black teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was retained while an \n     equally qualified white teacher was fired, in the name of \n     diversity. The Bush administration sided with the white \n     teacher after she sued the school board. The Clinton \n     administration backs the board. Two other cases relating to \n     education are also moving forward. In one, white students at \n     the University of Maryland are challenging a scholarship \n     program reserved for minorities. In the other, the University \n     of Texas law school is being sued for an admissions policy \n     that lowers standards for blacks and Hispanics.\n       While most court watchers do not expect sweeping changes in \n     current doctrine, the high court is closely divided on \n     racial-preference questions, and the deciding\n      votes could be cast by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Legal \n     analysts cite her opinion in a 1993 case challenging \n     voting districts that were drawn to guarantee a black \n     winner: ``racial gerrymandering, even for remedial \n     purposes, may balkanize us into competing racial \n     factions.'' The court's most likely move: require programs \n     to be more narrowly tailored to remedy past \n     discrimination.\n\n\n                                congress\n\n       Republican victories last year mean that critics of \n     affirmative action now control the key committees and the \n     congressional calendar. A strategy session was held last \n     Friday at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, \n     bringing together about two dozen Hill staffers, lawyers and \n     conservative activists. Already, Rep. Charles Canady, the \n     Florida Republican who heads the key House subcommittee, has \n     written to the Justice Department requesting every document \n     relating to affirmative action cases. His goal oversight \n     hearings that try to demonstrate that the administration's \n     civil rights policies far exceed the original intent of \n     Congress.\n       Conservatives are considering amendments to appropriations \n     bills that would restrict the administration's flexibility. \n     There also is talk of a measure banning racial and gender \n     [[Page S3476]] preferences altogether. Civil rights \n     proponents remain confident that Clinton would veto any \n     measure that eviscerates affirmative action and that his veto \n     would survive.\n\n\n                              campaign '96\n\n       The affirmative action issue will be test-marketed this \n     year by Buddy Roemer, a Republican candidate for governor of \n     Louisiana. But it is already intruding into the politics of \n     1996: California Gov. Pete Wilson has all but endorsed the \n     initiative and Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, who will soon \n     announce his presidential candidacy, has taken over the \n     appropriations subcommittee that handles the Justice \n     Department. He will use it, predicts an administration \n     official, ``as a platform to rail against quotas.''\n       The danger for Republicans lies in going too far in \n     attacking affirmative action and courting resentful white \n     males. If the antiaffirmative-action campaign ``turns into \n     mean-spirited racial crap, to hell with it,'' William Bennett \n     warned fellow Republicans.\n       But the questions at the core of the affirmative action \n     debate remain unanswered. How much discrimination still \n     exists in America? And what remedies are still necessary to \n     aid its victims?\n                                                                    ____\n\n           [From the San Diego Union-Tribune, Aug. 21, 1994]\n\n                  The Preferential Treatment Backlash\n\n                           (By Peter Schrag)\n\n       A Republican attempt to prohibit California government \n     agencies from discriminating for or against individuals on \n     the basis of race, ethnicity or gender got a three-hour \n     hearing in the Assembly Judiciary Committee this month, \n     followed by the predictable brushoff from the committee's \n     majority Democrats. ``It is one of the most dangerous pieces \n     of legislation I have witnessed in my four years here,'' said \n     Assemblywoman Barbara Lee, D-Oakland.\n       We should only be so lucky.\n       The California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), a \n     constitutional amendment that would have required a two-\n     thirds vote in each house of the Legislature in order to go \n     on the ballot, had as much chance as a snowball in a furnace. \n     It was sponsored by Assemblyman Bernie Richter of Chico and \n     had some 42 legislative co-sponsors, one of whom was a \n     Democrat and one an Independent.\n       It's a simply worded proposition. Its key passage says, \n     ``Neither the state * * * nor any of its political \n     subdivisions or agents shall use race, sex, color, ethnicity \n     or national origin as a criterion for either discriminating \n     against, or granting preferential treatment to, any \n     individual or group in the operation of the state's system of \n     public employment, public education or public contracting.''\n       Put that proposition to the voters unadorned and you're \n     likely to get a sweep. It's as American as Abraham Lincoln \n     and Martin Luther King Jr.: Judge people as individuals on \n     what they can do, on the content of their character, not on \n     what group they belong to or the color of their skin.\n       It's not the way things work, either in the universities, \n     where much of the push and inspiration for CCRI comes from, \n     or many other places in the public arena. Everywhere there \n     are preferences based at least partly on something else--in \n     hiring, in college admissions and in a thousand subtle other \n     ways.\n       The reasons for some official preferences are obvious \n     enough: 1) to make up for the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination and 2) to try to get in the professions, in \n     the civil service and on the campuses people who, at the very \n     least, are not strikingly different in pigmentation from the \n     rest of the populace.\n       But as the backers of the CCRI point out, the thing has \n     gone to the point where new offenses are committed in the \n     effort to remedy the old: Should there be scholarships \n     reserved for blacks or Hispanics? Should college departments \n     be offered bounties for bagging minorities in their faculty \n     recruiting? Should there be legislative requirements of \n     racial proportionality, not only in university admissions, \n     but in graduation rates?\n       Should people of the right color or sex be given preference \n     in contracting with public agencies, even if it costs the \n     public more? And to what extent should success of a \n     particular ethnic group--Asians in academic achievement for \n     example--itself become a reason for race-based restrictions \n     against them?\n       In some instances, these things have reached such totemic \n     proportions that just questioning them is regarded as \n     evidence of racism.\n       But it's not the whole story. Even CCRI's sponsors, who now \n     hope to get the measure on the ballot by the initiative \n     route, acknowledge that there are colleges that give \n     preference in admission to children of alumni or, as at the \n     University of California, to the offspring of legislators. \n     And there are almost without doubt fire and police \n     departments, and probably other public agencies as well, \n     where it still doesn't hurt to be related to somebody, or at \n     least to know them, whatever the civil service regulations \n     say.\n       More important, there are legitimate sensibilities and \n     experiences that come with certain backgrounds that may well \n     be important in the selection of police officers or in \n     enriching the composition of a campus. Where two candidates \n     are otherwise similarly qualified, what's wrong with giving \n     preference to the one whose parents are immigrants and grew \n     up in the barrio?\n       CCRI's backers point out, correctly, that economic \n     disadvantage could be used more legitimately to accomplish \n     almost the same thing. But the very precision in CCRI's \n     language is likely to run colleges and other state agencies \n     afoul, on the one hand, of federal laws that encourage \n     affirmative action and, on the other, to invite still more \n     suits from disappointed applicants every time there's a \n     suggestion that race or gender might have been used, however \n     marginally, as a criterion.\n       All that being said, however, CCRI nonetheless reflects a \n     set of increasingly serious problems and grievances that, as \n     the state becomes ever more diverse, will become all the more \n     vexing.\n       At what point do objective criteria and real performance \n     become secondary to the politically correct imperatives of \n     diversity, as in some cases they already are, thereby making \n     it harder and harder to maintain standards of quality? To \n     what extent do preferences for marginal candidates lead to \n     frustration when its beneficiaries are overwhelmed?\n       The questions run on: To what extent will the real \n     achievements of minorities be diminished by the suspicion \n     that they, too, got some kind of break? To what extent does \n     the whole process generate mutually self-validating backlash \n     that further institutionalizes race in our society? And at \n     what point, given our growing diversity, do the definitional \n     problems about who is what--definitions, ironically, that \n     squint right back to the slaveholders' racial distinctions--\n     become both absurd and totally unmanageable?\n       The problem may lie as much in the idea of subjecting these \n     processes to a rigid legal formula as in the formula chosen. \n     And it lies in the unchecked spread of the idea that \n     everything--college admissions, college graduation, a job--is \n     an entitlement not to be abridged without due process.\n       But the complaint of the CCRI people is real enough, and it \n     has legs.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, it has been only 2 months since the \nretirement of our former colleague, Senator \n[[Page S3478]] Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, but already it is clearly \napparent that his unique role remains unfilled in this body.\n  None of the phrases coined to describe Howard Metzenbaum--``The \nPeople's Watchdog,'' The Tiger From Ohio--quite does justice to the \nreal service he performed for the public and for the Republic in his \nduties here.\n  Someone of his stature, courage, and sheer persistence comes to the \nfore all too infrequently in public life today.\n  I commend to my colleagues, and to all others who care about this \ninstitution, an article written in the closing days of Howard \nMetzenbaum's Senate service that adds some historic perspective to his \ndistinguished career. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From the Cleveland Plain Dealer, Dec. 4, 1994]\n\n                              Howard's End\n\n                            (By Thom Diemer)\n\n       Metzenbaum was true to form through his last days in the \n     Senate. His leaving was like a fingernail scratching a \n     chalkboard.\n       He always had a chip on his shoulder.\n       His pursed-lipped scowl could intimidate a trash-talking \n     bureaucrat or unnerve an imperious Republican. He knew he had \n     the edge, he confided to aides, once his adversary got angry.\n       Howard Metzenbaum was true to form through his last days in \n     the United States Senate. He went out with neither a bang nor \n     a whimper. His leaving was more like a fingernail scratching \n     a chalkboard.\n       Some of his colleagues squirmed as Metzenbaum battled for \n     one last lost cause. But most shrugged or grinned, saying in \n     so many words, ``That's Howard.''\n       In a special lame-duck Senate session on Thursday, \n     Metzenbaum railed against the General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade, saying it was weighted down with ``deals for big \n     business'' and would ``shortchange American workers.'' He was \n     one of only 13 Democrats voting against the trade pact.\n       His determination, fearlessness and unrelenting \n     partisanship brought him acclaim and notoriety during 19 \n     remarkable years as Ohio's junior senator.\n       ``I think people know I vote in accordance with the \n     dictates of my conscience, not with the political winds,'' he \n     said in an interview last month. ``There are people who hate \n     me with a passion, but when I do meet them, I laugh and kid \n     them, and I tell them I absolutely defend their right to be \n     wrong.''\n       His character was shaped by a work ethic cultivated during \n     the Depression, a commitment to government activism \n     personified by the New Deal, close ties with the American \n     labor movement and an ethical grounding in Reform Judaism.\n       ``I always worked,'' he said.\n       A lean upbringing in Cleveland's Glenville neighborhood \n     fueled his resentment for a system that he saw as stacked \n     against the little guy. Brushes with anti-Semitism opened his \n     heart to the plights of other minorities and persecuted \n     groups.\n                        popularity defied logic\n\n       Metzenbaum's national stature grew as he gained power and \n     influence in the Senate, yet there was no mellowing. He could \n     be vitriolic, blustery and reckless even with retirement \n     looming at the age of 77.\n       He never shed his partisan image.\n       Political analysts puzzled for decades over the secret to \n     his electoral success: How did an acerbic, left-wing \n     ideologue, out of step philosophically with many of his \n     constituents in a Republican-leaning state, become one of the \n     most dominant public figures in Ohio history?\n       ``There is no question that in my political career I have \n     taken strong stands. No question some people were very \n     unhappy with those stands,'' he said at his last Senate news \n     conference. ``But fortunately, enough people decided they \n     were positions of conscience or conviction and they respected \n     me for it. Therefore, a number of them voted for me and I was \n     able to remain in office.''\n       He was a curmudgeon, the last angry liberal.\n       In 1988, his final campaign, he vanquished Cleveland Mayor \n     George V. Voinovich by 588,000 votes. Results strongly \n     suggested more than 1 million Ohioans split their tickets, \n     voting for both Metzenbaum and Republican President George \n     Bush.\n       ``He has been able to convert his liberalism into a \n     populism that not only benefits people on the bottom rungs of \n     the ladder, but also the middle class,'' Ohio State \n     University political scientist Herb Asher once said. ``That's \n     why he has been so successful in Ohio: Howard Metzenbaum is a \n     fighter, and a fighter for us--the middle class.''\n       Ohio Senate President Stanley J. Aronoff, who helped the \n     late Robert Taft Jr. of Cincinnati defeat Metzenbaum in \n     Metzenbaum's first Senate bid 24 years ago, said ``voters \n     have a propensity to like him or dislike him--very little in-\n     between.''\n       ``The interesting thing with Metzenbaum is that, as time \n     went on, he was able to become comfortable even in \n     conservative Cincinnati,'' Aronoff added. ``In some respects, \n     even though his philosophy would be leftish, he came to be \n     regarded as conservative.''\n\n\n                         consistency applauded\n\n       John C. Green, director of the University of Akron's \n     Raymond C. Bliss Institute for Applied Politics, explained it \n     this way: Metzenbaum, he said, had a ``tremendous knack for \n     being right about issues people care about''--job security, \n     pensions, workplace safety, cable television rates and a raft \n     of consumer issues.\n       Conversely, his battles on Capitol Hill against the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, multi-national corporations--or in favor \n     of gays in the military--were of little consequence to \n     average, working Ohioans.\n       ``Talking to people we hear over and over again, `I don't \n     like Metzenbaum, I don't agree with him, but I always know \n     where he stands and I admire him for that,' Green said. \n     ``Although he was perhaps more liberal on many issues than \n     Ohioans were, Sen. Metzenbaum has been remarkably \n     consistent.''\n       A Republican critic, media consultant Roger J. Stone, was \n     less generous.\n       ``Two words,'' he said when asked to explain Metzenbaum's \n     electoral success, ``luck and money.''\n       Metzenbaum's fund-raising prowess was unmatched by any \n     other Ohio politician. He raised a record $8 million to \n     battle Voinovich, taking from union members, Hollywood stars, \n     the arts community and liberal-oriented interest groups. He \n     was never shy about asking.\n\n\n                          mentor and tormentor\n\n       For years, Metzenbaum was said to be hated by Republicans, \n     unloved by his staff and disrespected by reporters, many of \n     whom saw him as a shameless publicity-monger. There was some \n     truth to all those observations, but Washington loves \n     success. Metzenbaum converted many of his critics because he \n     was effective at what he did.\n       Joel Johnson, his administrative assistant for most of his \n     last term, said he had been both a ``mentor and a tormentor'' \n     to his staff.\n       He was fiendish about punctuality, demanded that work be \n     nearly perfect, and read the riot act in unsparing, colorful \n     language when an aide let him down.\n       ``We were all pretty tough,'' said Barry Direnfeld, a \n     Cleveland native who started as a mailroom clerk for \n     Metzenbaum in 1974 and later became his legislative director. \n     ``It was a hyper place.''\n       At a Capitol Hill retirement party for the old tiger during \n     the final week of the Senate session, dozens of former \n     staffers nodded as Johnson's voice cracked as he said how \n     proud he was to work for Metzenbaum, a tough boss who \n     inspired loyalty.\n       There were no tears from the Republicans or the reporters. \n     But they came to his party--from crusty Strom Thurmond, the \n     one-time Dixiecrat and only senator older than Metzenbaum, to \n     Doug Lowenstein, the journalist Metzenbaum credits for \n     hanging the nickname ``Headline Howie'' on him. Lowenstein \n     eventually worked as a legislative assistant for Metzenbaum.\n       His decision not to seek a fourth term opened the door for \n     a Republican, Mike DeWine, who defeated Metzenbaum's son-in-\n     law, Joel Hyatt, in the campaign for the open Senate seat in \n     November. But Metzenbaum battled to the wire, a whirl of \n     activity as the clock ran out on the 103rd Congress.\n\n\n                           baseball obsession\n\n       He made a pest of himself trying to convince the Senate it \n     should jump into the baseball strike, stripping the owners of \n     their antitrust immunity so the players union could take them \n     to court.\n       His contempt for the millionaire owners, passion for anti-\n     monopoly laws and instinct for media attention drove him, \n     even while friends like Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa implored him \n     to drop the issue. He seemed oblivious to the fact that the \n     ballplayers he supported were a far cry from the blue collar \n     trade unionists he stood up for as a labor lawyer in the \n     1950s and 1960s.\n       On Sept. 30, Metzenbaum ignored his pals' pleas and \n     struggled in vain to get his antitrust amendment attached to \n     another bill, But that wasn't the only item on the agenda. \n     The same day, he fired off a letter to President Clinton, \n     urging him to fire CIA Director James Woolsey for his \n     handling of the Aldrich Ames spy case.\n       On Oct. 8, the Senate's last day of regular business, he \n     had ``holds'' on a half-dozen bills and was threatening to \n     block a dozen more. Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat, \n     said his office had forms to keep track of bills that were \n     stalled: ``a box for Republican holds, one for Democrats, and \n     one for Sen. Metzenbaum.''\n\n\n                           he did it his way\n\n       Howard Morton Metzenbaum was born on Chesterfield Ave. on \n     Cleveland's East Side on June 4, 1917.\n       His father, Charles Metzenbaum, was a wholesale jobber who \n     sold bankrupt stocks during the Great Depression. ``They were \n     struggling to eke out an existence,'' he says of his father \n     and mother, Anna. ``They were wonderful parents. I found no \n     fault with them at all.''\n       No fault. That's about it. He is devoted to Shirley \n     Metzenbaum, his wife of 48 years, but he doesn't talk much \n     about the family he grew up with. When he does, it is with a \n     certain detachment.\n       An older brother, Irwin, once ran unsuccessfully for the \n     Ohio Senate and lives in obscurity in Cleveland. A cousin, \n     Jimmy, served in the Ohio legislature, immediately preceding \n     Metzenbaum, who was elected to the Ohio House in 1942. Years \n     later an uncle, \n     [[Page S3479]] Myron Metzenbaum, developed the ``Metzenbaum \n     scissors,'' a surgical tool common in operating rooms.\n       ``I cannot explain why I am the way I am,'' said a man not \n     given to introspection. ``I cannot think of any individual \n     who molded me.''\n       No teacher, no mentor, no guru. He did it on his own.\n       Metzenbaum hurried through Glenville High School, running \n     track for the Tarblooders and once racing against the great \n     Jesse Owens, then at East Tech, who left him in the dust.\n       And he worked.\n       In high school, he sold magazines and hauled groceries in a \n     wagon to housewives at 10 cents a delivery.\n       He owned a car before he was old enough to drive. An older \n     boy operated an unlicensed livery service for him, ferrying \n     patrons to a race track. The business was short-lived. He \n     woke up one morning, and the car, a 1926 Essex,\n      was gone. His dad had sold it to make a mortgage payment on \n     their home.\n       Worse still, he and Alva ``Ted'' Bonda, a lifelong friend \n     and business partner, tried to sell class rings at Glenville, \n     but their entire inventory was stolen from a school locker. \n     ``The person we bought them from bothered us for years,'' \n     Bonda said, laughing at the debacle. ``I think that's why \n     Howard became a lawyer.''\n       At Ohio State University, he ran a bike rental business and \n     played trombone for 50 cents an hour in a youth orchestra. \n     During law school, he began drafting legislation for state \n     lawmakers.\n       He scalped tickets and sold mums outside Buckeye football \n     games and hit the road from time to time with a carload of \n     consumer items. Driving through towns like Findley and \n     Fremont, Metzenbaum and partners sold shopkeepers razor \n     blades, toiletries, pencils, and--yes, the old rumor is \n     true--condoms.\n       ``The police would hassle you, because condoms at that \n     point were sort of something dirty or smutty,'' he recalled.\n\n\n                          leftward tilt begins\n\n       War broke out in Europe. Metzenbaum, despite his allegiance \n     to Franklin D. Roosevelt, initially questioned U.S. \n     involvement. He was embarking on a dangerous flirtation with \n     the far left--associations that would haunt him throughout \n     his career.\n       Metzenbaum said he conducted himself in a way that no one \n     ever thought or suggested he was a communist--``Well, I won't \n     say nobody.''\n       Some did regard him as a fellow traveler. He had been a \n     member of the National Lawyers Guild and a co-founder of the \n     Ohio School of Social Sciences--organizations regarded as \n     communist fronts by red-hunters of the 1940s and 1950s.\n       Metzenbaum was red-baited in the 1970 campaign against \n     Taft, and again in 1987 when an old rival sprang to his \n     defense. A briefing paper urged GOP candidates to use his \n     past connections to brand Metzenbaum a ``communist \n     sympathizer.'' Sen. John Glenn, Ohio Democrat, a bitter foe \n     of Metzenbaum in the Democratic primaries of 1970 and 1974, \n     was among the first to denounce the paper, material prepared \n     by the National Republican Senate Campaign Committee.\n       The material was scrapped, but the irony couldn't be \n     missed: Metzenbaum, for all his left-wing leanings, is a \n     capitalist of the first order.\n       He started out as a tax consultant when he found the \n     prestigious law firms were not hiring ``nice young Jewish \n     lawyers,'' as he put it in a 1988 Plain Dealer Sunday \n     Magazine article.\n       He jumped into politics in 1942, right after law school, \n     serving first in the Ohio House, then in the Ohio Senate \n     where he sponsored a groundbreaking fair-employment act.\n       He remained in Columbus until 1950, leaving after he lost a \n     bid to become majority leader. He suspects anti-Semitism was \n     to blame; he can still tick off\n      the names of the five state senators who turned against him.\n\n\n                           business blossoms\n\n       After the war, he and Bonda and a third partner, Sidney \n     Moss, got interested in the rental car business, but soon \n     realized there was more money to be made in airport parking \n     lots. At the time, airports were still on the order of \n     tourist attractions. Most travelers used trains or buses.\n       ``There was no organized parking at airports,'' Bonda said, \n     ``it was just free parking.''\n       Not for long. APCOA--Airport Parking Co. of America--made \n     them millions of dollars, branching out with well-lighted, \n     guarded lots at dozens of airports. The partners sold APCOA \n     to ITT in 1966 for an estimated $6 million.\n       It was the first of many profitable ventures for Metzenbaum \n     and Bonda, including the suburban Sun Newspapers, and part-\n     ownership in the Cleveland Indians. Some enterprises used \n     union labor; others kept unions out.\n       Metzenbaum married, reared four daughters and kept his \n     finger in politics and the labor movement. He served as \n     counsel to the Ohio AFL-CIO.\n       He marched in Selma with Martin Luther King Jr. and Viola \n     Liuzzo.\n       In 1958, he managed the campaign of the cantankerous \n     Stephen M. Young to a stunning upset victory over Sen. John \n     Bricker, a diehard Republican conservative. Six years later, \n     he helped Young win again, this time over Robert Taft Jr.\n\n\n                         going for the big time\n\n       By 1970, Metzenbaum, his fortune made, his family secure, \n     decided to re-enter politics. All he had to do was defeat a \n     national hero--astronaunt John Glenn, who was also seeking \n     the Democratic Senate nomination.\n       That race was recalled at his farewell bash in October as a \n     number of old friends wore buttons from that campaign, \n     proclaiming, ``I'm a Metz fan.''\n       Little known outside the Cleveland area, he ran a brilliant \n     campaign against the overconfident Glenn. He used television \n     advertising extensively--a pioneering effort by Ohio \n     standards--and emphasized bread-and-butter issues.\n       Organized labor closed ranks behind him. The young consumer \n     movement embraced him. He even capitalized on the success of \n     the miracle New York Mets, using the ``Metz fan'' slogan.\n       He upset Glenn but lost to Taft in the general election. \n     Four years later when William Saxbe gave up Ohio's other \n     Senate seat to become attorney general, Gov. John J. \n     Gilligan, at the urging of union leaders, named Metzenbaum to \n     the open seat.\n       Glenn was furious and immediately challenged Metzenbaum in \n     the bar-knuckled 1974 Senate Democratic primary--the Civil \n     War of Ohio politics.\n       It was a low point for Metzenbaum, one of many in his \n     mercurial career.\n       When Metzenbaum suggested that ``Col. Glenn,'' a Marine \n     career officer, had never held a real job, Glenn unloaded on \n     him:\n       ``Go with me and tell a Gold Star mother her son didn't \n     hold a job. Go with me to Arlington National Cemetery. . . \n     .'' He lectured his opponent, who, because of substandard \n     eyesight, had never served in the military.\n       Glenn won. Metzenbaum had to wait until 1976, when he \n     finally unseated Taft in what was almost certainly his last \n     chance to win a big one.\n       But the feud with Glenn lasted for years. The two men \n     hardly spoke during Metzenbaum's first term. Glenn refused to \n     expressly endorse him for re-election in 1982.\n       They reconciled at mid-decade, and worked well together \n     when Democrats recaptured the Senate majority in 1986.\n       ``I've been waiting 20 years to say this,'' Glenn said at \n     Metzenbaum's goodbye party, ``come January of 1995, I'll be \n     the only one of us who has a job.''\n\n\n                          The Metzenbaum style\n\n       Metzenbaum's big mouth and perpetual wheeling and dealing \n     got him in trouble.\n       In 1974, 22 Republican senators voted not to seat the \n     freshman Metzenbaum because of his dispute with the Internal \n     Revenue Service over a five-year-old tax liability. The \n     millionaire entrepreneur hadn't paid any federal income taxes \n     in 1969.\n       ``That didn't bother me,'' he said. ``I stood there in back \n     and I said, `Incredible. Howard Metzenbaum's the subject of a \n     Senate debate. Isn't that great?'\n       Metzenbaum was embarrassed by the revelation in 1983 that \n     he accepted a $250,000 ``finders fee'' for putting together a \n     seller and buyer for the elegant Hay-Adams Hotel, a block \n     from the White House. Insisting all the while he had done \n     nothing wrong, he eventually gave back the fee, with \n     interest.\n       He called his clumsy performance in the Anita Hill-Clarence \n     Thomas hearings in 1991 a ``low point'' in his political \n     career. Charges that one of his staffers had leaked Hill's \n     sexual harassment allegations to the media knocked him off \n     balance.\n       Foreign affairs were not his forte. He once called for the \n     assassination of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafy--and he \n     praised Iraq's Saddam Hussein as a potential peacemaker, \n     before the Persian Gulf war.\n       A lifelong opponent of capital punishment, he disappointed \n     many of his closest supporters in 1987 when, with re-election \n     coming up the next year, he backed the death penalty for drug \n     kingpins in federal cases.\n       ``In retrospect,'' he said recently, ``I am not positive \n     whether there was some rationalization about that decision or \n     not.''\n       He rarely had doubts about which course to take. He didn't \n     hesitate in opposing a popular constitutional amendment \n     banning desecration of the American flag, for instance.\n       But he almost voted for the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction \n     plan--wrestling free from a panicked aide trying to stop \n     him--and the advocacy of his close friend Sen. Paul Simon \n     sorely tempted him to back a balanced budget law.\n       Pernnial roadblock\n       Despite a productive third term, Metzenbaum will be most \n     remembered for what he stopped, rather than what he pushed \n     through the legislative maze. He was a master of the \n     filibuster and an upsetter of the pork barrel. He had a \n     Holmesian knack for finding the mischievous language hidden \n     in legislation.\n       ``The first major decision that Howard made was a break \n     with a new president and filibuster on decontrol of natural \n     gas prices,'' Direnfeld said, recalling the senator's battle \n     with President Carter in 1977. He said Metzenbaum's attitude \n     was, ``I will do whatever it takes.''\n       Metzenbaum lost and later had to admit deregulation didn't \n     cause the price explosion he feared.\n       As he said in announcing his retirement last summer, ``I've \n     won my share of battles and fought my share of lost causes.''\n       He was so proficient at weeding out waste, extravagance and \n     special interest projects that the Washington Post headlined \n     a 1982 news story: ``Thank God for Metzenbaum!''\n       [[Page S3480]] He stopped the free transfer of a federal \n     railroad to Alaska, exposed a timber industry giveaway in the \n     same state and shut down a multi-billion tax break for the \n     oil industry--to name a few battles won.\n       It was often said he saved taxpayers billions, yet he \n     frequently appeared on ``big spender'' lists put out by \n     conservative groups targeting lawmakers enamored of social \n     spending and redistribution-of-wealth tax policies.\n       He frequently got knocked down. He failed to bar companies \n     from replacing strikers with permanent new hires; had little \n     success in his war against the insurance industry, often fell \n     short in bids to deny antitrust exemptions to various \n     concerns, including baseball.\n       ``Howard Metzenbaum seemed to go out of his way to \n     antagonize business,'' said Jack Reimers, immediate past \n     president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, recalling \n     Metzenbaum's Ohio Senate days. ``He was the opitome of the \n     anti-business politician--he thrived, savored and sought to \n     be viewed that way.''\n       He infuriated colleagues too, making lasting enemies who \n     waited for chances to torpedo his bills. ``One man's pork is \n     another man's building project,'' noted one former House \n     member.\n       Rep. David L. Hobson, a Springfield Republican respected on \n     both sides of the aisle, said the senator from his home state \n     never opened a line of\n      communication with him.\n       ``We don't have any contract with Metzenbaum--none,'' said \n     Hobson. ``You know what people say to me? `That's Howard.'\n\n\n                           champion of causes\n\n       When he joined the Senate majority in 1987, Metzenbaum was \n     determined to show he could legislate constructively. He \n     compiled a solid if unspectacular record of accomplishment.\n       The Ohioan passed legislation forcing companies to give \n     workers 60 days notice of a plant shutdown, ordering the food \n     industry to put nutrition labels on its products, and making \n     bankrupt companies honor their pension commitments.\n       He was a burr under the saddle of the National Rifle \n     Association. He sponsored the Brady handgun waiting-period \n     law and co-sponsored the assault weapons ban. He led the \n     successful fights to ban armor-piercing bullets and guns that \n     cannot be identified by airport metal detectors.\n       He wrote the key age discrimination law and was co-sponsor \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. He was one of Israel's best \n     friends on Capitol Hill and a consistent voice for organized \n     labor.\n       Sen. Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, angered by \n     Metzenbaum's interruptions during a debate, once referred to \n     him as ``the senator from B'nai B'rith.''\n       He championed laws for the smallest of constituencies. He \n     provided incentives for drug manufacturers to develop \n     ``orphan drugs'' for treatment of rare diseases. Typical of \n     Metzenbaum, when he discovered some of the drug firms were \n     reaping big profits, he tried to trim back the incentives.\n       He won breakthrough federal funding for Alzheimer's \n     research, watched out for migrant workers, and was always \n     protective of America's children. One of the last bills he \n     got enacted--and one of his proudest achievements--will make \n     it easier for couples to adopt a child from a different race.\n       His dedication to the wellbeing of children, his adoration \n     of Shirley, his delight in his grandchildren--that was his \n     softer side.\n       ``He is not the same man who came here 19 years ago. He had \n     a chip on his shoulder. He was demanding and impatient and \n     wanted to accomplish a lot,'' said Johnson. ``He changed.

Mr. President, this spring Temple Emanu-El in \nNew York City celebrates its sesquicentennial. This vibrant house of \nworship is both the largest Jewish congregation in the world and the \nfountainhead of America Reform Judaism.\n  Dr. Ronald Sobel, Temple Emanu-El's distinguished senior rabbi, has \nprepared a brief history of this dynamic temple which I believe will be \nof great interest to Members of the Senate. I ask that this history of \nTemple Emanu-El be printed in the Record.\n  The history follows:\n               The Congregation: A Historical Perspective\n\n                 (By Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi)\n\n       The Jewish historical experience is inextricably interwoven \n     with the history of Western civilization. It is the story of \n     a minority interacting reciprocally with large complex \n     societies and cultures. Therefore, unlike the history of any \n     other people or civilization, the historical experience of \n     the Jewish people cannot be viewed or analyzed in isolation. \n     In this respect there are no historical analogs.\n       From the dawn of civilization in the ancient Near East to \n     the post-industrial era of our own time, Jews have been a \n     part of and remained apart from each circumstance encountered \n     in history. They have created responsive forms appropriate to \n     the cultures and societies in which they have lived \n     throughout the globe for almost four thousand years. The \n     Jewish people became experts in creative adaptation.\n       However, there was and remains a single constant amid the \n     bewildering responses to changing historical circumstances. \n     The constant is a concept of unity, the affirmation that God \n     is One and omnipotent. Commitment to this idea of oneness in \n     nature and human nature did not breed repetitive conformity \n     century after century, but rather produced creative diversity \n     generation after generation. The concept of God's unity \n     allowed the Jewish people to live, survive, and create amid \n     changing historical realities; the concept of unity allowed \n     for the diversity necessary for survival. It was and remains \n     the mortar with which the Jewish people have built their many \n     houses among many peoples.\n       The process of Jewish adaptation to the society and culture \n     of the United States has been defined within the broader \n     phenomenon known as ``Americanization.'' It was a complex \n     process and the many methodologies employed reflect the \n     diversities of Jewish life. The Jews who came to the United \n     States as immigrants defined their destiny as inseparably \n     bound to the well-being of all Americans. They became \n     passionate advocates of the American experiment in democracy.\n       Though the first Jews to arrive on these shores came as \n     early as 1654, it was not until the mid-nineteenth century \n     that sufficient numbers of Jewish immigrants were present to \n     allow the forms and shapes of Americanization to emerge. It \n     was during that time that Temple Emanu-El was founded. The \n     Jews who established Emanu-El, and those who joined their \n     ranks during the first decades of the Congregation's \n     existence, were immigrants from Germany who sought to \n     reorient themselves by adapting their individual lives and \n     collective institutions to the new environment of American \n     civilization. The congregation they created and the \n     lifestyles they fashioned were only the most recent chapter \n     in a long history of creative adaptation; what they \n     accomplished was nothing new in the Jewish historical \n     experience.\n       From the very beginning the United States provided a polity \n     in which the freest Jewish community the world has ever known \n     was able to develop and grow. It was, and remains, within \n     this unique experiment in democracy that Temple Emanu-El \n     originated and subsequently flowered to world prominence.\n       It is useful to understand the nature of Western European \n     immigration to the United States in the nineteenth century in \n     general, and German Jewish immigration in particular, to \n     grasp fully the origins of Temple Emanu-El. The conservative \n     reactions that dominated Europe following the final defeat of \n     Napoleon created a climate wherein many of the dreams set in \n     motion by the Emancipation and the French Revolution were \n     considerably constrained. The climate of rigid conservatism \n     inhibited liberal growth in religion, in politics, and in the \n     social sphere. After unsuccessful attempts to change that \n     conservative trend, many liberals, finding no future in \n     Europe, turned to America. They came to these shores with the \n     hope and dream that in this land the preciousness of \n     personality would be cherished and the dignity of \n     individuality honored. Among those who came from Western \n     Europe in the late 1830s were the men and women who would \n     soon found Temple Emanu-El.\n       In September 1884, a ``cultus verein'' (cultural society) \n     was established on New York's \n     [[Page S3481]] Lower East Side, and it was out of that \n     cultural society that Emanu-El had its origins. In April \n     1845, thirty-three members of the society decided to \n     establish a Reform congregation.\n       They were not particularly conversant with Reform Judaism \n     and were only vaguely aware of its origins in their native \n     Germany. Seeking advice, they wrote first to Congregation \n     Beth Elohim in Charleston, South Carolina, which in 1824 was \n     the first Reform congregation established in the United \n     States; they also wrote to the leaders of the Har Sinai \n     Congregation in Baltimore, Reform Judaism's second \n     congregation in America, which was founded in 1843. They \n     received some responses and proceeded to establish their own \n     congregation, which they called Temple Emanu-El.\n       When they banded together as a religious community it was \n     simultaneously the first in New York to be established as a \n     Reform congregation and the third such Liberal congregation \n     in America. It is of some interest to note that the use of \n     the word ``Emanu-El'' as the name of a congregation is the \n     first time in history that we know of that a Jewish \n     congregation adopted this word as a designation. By choosing \n     ``Emanu-El,'' which means ``God is with us,'' the founders \n     were not doubt reflecting their hopes that God would be with \n     them as they came to this new land, and as they put down \n     their roots here.\n       Their spiritual hopes knew no bounds, but their material \n     resources were limited. Thus the first place of worship was a \n     rented room on the second floor of a private dwelling at the \n     corner of Grand and Clinton streets. The records indicate \n     that at the organizing meeting in 1845, the men present \n     contributed a total of less than thirty dollars, and with \n     that modest sum began the Congregation. The founders quickly \n     outgrew that rented room, and in 1848 they moved to Chrystie \n     Street, a few blocks west of their original location. The \n     Congregation was still limited by its financial resources and \n     did not possess the means to erect its own synagogue. By \n     necessity, therefore, they purchased an existant building, \n     which had previously been used as a methodist church, and \n     with some changes transformed it for Jewish worship and \n     communal meetings.\n       In the first few years, Temple Emanu-El's growth, through \n     not dramatic, was steady, and the members remained modest of \n     means. Yet there was sufficient development that by 1854 the \n     Congregation felt the need to move again, this time northwest \n     to Twelfth Street near Fourth Avenue. As the general \n     population in Manhattan was moving uptown so too was the \n     Jewish population, and thus inevitably the members of Emanu-\n     El as well. Again unable to build on their own, they bought a \n     structure that had been a Baptist church and refurbished it \n     as a synagogue. However, their dreams of building a great \n     temple were neither to be denied nor postponed to some \n     distant future. In 1868, three years after the conclusion of \n     the Civil War and twenty-three years after the final meeting \n     of the ``cultus verein,'' the members of Congregation Emanu-\n     El were in a position to erect an imposing sanctuary at the \n     northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Forty-third Street, \n     which a critic of the time described as ``the finest example \n     of Moorish architecture in the Western world.'' That \n     religious home was to remain the Congregation's place of \n     worship until the latter part of 1927, when construction of \n     the present edifice began.\n       It is remarkable that within a span shorter than twenty-\n     five years the Congregation that had begun with so few in \n     number and so little in material means was able to erect a \n     building that was judged an architectural\n      wonder not only by the Jewish world but also by the people \n     of the city of New York. The first quarter century of the \n     Congregation's history may be viewed as a microcosm of the \n     success of the Western European immigrant in general, and \n     of the German Jewish immigrant in particular.\n       The first rabbi to serve Temple Emanu-El was Dr. Leo \n     Merzbacher. Little is known about him, but it seems probable \n     that he was the first ordained rabbi to serve a congregation \n     in New York. Dr. Merzbacher led the Congregation in its \n     earliest encounters with Reform Jewish philosophy and \n     practice and authored one of the first Reform prayer books in \n     America. Following his death in 1856, he was succeeded by Dr. \n     Samuel Adler, who by that time had already achieved a \n     reputation as one of the great philosophical and theological \n     leaders of the Reform movement in Germany. The first three \n     decades of the Congregation's history were thus marked by \n     significant radical reforms in liturgy, theology, and \n     practice. But after 1875, having achieved great eminence, the \n     Congregation tended to become somewhat more conservative. \n     Innovations, ritual changes, and prayer book adaptations \n     thereafter came slowly. Dr. Adler preached in German, as had \n     Dr. Merzbacher before him, and that language adequately \n     served the needs of the first generation of Temple Emanu-El's \n     members. However, it did not serve the needs of the founders' \n     children, whose principal language was English, and thus it \n     was inevitable that this second generation expressed a desire \n     for an English-speaking preacher. That need was satisfied \n     with the election of Emanu-El's third rabbi, Dr. Gustav \n     Gottheil. Although born in Germany, Dr. Gottheil was fluent \n     in English, having served a Liberal congregation in \n     Manchester, England.\n       It is not without significance that Emanu-El's first three \n     rabbis were trained in Europe, a circumstance necessitated by \n     the fact that the American Jewish community had not yet been \n     able to establish a successful rabbinic seminary. (However, \n     it was not long thereafter that the need for such an \n     institution was satisfied, two years following Gottheil's \n     arrival in New York, Isaac Mayer Wise created the Hebrew \n     Union College in Cincinnati.) Dr. Gottheil served the \n     congregation until 1900 and advanced the cause of Reform \n     Jewish life in several important ways: he was an innovator in \n     liturgy, particularly by his authorship of a hymnbook, and he \n     was one of the earliest rabbis in the United States to \n     consciously reach out to the Christian community, and his \n     rabbinate witnessed the beginnings of the interfaith \n     movement. Better understanding between Christians and Jews \n     has been an important element in the experience of the \n     American Jewish community, and it significantly began at \n     Temple Emanu-El. Dr. Joseph Silverman, who joined the \n     rabbinic staff in 1888 as Dr. Gottheil's assistant, was the \n     first American-born rabbi to serve in New York and was a \n     member of the second graduating class of Hebrew Union \n     College.\n       In 1895, amid great joy and elaborate ceremony, the \n     Congregation celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its \n     founding. On that occasion the city's most prominent rabbis, \n     Christian clergyman, educators, and political figures were \n     present. Their participation and the wide press coverage \n     reporting the Golden Jubilee celebration reflected the \n     enormous growth of Temple Emanu-El. A congregation that had \n     begun so humbly on the Lower East Side was now, a half \n     century later,\n      being recognized as among the most important religious \n     institutions in the city.\n       Gottheil's successor was Dr. Judah Leon Magnes, who was \n     also American born and a graduate of Hebrew Union College. \n     Magnes was an active member of the nascent Zionist movement \n     and also played an important role in bridging the cultural \n     diversities that separated the Jewish community of German \n     origin from those who had emigrated from Eastern Europe. \n     Magnes remained at Emanu-El only a few years and later became \n     the first president of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In \n     1912, the Congregation called the scholarly Dr. Hyman G. \n     Enelow to the pulpit. His contributions to higher Jewish \n     learning were profound, and his writings are still studied by \n     scholars all over the world.\n       When Temple Emanu-El was founded in 1845 there were \n     approximately fifteen thousand Jews in the United States. \n     Thirty-five years later that number had grown to a quarter of \n     a million. In 1881, following the assassination of Czar \n     Alexander II, dread pogroms were unleashed throughout most of \n     Eastern Europe, and with them a great wave of immigration to \n     America began as Jews fled from physical \n     persecution, political oppression, and economic hardship. \n     During the next forty years the Jewish population in the \n     United States increased by an additional two-and-a-half-\n     million men, women, and children.\n       Recognizing their responsibilities by remaining receptive \n     to a centuries-old Jewish tradition that held that one must \n     ``aid the poor, care for the sick, teach the ignorant, and \n     extend a helping hand to those who have lost their way in the \n     world,'' the members and leaders of Temple Emanu-El responded \n     generously and creatively to the profound poverty of their \n     Jewish brethren who had emigrated to New York from Eastern \n     Europe during this forty-year period. The wealth and talent \n     of the uptown German Jews who worshiped at Emanu-El were \n     generously bestowed upon the newly arrived Russian Jews. \n     (However, even prior to this period of massive immigration, \n     the Congregation had established its own tradition of \n     philanthropic largesse.)\n       Although the members of Temple Emanu-El may have felt a \n     sense of noblesse oblige in the performance of their \n     charitable activities, and perhaps their efforts were largely \n     directed toward Americanizing their ``poor cousins'' in order \n     to reinforce their own standing in society, nevertheless what \n     they and other German Jews in America did was nothing short \n     of creating private institutions of philanthropy and \n     education such as no\n      community, Jewish or non-Jewish, had ever done before in \n     history. The Temple and its leaders set an example to a \n     world willing to learn about caring, and that caring \n     including concern for non-Jews as well as Jews.\n       In 1920, the Congregation celebrated its seventy-fifth \n     anniversary, again with great joy, but this time combined \n     with a thanksgiving celebrating the recent American victory \n     at the end of World War I. The fact that the United States \n     had been at war with Germany caused somewhat of an identity \n     crisis for many Americans of German origin, including some \n     members of Temple Emanu-El. (There were also ambivalent \n     feelings compounded by the fact that Russia, which had been \n     our ally in the war, was the country that, during the \n     previous four decades, was responsible for inflicting such \n     horrible brutality upon the Jewish people.) However, the war \n     was over, the Allies were victorious, and Emanu-El celebrated \n     its anniversary in an exaltation of freedom.\n       By the beginning of the third decade of the twentieth \n     century those Jews who had more recently arrived from Eastern \n     Europe were beginning to settle into American life, to define \n     themselves, and to make their own place in their new land of \n     freedom. Less and less were they in need of the kind of \n     assistance they had received for so long from the German \n     Jews. And thus Emanu-El and its membership were now able to \n     begin to address \n     [[Page S3482]] their own inner needs. In the 1920s a call for \n     spiritual renewal went forth from the pulpit, and what \n     followed was the establishment of many of the auxiliary \n     organizations and activities that continue to this day to \n     give so much vitality and meaning to the Congregation's \n     programs and activities. It is also of interest to note that \n     by the early 1920s some Eastern Europeans were beginning to \n     join the Temple. A generation later, by the conclusion of \n     World War II, the majority of the Congregation's members were \n     men and women who traced their ancestry to either parents or \n     grandparents of Eastern European rather than Western European \n     origin.\n       In 1868, when the Congregation dedicated its Temple, Forty-\n     third Street and Fifth Avenue was at the center of the most \n     elegant residential section of the city. However, by the mid-\n     1920s that part of Fifth Avenue and its surrounding streets \n     had undergone a radical transformation. What had been for so \n     long quietly residential had now become noisily commercial, \n     so much so that on Saturday mornings worshipers found it \n     difficult to pray over the cacophony coming from the adjacent \n     streets. Furthermore, until the early 1900s the majority of \n     the Congregation's members lived in the immediate vicinity of \n     the Temple, but by the 1920s the overwhelming majority were \n     residing much farther north, on the Upper West Side as well \n     as the Upper East Side. While the old building at Forty-third \n     Street remained architecturally beautiful, it had serious \n     functional problems. The student body in the Religious School \n     was growing in size, and the classrooms were inadequate. \n     There were insufficient meeting rooms to house the expanding \n     programs of the Temple. Following several years of debate and \n     consideration, the Congregation, upon the recommendation of \n     its respected president, Louis Marshall, purchased property \n     on the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Sixty-fifth \n     Street. A better location could not have been chosen. The \n     assumption was then, and the reality today remains, that so \n     long as there is a Central Park, this part of Fifth Avenue \n     would be exclusively residential in character.\n       It was also in the late twenties that the second most \n     influential Reform congregation in New York, Temple Beth-El \n     (House of God) consolidated with Emanu-El. Possessor of its \n     own distinguished history, Temple Beth-El had been \n     established in 1874 through the amalgamation of two earlier \n     congregations, Anshe Chesed (Men of Mercy) and Adas Jeshurun \n     (Congregation of Israel). Its first rabbi was Dr. David \n     Einhorn, one of the most important architects of nineteenth-\n     century Reform Jewish thought. He was succeeded by the \n     equally brilliant theologian Dr. Kaufmann Kohler, who left \n     the pulpit of Beth-El in 1903 to become president of Hebrew \n     Union College in Cincinnati.\n       The newly merged congregations combined rabbinic resources \n     as well as lay brilliance into one new great Congregation. \n     The people of Emanu-El left Forty-third Street in 1927, and \n     during the years that it took\n      to erect the new building, they worshiped at the handsome \n     Temple Beth-El, which stood at Fifth Avenue and Seventy-\n     sixth Street.\n       The first religious service at the new Temple at Fifth \n     Avenue and Sixty-fifth Street was conducted in September \n     1929; sadly, that gathering was occasioned by the death of \n     Louis Marshall, the man who perhaps more than any other was \n     responsible for the building of the great new Temple. A few \n     weeks later, services for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur were \n     conducted. How fortuitous it was that the members of the \n     Congregation decided to build and create this magnificent \n     Temple when they did, for had they delayed, for whatever \n     reason, in all probability this gloriously magnificent \n     edifice that now stands as Temple Emanu-El would probably \n     never have been built. In the latter part of October 1929 the \n     stock market crashed, and the Great Depression began.\n       The Temple was formally dedicated in January 1930 in a \n     ceremony presided over by the rabbis of the Congregation: the \n     great orator Dr. Hathan Krass, who had come to Temple Emanu-\n     El in 1923; Dr. Hyman G. Enelow, the gentle scholar who had \n     been with the Congregation since 1912; and the equally \n     brilliant scholar Dr. Samuel Schulman, who had been Senior \n     Rabbi of Temple Beth-El. The newly elected President of the \n     Congregation was the Honorable Irving Lehman, Judge of the \n     New York State Court of Appeals (and Chief Judge from 1940 \n     onward), whose family had been affiliated with the \n     Congregation since the 1870s.\n       Sharply contrasting moods characterized the decade and a \n     half that rounded out Temple Emanu-El's first hundred years. \n     On April 4, 1945, the Congregation entered the majestic \n     Sanctuary for a Service of Rededication, climaxing seven \n     months of Centenary Celebration. It was a decade and a half \n     that began with hope and ended with promise, while the \n     interval was filled with crisis and horror, sorrow and \n     tragedy, such as the human family had never before endured. \n     The Jewish people, schooled in centuries of persecution, were \n     made the victims of an ancient hatred welded to modern \n     technology, and by the time Nazism was finally destroyed by \n     the Allied victory, the virtual annihilation of European \n     Jewry had come to pass. The fortunate few who escaped to \n     America were welcomed to Temple Emanu-El with the same \n     attention and devotion shown by an earlier generation to \n     those who had fled the tyranny of Czarist Russia.\n       As a result of the economic catastrophe precipitated by the \n     Depression, the membership of the Congregation was \n     significantly diminished. However, to the credit of the Broad \n     and the congregants of Emanu-El, in the face of burdensome \n     debt they wholeheartedly assumed social responsibility for \n     those beyond the precincts of the Temple. Both to the needs \n     of the refugees from Hitlerism and the call for patriotic \n     service during the war, Temple Emanu-El's men and women \n     responded generously and willingly. In both areas they \n     established and maintained programs of excellence.\n       During 1934 Rabbis Enelow, Krass, and Schulman retired, and \n     Dr. Samuel H. Goldenson was selected as their successor. A \n     gentle man, and a champion of Classical Reform, Dr. Goldenson \n     brought to the rabbinate of Emanu-El a spirit of saintliness. \n     Two years previously, in 1932, the ministry of Dr. Nathan A. \n     Perilman had begun; he came to the Congregation with the\n      expectation of staying only six months, but remained for \n     forty-one-and-a-half years, making his rabbinate the \n     longest active service in the Congregation's history. Upon \n     the retirement of Dr. Goldenson in 1948, Dr. Julius Mark \n     was elected the Temple's Senior Rabbi. Dr. Mark had won \n     wide recognition for the important role that he played as \n     a Navy Chaplain during World War II. At the time of Dr. \n     Mark's election, Dr. Perilman was made Rabbi of the \n     Congregation.\n       The years following World War II saw an enormous growth in \n     the Temple's membership. The 1950s were characterized by an \n     age of significant revival in religious institutions, and the \n     Congregation grew wondrously as America was able again to \n     settle down to a peacetime environment. New programs were \n     introduced, old programs were revitalized, and adult-\n     education offerings were significantly expanded. After twenty \n     distinguished years, Dr. Mark retired in 1968 and was \n     succeeded as Senior Rabbi by Dr. Perilman, who remained with \n     the Congregation for an additional five-and-a-half years, \n     retiring at the end of 1973.\n       Dr. Perilman was then succeeded by Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, who \n     had come to Temple Emanu-El as Assistant Rabbi immediately \n     following his ordination at Hebrew Union College in 1962. \n     When elected Senior Rabbi at the end of 1973, Dr. Sobel was \n     the youngest spiritual leader ever elected by the \n     Congregation. Today he is assisted by two longtime \n     associates, Rabbi David M. Posner and Rabbi Richard S. \n     Chapin.\n       The 1970s and the 1980s have continued to witness further \n     growth in the Congregation, so much so that today Temple \n     Emanu-El is world Jewry's most prominent house of worship. \n     Physically it is the largest Jewish synagogue in the world, \n     and the size of its membership also makes it the largest \n     Reform congregation in the world. Innovative programs \n     continue to be introduced and older programs are expanded as \n     the members of the Congregation reach out more and more to \n     the Jewish world in New York and beyond and to the other \n     communities of which we are a part.\n       The past is always prelude to the present, the present \n     forever a preparation for the future. In 1995 the\n      Congregation will celebrate its one hundred fiftieth \n     anniversary. We have every expectation and hope that \n     Emanu-El will continue to be a beacon and a pride to world \n     Jewry.\n       Although much has changed in the near century and a half \n     since the Congregation was founded at Grand and Clinton \n     streets, the members of Temple Emanu-El continue to be \n     fundamentally committed to a faith that proclaims:\n       First, instead of one fixed and changeless revelation from \n     God to Moses at Sinai, the Jewish people have been heir to a \n     progressive revelation, which continues throughout history in \n     the discoveries of science and in the insights of wise, \n     sensitive human souls. The Bible and Talmud are valuable \n     permanent records of earlier and decisive stages in this \n     process. But, since revelation comes from God through human \n     beings, all the documents of revelation are a mixture of the \n     divine and the human, the eternally valid as well as the \n     temporary and transient. Judasiam is a living, growing way of \n     life, evolving gradually from earlier and more primitive \n     forms to the full flowering of its universal spiritual \n     message.\n       Second, central and changeless is the belief in the one and \n     holy God, who is to be served through righteousness and \n     mercy. God's law is basically ethical. Ritual and ceremony, \n     as the prophets declared long ago, are not the essence of \n     religion. Moreover, historical study reveals that ceremonial \n     practice has been constantly subject to change. Indeed, \n     ritual is not without value; it is a means of making \n     religious truth more vivid and inspiring to the worshiper. \n     But the forms are not sacrosanct. If they fail to instruct \n     and uplift those who practice them, they may be modified or \n     discarded.\n       Third, the universal ethical aspect of Judaism must forever \n     remain primary in the consciousness of the Jewish people. \n     Therefore, the members of Temple Emanu-El do not hope for the \n     coming of a personal Messiah to usher in a period of national \n     restoration, but rather look forward with anticipation to a \n     universal messianic era for all humanity. Neither the \n     establishment of a nation-state in the ancient homeland, nor \n     the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple, nor the \n     reinstitution of the sacrificial cult are necessary \n     prerequisites for the realization of the messianic dream. \n     Thus, we believe that Jews are, and should remain, citizens \n     of the various nations in which they live.\n       [[Page S3483]] Fourth, the survival of the Jewish people as \n     a religious group is a sacred and urgent obligation. The \n     Jewish people have a mission to humankind, a mission ordained \n     of God and proclaimed by the prophets of ancient Israel. This \n     mission requires that the people born in, or adopted into, \n     the Covenant of Abraham must persuade humankind through \n     teaching and example that the One and Only God can be \n     worshiped in holiness only as His children serve each other \n     in love. To acknowledge God's unity requires obedience to, \n     and reverence for, His ethical mandates and moral \n     imperatives. The mission of Israel will not have been \n     fulfilled until righteousness and peace prevail everywhere \n     for everyone. Until that great messianic fulfillment, the \n     Jewish people must survive as a ``kingdom of priests'' \n     dedicated to the service of God and humanity.\n       These were the principles of faith proclaimed by the \n     founders of Congregation Emanu-El in 1845; they remain the \n     principles to which this generation of Temple Emanu-El \n     constantly rededicates itself.\n       The story of Temple Emanu-El is the history of successful \n     Americanization. From 1845 to the present the members of the \n     Congregation have authorized a new chapter in the chronicle \n     of Jewish creative adaptation. Their lives have served as an \n     enviable model of what the Jew could strive to become, and \n     continue to be, in the United States.\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3480-2", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          BOB SAMPSON TURNS 70\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate my friend Robert Sampson, of Arlington Heights, IL, on the \noccasion of his 70th birthday, Saturday, March 4. He is a truly \nremarkable person, whom I admire and respect.\n  Bob Sampson has been an inspiration to many Americans. He has \nmuscular dystrophy, which has caused him to be in a wheelchair since he \nwas 9 years old. He lost his college scholarship when the school he was \nto attend found out he was disabled. Undaunted, he went on to college \nand law school and became a successful attorney for the city of \nChicago. He then joined United Airlines, where he rose to be a senior \nvice president.\n  As a successful member of the business community, Bob could have \nchosen to stay out of the struggles surrounding disability issues. \nInstead, he has been unselfish in his drive to help other people with \ndisabilities gain access to buildings and equal employment \nopportunities. He was one of President Carter's first appointments to \nthe U.S. Architectural Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, after \nhaving served as the Vice Chairman of the President's Committee on \nEmployment of the Handicapped. A long-term member of the board of \ndirectors of the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Jerry Lewis' ``big \nkid,'' he has told his personal story to millions of people to raise \nmoney to find a cure for muscular dystrophy. He has never forgotten his \nroots.\n  Bob Sampson has been a role model for all of us, teaching that \ndisability is not inability. I join his wife Jean, his children--Patty, \nRob, and Kathy--his grandchildren, and his many friends in wishing him \na very happy birthday, and many more.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3483-1", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO VENICE HIGH SCHOOL BAND\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a group of \nyoung people from Venice High School for honoring our veterans. On \nNovember 11, 1994, the Venice Area Veterans Council presented a special \nsalute to Korea veterans during a Veterans Day ceremony. The Venice \nHigh School Band, under the direction of John Lapato, performed the \n``Korea Veterans March'' composed by Charles Gabriele. Marilyn Sexton \nwas the vocalist. The band included Renee Arata, Mary Baker, Katy \nBanks, Leeann Bennett, Heather Bibbee, Jennifer Britton, Colleen \nBuckley, Joshua Burgett, Buddy Corbin, Amanda Coronado, Neejay Cowan, \nKevin Crissman, J.B.

Mr. President, last May scientists at Fermi \nLaboratory in Batavia, IL found the first direct evidence of the top \nquark, the sixth and last component of a standard model of matter that \nexplains the relationships between subatomic particles. This week, \nteams at Fermi Laboratory announced that they have confirmed evidence \nof the particle, leaving no doubt about its existence.\n  I want to congratulate them on their accomplishment. And, I want to \nadd that basic science research in this country, like that which goes \non at Fermi Laboratory in Illinois, Brookhaven in New York, and \nStanford in California, contributes greatly to our understanding of \nbasic science and provides vision and hope to thousands of curious \nstudents and researchers who are pursuing a future in the sciences.\n  The President in his fiscal year 1996 budget proposed adding $100 \nmillion above the 1995 level to enhance the work going on at our major \nDOE-operated basic research facilities. I support this initiative. The \nUnited States currently leads the world in particle physics research. \nWithout a continued investment in our DOE laboratories, our scientists \nwill find themselves uninvolved and disadvantaged in what's becoming a \nworldwide community of basic science research.\n  For nearly a decade, the superconductor super collider was the \ncenterpiece of the Nation's basic science program. While I fully \nsupported the project and opposed its termination, the project's \nexpense sacrificed valuable resources going to other worthy \nlaboratories, like Fermi lab in Illinois. With the cancellation of the \nSSC, we gutted our high-energy physics research budget and threatened \nto send a message to the world that we no longer were willing to invest \nin high energy physics research.\n  We now have the opportunity to make effective use of our current \nfacilities and to remain important contributors to a world-wide effort. \nWith the leadership of Senator Bennett Johnston and President Clinton, \nwe are once again investing in the research capabilities at Fermi lab \nand other leading laboratories, and as evidenced by the resent \ndiscovery of the top quark, we continue to be world leaders in this \narea.\n  The United States has tremendous potential to lead the way in \nscientific research in the next decade, but only with sufficient \nfunding. I applaud the President for his leadership in this important \narea.\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/03/03/senate-section/article/S3483-3", "month": "03", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3483-S3484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. HELMS.
