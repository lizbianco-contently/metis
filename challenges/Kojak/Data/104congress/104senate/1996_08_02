Mr. President, this is the day we can accomplish an awful \nlot for the American people in passing conference reports which are \ncompleted and ready to go to the President for his signature. Truly \nmonumental accomplishments can be achieved today--or tomorrow. We have \na lot of work to do, but it is work that we can finish, I think, in a \nresponsible and agreeable way.\n  For the information of all Senators, there are a number of important \nmatters that are available for consideration that I hope the Senate \nwill be able to proceed to and complete action on today. I understand \nat this time that the D.C. appropriations conference report, the \nmilitary construction appropriations conference report, the Department \nof Defense authorization conference report, the legislative \nappropriations conference report and the health care reform conference \nreport are available for Senate action. I hope all my colleagues will \ncooperate in allowing the Senate to do its business and complete action \non these measures prior to recess.\n  It is also still my intention to consider the Veterans' \nAdministration, Housing and Urban Development appropriations matter \nthis week. We need to get that bill completed so we can get into \nconference. Our veterans and people who seek the American dream of home \nownership are dependent, in many instances, on this very important \nlegislation. This is a bill I believe we can get completed, get it into \nconference, and then move it on to the President early in September.\n  I will, once again, remind my colleagues there is a lot of work to be \ndone and not a lot of time to accomplish it if we want to get out \nsometime today or tomorrow to go be with our constituents in our \nrespective States. Therefore, Members can expect a full day and evening \nwith rollcall votes throughout that time. Also, it may be necessary for \nthe Senate to convene tomorrow, if we are unable to complete action on \nthese important matters.\n  Mr. President, if I could continue, I am prepared now to ask consent \nto approve the nomination of Ann Montgomery to be a district judge for \nMinnesota. I would like to do that. I am also, though, then going to \nmove to approve the Commodities Futures--CFTC nominees. I believe there \nis a Republican nominee and a Democratic nominee. That has been held up \nfor weeks and weeks and weeks. After a lot of effort and serious \nconsideration we have cleared that. We are ready to go with that.\n  We need desperately to have the Chief of Naval Operations in place. \nIt has been a very slow but very careful consideration of the next \nadmiral to be the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson. His \nnomination is ready to be moved, along with a long list of other \nmilitary personnel that deserve the opportunity to have their \nnominations completed. I would like to do that.\n  We have a number of other very noncontroversial actions that we can \ntake, including the naming of Federal buildings and a list--I mentioned \nsome of them last night that we can get approved. So I am prepared to \nget started with that. I hope that would break through the logjam and \nget things started in the right direction.\n  I am prepared also to begin discussing the D.C. appropriations \nconference report, the military construction appropriations report, the \nlegislative appropriations conference report, and also to begin \ndiscussion on the all-important health insurance reform package. Is it \nperfect? No. Is it everything we want? I know it is not. But it is a \nmajor, major step forward for the women and men and children of this \ncountry--the guarantee of available and affordable health care. Could \nwe leave this building tonight, not having done that?\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\n  After a lot of fuss and carrying on yesterday and complaining and \ngrousing, the House voted 417 to 2 for genuine, responsible, affordable \nhealth care reform that will make it available to people, with choice \nof the medical savings account. Senator Kennedy, Senator Kassebaum, \nCongressman Hastert, Congressman Archer, have worked heroically to \nbring this to conclusion. Can we not begin debate and come to \nconclusion on this important legislation now? Why not?\n  Who among us here today, for whatever reason, wants to stop funding \nfor the District of Columbia, as desperately as it is struggling to \nsurvive and stand on its feet? And we are going to walk off and leave \nthis conference report uncompleted? I do not believe that will happen.\n  Are we going to walk away from safe drinking water? Safe drinking \nwater?\n  Mr. FORD. It's not here yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am a little worried that that bill would not be \ncompleted. I live in the District of Columbia. I worry about the water.\n  It is not here yet. The distinguished minority whip makes that point. \nIt will be here today.\n  I am just racking them up, as to what we can do today. I urge my \ncolleagues to come on over and let us get started. Let us not wait \nuntil the Sun goes down. Let us show them the Senate does not have to \nbe nocturnal. While it may look dark here, it is light outside. We can \nbring some sunshine to this institution by doing these very important \npieces of legislation.\n  I am prepared to go to the first nomination, but I see at least two \nor three Senators who appear to be wishing to make some comments. I \nwould be glad to yield the floor.\n  Why do I not yield the floor and then, if Senators would like to \ncomment, then I will move these nominations when they are prepared to \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am prepared.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9455-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9456-S9457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE STALKING BILL\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to just get a little \nclearer idea of where we are. I feel like there has been a mixture of \nissues here.\n  I did object to Judge Montgomery's going forward, because I wanted to \nfinish looking at this. There are a number of people who have been \nconcerned about the nominations that had gone through and want to look \nat the overall record. I am not prepared--I will object until I know a \nclear field and have a better idea of where we are going. But I am not \nsaying that I will keep the objection on Judge Montgomery.\n  But in the rhetoric that has been flying around on the floor I think \nthe stalking bill has been brought up. I did not put them together. But \nin his statement the night before last, when I objected, the \ndistinguished leader of the Democratic Party said that I should be \ngrateful to him for his help on the stalking bill and, therefore, not \nuse my right to object to a judge. And I was just very concerned about \nthat, because I have worked on this stalking bill since Memorial Day. I \nhave tried to pass a bill that would protect the stalking victims of \nthis country since Memorial Day. I have been held up by a Senator, \nwhose sincerity I do not doubt, but, nevertheless, he knows that the \namendment that he wanted to put on had some problems. He knew that it \nmight cause a problem.\n\n  I suggested that if he would just put his amendment on another bill, \nmine then could go forward to the President and we could have the \nprotection for the stalking victims of this country today, because the \nPresident, I believe, will sign it very quickly.\n  All the indications are it passed unanimously in the House. We wanted \nit to be passed unanimously in the Senate without amendment so it could \ngo straight to the President. We wanted that on Memorial Day. But \nnevertheless, the minority leader says I should be very pleased he \nhelped me pass my bill, and my bill is dying in the House right now \nbecause of the amendment that he forced me to take in order to move on \nanother issue.\n  So I don't doubt anyone's sincerity here, but I do want to have a \nclear picture of when we are going to take up the stalking bill. I said \nI would be happy to work with the Senator, whose amendment is causing \nthe problem, to do it on another issue. But since they have been \njoined--not my me--I do think that it is fair for us to take a little \ntime and let me see what the clear picture is on the stalking bill, and \nthen I think we can--I am sorry that they were joined. I didn't join \nthem. But now that they are, I would like to have a clear picture. I \ndon't want rhetoric to continue to get out of control here, but I would \nlike an answer.\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was talking when I should have been \nlistening. If I can ask the Senator from Texas, I heard you at the \nbeginning of your remarks indicate that you were perhaps not prepared \nto allow this consent to go forward at this time. I am sure you heard \nsome of the discussion last night. I was one of the ones who mentioned \nit in some way had been attached to the stalking bill, and the minority \nleader had talked about how he had tried to be helpful to the Senator.\n  I am very much committed to the stalking bill which the Senator from \nTexas has been working diligently on for months now. I was here the \nnight it was all cleared right up to the last minute, and all of a \nsudden something happened and it was objected to.\n  There is not a Senator who thinks we should not pass the stalking \nbill. If you really care about women and children and how they are \ntreated across State lines, being harassed and stalked, this bill \nshould be done. But it was held up for quite some time by a Senator \nthat had an amendment he wanted to offer.\n  There was a lot of cooperation from the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from New Jersey, the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig. It was \nworked out. It was sent to the House. It looks like it may not get \nthrough the House now. The understanding was if it got tangled up, we \nwould bring it back freestanding without the amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think it is important to know the arrangement that \nwas given, because I have not mentioned that because I did not want to \njeopardize the ability of the amendment to stay on the bill in the \nHouse. I have been in good faith. I supported the amendment. I have \ntried to get House support for the amendment. But I did not mention \nthat we had an agreement with the minority leader, with the majority \nleader, with myself, with the Senator from New Jersey, that, in fact, \nif it got bogged down that they would let us pass it clean in the \nSenate. It has gotten bogged down.\n\n  Now I want to have an assurance that everyone's word is going to be \nkept here, and then I will certainly get out of this picture. But it \nhas now become clouded, not of my making, but it has been. That is why \nI was trying to have the opportunity to see what the commitment will be \nto see if we cannot have help for the stalking victims starting right \nnow.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to that, I want to assure \nthe Senator from Texas, I am absolutely committed to working with her \non this very important legislation. I am committed to doing whatever is \nnecessary to get it through with amendment, without amendment, clean, \nand I commit right here today, after you have had a chance to see what \nwill happen in the other body--I am talking frankly about what is \ninvolved here because I don't think we have time to deal in nuances. We \nneed to get right upfront as to what is happening and what we can do to \nsolve it.\n  We will bring that bill back up by unanimous consent. We will move \nit, if we have to. We will do it when the Senator from Texas is \nsatisfied that it is not going to move in the House, and it may.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It was attempted to be brought up last night in the\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\nHouse, and it was thwarted. So it has now had an opportunity and it was \nto be brought up in a way that the amendment would not be on it.\n  I have supported the amendment. I would like to see the amendment \nstay on it. But nevertheless, it is not one person in the House, it was \nseveral who have objected to it. And when it was to be brought up in \nthat way, Members of the New Jersey delegation objected, and, of \ncourse, I understand that. I am not being critical. That is everyone's \nright, but nevertheless, I have been told I should be grateful for the \nhelp in passing my bill, which is now dying, and I am trying to see \nwhere we can make an agreement on this in order to free the business of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield further, I commit \nto her I will stalk this bill across party lines, across State lines.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am not worried about the majority \nleader being committed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me go one step further. I want to assure her of my own \ncommitment. I will be prepared to try to get unanimous consent to do it \nthis night if that will be helpful.\n  Let me say, before I yield to the Democratic whip, the Democratic \nleader and I work together. We try very hard, in our trusting \nrelationship. I think we have that. Sometimes we hope we can do things, \nwe hope to achieve, but we have to deal with 98 other people. Every now \nand then, we get a little further out on the limb, and we have to back \noff.\n  The minority leader is a man of his word, and he has assured the \nSenator from Texas that he will work with us to try to get this done at \nthe earliest time that the Senator from Texas would like to get that \ndone. I don't want to speak for him or put words in his mouth, but I \nknow him and I know, as he has already worked with me and with the \nSenator from Texas, that he is for this stalking bill, and he is going \nto work with us to try to get it done. He has another Senator, or \nSenators, who have an interest. We have to work through all that, but \nwe will work through that.\n\n  Would the whip like to say something? I yield to the whip.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I was not privileged to the agreement among \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas and New Jersey and our leader. So \nI am somewhat in a difficult spot here this morning. I will have to \nwait until the leader has arrived. He is not here at the moment, and we \nall understand why he is not, and also the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Two things happened. I remember the distinguished Senator from Texas \nmaking a statement on the floor about how much stronger her bill was \nafter the Lautenberg amendment was attached, and you made a very strong \nstatement about the bill as it left here.\n  The bill was only passed last week. We have been trying to get bills \npassed for 8, 9, and 10 months. So it was just passed last week. The \nproblem in the House, as I understand, was they tried to strip the \nLautenberg amendment from the stalking bill, and that is where it ran \ninto trouble.\n  The day is not over and tomorrow is not over, as the majority leader \nhas said. Maybe things can work out. I am willing to help in any way I \ncan, but I am somewhat at a disadvantage, if I may use that as a tool \nhere. I will work with the majority leader, as Senator Daschle has.\n  So I think what I am saying is correct here, that attempting to take \nthe Lautenberg amendment off the stalking bill last night caused the \nproblems, and that was the reason it was not brought up. Today is \nanother day.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could seek recognition again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before I press the Senator or give assurances to the \nSenator from Texas even further, could I inquire of the Democratic \nwhip--I was under the impression that, if we could work out the \ndifficulties with the nomination of Ms. Montgomery, we could also move \nthe CFTC nominations, which are Republican and Democrat, we could move \nthe military nominations, and we could begin to move the appropriations \nconference reports.\n  I am informed that maybe that is not the case if I move forward in \ngood faith on the nomination of the judge from Minnesota. Have I been \ninformed correctly we are not going to move these other nominations?\n  Mr. FORD. That depends. That would be my position as of this time, \nthat only the one judge. We can do judges, and that is plural. We can \ndo safe drinking water. We can do the small business minimum wage \nconference report.\n  Mr. LOTT. Oh, yes.\n  Mr. FORD. We could do health care and those sorts of things.\n  Mr. LOTT. Can we do the health care conference report?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes, we could. But, I mean, we have a little problem with \nthat bill. As the majority leader knows, we want to have a striking \nprovision relating to a drug patent that was put into the conference \nreport. We would like to have an opportunity to remove that before we \nmove to it.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. You have the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are going to have to have some good faith and \ncooperation. If the Democrats are going to hold up all the legislation \nuntil we get agreement on all the judges, then I think that is \nexceeding anybody's expectations. It is not going to happen. I have \nacted in good faith. I continue to act in good faith. I have been here \nbefore everybody trying to work out one more. But if you are going to \nhold up agreed-to CFTC nominations and health insurance legislation and \nall these other bills until there is some agreement on all of the \njudges here today, then I think that is just not going to be possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9456-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9457-S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      POINT OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to say one other thing, Mr. President, because I \nhave been waiting for an opportunity to rise on a point of personal \nprivilege.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. My integrity has been questioned by a Member of the House \nof Representatives. The Congressman from California, Pete Stark, \nalleged that I had committed an ethical violation because, as the \nmajority leader in the U.S. Senate and as a conferee on the conference \nwith the House on the health insurance legislation, I urged \nconsideration of the conference on a specific issue, this drug that was \njust mentioned.\n  Mr. FORD. Drug patent.\n  Mr. LOTT. The drug patent. That tells you how much I know about this. \nFirst of all, I resent the fact that my integrity was impugned. I do \nnot act that way. This is not an issue that I have a direct personal \ninterest in, even though I understand, I have been told, that this is \nintended to be a dagger aimed at my heart, that we are going to take \nout this drug patent to get at the majority leader.\n\n  Why? This is a product for arthritic patients. It is not produced in \nmy State. There is no plant in my State. I do not have a vested \ninterest in this. I act at the request of my colleagues in the Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, Senate and House, as a conferee.\n  I was presented this issue as a fairness issue. I talked to a lot of \ndifferent Congressmen and Senators. I talked to Congressman Walker of \nPennsylvania. He is the first one that mentioned it to me. I did not \nknow what he was talking about. There are Democratic Congressmen who \nspoke up in defense of this issue yesterday.\n  I remind you, after questioning my integrity, Congressman Stark was \none of only two--two--House Members who voted against that health \ninsurance reform package. He is totally out of order, and I resent it. \nI am not going to tolerate that sort of thing.\n  Also, Senators came to me from all over America, Republicans and \nDemocrats, saying this is something that ought to be done--Senator \nGorton of Washington, I do not know what his interest is; Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania; Senator Santorum. These are good and honorable \nmen who made a case for it.\n  I have a staff member who is an expert tax lawyer, a woman. We \ndiscussed it. It seemed like the right thing to do. I urged, if it were \npossible, that this be included in the package.\n  That is the whole story. If you are aiming a dagger at my heart, you \nbetter pick another issue. I ``ain't got no\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\ndog in this fight.'' I am just trying to help work it out with Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy and Democrats and Republicans, House and \nSenate, to get important legislation done for the women and children \nand the sick and the elderly in this country. A drug for arthritis, for \nHeaven's sake. So, you know, take it out; it is OK with me. But before \nyou do it, you better check with a lot of Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, that say they wanted that. But, in conclusion, Mr. \nPresident, if this is to get at the majority leader, you missed. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the argument of the majority leader is not \nwith us here on this side. It is with Representative Stark over there, \nbecause we are not in--as he said, our dog is not in that fight. We do \nbelieve, however, that this drug for arthritis is one that, if you keep \nthis language in the bill, will be manufactured for 2 more years and \nthe price will be up. It will not be a generic drug.\n  That is our legislative problem with this and not an argument between \nthe majority leader and Representative Stark. I think they should not \njump on us. I think we will come together on it.\n  But the other side of the coin is there is a legislative problem that \nwe would like to try to work out if we could as it relates to the bill. \nIf that is possible, we will try to do that. I do not like \npersonalities at all. I do not like this, taking another Member on in \nthe press. I think it is wrong. I will defend myself. I am just as \npolitical as the next person, but I try, as best I can, not to be \npersonal. I think it is unfortunate.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FORD. Yes. I will be delighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9457-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF ANN D. MONTGOMERY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is in the form of a question, if my colleagues \nwould be tolerant for just a moment. The first question or comment is, \nagain, I understand what the Senator from Texas has said. I do want to \npoint out that Judge Montgomery does not have anything to do with what \nis going on in the House of Representatives or anywhere else. She is \njust back in Minnesota waiting to be confirmed.\n  I say to the majority leader, whom I have worked with in good faith \nand appreciate all that he is doing, that a long time ago we discussed \nJudge Montgomery. We were going to do it judge by judge. I hope she \njust does not get held up in this big puzzle, and we can please go \nforward with her.\n  The last point I want to make is just to follow up on the minority \nwhip. Since then I talked to the majority leader yesterday about \nLodine. I said this was something I would challenge on the floor. But I \nunderstand exactly what the majority leader had to say, and I, in no \nway, shape, or form, believe this should have anything to do with any \nkind of personal attack or anything like that. I am opposed to that. \nWhen we have this discussion and I have a point of order, I will stay \nfar away from that.\n  The majority leader has been someone I have enjoyed knowing and \nenjoyed working with, and I want him to know that, as somebody who will \nbe on the floor later on in that debate. But could we please--Judge \nMontgomery is just waiting back in Minnesota for us to move this. Could \nwe please do that for her? I have told her that Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans, are good people, that we all have a big heart. Could we \nplease move her forward?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, first I would just like to say, it has \nbeen a year ago today that the health insurance reform legislation \npassed unanimously in the Labor Committee. So, it has been a bumpy road \nto achieve what has been achieved, and, I think, a very important piece \nof legislation. One of the reasons it is on the floor today has been \nthe active participation and support of the majority leader.\n  The Senator from Mississippi has been insistent that we achieve the \npassage of this bill, the conference be successful. I just want to say \nthat I think any differences that may have arisen because of the patent \nextension provision, which was added late, can be addressed.\n  But certainly the majority leader is one of the reasons we have \nbefore us today the health insurance reform bill, and it is my hope \nthat we can bring it up and we can address this and not put it off to \nthe point that we are going to lose an opportunity to pass this, which \nis a small but historic step for health insurance reform. I yield the \nfloor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9458-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9458-S9460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT TO THE STALKING BILL\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I regret that I was not here at the \ntime this debate began because we are now engaged in a discussion about \nwhat it is that is holding up the progress of the U.S. Senate on behalf \nof the American people. We have a most extraordinary situation here in \nthe Senate. I think it is important the public understand what has \nhappened.\n\n  The public is being victimized by procedural gridlock that is going \nto cost thousands of people across this country an opportunity to have \ntheir cases heard, to see justice dispensed, and fairness dealt with.\n  Last night, the U.S. Senate was thrown into gridlock once again, \nalthough an agreement had been reached between the respective leaders \nto move forward with several important judicial nominations. That \nagreement was undermined at the last minute when one Member of this \nbody objected unexpectedly, and much contrary to the rules and protocol \nhere--courtesy, if you will--when the minority leader, the Democratic \nleader, asked the Senator what was her objection, she turned on her \nheel and walked out. I have never seen that in the 14 years I have been \nin the U.S. Senate. Usually, there is a courtesy that says, ``Well, I \nobject for the following reasons,'' and that makes sense. That is the \nway this body operates.\n  Now the basis of the objection has become clear. It is truly \nremarkable. The Senate is being held hostage and so is the American \npublic for one reason, and one reason only: So that we do not take away \nguns from wife beaters and child abusers. We want to make sure they can \nget their gun if they want it. That is why some 2,000-plus women a year \nget killed by men who have already beat them up, have been hauled into \ncourt, and in many cases convicted of misdemeanors, and then they want \ntheir gun back. Around here, we want to make sure those nice boys can \nget their guns.\n  Mr. President, the situation is too absurd. It would almost be a \ncomedy, but it is too serious, a matter of life and death for thousands \nof women and children whose futures are being threatened by a narrow \nfaction of extremists.\n  I want to take a moment to explain. Mr. President, for months I have \nbeen trying to get an amendment included in the bill that deals with \nthe problem of stalking. Stalking is a terrible thing for anyone to \nhave to endure. We see it in New Jersey. We see it across the country. \nI am sure all 50 States have the problem. I support the bill. In fact, \nI am cosponsor of the legislation.\n  I wanted to make it even more effective. That is the right that we \nhave here. When you have an opportunity to add a piece of legislation \nyou think has merit, you put it on a piece of legislation that has \nalready been introduced. I have been working to include an amendment \nthat would prohibit anyone convicted of domestic violence from \npossessing a firearm. It is pretty simple. My amendment stands for the \nsimple proposition that if you beat your wife, if you beat your kid, \nyou should not have a gun. It says ``beat your wife, lose your gun; \nabuse your child, lose your gun.'' It is pretty simple. It is little \nmore than common sense.\n  Mr. President, for months I tried to include my proposal as part of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\nstalking bill. Finally, on July 25, after agreeing to several changes \nat the request of my Republican colleagues, my legislation passed the \nSenate by a voice vote. The compromise, Mr. President, that was worked \nout was supported by even the most ardent progun Members of this body. \nEven those Members were not willing to go on record and stand up here \nand vote to say that someone accused of wife abuse, child abuse should \nhave to have a gun.\n  They did not want to vote on it, because it would have been a \nshameful experience. Maybe they would have pleased some, but they would \nnot have pleased all. So our sense was that with the changes that were \nmade at their request, the stalking bill, which was here with my \namendment attached, should be able to move quickly and easily through \nthe House.\n\n  It was my understanding that the majority party here was going to \nhelp work it through the House. Well, Mr. President, it looks like the \nextremists are back. Although the House passed a large number of \nnoncontroversial bills earlier this week, this legislation was not \namong them. Now we hear that there is a move afoot among Republican \nleaders in the House to eliminate my proposal, the proposal that wife \nbeaters should not get guns.\n  I think, Mr. President, the American people would share my outrage at \nthis. Every year thousands of women and children die at the hands of a \nfamily member, and 65 percent of the time those murderers use that gun. \nThere is no reason why wife beaters and child abusers should have guns, \nand only the most progun extremists could possibly disagree with that. \nUnfortunately, these same extremists seem to have veto rights in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, I made it clear that if the stalking bill comes back \nfrom the House with my proposal gutted I will not just sit back and \ntake it. The lives of thousands of women and children are at stake. We \nare not just talking about the use of a gun in a murder; we are talking \nabout a gun that is used in intimidation, to threaten and to strike \nfear and harass. Imagine what a child must think when he sees a man \nholding a gun, threatening a woman, even if he does not pull the \ntrigger. What kind of a society are we that says by law we should not \nremove the gun from the hands of that individual? I will fight for this \nevery step of the way.\n  Now we have the progun extremists dictating how this body is going to \nfunction. It is across the Capitol, but we are willing to do it here. \nThings like judicial appointments, so that justice can be administered, \nso that we can move the process that this country has in its very \nfoundation, a country of laws.\n  ``No, no,'' the Senator from Texas says. ``No, no, you are not \ngetting those judges. I don't care how good they are.'' What she is \nsaying is, ``Unless you take off the denial of a convicted wife abuser \nto own a gun, I am not letting judges go through.'' What a contrast. It \nis perfect. Want to control the law, not let the judges go through, not \nlet other important legislation go through? Tie the place up in a knot.\n  Well, maybe that is where we are going to be, but I hope the American \npublic hears it. I hope they understand what is being said here, that \nyou can have a gun even though you may have beaten your wife. It \nreminds me of the story I repeated on this floor now a few times about \nthe judge in Baltimore County, not far from here, who, faced with a \nsentencing of a man who murdered his wife, sentenced him to 18 months, \ntime to be done on weekends, because he said he ``didn't like giving a \nnoncriminal a criminal sentence.'' In other words, murdering a wife is \nnot the same as murdering a stranger.\n  Those who want to shut this place down are ignoring what the \nconsequences are of this, not to let us consider noncontroversial \njudicial appointments. So eager that we protect the rights of child \nabusers that they will not let us consider a bill to fund veterans \nhealth care, environmental protection; so eager not to deprive a wife \nbeater of a gun that they are willing to grind the Senate to a halt on \nall appropriations bills.\n  Mr. President, this is extremism run amok. It is outrageous, almost \nunbelievable. So I hope the people and the press will tell the American \npeople what is going on here. It is quite an amazing story, stranger \nthan fiction. It is unbelievable, in my view. It says a lot about this \nCongress and the power of the National Rifle Association. It says a lot \nabout our values, priorities, and about our commitments to people \nvictimized by domestic violence.\n  Mr. President, I am hoping that we can overcome the extremism on this \nissue, because special interests may have a lot of power in Washington. \nExtremism may have a lot of power in Washington, but, at the end of the \nday, the real power in this country rests--and so it should--with the \nAmerican people. I am convinced that the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans would agree with these basic principles: Wife beaters should \nnot have guns. Child abusers should not have guns.\n\n  It is time for Congress to put these principles into law.\n  Mr. President, I just want to refer to the Record of July 25, 1996, \nwhen the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], said:\n\n       Senator Lautenberg is to be commended for working with us \n     to make his amendment a good amendment, and it is a good \n     amendment, and I applaud him for it. I think it adds to the \n     bill. He was willing to work with us, and I think we now have \n     a very strong bill. Because of Senator Lautenberg's \n     amendment, we are also going to be able to keep people who \n     batter their wives or people with whom they live from having \n     handguns. So I think it is going to be a great bill that will \n     give the women and children of this country some protection \n     that they do not now have, and I am very pleased to be \n     supportive of the compromise.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased that Senator Lautenberg \nhas come to the floor, because I think that he is partially correct in \nhis scenario of July 25, and that is that he and I and the leader of \nthe Democratic side and the leader of the Republican side came together \nand made an agreement, and it was an agreement that I was concerned \nabout but, nevertheless, was willing to work with all of my colleagues \nto make happen. That was the following: I do agree with his amendment. \nI think it is a good amendment. That was never the question. The \nquestion is, do we hold up a good bill that protects the stalking \nvictims of this country with an amendment that might bog the bill down \nbecause it has to go back to the House?\n  Now, I supported his amendment, but I asked, ``Could we put it on \nanother bill? Could we make the agreement that Senator Lautenberg would \nget his vote on another bill?'' The distinguished leader of the \nDemocratic Party said, ``Well, they can take it up on a suspension in \nthe House. It really won't delay the bill if they will do that.'' And I \nsaid, ``What if it runs into opposition in the House?'' at which time \nthe Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from South Dakota agreed \nthat they would let the Senate pass a clean bill that could go directly \nto the President, pass the same bill clean so it could go directly to \nthe President, to get relief for the stalking victims, with the \nagreement of the distinguished majority leader that Senator Lautenberg \nwould be able to go to another forum, another bill for his amendment.\n  So when we talk about the extremists that are for wife beaters having \nguns, that is really not the issue. The issue is, are we going to have \nthe stalking bill, which is a good bill, which passed unanimously in \nthe House of Representatives, if we can't get Mr. Lautenberg's \namendment on the bill? That is the question.\n  Now, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from South Dakota \ngave their word that if it ran into trouble in the House, they would \nhelp pass a clean bill so that we could do that much and give the \nSenator from New Jersey another opportunity on another bill for his \namendment. So that is the issue here. Now it has run into trouble in \nthe House.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky says, ``It has only been \npassed for a week.'' We got the bill Memorial Day. I had hoped that we \ncould have it passed before Memorial Day. It has been 2 months since \nthe bill came from the House, and we have had this opportunity.\n  I am certainly in sympathy with the Senator from New Jersey in \nwanting to have his amendment. But he did make\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n\nan agreement that he would not hold up one good bill for his amendment \nhaving to go just on that bill. We have other options. There will be \nother bills. The majority leader, whose word is good, will find another \nopportunity for the Senator from New Jersey. But we must know that we \nare going to have the stalking bill at some reasonable time. I would \nlike to see it before the recess so that we can put this law into \nplace. It has been pending since Memorial Day. So I would like to ask \nif we could work on having this bill out and work with the Senator from \nNew Jersey for his amendment to go on another bill. It is really quite \nsimple. If everyone is in agreement that the underlying stalking bill \nis good, then I think we should move forward on that.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9458-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9460-S9461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while we are talking about bills that need \nto be moved, I want to return to the matter of the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. As Members in this body and those who are \nobserving our actions will recall, last night, proceeding to the bill \nwas objected to by the Senator from Minnesota. This bill is being held \nhostage for another issue not related to it.\n  I rise today to point out to my colleagues the importance of passing \nthis bill as quickly as possible. This is an appropriations bill. This \nis an important appropriations bill that provides money for the \nVeterans Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Environmental Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, National Science Foundation, and others.\n  We not only have to pass that bill, however, to provide funds \nbeginning on October 1, the start of the new fiscal year, there are, at \nthe request of the administration, certain emergency supplemental \nmatters that have to be dealt with now. Let me advise my colleagues \nthat the consequences of continuing to delay action--and the delay last \nnight may already have made it too late to get this bill through--I am \nready, however, to stay here and work as long as the leadership wants \nus to work, because this bill contains a supplemental appropriation for \nGinnie Mae, the Government National Mortgage Corporation. This bill \nprovides a $20 billion increase in the current limitation on loan \nguarantees for mortgage-backed securities needed to finance FHA and \nVeterans Administration mortgages through September.\n  If we do not pass this bill, it means that sometime probably in early \nSeptember, the VA and FHA will no longer be able to sell in the \nsecondary mortgage market the paper that is generated by an issuance of \nloans to veterans and to those who qualify for the FHA. These people \nwill be without the financing that should be available to them, and it \nwill be the fault of this body and those who have held up this bill if \nveterans in my State, in the State of California, the State of New \nYork, or the State of Minnesota are not able to get mortgages in \nSeptember.\n  The effect will be ultimately increasing mortgage interest rates and \nconstraining home financing availability.\n  In addition, if this bill is delayed past the signing after October \n1, as of September 30 the Federal Emergency Management Agency advises \nus that they will no longer be able to write flood insurance policies. \nProperty owners in every State in the Nation depending upon Federal \nflood insurance will no longer be able to get Federal flood insurance. \nThe authority expires. We have been asked to include an extension of \nthe authorization for one more year in this bill. Without this bill, \nflood insurance will not be available.\n  There has also been discussion of water projects. Everybody knows \nthat the District of Columbia is suffering from drinking water \nproblems. This bill includes $2 million for water infrastructure funds, \nincluding funds that will go ultimately to the safe drinking water \nrevolving fund in every State and the District of Columbia.\n  That requires some additional explanation. We know that the House has \npassed the safe drinking water bill. We know also that the \nappropriations measure which passed both bodies and was signed into law \nfor the current fiscal year had a provision that if the safe drinking \nwater law was reauthorized prior to August 1, there would be roughly \n$725 million available for that fund. August 1 has come and gone. As a \nresult of the terms of the appropriations bill for this year, that \nmoney goes into the clean water fund. Those moneys are in the process \nof being paid out by the EPA to the State revolving funds.\n  When this bill is ultimately passed and signed by the President, \ntraditionally the EPA takes about 3 months to get regulations issued so \nthat funds can be paid out to all of the States under the formula for \nthe drinking water revolving fund.\n  We are prepared in this measure when the President signs the safe \ndrinking water bill, as I hope he will, to credit the safe drinking \nwater fund with the money that is poured over into the clean water fund \nand provide additional appropriations, reducing the clean water funds \nfor the next fiscal year.\n  I have assured the authorizing committees that we will make those \nmoneys available as soon as we can approve this bill. As soon as we can \nsend it to the President and get it signed, that money will be there.\n  The opposition to moving forward to VA-HUD means that we are holding \nup money to go to drinking water projects and clean water projects. The \nmoney that was temporarily set aside until August 1 for the States for \nthe drinking water funds is now in the clean water fund, and the EPA \ncan continue to distribute that money. It can go to the States and the \nState revolving fund.\n  So that money is not lost. There have been some irresponsible \nstatements by people who do not understand the process that the money \nis being lost. The money is not lost. The money can go to work today, \ntomorrow, this week on the clean water fund, but if it gets passed by \nboth Houses and the President signs the safe drinking water fund at the \ndirection and at the request of the authorizing committees, I will \nrecommend to the committee and to this body that we put an equivalent \namount from the 1997 appropriations into the safe drinking water \nrevolving fund so that the District of Columbia and other States--as \nsoon as the Environmental Protection Agency writes the regulations and \ncan hand out the money--will have the dollars available to improve the \ndrinking water supplies. That is another reason this bill must be \nprotected.\n\n  In addition, this bill includes the funds needed as of October 1 to \nsend out benefit checks to about 2 million poor and disabled veterans \nand veterans' widows. When this bill is held hostage, as it was last \nnight, we are threatening the money that goes to the poor and disabled \nveterans and their widows.\n  This bill, Mr. President, also has $1 billion to restore FEMA's \ndisaster relief fund so that disaster victims from floods and other \ndisasters across the country may be helped by FEMA. Mr. President, when \nsomeone holds up this bill and holds it hostage, it is holding hostage \nthe money that would go to aid victims of disaster.\n  I ask my colleagues to quit playing games with a vitally important \nappropriations bill. Deal with the other matters. There are many \nsensitive matters. There are many things that I have that are being \nheld up, and I am doing my best to work out agreements with those who \nare holding them up. But I say to you that the appropriations bills \nneed to go forward not only to fund vital programs that begin October \n1, but in the instance of the Ginnie Mae loan limitation, the bill has \nto be enacted as soon as possible so that Ginnie Mae's ability to sell \nVA and FHA mortgages will not expire.\n  In addition, as of October 1, there will be no authority for FEMA to \nwrite flood insurance.\n  Mr. President, we have talked enough about all of these problems. I \nhope that very shortly the majority leader will be able to ask \nunanimous consent to move forward on some of these vitally important \nmeasures that are pending before this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I say to my colleagues that \nI will take only 2 minutes.\n  Look, the Senator from Missouri--we know each other. We work together \non the Small Business Committee. If we want to talk about being held \nhostage, we have a judge who is being held hostage. The Senator knows--\nhe was up here earlier--that there are a lot of discussions going on. \nAnd I think the majority leader is confident that this can be worked \nout very soon.\n  Nobody is trying to stop everything. This all started with a \nwonderful judge. You would think she is wonderful. She thought she was \ngoing through the other night. Everybody had given their word. It was \ngoing to be by unanimous consent. And then, all of a sudden, for a \nvariety of different reasons, it did not.\n  It does not do any good for anybody to get angry at anybody any \nlonger. It did happen. We are now trying to work this out. Believe me, \nthis really was the judge that was held hostage. But we are beyond that \nnow. We are working hard on an agreement, and that is going to happen.\n  That is all I would say to my colleague. I think he knows that.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would say simply that the effect of what \nhas been done is to hold this bill hostage. I am not in here to fight \nabout judges. I have had judges held up before. I sympathize with \npeople who want to move things forward that are held up. I am simply \npointing that out for whatever reason. I am not here to judge whether \nthis judge may or may not be important in all the measures and all of \nthe provisions that I have cited.\n\n  I want to call attention to everybody in this body the likely \nconsequences of holding up this bill. It was held hostage last night, \nand until we hear differently, I regret that it apparently is being \nheld hostage, and the consequences.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me just take 1 minute, and then I will \nsit down.\n  The Senator from Missouri is fussing quite eloquently here about not \ngetting his bill up and giving a lot of reasons. The objection this \nmorning came from your side, not from this side. It came from your side \nto bringing things up over a bill that is in the House, not in the \nSenate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield? There has been no objection \nthis morning. There has been no offer. There has been no objection. The \nobjection was last night by the Senator from Minnesota on a judgeship.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I know what the objection would be. The \nreason it has been brought up is because there would be an objection, \nand the objection was made last night.\n  The finger pointing has gone too far here. I think we need to call a \nquorum, wipe the sweat off, and try to work things out instead of \npointing fingers at each other. We are getting too harsh.\n  The majority leader is working hard, trying to make this thing work, \nand then we have people jumping up and down fussing back and forth. It \nis time it stopped. It is time it stopped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator is correct. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I want to make the same point. The Senator from Missouri \nmakes an appropriate point about the urgency, and we need to move this \nlegislation. I understand that. I accept that. I hope we can do that.\n  To suggest somehow that one Senator, the Senator from Minnesota, or \nanyone else in the Chamber is deliberately holding something hostage is \nnot appropriate.\n  What has happened here is there are a series of issues that get done \nby consent and by agreement, and the majority leader and minority \nleader and others have worked hard to put these things together. Some \nof them become unraveled, and there are a number of reasons that they \nbecome unraveled.\n  The fact is when you start talking about taking hostages, if we \nwanted to spend some time we could talk about hostagees here for a \nwhile, but I do not think it would serve your interests or mine. I just \nthink it is not appropriate to suggest that the Senator from Minnesota \nor anyone else is holding up this bill. There is a whole series of \nthings that have to be done by agreement here, and when they are done \nall these things are going to work and happen.\n  Again, I say that it is appropriate to talk about the urgency of this \nbill. I do not want to go back and talk about how this started, but I \nknow how it started and so does the Senator from Missouri, and it needs \nto get unraveled, which includes a whole series of issues including \nthis bill.\n  I appreciate the Senator yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9460-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9461-S9462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to raise the awareness of the \nSenate as to the importance of being able to pass the D.C. \nappropriations bill today.\n  The reason for that is that we have in this city a serious problem \nwith the drinking water. And I will mention that in a little more \ndetail in a moment. The bill is at the desk. It has passed the House. \nThere is an appropriation in that bill to provide for immediate efforts \nto clean up the serious circumstances with the city's drinking water. I \ndo not want to alarm anyone too much, but it is a health hazard to \ncertain individuals who have immune problems as well as elderly people.\n  In order to correct it, it is going to take some effort from private \ncontractors, and it is going to take funds in order to contract with \nrespect to certain pumps that may be broken in the efforts to flush the \npumps out.\n  In addition to that, we also have serious problems right now which \nneed attention immediately, that is, we have public safety funds which \nhave been increased in this bill. We have police cars right now on the \nblocks; we have fire engines in the shop and computer systems in chaos. \nThere are funds in the bill which will allow us to do that and to get \nstarted immediately upon passage of the D.C. appropriations bill.\n  Let me read to you from the report on the drinking water matter so \nthat everybody is fully aware of the situation the city finds itself \nin:\n\n       The conferees are deeply concerned about recent violations \n     of Federal drinking water standards and continuing problems \n     that beset the drinking water supply and the distribution \n     systems in District of Columbia. The Federal Environmental \n     Protection Agency recently completed a preliminary \n     investigation of the water quality problems attributed to the \n     District water distribution system and concluded that there \n     is an urgent and immediate need for the District to implement \n     steps to assure the integrity of drinking water quality in \n     the District. Among the most important of these recommended \n     actions is that the District hire a private contractor or \n     contractors to flush the drinking water distribution system \ncompletely and to inspect and repair water valves. The conferees agree \nthat there is a strong Federal interest in assuring that those who \nvisit, live, and work in the Nation's Capital have safe drinking water. \nAccordingly, the conference agreement includes $1 million in Federal \nfunds for this purpose under Amendment No. 2. These funds are provided \nto the Financial Control Board to contract with a private entity or \nentities to conduct an inspection, the flushing and repair work \nrecommended by the EPA. The conferees direct the Control Board to \nconsult with the Department of Public Works, D.C. Water and Sewer \nAuthority, and EPA in implementing this activity. Further, the \nconferees encourage the Control Board to move expeditiously to contract \nfor the work in anticipation of the funds provided.\n\n  I just want to point out that if this bill passes, an immediate \naction will be taken to be able to correct the serious problems we have \nwith the water in the city. So I hope that it would come to a point \nwhere we can pass that expeditiously today. The majority leader may or \nmay not wish to call it up, but I want to let everyone know I am ready. \nIt has passed the House. I want to assure all of the citizens of the \nDistrict as well as those who visit us that we are doing everything \npossible and any delay would, again, impair the safety of certain \nindividuals in the District, and I hope that does not occur.\n  In addition, we are ready to move on this, and it is important for \nthe city to get into a position where they know where they stand.

Mr. President, last night the House of Representatives \npassed and sent to the Senate the conference report on military \nconstruction, and that bill, too, is at the desk to be considered \ntoday. We have worked very, very hard with both sides of the aisle to \nwork out our differences--and sometimes on the same side of the aisle.\n  I applaud my good friend from Vermont, with whom I used to serve on \nD.C. Appropriations, on the work they have done on the D.C. \nappropriations bill. And the work that Senator Bond has done in his \ncommittee as far as VA-HUD.\n  We have worked very hard, too, on the thrust of military construction \nin this particular year, not only dealing with less dollars but also \ndealing with some very important items which have always been put on \nthe shelf. One of them is the environment because of the Base Closure \nand Realignment Commission, and the other one is family housing and \nsupport services for families that serve this country on our posts \naround the world.\n  This bill provides the necessary funding for the planning, the \ndesign, the construction, the alteration, and the improvement of \nmilitary facilities around the world, and included in that, of course, \nis the appropriation that keeps us strong, the NATO Security Investment \nProgram. It also provides the funding to implement base closures and \nrealignment as called for by law.\n  Again, let me emphasize that in this bill there is included child \ndevelopment centers. We worry about children. We hear speeches made \nabout children. Repairs are needed also for the damage that was done by \nHurricane Bertha. In this bill is funding for family support centers on \nour bases and environmental compliance projects. I think one of the \nmost important parts of the funding in this bill is environmental \ncleanup when these bases are closed and, of course, taking new actions \nwhere active bases are still in operation; hospitals, public safety \nsuch as fire stations.\n  There is $1.2 billion for the implementation of BRAC, $4 billion for \nfamily housing. Out of a $9 billion appropriation, $4 billion will be \nspent on families and family housing to improve the life of our \nmilitary people. Just to give you an idea on that: Yuma Marine Air \nStation in Yuma, AR; Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, 202 units, \nspending $29 million; Lenmoore Naval Air Station in California; \nFlorida, Mayport Naval Station; in Hawaii, almost $60 million being \nspent for family support and housing; in Maryland, just outside of \nWashington here, the Naval Testing Center at Patuxent River; Camp \nLejeune, community centers; family centers in Texas, Corpus Christi \nNaval Complex; Kingsville Naval Air Station; in Virginia, Chesapeake, \nWallops Island; State of Washington, at Bangor Naval Submarine Base, \nand Everett Naval Air Station, Puget Sound.\n  The list goes on of those projects that are started or being planned \nand started, and all of them in support of families that serve this \ncountry. One has to remember that they, too, have to live, and we have \nstarted a new project, the Secretary of Defense working with the \ncorporate sector in partnership for private housing off base, which is \na new approach. By the way, there is funding in the bill for his \nprogram. There is certain types of community impact assistance that has \nto be provided for our military who face the loss of a sale of private \nresidences due to installation realignments and due to some closures.\n  So, Mr. President, that is what is in limbo here whenever we start \ntalking about gumming up the process. Here is a bill that we have \nworked very hard to overcome the objections on both sides of the aisle, \nto make it through not only committee, subcommittee and full committee \nand, yes, on the floor to pass a bill, send it to the House and then \nconference and bring it back and it is ready to pass this body because \nthe House passed it last night and it is ready to be sent to the \nPresident for his signature to implement what we think is very \nimportant in support of our military families around the globe.\n  So, I ask, if we could work out this so-called flap and get the \nprocess back on the move again, lay aside some of our emotions and do \nthe right thing and allow us to bring the conference report of the \nmilitary construction to this floor, pass it, and let us send it to the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9462-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9462-S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we had some good discussion this \nmorning and I believe we made some progress in talking to Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, working out problems.\n  I know several Senators are going to need an opportunity to talk to \nthe minority leader. I know the minority whip will be doing that here \nin a few minutes. So, hopefully, after those conversations we can get \nan understanding of how we can move on these very important issues. So, \nat this time, rather than just keeping the Senate here, what I propose \nto do is to have the Senate stand in recess until 2:30 p.m., at which \ntime I will again enter into a colloquy with the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from New Jersey about how we will deal with the stalking \nissue and the Lautenberg amendment; and then I would move to get \nunanimous-consent agreement on Judge Montgomery; and then I would move \nthe CFTC nominees, and then the military nominations, including the new \nChief of Naval Operations, which is needed very badly to be on duty. \nThen I would move to take up the health care issue.\n  In the meantime, I understand there will be some efforts made to deal \nwith the drug patent issue in a way that, hopefully, is acceptable. And \nthen we would go to the small business tax relief and minimum wage \nissue, and the safe drinking water conference report; all three of \nthose conference reports.\n  I would also go to the DOD authorization and I would--of course, we \nwould need to talk to the minority leader about exactly how we deal \nwith that.\n  I would also attempt to move the three noncontroversial, universally \nsupported military construction appropriations, legislative \nappropriations and D.C. appropriations. If we could get those issues \nworked out and completed, we would have made tremendous achievement \nhere today.\n  If at 2:30 we cannot get an agreement on these, or an agreement on a \npackage of these items, it would be my intent to take the Senate out \nfor the balance of the day and come back tomorrow morning. I see no \nsense in standing around here waiting or going in and out on recess. So \nwe will have 2\\1/2\\ hours now in which we can consider the situation, \ndecide if we want to pass health insurance reform that so many people \nlabored so hard on, that every voting representative in the House but \ntwo voted for just yesterday, the small business tax relief, minimum \nwage--everybody wants to get this done--and the safe drinking water. \nEverybody wants these three bills done.\n  I understand the White House is very anxious for us to get that done. \nThere is no reason why we should not do these three appropriations \nconference reports. So we will have some time here to work through that \nand have a chance to talk to the minority leader. I hope to hear from \nhim in the next hour or two. And we will see if we can\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\nget this all worked out. And if we can, it would be really great. If we \ncannot, we will just go out and come back in the morning. I have had \nthat on my mind all week anyway. So we can do that.\n  Mr. FORD. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to.\n  Mr. FORD. I have no objection to the recess. But we do have a couple \nSenators that were on their way to make some remarks on our side. If \nyou could withhold that or set it at the end of the statements by \nSenator Kennedy and Senator Wyden and maybe Senator Baucus, because \nthose three would like to make some remarks. That way we would not be \nwasting the time.\n  Mr. LOTT. As long as there are Senators who would like to speak, \nobviously, we want to allow that. If those three are going to speak, we \nwould probably want to have maybe some response on our side. But when \nwe reach the point where Senators are not here speaking, instead of \njust keeping everybody here waiting, I would propose we recess then \nuntil 2:30. But at 2:30, regardless, I will move to get this underway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9462-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am very hopeful, and I know the \nAmerican people are, that we will move ahead this afternoon on the \nconference report dealing with the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. As we know, \nit was a year ago today that we passed that bill out of the Human \nResources Committee. It languished for close to 9 months on the Senate \ncalendar before it was considered. Then it was considered. And it has \nbeen several more months before we were able to get resolution of the \nprincipal items which were at issue, the portability issue, the MSA \nissue and the other provisions in the legislation. And we saw a \nsuccessful conclusion of those issues just some 2 days ago. All of us \nare very eager to get that measure down to the President of the United \nStates.\n\n  However, I must say, a number of us were very surprised to find that \nour staffs, around 10:30 or 11 o'clock the night before last, after a \nnumber of us were assured that there were only technical corrections in \nthe legislation, discovered that a special provision had been included \ninto the act at page 76. That special provision, which no one knew \nabout, was a patent extension and special treatment for a drug called \nLodine which people take for arthritis. And now that is in the health \ncare legislation that we all want to get to the President of the United \nStates as soon as we can. But, this afternoon we are faced with this \nspecial interest provision being put into the whole proposal.\n  I just want to make it very clear that neither I nor do I understand \nany other Member of our side, and to the best of my knowledge on the \nother side, had any idea whatsoever that this special interest \nprovision benefiting a single company had been included in the health \ncare bill. It is a special interest provision for one particular \ncompany that has annual revenues from this one drug, Lodine, of some \n$275 million.\n  The special interest provision gives that company 2 additional years \nof patent protection and other special benefits. As I understand it, in \nreturn, the company would have to pay $10 million each year for a total \nof $20 million to the Federal Government and pay the States so they do \nnot have to pay for the increased costs due to the patent extension.\n  So the question is, Who pays? Well, the answer to that is, everyone \nelse in America will pay more for Lodine. Every senior and every \nAmerican who uses this arthritis drug will pay more because this \nspecial provision says no one else can compete with this drug for 2 \nmore years. This provision eliminates competition and gives this \ncompany a monopoly, which means it can charge whatever it wants for its \ndrug. Our seniors and everyone else will be paying the bill for this \nspecial interest provision.\n  The question is, then, How much more? How much more money will people \nhave to pay? We know that generic competitors historically undercut the \nprice of drugs like Lodine by 30 to 50 percent. That means that when a \npatent expires, other companies can make and sell inexpensive generic \nversions of the drug to compete. This provision means that there can be \nno competition for 2 more years and that means Americans will pay \nbetween $80 to $130 million more each year for this sweetheart deal.\n  Now, Mr. President, we all know that this sweetheart deal will cause \nall the other companies to come in here and ask for special favors \nalso. This deal for one drug will open the floodgates and will cost \nconsumers hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, the claim is made that we ought to go ahead with this \nspecial deal because their competitor has received an extension. That a \ncompetitor, called Daypro, got a deal stuck into the continuing \nresolution in April 1996, without any hearings, without any testimony, \nwithout any public review by the committees with jurisdictions, does \nnot make this right. It is an old saying, but it is true: Two wrongs do \nnot make a right. Because one snuck through, we cannot do it again and \nagain and again.\n  It will not stop with Lodine. There are 12 drugs in this class on the \nmarket. You do this for Lodine, and the other 10 will be here tomorrow. \nIn fact, in the last 2 weeks alone, three or four of those other \ncompanies have already been in this building asking for special \ntreatment like Lodine. It will not stop here. The special interests \nwill be banging at the door.\n  Mr. President, this is not really a new issue for some Members of the \nSenate because there was an effort to include a special deal for Lodine \nin June 1996, in the Defense authorization bill in the Senate as part \nof the Hatch-Specter GATT loophole closing legislation. But, then the \nlobbyists started lining up asking for special treatment for other \ndrugs. They claimed that if Lodine gets special treatment, then they we \nwould have to do it for others.\n\n  Then there was the Bliley-Dingell letter to the Defense conferees \nsaying, ``Take Lodine out''. And the House Judiciary also objected to \nLodine, and the conferees took Lodine out of the Defense authorization \nbill.\n  That didn't stop the Lodine special provision. The special deal for \nLodine was put into the House agricultural appropriations bill in July. \nBut, Senator Pryor and Senator Chafee drafted a letter dated July 26, \n1996 to Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers saying there was no merit \nand no basis for a Lodine extension. They said there were no hearings \nor deliberations of any kind in either the House or the Senate to \ndetermine if there were any public purpose served by granting this \nspecial extension. They urged that it be taken out of the agricultural \nappropriations bill.\n  At about the same time, the Senate health care conferees were \nappointed on July 25. And on July 30, the Republicans gave the \nDemocrats a draft of this section of the health care bill. That draft \nwas dated June 25, but it had no provision relating to the patent \nextension.\n  Then, at about the same time, the agriculture appropriations \nconferees took the special provision for Lodine out of the bill. That, \nI believe, was also on July 30.\n  Now, back to the health care bill. On July 31, there were extensive \nnegotiations on both of the issues of portability and on the MSA \nissues.\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I ask for 5 more minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then at 6:30 that night, July 31, after we worked out \nthe portability and the MSA, I remember the call from Senator Kassebaum \nsaying that we only had about 10 more minutes to sign. And so this \nSenator signed on the basis of the representations of what I knew was \nin the bill and the representations that were made by the various staff \nand other Members who were familiar with the language. There was never \nany mention of any special interest provision for Lodine.\n  We had the press conference announcing the agreement around 8 p.m. \nthat night.\n  Then, around 10:30 that night, the Democratic staff go to legislative \ncounsel and see the administrative simplification section, which they \nwere being shown for the very first time. And there it was. Stuck in \nthe administrative simplification section was this special provision \nfor Lodine. This is the first time that anyone had seen this provision. \nIndeed, it was the first time anyone had even heard about it in \nconnection with the health care bill.\n  They thought they killed it in the Defense authorization. They \nthought they killed it in the agriculture appropriations bill. But, \nthey didn't. No. It was snuck into the health care bill and no one knew \nit and the rest is history.\n  It is interesting that over in the House on August 1, there was a \nDemocratic effort to recommit the bill due to the special patent \nprovision and also because of the nonparity for mental health.\n  The vote to re-commit in the House was 224 to 198. I have heard from \na number of my colleagues that if that motion had only dealt with the \npatent provision, it would have been rejected and returned to the \nconference.\n  Now, Senator Lott's spokeswoman was quoted in today's CongressDaily. \nI know Senator Lott would want to clear up the alleged quote in \nCongress Daily because it said that this special provision was added \nwith full knowledge of the conferees and was done for fairness. He was \neither misquoted or wrong on that, because it was not done with the \nknowledge of the conferees. If it were done with the knowledge of some \nof the conferees, then I hope they will come over here and explain it. \nExplain who knew about it. Explain who didn't know about it. Explain \nwhy this special provision was slipped into the health care bill \nwithout our knowledge.\n  Now, it certainly was not done for fairness. It was slipped into the \nbill without telling anyone, because it is not fair, and it is not \ndeserved. Now, Mr. President, I will not take the time now to go into \nall of the details, but I will draw the Senate's attention to the fact \nthat we have been addressing these kinds of issues for the last 20, 25 \nyears. Because of the series of different requests during the 1970's \nand 1980's, the Senate and the Congress, in their wisdom, passed the \nHatch-Waxman bill in 1984 to deal with issues of justice and fairness \nthat perhaps arose under some circumstances due to the arbitrariness or \ntermination of patent extensions. To avoid this very problem, that law \nwas passed to treat all companies equally and fairly. That system has \nworked pretty well. As a matter of fact, Lodine itself has already gone \nthrough that process and it has already received a 2-year extension.\n  But it still claimed that it was treated unfairly by the FDA. It \nstill claimed that the FDA delayed its approval and was unfairly denied \nyears of patent protection. But, as everyone knows, the claim that the \nFDA delayed approval has no merit. Everyone knows this, because this \nclaim was thoroughly reviewed in 1992 and 1993. In fact, the GAO did a \nfull review and published a detailed report in April of 1993. The \nconclusions were unambiguous and firm: any delay was the company's \nfault, not the FDA.\n  I will conclude with this: In 1993, the GAO issued its report \nspecifically about the Lodine patent. GAO concluded there was no basis \nfor recommending a patent term extension. Lodine's approval was delayed \nbecause of the company's actions and for public health reasons. I have \nthat GAO report right here. We will have a chance to get into it in \ngreater detail, but for now let me tell you their fundamental \nconclusions:\n\n       (1) it is a ``me-too'' drug which provided no significant \n     public health benefit or therapeutic breakthrough, which \n     would justify expedited review (such as AIDS or cancer \n     drugs);\n       (2) concerns about Lodine's carcinogenicity were raised \n     both in Canada and the United States, which had to be \n     resolved before the drug could be approved;\n       (3) FDA found that the Lodine submission was ``piecemeal, \n     voluminous, disorganized and based on flawed clinical \n     studies.''\n       (4) the Lodine submission to FDA did not contain ``enough \n     data to prove efficacy until September 1989''--almost 7 years \n     after the submission was made to FDA.\n\n  It goes on and on. Every single claim made by the company was \ninvestigated, reviewed and rejected on the merits. That is why this \nspecial interest provision keeps being slipped in under cover of \ndarkness. It can't stand the light of day. There is no merit or basis \nfor special treatment. Indeed, the facts show that this particular drug \nand this company was already treated fairly and appropriately. Under \nthe rules that everyone else has to abide by, Lodine was treated right. \nIt should have to play by the same rules as its competitors and \neveryone else.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped this special interest provision would not \nbe included. It is not the way to do business. It is a special interest \nprovision that was added without the knowledge of the members of the \nconference. It is bad policy.\n\n  Furthermore, it will result in the fact that millions of senior \ncitizens will pay an unwarranted, unjustified additional amount for \ntheir prescription drugs because of one particular drug company which \nrefused to follow the rules in terms of going through public hearings, \npublic notice, and to give consumers a right to speak. It is absolutely \nwrong, Mr. President.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to address this more, then move \nvery quickly to the final consideration of the very important health \ncare bill which we have reached resolution on. I see no other reason, \nif that unjustified special provision was resolved, that we could not \nresolve the conference report in an hour, or even less, so that it \ncould be on its way to the President of the United States.\n  But, before we can do that, this special interest slipped into the \nhealth care bill will have to be examined. The American consumers \ndeserve better than this type of shabby treatment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

I will be very brief, Mr. President. A few weeks ago, one \nof Vermont's most noted and valued citizens, Mollie Beattie, died. Much \nwas said on the floor of the Senate about her. Much was said in Vermont \nat her memorial service and again at the Department of Interior when \nthe Secretary of Interior, as well as the Vice President, her husband \nand others spoke. Much also was written in Vermont.\n  I noted a commentary by Jim Wilkinson in one of our Vermont \nnewspapers about Mollie Beattie. Jim Wilkinson is one of those \nquintessential Vermonters who represents the best values of our State. \nI have known him for decades, both in his role as the commissioner of \nVermont Department of Forest, Parks and Recreation, and more recently \nas the consulting forester for the tree farm my wife and I have in \nMiddlesex, VT. He is a man of great depth, great honesty, and, frankly, \ngreat wisdom.\n  I ask unanimous consent that what he had to say about Mollie Beattie, \nreported in the Rutland Daily Herald, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, July 23, 1996]\n\n                       Mollie Beattie Remembered\n\n                           (By Jim Wilkinson)\n\n       Webster defines ``memoir'' as ``a report on an event of \n     significance.'' This memoir is a personal observation on the \n     life of Mollie Beattie, an event of great significance.\n       Mollie has been proclaimed as a scholar, a forester, a \n     writer, a philosopher--all that and more. She was known as a \n     friend, a public servant, a leader. In all of these roles \n     Mollie's time with us was lived to the fullest, with \n     vitality, commitment, and serenity.\n       Others have written or spoken of her career in public \n     service to Vermont and to the\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\n     nation. Her political savvy and integrity brought \n     professional respect, as well as outstanding accomplishment. \n     The great courage of her final year has been cited as she \n     fought and at last accepted death with confidence, peace and \n     encouragement for others. Not only at death's door was \n     courage so evident. Her professional standards and personal \n     values demanded courage and confidence and determination in \n     reaching the goals she set for herself.\n       Mollie recognized the importance of maintaining a strong, \n     healthy persona--physically, mentally and spiritually--not a \n     selfish concern for her ego, but the pragmatic acceptance \n     that thus only could she give the most of her life. Carlyle \n     wrote that ``Life is a little gleam of time between two \n     eternities.'' Mollie's life was a great burst of light in \n     that time allotted to her. We have been blessed by it.\n       She had one unusual and wonderful attribute--that of an \n     unconscious but strong sense of personal presence, not one of \n     power or command, but a presence that, of itself, demanded \n     attention and got it. Hard to describe, but easy to recognize \n     when you were exposed to it. Yet there were occasions when, \n     while looking directly at you, she would leave you dreaming \n     or thinking of some secret, transmundane reality, some mystic \n     other world that only she could know and could not share. \n     Then with a glance and a grin she would return her attention \n     to you.\n       At the end Mollie could have assured us, ``I own only my \n     name.

I rise today to inform my colleagues of my degree of \nfrustration with the gridlock that has occurred this entire Congress \npreventing passage of virtually every bill reported by my committee, \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As chairman of that \ncommittee, I obviously have the obligation of moving the bills out. I \nhave attempted to do that.\n  I think it was the night before last, Mr. President, that the \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, expressed similar frustration over an \nobjection from this side of the aisle to a judicial nominee. You can \nimagine my frustration when a few Senators from the Democratic side \nhave prevented passage of all 72 bills from my committee currently \npending on the calendar. Those objections, Mr. President, were not \nbased on the merits of the bills being held; they were based on a \nproblem with some other bill. So we have this chain of ``you are not \ngoing to support my bill unless your bill passes.''\n  I think it is fair to note that during part of the last year and a \nhalf, all of my committee bills were being held not because of any \ninaction by the Senate or my committee, but the excuse was the House \nwas not acting quickly enough on some matter of interest. There are \nmany, many items that are very important to Senators. I want to get \nthem cleared and get them out.\n  For example, Sterling Forest, my good friend Senator D'Amato has been \nurging me, clear Sterling Forest. The New York Times has taken up the \ncharge. I certainly want to see Sterling Forest cleared. I want to \nsupport the position of my friend, Senator D'Amato from New York, who \nresponded to the editorial of the New York Times as it affects New \nJersey, as it affects New York. We attempted to clear that, along with \nthe Utah ski bill, and a couple of small native items for Alaska.\n  I cannot recall how many holds--it was like a rabbit trail. You could \nnot keep up with it fast enough. Once we attempted to clear them, one \nhold would go on, someone would attempt to remove the hold, and, bingo, \nit is back on. My good friend from Utah, Senator Bennett, spent endless \nhours trying to clear that. This is a blatant abuse of the whole \nprocess. It has to stop. I know the leadership feels that way. The \nMembers are going to have to recognize a few realities.\n  Over the past several months, I have been working with my House \ncounterparts to put together a package in conference on the Presidio \nbill. It has virtually everything in it. Everybody is not going to like \neverything in it, but there is virtually something in it for every \nMember. If you want to get behind this bill and get these land issues \npassed, you are simply going to have to recognize that we will have to \nkeep the bill together.\n  Due to the holds and the situation of the Senate, the process has \nbecome cumbersome, to say the least. Virtually everyone who has a parks \nor public lands bill introduced in the House or Senate wants to be \nincluded in any package that is moving.\n  On the other hand, if I try to move an individual bill separately, \nMembers think the Presidio package is dying and want to be included in \nthe measure, as well. So what we have, Mr. President, is gridlock. I am \nnot going to point fingers. It is just the reality.\n  Mr. President, frankly, I have had it. Unless those Members who have \nblanket holds on Energy Committee bills, unless they lift those holds \nand allow me, as chairman, to work the system, to start moving \nindividual bills and packages where appropriate, no bills are going to \nmove. That would be a shame, Mr. President, because these bills affect \nour Nation's parks, public lands, our forests. They are good public \npolicy, and they are good for the environment.\n\n  I want to also add one more thing, because there is some confusion \nabout the interests of the Senator from the State of Alaska. The \nTongass is not part of this package. There is a proposal to allow an \nextension, for 15 years, of a competitive timber contract with the \nForest Service for Louisiana Pulp Co., Louisiana Pacific Co. The \nrationale behind that, or the necessity, is that they are prepared and \nrequired, under the new laws governing effluent and air quality, to \ninvest roughly $200 million in converting this plant--which, I might \nadd, is our only year-round manufacturing plant--in southeastern \nAlaska, upon which 2,000 jobs are dependent. They simply must have a \ncontractual commitment from the Forest Service for supply of raw \nmaterial.\n  Now, why is that different in Alaska? It is different in Alaska, Mr. \nPresident, because we have no other source of timber. There is no \nprivate timber. There is no State timber. It is all owned by the \nFederal Government, and their current contract is about to expire.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have 1\\1/2\\ more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the 15-year contract is not extended, this plant--\nthe only manufacturing plant, with 2,000 jobs--will be lost, and the \npulp timber will be exported out of the State, which is really a \ntravesty.\n  Now, that is the interest of the Senator from Alaska in this package. \nSo, Mr. President, I hope that clears up any doubts in the minds of \nanybody relative to the environmental aspects of the merits of this \ncontract. This is to provide a chlorine-free new mill to replace the \nold one. But it can only happen if there is a contractual commitment \nfor timber, because nobody is going to spend $200 million without an \nassured supply and a contract with the Federal Government.\n  So I am committed to moving these bills. My committee has held \nhearings on these bills and held the markups. I have supported and \nvoted for each of these bills. I am not the problem, Mr. President. But \nunless these holds are lifted, I don't see how I can be part of the \nsolution. So I urge my colleagues--particularly the leadership--to do \nwhat they can to end this gridlock. It just has to be stopped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9465-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9465-S9466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF PATENT FOR LODINE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  Mr. President, I have sent a letter to my colleagues about the \ninclusion of the extension for the patent of the drug Lodine in the \nhealth insurance conference report and announced my intention to raise \na point of order about this, since a similar provision was not included \nin either the House or the Senate bill. Whatever the intentions of \nwhoever inserted this into conference committee report in the dark of \nnight--and I don't know what their intentions were--certainly the \nimpact of\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\nthis provision on consumers will be disastrous. Moreover, granting such \nan extension in the dark of night is not the way to legislate.\n  So all of my colleagues have a letter announcing my intent to \nchallenge this provision on a point of order. I am also considering \noffering a concurrent resolution to delete this provision from the \nconference report. My hope is that we can get bipartisan support for \nthis effort, in which case, one way or the other, we can knock this \nspecial interest giveaway out of conference committee report.\n  I want to state to my colleagues that this patent extension that we \nsee before us for the manufacturer of Lodine essentially means that for \na period of 2 years, and in effect over a period of 5 years because of \nthe way the provision is written, cheaper versions of the prescription \ndrug will not be made available to consumers. People who are suffering \nfrom arthritis and are not able to buy a cheaper drug will pay millions \nof dollars that they should not have to. This is really outrageous.\n\n  When I was a college professor, I talked about conference committees, \nand I knew they were kind of the third House of the Congress, but I had \nno idea that this type of thing happened all the time, or some of the \ntime. But it should not happen any of the time.\n  What we have here is a company that sells over a quarter of a billion \ndollars worth of a drug, willing to pay the Government $10 billion a \nyear for the additional costs that the patent extension will cost the \nGovernment in increased Medicaid and health care costs, but not willing \nto do anything for consumers and seniors. And quite frankly, the \npayments to the Government are nothing compared to the ripoff of \nseniors and consumers.\n  I hope that we may be able to do something about this situation \ntogether, in a bipartisan way. I believe that Senator Kennedy, Senator \nKassebaum, and many other Senators will be interested in doing that one \nway or the other. I started talking about this yesterday when I \nrealized that, in the dark of night, this provision had been inserted, \nand one way or the other I am going to take action as a Senator from \nMinnesota to do everything I can to knock this provision out.\n  This provision represents a giveaway to a special interest at the \nexpense of patients and senior citizens, and, quite frankly, the \nmysterious manner in which it was added to the conference report late \nat night is not the way we ought to be conducting our affairs here. \nThis is a perfect example of the kind of practice that makes people \nlose confidence in our political process. Therefore, I hope all \nSenators, Republicans and Democrats alike, will join me in my effort to \nknock this provision out.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9465-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9466-S9469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FAMILY HOUR PROGRAMMING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, earlier this week, the President of the \nUnited States gathered the TV networks together to work out a much-\ntrumpeted agreement on quality TV programming for children. I certainly \napplaud the President's efforts, and I am pleased that the meeting has \nserved to at least spotlight this important issue. But the sad fact \nremains that this new and improved agreement to bring quality \nprogramming to our children is really nothing more than a ratification \nof the status quo. In fact, two of the major networks announced they \nalready met this agreement. Another said that it is just barely short \nof compliance now.\n  So, essentially, the President has come out and said he approves of \nwhat the networks are already doing about quality programming; the \nstatus quo is OK.\n  Mr. President, as the father of eight children, and now the \ngrandfather of three, let me just say that I do not approve of what the \nnetworks are doing. In fact, I find that some of what you see on \ntelevision during the so-called family hour, from 8 to 9 o'clock at \nnight, is absolutely outrageous today. I do not approve of it. I can \nsay with assurance that parents I have talked to are clearly frustrated \nwith television programming today. The last thing we want to say to the \nnetworks is, ``Just keep on doing what you are doing.''\n  Parents do not want a measure that has a lot of fanfare and no \nsubstance. They want to do something real. Personally, I would like to \nbe able to sit down after dinner with my 13-year-old daughter, Alice, \nor my 9-year-old son, Mark, or my 4-year-old daughter, Anna, and watch \na half an hour or an hour of TV without having to always be in some \nsort of high state of alert for things that might not be appropriate \nfor any one of them to see.\n  You know, Mr. President, it was not that many years ago that we did \nnot have this problem. We could all watch TV with our children between \n8 and 9 o'clock at night without having to worry about them. While \nevery show between 8 and 9 wasn't a great show, at least you could find \none show between 8 and 9 o'clock at night that was appropriate for a \nchild to watch with a parent.\n  Mr. President, I think we should take advantage of the attention that \nthe White House has focused on this issue, and I think we should use it \nto call for some measures that really would make a difference.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, has \nrecently proposed a resolution that I think would do a great deal to \naccomplish this goal. His resolution would call upon the networks, on a \nstrictly voluntary basis, to restore the idea of family hour \nprogramming.\n  That, Mr. President, would make a real difference in the lives of \nAmerica's families. I would guess that, on this issue, my experience is \nnot unique or unusual. Who among us--among all the parents in this \ncountry--has not been very worried about what their children might \nsuddenly be exposed to on TV?\n  Just a few years ago, during the family hour, you did not have to do \nthat. I am not talking about just the 1950's or the 1960's; I am \ntalking about as recently as less than a decade ago. I think many of us \nin politics do not fully realize how much and how fast TV has changed \njust in the last few years. That is why I think my colleagues will be \ninterested in seeing a comparison of the TV Guide listings for the hour \nbetween 8 and 9 o'clock as they have changed over the years.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this very interesting document be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, and I recommend \nit to the attention of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. This was put together by Dan Wewers, a young man who \ninterned in my office. He researched the TV Guides going back to 1954 \nand looked at a typical week. We take it every so many years, in 1954, \nin 1960, all the way up through July 14 through the 20th of 1996. \nPeople are not going to approve or like every program on here. They \nweren't all great shows. But the point is, I think there were very few \ntimes where you could not at least find one program between 8 and 9 \no'clock that was suitable to watch with your children.\n  Mr. President, the networks recognize, at least in principle, that \nthey have a responsibility to the public. As parents and citizens, we \nhave both the right and the duty to tell the networks what we think \nthey should do--the little changes they can make that we believe will \nmake a positive difference in the lives of our children and our \nfamilies.\n  Scheduling 1 hour of programming in the early evening that is \nappropriate for parents to watch with their children would be a very \nbig positive step, and it would be a great change from the status quo. \nThat is why I support the Lieberman initiative, and I think my \ncolleagues, if they look at the document I am submitting today, which I \nasked be printed in the Record, they will come to the same conclusion.\n  I think the President should talk to Senator Lieberman about this \nidea. It is a good idea, and it would make a real difference.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        Family Hour Programming\n\n                            (8:00-9:00 p.m.)\n\n\n                           TV GUIDE LISTINGS\n\n                     New York Metropolitan Area \\1\\\n\n                         Major Network Stations\n\n                        (CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX)\n\n       For the dates of:\n\n     \\1\\ Washington, D.C.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss for a few moments \nwhat will, hopefully, be before the Senate before too long. Also, I \nwill make some comments with respect to the antiarthritic drug, Lodine.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate will have a chance to vote \nshortly on the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, because breaking this \npolitical logjam on health care reform means that millions of Americans \nwho are stuck in jobs because they have a preexisting health problem \nwill have a new margin of health security and economic freedom.\n  This legislation is good for American families. It is good for our \nworkers and our business. What it means is that fear of losing critical \nhealth insurance coverage no longer would be a roadblock on the road to \na better job and a better life. I want to applaud the bipartisan \nefforts of the Senate conferees, particularly Senator Kennedy, Senator \nKassebaum, and Senator Breaux, who put long and hard service into this \nlegislation, and it will be an important step forward when adopted.\n  Besides guaranteeing portability of health insurance coverage, this \nlegislation contains little-noticed provisions that I think are going \nto make a great difference with respect to expanding health insurance \ncoverage. This legislation, to the bipartisan credit of those Senate \nleaders, protects State flexibility with respect to State health \ninsurance reforms. States like mine are laboratories for health care \nreform, and it is essential that we not turn out the laboratories at \nthe State level with unnecessary Federal restrictions.\n  Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy worked very closely with me so that \nthe exemption language in this legislation will allow Oregon's humane, \nrational, and far-reaching health insurance reform program to go into \neffect later this year. It would provide extensive group to individual \npolicy reform in much the same way our Federal legislation envisages, \nbut the approach that Oregon is taking is one that I think other States \nand possibly the Federal Government will want to emulate in the days \nahead.\n  Mr. President, there are features of this bill and provisions that \nwere not included that I think are unfortunate.\n  During this debate, I have expressed concern about the possibility of \nsome vulnerable Americans being left behind if medical savings accounts \nbecome widespread. Every Senator should want to oppose the \nbalkanization of medicine, where the young, the healthy, and the \nwealthy get good affordable health coverage at the expense of the \nsickest, the neediest, and the elderly. It is appropriate to test out \nthe MSA concept, however, and I do believe this conference report \noffers a reasonable compromise in the form of a limited MSA \ndemonstration project.\n  I join Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone and many of my \ncolleagues in mourning the loss of mental health parity in this \nlegislation. Parity, in my view, is not just fair, it is good health \ncare policy that saves health care dollars in the long run by assuring \nquality mental health coverage and particularly early intervention. I \ndo not intend to vote against a good, bipartisan bill because of the \nloss of one provision, but I intend to join with colleagues of both \nparties to make sure that mental health parity is an issue revisited \nearly in the next Congress.\n  Finally, as happens often in large conference reports, a few stray \ncats and dogs find some homes. This bill is no exception. I am going to \ntalk for a moment about a mongrel in this bill that seems to have a \npretty bad case of fleas. There is a provision in this legislation that \nwould give the antiarthritic prescription drug Lodine a 2-year patent \nextension. Supporters of this idea first tried to maneuver it into the \n1997 agriculture appropriations bill in the House. It is now in this \nlegislation, page 76, subtitle H.\n  This is a bad idea, in my view, and it certainly should not be a part \nof an important bipartisan health reform bill. Lodine has already \nreceived one extension under the terms of the 1984 Hatch-Waxman \namendments allowing for additional patent life on drugs which become \ninvolved in long regulatory approval delays. With that extension, the \ndrug's manufacturers have built sales of $274 million. Many of these \npurchasers are seniors. Many of those who buy this anti-inflammatory \ndrug are older people, walking on an economic tightrope, balancing \ntheir food costs against their fuel costs, their fuel costs against \ntheir medical bills, and they are paying for this drug, many of them, \nout of their pocket.\n  Mr. President, if Lodine's current extension is allowed to run out in \n1997, this drug likely would get a generic competitor, and those \nconsumers, those vulnerable older people would get a price break as a \nresult of the competition. They are not going to get that break with \nthis extension. I think it is unwise for the Senate to take more money \nout of the pockets of older people in this fashion. There have not been \nany congressional hearings, have not been any deliberations to look at \nany public purpose served by another 2-year extension of the Lodine \npatent. I think granting this extension creates a poor precedent. I am \nsorry to see this provision in this bill. It is a good bill, a \nbipartisan bill that needs to be enacted, but it is wrong to have this \nspecial-interest provision in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9469-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9469-S9471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MISSOURI WATER RAID OF 1996\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the past 2 years, the House of \nRepresentatives has made some good decisions, but I must say they have \nalso made some rather questionable ones that is, from the two \nGovernment shutdowns not too long ago to the attempted cuts in school \nlunches, Medicare, and college loans. I think it has left a lot of us \nnot only in the Senate but across the country shaking our heads. But \nthe great water raid they pulled off under\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\nSpeaker Gingrich's leadership last Tuesday may be the worst decision \nyet.\n  Let me sum up the water raid very simply. The House, operating under \na procedure that allowed no vote in the Chamber, passed a water \nresources development bill that takes 30 days' worth of water out of \nMontana, out of Wyoming and the Dakotas and sends it downstream.\n  This was done to give bargeowners downstream 1 month's worth of extra \nnavigation, bypassing the Army Corps of Engineers, putting scientific \nand environmental analysis in the trash basket, and ignoring basic \neconomics.\n  For many years--in fact, ever since Fort Peck Dam went up 60 years \nago--the Army Corps of Engineers has discriminated in favor of \ndownstream navigation and against the far more economically valuable \nrecreation and tourism industry upstream. They have done it by draining \nwater out of the Upper Basin States, leaving farmers and dockowners \nhigh and dry.\n  Only in the last 3 years has the Army Corps of Engineers finally \nbegun to make decisions on sound science and good economics rather than \nspecial interest pleading. They have limited the navigation season and \nallowed higher pool levels in our upper reservoirs, and that is good. I \nhasten to say that the system is still grossly biased against our part \nof the country. I think the corps need to do better, but we have made \nsome progress.\n  That was up until last Tuesday, when the House decided to take an \nextreme step backward and steal 1 month's worth of water from us. That \nis the water we drink. It is the water farmers use to grow their crops. \nIt is the water ranchers need for their stock. It is the water \nfamilies, tourists, and sportsmen use for fishing, swimming, and \nrafting. It is our water. And the House has used a rigged procedure--\nwhat my colleague, Pat Williams, called a midnight slam dunk--to take \nit away.\n  This great water raid, I might hasten to add, is not a done deal--far \nfrom it. The Senate, acting with considerably more fairness, much more \nclear thinking, did nothing of the kind. In the overall bill that is \nnow headed to the conference committee, we will iron out the \ndifferences between the good bill we passed here--and to use a \ncharitable term--flawed bill passed in the House.\n  There is a good chance that the conference committee will strip out \nthis water raid provision. As ranking member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and a member of the conference, I will do all I \ncan to assure that we take it out. And I, certainly, will strenuously \noppose any conference agreement that contains the water raid.\n  But I must tell my colleagues that if worse comes to worst, I want to \nput all of them on notice that there could well be a full discussion of \nall the ramifications of the Missouri River issue. It is very \ncomplicated. It requires a lot of background and a lot of study.\n  So to prepare the Senate fully, I may read aloud the entire Army \nCorps' ``Master Water Control Manual.'' This was published in July \n1994, and it gives the corps present view of the optimal way to manage \nthe Missouri River.\n  This manual, even in its present form, is inadequate and unfair to \nthe Upper Basin States--that is, Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, and \nSouth Dakota. But it is a crucial document if one hopes to first \nunderstand the genesis and present state of the Missouri River debate \nand, second, to grasp what management changes we need. That is why I \nwill most likely read the entire manual to the Senate.\n  Now, for the curious who may be listening in on this little \ndiscussion, I must say that the manual comes in nine parts. I will just \nread off the entire front cover to let Senators know what the manual \ncontains and to give them a little preview.\n  Volume 1: ``Alternatives Evaluation Report.''\n  Volume 2: ``Reservoir Regulation Studies: Long-Range Study Manual.''\n  Volume 3A: ``Low-Flow Studies: Gavins Point Dam to St. Louis, \nMissouri.''\n  Volume 3B: ``Low-Flow Studies: Gavins Point Dam to St. Louis, \nMissouri,'' including Appendix A on ``Ice Impacts'' and Appendix B on \n``Water Quality Impacts.''\n  Volume 4: ``Hydraulic Studies: Upstream from Gavins Point Dam.''\n  Volume 5: ``Aggradation, Degradation and Water Quality Conditions.''\n  Volume 6A: ``Economic Studies: Navigation Economics.''\n  Volume 6B: ``Economic Studies: Water Supply Economics.''\n  Volume 6C: ``Economic Studies: Recreation Economics.''\n  Volume 6D: ``Economic Studies: Hydropower Economics, Flood Control \nEconomics, and Mississippi River Economics.''\n  Volume 6E: ``Economic Studies: Regional Economics.''\n  Volume 7A: ``Environmental Studies: Reservoir Fisheries,'' including \nthe main report along with Appendix A, ``Description of Resource,'' and \nAppendix B, ``Reservoir Fish, Reproduction Impact Methodology.''\n  Volume 7B: ``Environmental Studies: Reservoir Fisheries,'' including \nAppendix C, ``Coldwater Habitat Model.''\n  Volume 7C: ``Environmental Studies: Riverine Fisheries,'' including \nthe main report, and Appendix A, ``Description of Resource.''\n  Volume 7D: ``Environmental Studies: Riverine Fisheries,'' including \nAppendix B, ``Physical Habitat Analysis Upstream of Sioux City,'' and \nAppendix C, ``Physical Habitat Analysis Downstream of Sioux City.''\n  Volume 7E: ``Environmental Studies: Riverine Fisheries,'' Appendix D, \n``Assessing Temperature Effects on Habitat.''\n  Volume 7F: ``Environmental Studies: Wetland and Riparian,'' including \nthe main report along with Appendix A, ``Field and Mapping Methods,'' \nand Appendix B, ``Plant and Wildlife Species List.''\n  Volume 7G: ``Environmental Studies: Wetland and Riparian,'' including \nAppendix C, ``Fate of Wetland/Riparian Types,'' Appendix D, \n``Diversity,'' Appendix E, ``Backwater Analysis,'' and Appendix F, \n``Value Function Testing.''\n  Volume 7H: ``Environmental Studies: Least Tern and Piping Plover, \nHistoric Properties, and Mississippi River Environment.''\n  Volume 8: ``Economic Impacts Model and Environmental Impacts Model.''\n  And Volume 9: ``Socioeconomic Studies.''\n  I know my colleagues must be wondering. They must be wondering, \n``That is an awful lot of volumes. If the water raid boils down to \nnavigation and taking water from recreation uses, why doesn't the \nSenator from Montana just read Volume 6A and 6C on recreation and \nnavigation?''\n  Well, I might say that is the reasonable question. But I believe the \nwater raid issue is so important--it is such a basic, fundamental \nquestion of fairness and justice--that each Senator probably deserves \nthe chance to hear the issue in its full context and have the benefits \nof the entire context of this issue.\n  So I decided it probably would be more fair and probably more prudent \nto read the entire manual than it would be, in essence, to cheat \nSenators by skipping straight to Volumes 6A and 6C and calling it a \nday.\n  I might say I have with me just two of the volumes, 6A and 6C. These \nare the ones that go straight to the heart of matter. They are just two \nof the total of nine volumes. As I said, I do not want to be unfair to \nmy colleagues. So I feel that they should have the benefit of the \nentire reading of the entire list of all of the volumes.\n  Altogether, the manual runs to 21 bound volumes. If we add all of \nappendices, it comes down to 21, several thousand pages. And having \nfinished the manual, I will then move on to the point of discussing the \nerrors that I believe are contained in the master manual.\n  I might tell Senators that this probably would take some time. But \nthe conference will be done in September. And if it contains the water \nraid clause, I will have no alternative. I will be down here each and \nevery day so they can have the benefit of the entire context of all the \nvolumes so they can make a good decision on this issue. And I am pretty \nconfident. I think I can get most of the standards in by September. I \nmay need a couple of weeks in October to get Senators fully informed. \nBut it is, I think, important that we have that.\n  So I might say, Mr. President, in concluding, I thank my colleagues \nfor allowing additional time. It is my fervent hope and strong \nintention that the water raid provision will be out before the \nconference ends, so that it will be in the Senate here and not taking\n\n[[Page S9471]]\n\nall of this time to learn the full issue, the ins and outs of it all. I \ndo not look forward to reading it in its entirety, but I am taking this \nstep, Mr. President, because it is very simple. This provision was put \nin totally unfairly, it is totally wrong, and in a procedure that is \ntotally out of the question.\n  I might remind Senators that water is our lifeblood in Montana. It \ndoes not rain very much west of the 100th meridian. We very much want \nto stand up for what we think is right. I want Senators to know this \nissue may come up. I thank my colleagues.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator speaking for \n20 minutes?

Mr. President, just a month ago we had a discussion \nhere on the Senate floor about the issue of campaign finance reform. I \nthink a lot of us worked hard on the effort. We have taken a bit of a \nbreather for the last month and assessed the situation, and we are \nready to consider resuming the fight for this very important issue. \nAlthough the debate was abbreviated, it was a pretty good debate. We \ncertainly did not suffer from any shortage of speakers offering their \nideas on how we could best reform our campaign finance laws. In the \nend, I was pleased the bipartisan reform bill offered by myself and the \nsenior Senator from Arizona was able to receive the support of the \nmajority of this body, actually a bipartisan vote, obtaining 54 votes. \nSo I feel very strongly, although we did not complete the task, we are \nwell on our way.\n  And even though we fell 6 votes short necessary to ward off a well-\nstaged filibuster, I think it is clear that there is a bipartisan \nmajority in favor of acting on campaign reform, and many of us intend \nto press forward on this issue in the coming months and into the 105th \nCongress.\n  The vast, vast majority of the American people want the Congress to \nact on campaign finance reform and we cannot allow a small minority of \nSenators to thwart the will of the American people and wage a stealth \nattempt to sweep this issue under the rug.\n  Interestingly, less than 24 hours after the Senate voted against \nfurther debating the issue of campaign finance reform, the Supreme \nCourt handed down a much anticipated decision that will undoubtedly \naffect the Federal election landscape.\n  The case was Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus \nFederal Election Committee. It arose out of a 1986 incident in \nColorado, in which the Colorado State Republican Party made some \n$15,000 worth of expenditures on radio advertisements attacking the \nlikely Democratic candidate for a Senate seat.\n  The FEC had charged that this expenditure had violated the Federal \nlimits on so-called coordinated expenditures and the tenth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals agreed with the FEC's assessment.\n  The Federal coordinated expenditure limit is the amount of money the \nnational and State parties are permitted to spend on express advocacy \nexpenditures for the purpose of influencing a Federal election. The \ncoordinated expenditure limit is based on the size of each State.\n  It is important to understand what the litigants were arguing before \nthe Court, because many people have tried to interpret this decision as \nsomething other than what it is.\n  The Colorado Republican Party, joined by the Republican National \nCommittee, argued that the Federal limits on coordinated expenditures \nwere unconstitutional on their face and an infringement on the First \nAmendment rights of the political parties to participate in the Federal \nelection process.\n  In other words, these parties wanted the Federal spending limits on \ncoordinated expenditures tossed out completely, not just the narrow \nruling that was handed down.\n  The FEC, on the other hand, argued that the Federal spending limits \nhelped prevent both actual corruption and the appearance of corruption.\n  In short, the FEC argued that these spending limits were necessary \nand valid for the same reasons that the Supreme Court found Federal \ncontribution limits constitutional and necessary in the Buckley \ndecision some 20 years ago.\n  Who won, Mr. President? Really, no one won. The Court, in a 7 to 2 \ndecision, found that this particular case out in Colorado was a unique \nsituation. At the time the expenditures in question were made, there \nwas neither a Democratic nor Republican nominee for the open Senate \nseat. Moreover, the expenditures were made some 6 months before the \ndate of the general election.\n  And finally, and perhaps most importantly in the Court's eyes, there \nwas no demonstrable evidence that there was any coordination between \nthe Colorado State party and any of the Republican candidates vying for \nthat party's nomination.\n  That is the key.\n  That, Mr. President, is what these Federal limits on coordinated \nexpenditures are supposed to be about. The word ``coordinated'' implies \nthat there is some sort of cooperation between the party and the \ncandidate in making the expenditure, and in this particular case the \nCourt found that there had been virtually no coordination whatsoever.\n  The lack of any coordination led the Court to decide that this was an \nexpress advocacy, independent expenditure, much like the independent \nexpenditures we see so often made by organizations such as the National \nRifle Association, the National Right to Life Committee, and the AFL-\nCIO.\n  In the landmark Buckley decision and subsequent decisions such as the \n1986 decision in FEC versus Massachusetts Right to Life, the Supreme \nCourt has ruled that the Government cannot limit independent \nexpenditures which the Court found to be pure expressions of political \nspeech protected by the first amendment.\n  These rulings are the basis for the absence of Federal limits on \nindependent expenditures made by individuals, organizations, and \npolitical action committees.\n  The key determination in the Colorado decision was that the Court \nfound that this particular expenditure was an independent expenditure, \nand an independent expenditure made by a political party is entitled to \nthe same constitutional protections as an independent expenditure made \nby anyone else. In short, political parties may make unlimited \nindependent expenditures in Federal elections in the same manner other \norganizations are free to make such expenditures.\n  In addition, the Supreme Court, unfortunately, did leave certain key \nquestions unanswered. For example, the Court found the Colorado \nexpenditure to be an independent expenditure largely because it was 6 \nmonths before the general election and there was no Democratic nominee \nand no Republican nominee, to make an express, coordinated attack on.\n  What would happen if the same expenditure was made 1 month before \nelection day, when both the Democratic and Republican nominees had been \nchosen?\n  The Court did not address this question.\n  Instead, the Court elected to issue an extremely narrow ruling by \nfocusing on the peculiar circumstances relevant in the Colorado \ndecision.\n  The Court simply ruled that an expenditure made without coordination, \nmade far in advance of an election and before there are any nominees of \neither party must be treated as an independent expenditure and is \ntherefore not subject to limit.\n  Mr. President, for the 80 percent of the American people who want us \nto reduce the role of money in congressional elections, this is not the \nbest news.\n  What it means is that the parties are free to independently pour \nmillions and millions of dollars into each State months and months \nbefore the voters are to go the polls. It will open the door to more \nexpensive campaigns, longer campaigns and if current trends continue, \nincreasingly negative campaigns.\n  It can mean a proliferation in everything that repulses Americans \nabout our campaign finance system.\n  That is bad news Mr. President. But it must be understood and the \nreason I\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\nam speaking today, so that this is clarified, this decision could have \nbeen far worse.\n  The Colorado Republican Party had advocated that the Court strike \ndown the actual Federal limits on coordinated expenditures, and in \nfact, many of the so-called legal experts had predicted that this \nconservative court would do just that. But they did not.\n  But the Supreme Court specifically refused to strike down these \nlimits. The Court ruled that this issue needed to be addressed further \nby the lower courts before the high court could adequately issue a \ndetermination of whether such limits are constitutional.\n  That, Mr. President, is why this was such a narrow ruling. It only \naffects a certain type of expenditure made by a political party. The \nFederal limits on coordinated expenditures were left in place and are \nstill a part of the current election system.\n  Some have suggested that this decision will allow the parties to play \na greater role in the election process. I agree. The question is, in \nthe end, will this have a positive or negative effect on our political \nsystem.\n  I think it could go either way. For example, the parties may decide \nto use this decision to run negative television ads against a \nparticular candidate 8 months before election day.\n  I do not think that is a positive contribution to the process, and in \nfact, I think it is exactly the type of activity that has turned the \nAmerican people against our current political system. I am hopeful, Mr. \nPresident, that the American people will reject those kinds of tactics, \nif they are, in fact, used by the parties.\n  On the other hand, on a brighter note, there is a possibility that \nthis decision could have a positive impact on the system. If, for \nexample, a challenger is severely underfunded and is facing an \nincumbent with a colossal war chest, expenditures made by the parties \ncould aid the challenger in running a competitive race.\n  But I do not think this is the best approach to the very real problem \nof an uneven electoral playing field.\n  Why shouldn't we instead empower the challenger to make such \nreasonable expenditures in this situation in his or her own favor? Why \nnot, in this particular situation, allow the candidate, rather than the \nparty, to play a somewhat greater role in the election process?\n  That is precisely the approach advocated by the senior Senator from \nArizona and myself and many others and was embodied in the bipartisan \nlegislation we offered just a couple of weeks ago. Our proposal created \na mechanism that offered candidates who agreed to a reasonable set of \nlimits on their campaign spending the tools to run an effective, \ncredible, and competitive campaign for the U.S. Senate.\n  I want to make something very clear, Mr. President. The effect of the \nColorado decision on the McCain-Feingold legislation, or any \nlegislation like that legislation, is, at best, nominal. I realize that \nmany have tried to say just the opposite, somehow suggesting that the \nColorado decision contradicts everything in the McCain-Feingold bill or \nother reform bills. Mr. President, that is not true. It is wishful \nthinking on the part of those very same people who have done everything \nthey can to kill campaign finance reform.\n  The Colorado decision has nothing to do with any of the key \ncomponents of our proposal, whether it is the voluntary spending \nlimits, the broadcast and postage discounts, the PAC restrictions, \nbundling restrictions, franking reforms or any other provision. None of \nthese are affected by the Colorado decision.\n  Some have said that the spending limits in our bill will prevent a \ncomplying candidate from responding to an attack made by these new \nparty-independent expenditures.\n  There is concern expressed that a candidate who has agreed to abide \nby the voluntary spending limits who is then hit with $100,000 worth of \ntelevision ads bought by the national party will be unable to respond \neffectively. That is a fair concern to raise. But, Mr. President, the \nanswer is the same as it was when we debated the proposal 2 weeks ago.\n  There is a provision in our bill that provides that if any complying \ncandidate is the target of an independent expenditure, that candidate's \nspending limits are raised in proportion to the amount of independent \nexpenditures made against them. So candidates would not be restrained \nfrom reasonably responding to an independent expenditure by the \nvoluntary spending limits that they have agreed to. It is really that \nsimple.\n  So, Mr. President, I am confident that this legislation will be \ndebated again, if not this year, then early in the 105th Congress. It \ndoesn't matter whether the Senate is under Republican or Democrat \ncontrol next year, but the American people will surely reject what I \nlike to call the two escape hatches of campaign finance reform, in \naddition to saying the Supreme Court has foreclosed the matter.\n  The first escape hatch, which will allow the Congress to talk the \ntalk without walking the walk, is to create yet another commission to \nstudy this problem. I say ``another'' because it has already been done \na few years ago. Commissions are meritorious when a relatively new \nissue needs to be studied, but that is not the situation when it comes \nto campaign finance reform. In fact, this issue has been the subject of \nmore congressional hearings and testimony than the vast majority of the \nissues debated on the Senate floor.\n  Clearly, at a time when so much is known about the issue and when so \nmany creative ideas have been offered, establishing another commission \nto study the problem is unwarranted and nothing more than a dodge.\n\n  The other escape hatch, which has turned into the escape hatch for \nseemingly every other issue that the Senate has debated in the 104th \nCongress, is to call again for yet another constitutional amendment. \nThis particular constitutional amendment would allow Congress to set \nmandatory spending limits on campaign expenditures.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that the people who are supporting \nthis concept are sincere. At one brief moment, I supported such a \nconstitutional amendment before I realized that the 103d Congress will \nbe followed by a 104th Congress that seems to be trying to turn the \nConstitution into a billboard for every imaginable campaign slogan.\n  Let's be honest here. A constitutional amendment requiring 67 votes \nis not going to pass before the turn of the century and, frankly, I \ndon't think would pass by the turn of the next century. We could not \neven get 60 votes for a modest bipartisan and bicameral bill that had \nan unprecedented level of public support.\n  Moreover, even if such a proposal were to somehow miraculously \nreceive 67 votes in the Senate and 291 votes in the House of \nRepresentatives, then it has to be ratified by three-fourths of the \nStates.\n  So I think it is clear that anyone who suggests that a constitutional \namendment is the solution to our campaign finance problems must also \nadmit that sort of solution is years and years and years away from \nrealistically coming into play.\n  We just cannot put off a decision any longer, Mr. President. No \ngames, no side shows. The American people are tired of campaigns in \nwhich issues and ideas have become secondary to dollars and cents. They \nview our electoral system not as part of the American dream, but just \nanother chapter in the ``lifestyles of the rich and famous.''\n  The voters have become inherently mistrustful of any individual \nelected to public office because they know that individual is now part \nof the Washington money chase, where their principal goal as an elected \nofficial sometimes looks like not representing their communities but, \ninstead, raising the requisite millions of dollars for their reelection \nefforts.\n  Those are the trademarks of a dysfunctional campaign finance system \nthat is crying out for meaningful bipartisan reform. I remain \noptimistic that early next year, this Senate can come together on a \nbipartisan basis and pass the sort of comprehensive reforms that the \nAmerican people have been demanding for so many years.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know we all have been saddened in recent \ndays by reports of rioting and violence in Indonesia. Last weekend, the \ngovernment cracked down on a political opposition group in Jakarta. \nSupporters of that group took to the street in protest and as a result, \nseveral people have been killed and over 200 arrested. The crackdown \nhas reportedly been widened to include other known political activists \nincluding Muchtar Pakpahan, the head of the Indonesian Labor Welfare \nUnion.\n  We also read this week that the military commander in Jakarta ordered \nhis troops to ``shoot on the spot'' any protestors who are seen to be \nthreatening the peace, a particularly disturbing development. I would \nurge the government in Jakarta to seek to negotiate and to work with \nthe opposition forces in a peaceful manner, rather than calling on the \nmilitary to quell any protests. This is the same approach I suggest in \nthe report of my visit to Indonesia 2 months ago.\n  The root of the current problems is, I believe, the lack of an open \npolitical system in Indonesia. Two token legal opposition parties are \nallowed to exist, but they have little influence over policy. They \ncannot seriously challenge the ruling Golkar party. The current \npolitical and electoral systems are designed such that Golkar is \nassured of retaining power. But in the most recent parliamentary \nelections in 1992, Golkar unexpectedly lost a percentage of the \nparliamentary seats. Hoping for a trend, the two opposition parties \nwere beginning to talk of making greater gains in the parliamentary \nelections scheduled for next year, although observers never thought \neither was likely to take the majority. This talk upset the government. \nEven though retaining ultimate political control was never in question, \nthe government has reacted to even a slight loss in that control by \ncalling on the military.\n  The government is centering its efforts on the Indonesian Democracy \nParty--or PDI--led by Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of \nIndonesia's first president, Sukarno. Megawati had begun a very visible \ncampaign in preparation for the parliamentary elections next year and \nindicated that she might challenge President Suharto in the \npresidential elections in 1998, a first for Suharto who has always been \nunopposed. In what appears to be a nervous reaction, the government \nallegedly orchestrated a coup within the PDI to force Megawati out of \nher leadership position. Her supporters took over the PDI headquarters \nand refused to leave until the military took over the headquarters this \npast weekend.\n  President Suharto has done much that is good for his country. \nIndonesia's population control program, for example, is a model for the \ndeveloping world. The country's economic development has been admirable \nand many U.S. companies benefit from their investments throughout the \narchipelago. But as the country has grown and developed economically, \nit comes as no surprise that certain elements of Indonesian society now \nwant their country to grow and develop politically as well. The \ngovernment's current approach to the threat of a serious political \nchallenge--to arrange for Megawati's overthrow within her party, blame \nthe riots on virtually extinct communist sympathizers, and threaten to \nshoot any protestors--I believe will both hamper Indonesia's continued \neconomic development and cause great harm to our bilateral \nrelationship. Internally, the Indonesian currency and stock market are \nbeginning to fall.\n  For several months now the U.S. Government has considered selling F-\n16s to the Indonesian military. In light of the events in Jakarta, I \nurge the administration to rethink the wisdom of this sale. My own view \nis that we should not rush forward with a high-technology, glamorous \nweapon sale to a foreign military that is threatening to shoot peaceful \nprotestors in the street. I am encouraged, Mr. President, by some signs \nthat the administration is considering holding off on this sale.\n  Indonesia is poised to be one of the region's most important and \ninfluential countries. President Suharto has the chance now to \naccelerate that process by allowing for Indonesia's transition to \nmodern political governance. He could follow the model of Taiwan, which \ntransformed itself from a single-party, authoritarian regime to a \nthriving multi-party democracy without violence. Indonesia is more than \nready to allow full-fledged, active opposition voices to publicly make \ntheir case to the people. I would urge the Indonesian Government to \ncall back its military, deal peacefully with the opposition, and show \nthe world it is indisputably ready for the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9473-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9473-S9475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RATIFICATION OF THE LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION IS AN URGENT NECESSITY\n\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, the United States will shortly become one of \nthe first and perhaps the first Nation to ratify the Straddling Fish \nStocks Agreement. This agreement was approved by the Senate on June 27. \nI am very pleased that prompt Senate action on the Agreement enabled \nthe United States to continue its leadership on international fisheries \nissues. The agreement will significantly advance our efforts to improve \nfisheries management. In effect, it endorses the U.S. approach to \nfisheries management and reflects the acceptance by other nations of \nthe need to manage fisheries in a precautionary and sustainable manner.\n  That being said, Mr. President, in advising and consenting to \nratification of the Straddling Stocks Agreement, the Senate's work is \nonly partially done. Having approved the Straddling Stocks Agreement, \nthe next logical step for this body is to consider and pass the treaty \nwhich provides the foundation for the agreement, namely the United \nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. My purpose today is to \nhighlight the connections between the two and to underscore the many \nbenefits that will accrue to the United States if the Senate grants its \nadvice and consent to ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention, a \nstep that should have been taken long since, and I hope will come about \nshortly.\n  Prima facia evidence for the tight linkage between the Law of the Sea \nConvention and Straddling Stocks Agreement is found in the latter's \ntitle, the ``Agreement for the Implementation of the United Nations \nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 Relating to Fish \nStocks.'' Clearly, the Agreement was negotiated on the foundation \nestablished in the Law of the Sea Convention. The connection between \nthe two is made explicit in Article 4 of the agreement which stipulates \nthat the agreement ``shall be interpreted and applied in the context of \nand in a manner consistent with the Convention.'' Further, Part VIII of \nthe agreement provides that disputes arising under the agreement be \nsettled through the convention's dispute settlement provisions. Indeed, \nthe Law of the Sea Convention establishes a framework to govern the use \nof the world's oceans that reflects almost entirely U.S. views on ocean \npolicy.\n  Can the United States become a party to the agreement, but remain \noutside the Law of the Sea Convention? The answer is yes. The more \nimportant question is: Does this best serve U.S. interests? The answer \nto that question is no. Only by becoming a party to the Law of the Sea \nConvention can the United States maximize its potential gain from the \nagreement and protect its fisheries interests.\n  One way to do this is to ensure that U.S. views on fisheries \nmanagement are represented on the Law the Sea Tribunal. That is the \nbody which settles disputes arising under the agreement, and it is \nestablished in the Law of the Sea Convention. Not surprisingly, in \norder to nominate a judge to the tribunal, the United States must \nbecome a party to the Law of the Sea Convention.\n\n  A second way to ensure that U.S. gains are maximized is to ensure \nthat our country's views on fisheries management are well represented \nin the convention processes themselves. To do this, we must be a party \nto the convention. The Straddling Stocks Agreement's provisions are to \nbe applied in light of the convention. As the convention itself is an \nevolving, living document, the United States must be part of the \ndialogue that will affect not only the Straddling Stocks Agreement, but \nother oceans management policy.\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\n  Mr. President, there are sound reasons for the United States to \nbecome a party to the Law of the Sea Convention in order to enhance the \nbenefits of the Straddling Stocks Agreement. There are, however, \nreasons to become a party to the Law of the Sea Convention far beyond \nthe connection with the Straddling Stocks Agreement.\n  Indeed, I have always held the view that the strength of the Law of \nthe Sea Convention lies in the multiplicity of interests that it \nprotects and enhances for the United States. It is precisely because \nthe convention addresses our Nation's broad range of interests so \ncomprehensively that the United States has so much to gain by becoming \na party. Indeed, I believe there is no action that the Senate can take \nbefore the end of this session that would have greater long term \nbenefits for the world as a whole than to ratify the Law of the Sea \nConvention.\n  The implications for world peace are enormous; the potential for \ntrade and development is equally far-reaching. I hope this will not be \ncaught up in a spate of politics as usual, but will be seen in the \nframework of a renewed commitment to bipartisanship in foreign policy.\n  The old saying was that ``politics stops at the water's edge.'' That \nwould be an apt motto for our consideration of Law of the Sea, since \nits scope begins precisely at the water's edge.\n  Perhaps more than any other nation, the United States has a broad \nrange of interests in the oceans and their uses. We are the world's \npredominant sea power. The United States Navy operates on a global \nscale and has vital interests in seeing the convention's provisions on \nfreedom of navigation implemented. The Air Force too shares many of \nthese interests. We are also a maritime nation, Mr. President. Fully 95 \npercent of U.S. export and import trade tonnage moves by sea, with \ndirect repercussions for American workers' jobs. The United States is \nalso a coastal nation--we have one of the longest coastlines in the \nworld--with strong interests in the sound use of resources on our \ncontinental shelf.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is useful to remind my colleagues that, \nmore than 20 years ago, the United States was a driving force in \ninitiating the negotiations that produced the Law of the Sea \nConvention. At that time, the Navy in particular was concerned about \nother nations' ever increasing maritime jurisdictional claims. To \naddress this problem, the Department of Defense sought a treaty that \nwould set out as a matter of international law a regime to govern such \nclaims. Given this history, it is more than a little ironic that the \nUnited States ultimately led efforts to block adoption of the \nconvention upon conclusion of negotiations in 1982.\n  In my view, while the convention's critics raised some legitimate \nconcerns regarding provisions related to deep seabed mining, they \nallowed these concerns to blind them to the overriding benefits the \nconvention would confer on the United States. Moreover, all of these \nconcerns have now been addressed in the recently negotiated agreement \non deep seabed mining. I would like to recount those benefits for my \ncolleagues' information.\n  First and foremost, the convention enhances U.S. national security. \nRemember, Mr. President, that this was the original driving force \nbehind U.S. participation in the convention. The convention \nestablishes, as a matter of international law, freedom of navigation \nrights that are critical to our military forces. In testimony before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, Admiral Center stated,\n\n       The Convention strongly underpins the worldwide mobility \n     America's forces need. It provides a more stable legal basis \n     for governing the world's oceans. It reduces the need to fall \n     back on potentially volatile mixture of customary practice \n     and gunboat diplomacy.\n\n  The need to protect freedom of navigation is not merely a theoretical \nissue. There have been recent situations where even U.S. allies denied \nour Armed Forces transit rights in times of need. Such an instance was \nthe 1973 Yom Kippur war when our ability to resupply Israel was \ncritically dependent on transit rights through the Strait of Gibraltar. \nAgain in 1986, U.S. aircraft passed through the Strait to strike Libyan \ntargets in response to that government's acts of terrorism directed \nagainst the United States, after some of our allies had denied us the \nright to transit through their airspace.\n  I have heard arguments that the convention's provisions on freedom of \nnavigation are not really important because they reflect customary \ninternational law. I disagree. Customary international law is \ninherently unstable. Governments can be less scrupulous about flouting \nthe precedents of customary law than they would be if such actions were \nseen as violating a treaty.\n  Moreover, not all governments and scholars agree that all of the \ncritical navigation rights which are protected by the convention are \nalso protected by customary law. They regard many of those rights as \ncontractual; that is, only available to parties to the convention. For \nexample, it was not long ago that our country claimed a territorial sea \nof only 3 miles. This zone now extends to 12 miles, as allowed by the \nconvention. But other countries have claimed territorial sea zones that \nextend to 200 miles, in direct violation of the convention. Currently, \nthe United States routinely challenge such excessive jurisdictional \nclaims through the Freedom of Navigation Program.\n  I do not doubt that, if necessary, the U.S. Navy will sail where it \nneeds to to protect U.S. interests. But, if we reject the convention, \npreservation of these rights in nonwartime situations will carry an \nincreasingly heavy price for the United States. By remaining outside of \nthe convention, the United States will have to challenge excessive \njurisdictional claims of states not only diplomatically, but also \nthrough conduct that opposes these claims. Each time we conduct an \noperation in contested waters we are sending our young men and women \ninto harms way. Mr. President, we don't need to do that. A widely \nratified convention would significantly reduce the need for such \noperations. A widely ratified convention would also afford us a strong \nand durable platform of principle to ensure support from the American \npeople and our allies when we have no choice but to confront claims we \nregard as illegal.\n  Now I would like to turn to the issue of the Law of the Sea \nConvention and U.S. economic interests. The convention promotes these \ninterests in a number of ways. It provides the U.S. with exclusive \nrights over marine living resources within our 200 miles exclusive \neconomic zone; exclusive rights over mineral, oil, and gas resources \nover a wide continental shelf that is recognized internationally; the \nright for our communications industry to place its cables on the sea \nfloor and the continental shelves of other countries without cost; a \nmuch greater certainty with regard to marine scientific research, and a \nground breaking regime for the protection of the marine environment.\n  Mr. President, seaborne commerce represents 80 percent of trade among \nnations and is a lifeline for U.S. imports and exports. As I noted \nearlier, 95 percent of U.S. export and import trade tonnage moves by \nsea. With continuing economic liberalization occurring globally, \nexports are likely to continue to grow as a percentage of our economic \noutput. In addition, in some sectors, such as oil, our dependence on \nimports will continue to grow. Thus our economic well being--economic \ngrowth and jobs--will increasingly depend on foreign trade. Without the \nstability and uniformity in rules provided by the convention, we would \nsee an increase in the cost of transport and a corresponding reduction \nof the economic benefits currently realized from an increasingly large \npart of our economy.\n\n  Consequently, the United States would stand to lose a great deal if \nit was no longer assured of the freedom of navigation: trade would be \nimpaired, ports communities would be impacted and our whole maritime \nindustry could be put in jeopardy. The convention addressees the \nconcerns and failure of the United States to ratify would impose a \ntremendous burden on this industry.\n  Within its EEZ, the United States has exclusive rights over its \nliving marine resources. Foreign fleets fishing in our waters can be \ncontrolled or even excluded, and our regional management councils are \nin a position to adopt the best management plans available for each of \nthe fisheries on which our industries depend. The settlement of \ndisputes provisions of the convention do not apply to the measures \ntaken by the coastal State within its EEZ. Consequently, the United\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nStates has discretionary powers for determining the total allowable \ncatch, its harvesting capacity, the allocation of surpluses to other \nStates and the terms and conditions established in its conservation and \nmanagement measures.\n  Indeed, the Law of the Sea Convention will play a paramount role in \nthe implementation of the important international agreements to which \nthe United States is already a party. These include: the 1992 \nConvention for the Conservation of Anadromous Stocks in the North \nPacific Ocean, approved by the Senate on August 11, 1992; the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly Resolution on Large-Scale High Seas Driftnet Fishing, \napproved by the Senate on November 26, 1991; the Convention on the \nConservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering \nSea, approved by the Senate on October 6, 1994; and the FAO Agreement \nto Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management \nMeasures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, approved by the Senate on \nOctober 6, 1994.\n  In approving these treaties, the Senate spoke to the importance of \nthese issues to our Nation; however, the long-term benefits of these \nfishery agreements will only be realized and mutual enforcement ensured \nif the underlying principles of the Law of the Sea Convention--the new \nconstitution of the oceans--are ratified by the United States.\n  Mr. President, in 1982, the Reagan administration was prepared to \nsign the convention on behalf of the United States, but for part XI. \nPart XI dealt with deep seabed mining and contained a number of \nprovisions that the United States found objectionable. Unfortunately, \nat the time, the administration was not able to secure the changes it \nsought in time for the United States to sign the convention. As a \nresult, neither the United States nor the other industrialized \ncountries signed the convention.\n\n  During the Bush administration, with the prospect that the convention \nwould actually enter into force, informal consultations were begun at \nthe United Nations with the aim of resolving concerns with part XI. \nThat goal was achieved in an agreement that, in effect, amends part XI \nof the convention in a manner that meets all of the concerns first \narticulated under President Reagan and carried forward through to the \nClinton Administration. The modification of part XI is a bipartisan \nforeign policy success and is the culmination of three decades of U.S. \noceans policy efforts.\n  I feel qualified to say this Mr. President, since I have closely \nfollowed the Law of the Sea negotiations from their early days to the \npresent. The initial support for this idea was put forth by Arvid \nPardo, Malta's delegate to the United Nations, with his famous ``Common \nHeritage of Mankind'' speech before the U.N. General Assembly in 1967. \nThe convention then became the product of visionaries. I remember \nparticularly the ``Pacem in Maribus''--Peace on the Seas--meetings \norganized by Elizabeth Mann Borgese, the daughter of Germany's great \nwriter, Thomas Mann. Her book, The Ocean Regime, published in 1968, \ngave written expression to the ideas that were to gain a wider audience \nthrough Pacem in Maribus, on their way to being embodied in the \nnegotiated texts of the Law of the Sea Convention.\n  For me the dream began even earlier, during my service in the U.S. \nCoast Guard during World War II. Why not declare the oceans a zone of \npeace, open to all peoples and nations, to be free forever from the \nravages of warfare? My service on the staff of the San Francisco \nConvention that prepared the U.N. Charter, just 51 years ago this \nsummer, further confirmed me in my belief that ways could be found to \ncreate a working peace system.\n  The Law of the Sea Convention is the product of one of the more \nprotracted negotiations in diplomatic history. When the process began, \nthe Vietnam war was nearing its peak; the cold war was at its height; \nit had been only 5 years since the construction of the Berlin Wall.\n  I was proud to serve as a delegate to those early Law of the Sea \nnegotiations, one of the few who had also attended a Pacem in Maribus \nmeeting. My enthusiasm led me in 1967 to introduce the first Senate \nresolution calling on the President to negotiate a Law of the Sea \nConvention.\n  That resolution and a draft treaty that I proposed in 1969 led to \nthe Seabed Arms Control treaty, which was ratified by the Senate in \n1972. This little-known treaty has permanently removed nuclear weapons \nand other weapons of mass destruction from the ocean floor, which is 70 \npercent of the Earth's surface. It has been signed by nearly 100 \ncountries, it works, and it provides a good precedent for the \nConvention on the Law of the Sea. With the Seabed Arms Control Treaty \nas my model, you can appreciate my enthusiasm for the Law of the Sea \nConvention.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, we must look to the future and U.S. oceans policy \nfor the 21st century. Our interests in the Convention lie not only in \nwhat it is today, but in what it may become. Just as form and substance \nhave been given our Constitution by the courts, so too will future uses \nof the oceans be influenced and shaped by decisions made under the \nconvention. With the convention's entry into force, the United States \nstands on the threshold of a new era of oceans policy. Under the \nConvention, U.S. national interests in the world's oceans would be \nprotected as a matter of law. This is a success of U.S. foreign policy \nthat will work to our benefit in the decades to come.\n  Mr. President, the United States was a leader in initiating the \nnegotiations of the Law of the Sea Convention because our national \nsecurity interests were at stake. We have also played a widely \nrecognized leadership role in the Straddling Stock Agreement \nnegotiations because our fisheries interests were threatened. Indeed, \nthe United States will be among the very first parties to ratify this \nvery important agreement. It is time for the United States to regain \nits leadership role by ratifying promptly the United Nations Convention \non the Law of the Sea and thus protecting the entirety of our oceans \ninterests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I am disappointed to have just learned \nthat Mexican officials have arrested Ricardo Cordero. Mr. Cordero came \nto our attention this week with articles in the Washington Post and \nother papers in our country because of charges he made about the degree \nof narcotics-related corruption in Mexico's counterdrug efforts.\n  When I read those articles, the thought came to my mind, how come \nthis guy is still in Mexico? He will be assassinated, executed, or \nsomething. But anyway, now he is arrested. It has been on charges of \ncorruption and taking bribes himself.\n  I do not want to comment on the merits of those charges. He could be \nguilty, of course. But what concerns me, and what needs to concern all \nof us in this body,Cordero's accusations made this week printed in our \nown newspapers.\n  The arrest has the appearance of retaliation and intimidation. It \ngives the impression that instead of investigating his allegations, \nthat the messenger, in fact, has been punished. If this is the case, \nthen it raises further doubts about the ability of Mexico to take \nserious steps to end corruption and to deal with the problems posed by \ndrug trafficking.\n  Even if Mr. Cordero is guilty of the charges brought against him, it \nis a clear indication of the thorough-going nature of corruption in the \ncounterdrug fight in Mexico. If he is innocent, however--and at least \nin our\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\ncountry we would believe that he is innocent at this point--then his \narrest is an example of a system that is on the verge of going out of \ncontrol.\n  I want to make it clear here that we will be following Mr. Cordero's \narrest closely. How his case and his personal safety are handled will \nbe the subject of considerable attention. I know that bureaucracies \nhate whistle-blowers, here or, I am for sure, they hate them in Mexico \nas well. The integrity of public institutions, however, can only be \nmaintained if people in those institutions, with regard for \ndocumentation, are able to tell their stories without retaliation.\n  Mr. Cordero's case is very disturbing. And if it should prove to be a \ncase of retaliation, it does not speak well of Mexico's ability to deal \nseriously with the problems of corruption.\n  I call on the Mexican Government to resolve this case quickly, and, \nof course, fairly. I ask our own U.S. administration, even those of us \nhere in the Congress, to monitor this case very closely. And in the \ncase of the administration, please keep Congress informed. I expect Mr. \nCordero's rights--most importantly, his personal safety--will receive \nparticular attention. Thank you.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  Before the Senator from Iowa leaves the floor, I want to thank him \nfor bringing this issue before the Senate.\n  Mexico is continually asking for cooperation with this country in the \nareas of trade. I say to my friend, I am in a little bit of a battle \nright now over the dolphin-safe fishing of tuna where the Mexicans are \nreally fighting very hard to have us change the rules of the game so \nthey can go out and purse seine on dolphin and sell their tuna here in \ncompetition with our dolphin-safe American tuna people.\n  They want our cooperation, and yet we know the drugs are coming from \nMexico, yet we know they are doing, I would say, virtually nothing to \nstop illegal immigration. I believe it is important to have a warm and \ngood relationship with our neighbor, Mexico. But I think the Senator \nhas raised an issue that really requires the attention of the U.S. \nSenate. And I will work with him, and I know Senator Feinstein, the \nsenior Senator from California, will as well. Again, I want to thank \nhim for raising this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9475-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LEGISLATION PASSED BY CONGRESS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I came to the floor because I have been \nwatching a series of dueling press conferences, one held by the \nRepublicans this morning, the Republican leadership, one held by the \nDemocratic leadership, to discuss who deserves credit for the flurry of \nlegislation that has finally passed this Congress, after a do-nothing \nCongress.\n  Of course, the American people are going to make the decision about \nwho deserves the credit or the blame, depending on how they view the \nlegislation. The issues are welfare, health care, and minimum wage. We \nremember back to President Clinton talking about how it was important \nto reform welfare as we know it, the fact that he granted many waivers \nto the States to reform welfare, the fact that he presented some \nexcellent welfare reform bills which I consider to be real reform.\n  I think what the Republican Congress put out is very hurtful to my \nhome State. It is a huge, unfunded mandate, and it also hurts children. \nAs I said yesterday, it amazed me that Senators who earn large \npaychecks in relation to most of the people in this country did not \nhave the heart to mandate that the little kids who are helpless and \nhopeless, whose parents cannot find a job, that they are not assured \ndiapers, school supplies, emergency food and other things. So people \nwill decide on that one.\n  On health care, we know Senator Kennedy, for years, has worked on \nthat. Senator Kassebaum and he got together and passed two provisions \nof the Clinton health care reform bill, very important provisions. I am \nvery hopeful we will see portability of health insurance, so that when \nAmericans lose their jobs, they can take their health care with them \nand they will not be punished if they have a preexisting condition.\n  Who deserves credit for that? The Republicans say they do; I say look \nat the record. It was Senator Dole who blocked Senator Kassebaum from \nbringing up the bill time and time again. It is in the Record. Finally \nshe said, ``I will offer it every day.'' We finally have a bill.\n  Minimum wage. I do not have to tell you that Dick Armey, the majority \nleader of the Republicans, said, ``I will fight a minimum wage increase \nwith every fiber in my body.'' Well, it was not good enough, Mr. Armey, \nbecause the army of people in this country did not agree with you. Now \nyou want to take credit over there for it. The most important thing to \nthis Senator is that people will get a minimum wage increase--I am \nhappy about that--millions of hard-working Americans who do not want a \nhandout, they want to work for a decent wage. Most of them, by the way, \nare adults, and most of them are women.\n  So we have an argument going on. As I watched the Republican press \nconference, it brought to mind a little fable. I want to tell you the \nlittle fable. Once upon a time, in 1994, the real Republicans took over \nthe U.S. Congress. They came in like the wolf in Little Red Riding \nHood, and this is what they did, on the record: They tried to roll back \nenvironmental laws that protect our children. I know, I am on the \nEnvironment Committee. I saw it. They tried to sell off our parks. As a \nmatter of fact, Chairman Hansen said publicly it was not a question \nthat they would close down the parks, it is just how they would do it.\n  They tried to give huge tax breaks to millionaires, paid for by the \nmiddle class. They put through the largest cuts ever in education in \nthe history of our country. They denied many American women the right \nto choose. That is on the record. They even shut down the Government \nbecause Democrats would not let them destroy Medicare.\n  That is only part of it. Then the real Republicans read the polls and \nrealized they were about to lose the elections. So before your eyes, \nthe wolf has put on a grandma's disguise just like the wolf in Little \nRed Riding Hood, a grandma's smile, a grandma's voice, sweet, and it is \ntelling the American people, ``Look at the goodies we have done for \nyou.''\n  There are different versions for the end of Little Red Riding Hood. \nIn one she gets eaten alive because she trusts the wolf. In the other \nshe found out that Grandma is really a wolf in disguise, and she is \nsaved.\n  We say, today we do not think the American people will be fooled by \nthis costume because the real Republicans are on the record. I love the \nnew ones. I have never enjoyed it more than the last few days of being \nable to get some work done around here, that will make life better for \nthe people.\n\n  But I have to say in closing, do not take my word for it. Listen to \nwhat House Republican whip Dennis Hastert has said, on the record, \nquoted in the St. Louis Dispatch, June 9, 1996: ``After November, it \nwill be a different story.''\n  So, for now, we see different Republicans. I am going to reach out to \nthose different Republicans. Let's do something about pensions. Let's \ndo something about paycheck security. Let's put more police on the \nbeat. Let's do something about terrorism. Let's not back off of this \ntaggant issue. Tag those explosives used in bombs. Let's work together \non these issues. Let's go with President Clinton's idea to give our \nmiddle-class families a tax break for education. Let's put more \ninvestment into research for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer and \nAIDS, and wipe these scourges off the face of the Earth.\n  We can to it. We can do it, I say to my friends in your new outlook, \nin your new desire to work. But I say to the American people, look out. \nWatch out for the disguise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to communicate some very good \nnews to my colleagues in the Senate. The good news is about an issue \nthat I have previously talked about on two or three occasions on the \nSenate floor, the issue of schoolbus safety.\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\n  Over the last year and a half, I have been working on an important \nproblem affecting the safety of America's schoolchildren. Mr. \nPresident, tragically, since 1991, at least six children have died in \naccidents involving defective handrails on schoolbuses. Other children \nhave been injured.\n  My interest in this issue, Mr. President, came about because of a \nhorrible tragedy in my home county in Greene County, OH. A little girl \nby the name of Brandie Browder was killed. She was killed because of \none of these defective handrails and because the drawstring from her \nclothing was caught on that handrail as she was trying to get off the \nbus. She was stuck there, and unfortunately the bus ultimately ran over \nher.\n  We have been working for the last year and a half on this particular \nproblem. As I indicated, we have made some, I think, very, very \nimportant progress.\n  Mr. President, ever since I learned about these accidents, we have \nbeen trying to warn communities, schools, and parents in Ohio and \nacross the country about this danger. We have publicized some methods \nfor reducing the risk to children, such as a test we use in Ohio to \ndetermine whether a handrail is safe.\n  Mr. President, I have also chaired two Senate hearings--two Senate \nhearings--to investigate this problem. At the most recent of these \nhearings, this past April, we displayed this chart. I might say, Mr. \nPresident, to explain this for a moment, the question, does your State \nremove schoolbuses with dangerous handrails? This was the status as of \nApril, the red being ``no,'' the States that did not deal with this \nproblem; the yellow being states that were dealing with this problem. \nThis was an interim report. If we would have gone back a year before \nthat, we probably would have seen virtually every State in the Union in \nthe red with a ``no.'' So this was the progress as of April. You can \nsee, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, at that time there were \nstill at least 15 States that had these dangerous buses on the road.\n\n  Since that time I have been working with both my colleagues in the \nSenate and directly with officials in these States to see what we can \ndo to fix this problem. We have come a long way. I am glad to announce \ntoday, that as of today, as you can see in this new chart, all States \nexcept one--all States except one--are taking active measures to get \nschoolbuses with defective handrails off the road.\n  Mr. President, as we approach a new school year, it is my hope that \nthe last remaining State, the State of Georgia, will follow suit and \nwill do this by the beginning of the school year. I have been working \nwith Senator Coverdell to bring this issue to the attention of the \nrelevant officials in Georgia. We certainly hope that Georgia will take \naction soon.\n  Mr. President, we are close to a solution on the issue of defective \nhandrails. I am encouraged by the cooperation I have received from my \ncolleagues in this Chamber, and I want to help them for all the help \nthey have given my office over the last year and a half. Let me stress \nthat schoolbuses are already the very safest mode of transportation. \nThey should be, because they carry the most precious asset that any of \nus have, and that is our children.\n  Mr. President, we do have to do everything we can to make them even \nsafer. That is why I will continue to work on other areas of the \nschoolbus safety issue. But on this issue, Mr. President, we are very, \nvery close to solving the problem. If we can continue working together \nin this effective, bipartisan manner, I expect to make a great deal \nmore progress on school bus safety in the months ahead.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to urge the Senate to consider \nthe conference report on the national defense authorization bill for \nfiscal year 1997 before we adjourn for the August Recess.\n  I need not remind my colleagues that the Constitution vests the power \nto raise and support armies, provide and maintain a navy and to make \nrules for the Government and regulation of land and naval forces in the \nCongress. We execute that power through the Defense authorization bill \nwhich is currently awaiting consideration by the Senate. The 1997 \nnational defense authorization bill provides the funds and authorities \nfor the Department of Defense to carry out its functions for the coming \nfiscal year. It is a good bill that provides critical funding for our \nforces deployed around the globe in support of our national security. \nIt would be a travesty if the security and welfare of our forces is put \nat risk because of political squabbling in the Senate.\n  Throughout my 40 years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, it has \nbeen my philosophy that national defense is a bipartisan effort. The \nconference report that is pending before the Senate is a bipartisan \neffort. It passed the House last night by an overwhelming vote. It will \npass the Senate in the same bipartisan vote if given a chance.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to work with the leadership to \nresolve the deadlock that is holding up consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill by the Senate. We owe it to the Nation, but more \nimportantly we owe it to the men and women in uniform who are deployed \nto the trouble spots throughout the world.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to request that before the Senate \nrecesses, it approve the military nominations that are pending.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nconference report to S. 1028, the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act of 1996. The road leading to this compromise has \nbeen long and tortuous, but I'm happy that the leaders in this effort \nhave finally come to an agreement.\n  Over the past 5 years, the issue of health care reform has been at \nthe top of our national agenda. The need for an overhaul in our health \ncare delivery system was a centerpiece of the last Presidential \ncampaign, and our inability to enact comprehensive reform legislation 2 \nyears ago was a profound disappointment. At the same time, there \nremains a firm national consensus that something must be done to reform \nthe health care system.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that between 32 \nand 37 million Americans have no health insurance, and an additional 50 \nto 60 million are underinsured. As stated by the Office of Management \nand Budget, a total of 13 percent of all Americans are completely \nuninsured, with as many as 28 percent without insurance for 1 month or \nmore. The Labor Department reports that each year, 1 million people \nlose their health insurance.\n  As currently structured, the private health insurance market provides \nan insufficient level of coverage for individuals and families with \nmajor health problems and makes it difficult for employers to obtain \nadequate coverage for their employees. This is especially true of small \nbusinesses.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act will reduce many of the existing \nbarriers to obtaining insurance coverage by making it easier for people \nwho change jobs or lose their jobs to maintain adequate coverage. As \nmany as 25 million Americans will be helped by this legislation, since \nits protects portability and against losing insurance due to \npreexisting medical conditions.\n  This measure builds upon innovative and successful state reforms and \nenhances the private market by requiring health plans to compete based \non quality, price, and service instead of refusing to offer coverage to \nthose who are\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\nin poor health and need it the most. It would also provide much-needed \nmomentum for the more comprehensive reform that is still needed. \nEqually important, it would not increase Federal spending--because of \noffsets--impose new or expensive requirements on individuals, \nemployers, or States, or create new Federal layers of bureaucracy.\n\n  This measure enjoys wide bipartisan support in Congress and from a \nhost of organizations, including the National Association of \nManufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Governors \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, Independent Insurance Agents of America, and the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities. Virtually every medical \ngroup in the country has endorsed the bill and the House passed it by \nan overwhelming vote of 421 to 2.\n  I want to commend Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum for their \noutstanding leadership in bringing us this conference report. They have \nbeen tenacious and steadfast when it would have been understandable if \nthey had just called it a day and moved on. It is a sound, targeted, \nmarket-based reform measure that will make it easier for millions of \nAmericans to change jobs without the fear of losing their health \ncoverage.\n  I must say that I share the disappointment of Senators Domenici, \nWellstone, Simpson and others that their amendment guaranteeing parity \nof coverage for mental and physical conditions was dropped by the \nconference committee. I sincerely hope that the next Congress will \nagain take a close look at mental health coverage and reconsider giving \nit parity. Too many citizens have mental health conditions that not \nonly affect their personal lives, but also lower their productivity and \nlead to serious physical problems. This results in higher costs to the \nhealth care system and to employers.\n  While this bill does not make all the necessary changes we need in \nthe health care system, it does make a series of valuable reforms that \nwill make a discernible difference in the lives of millions of our \ncitizens. It does so without interfering with those parts of the system \nwhich work and without taking away the ability of States to implement \ntheir own reforms. If we learned anything from the health care debate \nin 1994, it is that our system must be reformed gradually and \nincrementally. The Health Insurance Reform Act before us is an example \nof the kind of incremental changes that can be enacted step-by-step in \na bipartisan, collegial manner. Hopefully, this will serve as a model \nfor future legislative reforms to our health care system and prompt the \ntwo sides of the aisle to seek more ways of working together for the \nbetterment of the Nation.\n  Again, I congratulate the managers of this bill and am proud to lend \nmy support.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRESSLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9477-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9478-S9479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE 104TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I was pleased to participate in an event \nthis morning which summarized the events of the 104th Congress up to \nthis date. It has been a very productive Congress.\n  This Congress is near the end of passing a major health reform bill \nwhich will provide for portability of insurance. It will also provide \nthat a person with a preexisting condition gets certain considerations.\n  This Congress passed the first major welfare reform legislation since \n1963 to initiate ``workfare'' and to help both the taxpayers and truly \ndeserving welfare recipients.\n  This Congress also passed a major telecommunications reform bill--a \nsweeping bill that will creates jobs and moves us into the wireless \nage.\n  In addition, this Congress passed the freedom to farm bill which will \nend some of the bureaucracy and costliness of the farm program, helping \nboth taxpayers and farmers, and will usher us into a new age of \nderegulated agriculture.\n  The 104th Congress also passed several other bills of great note \nmaking the last 18 or 19 months probably the most productive of any 18 \nor 19 months that I have seen in the recent history of Congress.\n  I think that this fiscally responsible approach this Congress has \ntaken has resulted in a prosperity and a confidence in the business \ncommunity across the country. The business community knows that there \nis an effort to balance the budget, and we are moving closer to it. The \nbusiness community knows that we have a Congress that is deregulatory \nin its intentions in legislation and that it wants to have a balanced \nbudget and a sound fiscal policy.\n  But there is one more step that this Congress must take, and that is \nto pass legislation that will fully achieve a balanced budget.\n  I have been very proud to be associated with the Domenici budget here \nin the Senate. I proudly voted for it last year. It is a fair budget. \nIt saves Medicare and Medicaid for our senior citizens. It move us to a \nreal balanced budget with real numbers by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, the national debt has spiraled upward to more than $5 \ntrillion. Twenty years ago it was $524 billion--only about one-tenth of \nwhat it is today. The annual interest on the debt now exceeds $340 \nbillion. It is unfair to us and especially to the future generations of \ntaxpayers to allow the debt to continue on this course.\n  While the Congressional Budget Office recently revised its deficit \nestimate for fiscal year 1996 downward to $130 billion, one needs to be \ncareful to note the true sources of this deficit reduction. As pointed \nout by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, a large part of the decline was a result of greater \nfiscal restraint by Congress, which blocked a number of White House \nspending proposals. Further, the deficit is expected to be lower due to \nrevised technical assumptions and revisions in economic forecasts.\n  Though this represents progress, let us not kid ourselves. We \ncertainly do not have a settled fiscal policy that will bring an era of \nunceasing deficits to an end. As the Congressional Budget Office has \nwarned,\n\n       . . . the retirement of the baby-boom population starting \n     about 2010 will put severe pressure on the budget. CBO \n     projects that, if spending and revenue policies are not \n     changed, deficits and debt will soar to unprecedented levels \n     in the following 20 years.\n\n  In response to this situation, Mr. President, I have supported and \nvoted for measures that slow the growth of Government across the board. \nI also voted for the constitutional amendment to balance the budget and \nline-item veto authority for the President. I am pleased the line-item \nveto is now law. Yet the most important vote I cast in this Congress \nwas for the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. This bill would achieve a \nbalanced budget in 7 years, reform the costly welfare program, preserve \nMedicare for seniors, and reduce the tax burden on American families \nand small businesses. Regrettably, President Clinton vetoed the \nBalanced Budget Act. This is unfortunate. Each day we fail to pass a \nbalanced budget, we add the cost of doing so on the next generation.\n  Mr. President, despite last year's veto, I am proud that the Senate \ncontinues to move forward in our efforts to achieve a balanced budget. \nJust a few months ago, we adopted a budget resolution for fiscal year \n1997 that maintains our commitment to balance the budget by 2002. If we \nstick to this plan, we will achieve a $5 billion budget surplus in the \nyear 2002 and, for the first time in decades, bring about a reduction \nin the national debt.\n  In addition, this resolution calls for much-needed reforms in the \nareas of welfare and Medicaid while continuing to allow the programs to \ngrow at a fiscally responsible pace. This budget plan would maintain \nour commitment to low-income families, seniors, college students, and \nsmall businesses.\n  I am especially concerned with preserving and strengthening the \nMedicare Program. My mother is a senior citizen. I will be a senior \ncitizen as well in the not-too-distant future. Under the Senate plan, \nMedicare would increase at an annual rate of about 6.2 percent--nearly \ntwice the rate of inflation. Spending for each Medicare beneficiary \nwould increase from $5,200 per person today to $7,000 per person in \n2002. Just as important, we would preserve Medicare for years to come, \nand quality health care would continue to be provided to those seniors \nwho need it.\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\n  Finally, our budget plan calls for tax relief in the form of a \npermanent, $500-per-child tax credit for families. Millions of middle-\nclass families across the Nation would benefit from this measure. A \nfamily with two children, for example, would be given the opportunity \nto invest or spend as they see fit the $1,000 that otherwise would have \nbeen paid to the Federal Government. This is the way it ought to be. \nThis is a true middle-class tax cut. In fact, the tax credit would be \nphased out for unmarried individuals with incomes over $75,000 and \ncouples with incomes over $110,000.\n  Mr. President, not many days remain in the 104th Congress. I \nsincerely hope that before we adjourn, this Congress and the President \nwill be able to agree on legislation to assure a balanced budget by \n2002. Our Nation's economic future and the quality of life for the next \ngeneration depend on a balanced budget. We must not lose sight of this \ngoal and we must not delay. I urge my colleagues to give their full \nsupport for legislation to implement this budget and to push forward in \nour efforts to ensure economic growth, more job opportunities, a higher \nstandard of living, better opportunities for our children, and a \ncountry free from ever-increasing debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9478-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO SOUTH DAKOTA NATIONAL GUARD 57TH TRANSPORTATION DETACHMENT\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, it is with a great sense of pride that I \nrise to pay special tribute to Capt. Andy Gerlach, Pfc. Jess Berg, \nSpecialist Travis Nelson, Sgt. Alan Kludt, Sgt. Glenn Nordemeyer, \nSpecialist Fred Emmetsberger, Sgt. Jim Aarstad, and my nephew \nSpecialist Steve Pressler. These eight dedicated South Dakotans are \nmembers of the South Dakota National Guard 57th Transportation \nDetachment. Today, they will return to South Dakota after having been \nthe only Guard unit from South Dakota called to serve as part of the \npeacekeeping mission in and around Bosnia. The 57th Transportation \nDetachment was called to active duty in December 1995 with the primary \nresponsibility of supporting rail operations in Bamberg, Germany. The \n57th coordinated the movement and transportation of military personnel, \nmaterials, equipment, and supplies to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, all South Dakotans are proud of these eight \noutstanding guardsmen. As a Vietnam veteran, I have deep respect and \nhigh admiration for these young men. I am sorry I cannot be in \nBrookings, SD, personally to welcome them home and see them reunited \nwith family and friends. The men of the 57th have done their duty to \ntheir country with professionalism and dedication. South Dakotans \nalways have been ready to answer their country's call to duty. The men \nof the 57th are a shining example that Americans stand ready to defend \nthe interests of their Nation and their values. I am confident the 57th \nwill continue to serve South Dakota and our Nation in an equally \noutstanding manner in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9479-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9479-S9480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the 1997 \ndefense authorization bill. I am privileged to serve on the committee \nwith the distinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, of South Carolina, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, Mr. Nunn, of Georgia, and I wish to \ncompliment them, together with their senior staffs, for putting \ntogether an excellent bill and conference report. It is my hope and \nexpectation that conference report will be voted on favorably by this \nbody very shortly.\n  Mr. President, as we deliberate this bill, let us put ourselves in \nany of 10 places beyond the shores of this country where men and women \nof the Armed Forces are standing guard, or actually in some instances \nbasically looking down the rifle bore of a potential enemy, but \nstanding guard and taking those risks in the cause of freedom.\n  It is for that reason I so fervently hope this body turns to the \ndefense authorization conference report and passes it this afternoon \nsuch that it can go on to the President from the Senate and the House \nand receive the President's signature and be enacted into law.\n  This conference report goes a long way towards ensuring that our \nArmed Forces will remain capable of meeting the many challenges that \nlie ahead. Let me dwell on that for a moment--challenges that lie \nahead. Today, we have the finest equipment for the men and women of the \nArmed Forces, but it takes basically 10 years, 10 years from the \ndrawing board until the next generation of weapons systems are \ndelivered by the American industrial base. And we are proud to have in \nthis country the finest industrial base in the world. But it will take \nthem 10 years from drawing board to delivery to the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces.\n  Our actions today ensure that those young men and women today barely \nin their early teens will have that equipment when they, hopefully, \nvolunteer to assume their role on the ramparts not only of this country \nbut across the world to achieve freedom.\n  To achieve this goal the conferees had to add $11.2 billion to the \nClinton administration budget request. We concentrated those additional \nfunds on just that, providing the research and the development, from \nthe drawing board to providing the funds for the production lines all \nacross the America for airplanes and ships and missiles, trucks, tents, \nand the like for our men and women of the Armed Forces 10 years hence.\n  Earlier today I had the opportunity to talk by phone to Secretary of \nDefense Perry. We discussed his mission to Saudi Arabia. Deep in the \nhearts of every person in this Chamber is the sadness for the loss of \nlife due to terrorism--make it clear, Mr. President, terrorism--when \nthose barracks were maliciously partially destroyed by a truck bomb.\n  The Secretary advised members of the committee that he is taking \nsteps to ensure greater security for those troops, and, indeed, that \nrequires moving from their present quarters to places elsewhere in \nSaudi Arabia. But that is what this money is for.\n  I must point out, however, that even with the funding added by the \nconferees, this year will mark the 12th straight year of declining \ndefense budgets. The funding level in the fiscal year 1997 conference \nreport represents a real decline of $7.4 billion from last year's bill. \nJust 12 months ago this Chamber acted on that piece of legislation and \nalready there has been that significant depreciation in the spending \nlevel for the Department of Defense. To all of our critics I say that \nwe have not increased defense spending. This bill merely lessens the \nrate of decline.\n  As I stated, U.S. troops are currently deployed in 10 separate \nmilitary operations overseas. Despite the end of the cold war, we are \ncalling on the men and women of the Armed Forces at an ever increasing \nrate to endure more and more separation from families. What a joy for \nMembers of this Chamber to go home in the evening and join their wives \nand their children, and for millions and millions of other Americans \nwherever they may live. But so often the man or the woman in uniform is \ndeployed beyond our shores and separated from that which he or she \nregards most precious in life--their family. They do that, as \nvolunteers, so that we can have the exercise of free speech and all the \nother many blessings that this country enjoys.\n  Despite the end of the cold war, we are calling on these men and \nwomen, again, to take more and more deployments abroad. It is our \nresponsibility, then, to provide our troops with adequate resources so \nthey can effectively and, I underscore, Mr. President, safely--not only \neffectively, but safely--perform their missions. We must not now, \ntomorrow, or ever send them into harm's way without the best possible \nequipment.\n  The conference report which passed the House last night and is \ncurrently waiting Senate action provides for our troops, not only by \nadding desperately needed funding for the procurement, which I have \naddressed in the R, but also by funding vital quality-of-life \ninitiatives such as the 3-percent pay raise for our troops, enhanced \nmilitary medical benefits, and almost $500 million of budget requests \nfor construction of improved quality-of-life housing, both for families \nand single troops.\n  Just remembering back in my own lifetime, having had the privilege to \nserve in uniform, the pay raise is particularly very important, \nparticularly\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\nwhen you are beyond the shores and your family is back here in the \nUnited States. That pay raise means the difference in their quality of \nlife. I cannot tell you the emotional stress on a military person, \nseparated from his or her family, beyond the seas, when they hear that \npay raise could well be in jeopardy should this body, this afternoon or \ntomorrow, not pass this legislation. We owe a duty to those who \nvolunteer to see that they are adequately compensated. I hope we will \ndo that.\n  In addition, this conference report adds almost $1 billion over the \nbudget request to provide defenses for our troops and our Nation \nagainst the very real threat that is in the R report, the real \nthreat, particularly to forward-deployed troops, against missile \nattack. Those of us who visited the gulf operations during the gulf war \nsaw firsthand the damage by the crudest type of ballistic missile, the \nScud missile, that Saddam Hussein relentlessly fired upon our troops \nand those of our allies, and relentlessly fired upon Tel Aviv. Many of \nus here saw firsthand the devastation of those crude weapons.\n  We had in place our best defense at that time, barely off the drawing \nboards, barely off the production lines. We have an obligation to the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces and, indeed, to all of our citizens \nand others deployed abroad to put our greatest strength of research and \ndevelopment into deterring these systems in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, may I inquire of the Chair what the \nregular order is? Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to talk a little bit today about an \nissue which is on everyone's mind in America, which is the question of \nterrorism. I spoke briefly yesterday on this matter, but I wanted to \nexpand on those comments because there is a great deal happening within \nthis body and the other body and in the Government generally on how we \nreact to this new world, which has brought this threat to us with such \nimmediacy, as we see in Atlanta, as we see in flight 800. I think it is \nimportant to review what is happening here in the Federal response to \nit, where we should go from here, and also to talk a little bit about \nother areas that need to be addressed.\n  First off, the scope of the problem, I think, cannot be \noverestimated. The immediacy of the problem cannot be overstated. The \nfact is, we have stepped out of the cold war into a very hot war, and \nit is a hot war that involves people who have targeted Americans and \nAmerican institutions with the intention of bringing physical harm to \nthose institutions and to our citizens.\n  We should not be naive about this. We are a nation which has some \nwonderful characteristics. One of the great characteristics of our \nNation is that we always believe in the best in people. We always give \npeople the benefit of the doubt. We are an optimistic and upbeat \ncountry. It is our nature to think positively, not only about ourselves \nbut about our neighbors throughout the world. That is a wonderful \ncharacteristic, and, hopefully, nothing will ever cause us to lose that \nbetter nature which makes up the American personality. But it is time, \nalso, for us to be realistic. There are evil people out there. \nUnfortunately, there are also governments out there which fund, \nsupport, and endorse those evil individuals. There are people out there \nwhose intention it is to kill Americans, to destroy American \ninstitutions simply because we are Americans.\n  Some of this terrorist threat is obviously domestic. But the domestic \nthreat is a manageable threat. It is a containable threat, and it is \none which I believe our institutions are well structured to address \nalready. The FBI and the various State agencies which do law \nenforcement are well-tooled and well-experienced in how to address, to \nmeet, to obtain intelligence on and to respond to, domestic terrorism \nand acts of violence. We, as a nation, have had this happen in the \npast.\n  I remember in the 1960's we had a group called the Weathermen, in New \nYork. We have been able to respond. I do not have any question in my \nmind but that we will find the perpetrator of the bombing in Atlanta \nand we will prosecute that person, and we will do likewise relative to \nOklahoma in the prosecution area and obtain a conviction, hopefully, if \nthat is what the jury finds appropriate.\n  So, domestic terrorism is a very severe problem, but it is not the \ncore threat that we face as a nation. The core threat that we face as a \nnation is internationally sponsored terrorist acts, because here you \nhave individuals who are backed up by governments or by institutions or \nlarge groups of people who have the physical and economic capacity to \nwreak incredible harm on our country and our citizens. This \ninternational terrorism is a new breed of threat. It is something we as \na country have not faced before.\n  As a result, we need to take a new look from a different view of how \nwe approach the prevention, anticipation, and, hopefully, termination \nof this threat.\n  It was reported in the press today that there are actually functions \ncamps in Iran that may have as many as 5,000 individuals who are \nspecifically being trained for the purposes of executing terrorist \nacts, killing of Americans, killing of people from other cultures \naround this world that these fanatics, these criminals disagree with.\n  Now, whether that report is accurate, I do not know, but it is \nlegitimate enough to have been put on the wire by a reasonable news \nsource, and it is clearly reflective of the concern which we, as a \nnation, must be ready to address.\n  So, how do we address it? How do we address this new international \nthreat, this new cold war which is now a hot war for us?\n  I think we have to begin by recognizing that as of right now, the \nFederal Government is not ready to address it. We have to acknowledge \nour weakness in this area. We have very good people at the heads of the \nagencies which are charged with the responsibility for anticipating and \ndeveloping a response to international terrorism directed at the United \nStates.\n  There are four primary agencies involved: the State Department, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, the Defense Department, and the Justice \nDepartment. There are also a lot of ancillary agencies that have a role \nin this--the Treasury Department, for example--but the four primary \nagencies are headed by good people, in my opinion, and they are all \ncommitted to doing something on this issue.\n  But the problem is that there isn't a comprehensive, systematic plan \nin place. There are, on paper, some systematic plans. For example, the \nNational Security Council is, by law, charged very appropriately with \nthe responsibility of organizing, orchestrating, anticipating the \nthreat of terrorism and the response to the threat of terrorism. But it \ndoesn't really do it in practice. In practice, it does very little, \nactually.\n  If you talk to each of the heads of the different Departments in \ncharge here, they will tell you of their sincere interest in pursuing \nthis and what their Department is doing. You can ask them, ``How are \nyou interfacing with the other Department?'' And they say, ``Well, \nwe're occasionally speaking on this point and speaking occasionally on \nthis point,'' and it is almost always a personal-relationship-type \nexchange. There is no system in place, no management structure in \nplace, no comprehensive plan in place which directs the response to the \ninternational terrorist threat. That has to be changed.\n  Now, in a bill that was reported out of the Appropriations Committee \nyesterday, the Commerce, State, Justice bill, which is the subcommittee \nI chair, we put in place a series of new initiatives in the area of \nfighting terrorism. Not new in some instances; in some instances, they \nwere supportive of initiatives which were already in place. But the \nmost important part of this proposal was that we have developed by the \nAttorney General a comprehensive plan which will be reported back to \nthe\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nCongress by November 15 and which will outline how we are going to get \nthese different agencies to work together.\n  I don't know if this proposal is going to go anywhere, because that \nbill, which subcommittee I happen to chair, is sort of at the end of \nthe trail here as we move down the appropriations path, and it may not \neven get up until the end of September. As a practical matter, we \nreally shouldn't have to have a law passed to tell the administration \nto do this. As a practical matter--and I don't say this to be \nderogatory because I don't intend to be, I hope it is constructive--as \na practical matter, the President should meet with the Secretary of \nState, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the Defense Secretary and require them to develop such a \nplan. And those meetings should continue on a regular basis with the \nheads of those agencies over a series of weeks and months until that \nplan is not only developed but being executed.\n\n  As a practical matter, we are not going to accomplish the goal of \nputting in place a systematic response from the Federal Government to \nthe threat of international terrorism until we have the President of \nthe United States driving his Department heads to accomplish just that \nin an organized way.\n  Having served as a chief executive at a State level--and it doesn't \nreally work much differently at the Federal level; in fact, it probably \nis even worse at the Federal level as far as getting coordination \ngoing--I know from experience that unless the chief executive \nphysically participates and demands a physical participation of the key \ndepartment heads, then issues like this then get lost either, one, to \ninattention, or, more significantly and more often is the case, get \nundermined by the battles over turf.\n  An equally important initiative to having the President drive this \nprocess with his Department heads is that there must be put in place a \nsystem which accomplishes the follow-on followup that is necessary to \nproduce results so that it doesn't depend on individuals in the end, \nbut it is functioning as an element of an organized plan which can be \nexecuted by people no matter who is sitting in the key seats around the \ntable. Unfortunately, none of that has occurred to date. I hope that it \nwill occur soon.\n  In the meetings that have been going on this week on the special task \nforce on terrorism that was set up where Members of the Senate, Members \nof the House, and the White House were meeting, along with the Justice \nDepartment, it was suggested we have a blue ribbon panel. I believe the \nHouse today will appoint a blue ribbon panel.\n  Now, I like blue ribbon panels as well as the next person, and I am \nsure a blue ribbon panel could be useful here to some degree, but the \nlead time for such a group is considerable, and we don't have to wait \nto get things started, to hear back from a commission, as good as it \nmay be and as constructive as it may be.\n  There is a tremendous amount of coordination and planning that can \nbegin now. It is not occurring now. There is a lot of planning and \neffort going on right now, I don't want to underestimate that. These \nDepartments individually are doing a superior job in trying to get up \nto speed in their area of responsibility. But so often, the right hand \ndoesn't know what the left hand is doing, and the left hand doesn't \ntell the left foot what it is doing, and the left foot doesn't tell the \nright foot what it is doing, and we all end up in different directions, \nand we end up in a pretzel-like position. And that is, unfortunately, \nwhat is occurring, to some degree, to our response of the overall issue \nof a comprehensive initiative.\n  So, yes, let's go forward with a blue ribbon commission, because I \nthink it would be helpful to get outside review from people who are \nvery knowledgeable on terrorism as to how to proceed. And yes, let's \nkeep the energies going in the FBI, and the CIA, and in the State \nDepartment and in the Defense Department on various actions in their \nbailiwicks that can be taken to try to get their responsibilities in \nterrorism response proceeding effectively.\n  But at the same time, we need to have this comprehensive approach \ncoming from the top, from the President, through the Secretariats, to \nthe departments so that we have an integrated, cooperative effort and \none that is focused. That is the most critical thing we need to do \nright now to address the international terrorist threat, which is huge \nand extraordinarily dangerous.\n  In addition to this comprehensive plan, within the bill that was \npassed out of the Appropriations Committee, we basically took five \nother steps, five other philosophical steps--or not philosophical \nbecause I think they are very tangible steps--steps to try to beef up \nthe effort in fighting terrorists.\n  First off, we have given significantly more resources to the FBI to \nhelp it monitor terrorist groups in the United States and overseas. \nObviously, the best way to stop a terrorist attack on the United States \nis to know when it is going to come and who is going to pursue it. But \nto do that, you have to have people. You have to have intelligence-\ngathering. Unfortunately, the intelligence-gathering capability by \nhuman beings, which is the way you really have to do it in this area of \nterrorism, has been significantly reduced, especially at the CIA.\n  However, the FBI, which our committee has jurisdiction over, is \nattempting to reach out to police forces around the world in order to \nuse the resources of the police forces in various countries where \nterrorist groups may be organizing and to take advantage of their \nknowledge base, which is extraordinary, and thus multiply by hundreds \nif not thousands and actually tens of thousands their ability to obtain \ninformation.\n  The FBI is attempting to expand that pool of information-gathering by \nmoving agents into international posts. In this bill we propose to \nstrongly support that initiative so that we can begin to better \nanticipate who and where the threat is coming from.\n  It is an interesting thing. I met with President Mubarak yesterday, \nor Wednesday. There is a man who obviously understands and knows the \nthreat of terrorism. One of his biggest concerns--and I would put it \ndown almost as a gripe, and it is a legitimate one. Maybe I should not \nuse the word ``gripe'' because it is a very legitimate frustration. His \nbiggest frustration is that it is our democratic allies in Europe who \nhave become the prime harborers of some of the most vicious murderers \nand terrorists.\n  He points to England and to some of the European Continent countries \nas being nations which, for whatever reason, have decided to allow to \nlive within their shores people who are known to have an intention of \ncommitting terrorist acts and who have a stated policy of doing so \nrelative not only to Egypt and to other modern Arab states, but \nrelative to America.\n  So we are not talking about access to information in nations which \nmaybe we have trouble dealing with. We are talking about getting access \nto information in nations who are our allies and maybe working with \nthose allies to be a little more responsible in the manner in which \nthey deal with individuals whom they have allowed into their countries \nand who may represent threats to our country.\n  The third issue which we attempted to increase the effort here in our \nbill is to create a better capacity for response, both at the Federal \nlevel and at the State and local level, to a terrorist event. In this \narea we are very concerned about terrorist events that might involve \nbiological or chemical threats. So that is something we really need to \nfocus in on.\n\n  This committee is trying to do that. We have created rapid response \nteams or increased the funding--they already exist--but increase the \nfunding to allow us to have more capacity to move rapid response teams \ninto positions where there is a local emergency.\n  In addition, we have significantly increased the effort to break down \ncommunication barriers between the Federal Government and the State \ngovernments and the local governments. Once again, you have this \nunfortunate atmosphere which develops amongst bureaucracies, whether \nthey are law enforcement bureaucracies or social services \nbureaucracies, that is known as turf.\n  I remember when I was Governor of New Hampshire, one of my great \nfrustrations was that we could not get the State police and the local \npolice to even be on the same radio band so if a State police officer \nwanted to talk to a\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\nlocal police officer while they were chasing a car at a high speed, \nthey basically had to call in to headquarters and have the headquarters \ncall out to the other police car. They could not talk to each other. It \nwas a turf issue.\n  Unfortunately, that gets magnified hundreds and hundreds of times in \ninnumerable circumstances. What we are trying to do is break down those \nbarriers of communication so that we will have better communication \nbetween Federal, State, and local law enforcement on a two-way-street \neffort for information.\n  Fifth, we have attempted to increase the technological information \nand capability of the FBI. This is very important. We all know that we \nare dealing in a technological world and there are in the area of \ncommunications, in the area of detection, in the area of crime \nprevention, huge technological advances being made, and we have to stay \ncurrent. So we are going to significantly increase that effort.\n  Sixth, it is our desire to make sure that our key facilities in the \nlaw enforcement and international community, international stage, are \nprotected. So we have increased the funding for security at our \ncourthouses, and, very important in my mind, we have increased the \nfunding for security for our personnel who are serving overseas in our \nState Department.\n  I cannot and will not tolerate--and I do not think anybody in this \nbody would tolerate--putting American citizens who are working for our \nGovernment in a post that has a fair amount of risk to it at an \nunnecessary risk. There are simple things that need to be done to help \nthese people and protect their security and, equally important, protect \ntheir family security.\n  There is no reason why an American who is working for the State \nDepartment who has his or her family with him or her should feel that \nthat family is not getting adequate protection from our Government if \nthere is a threat occurring in that country to Americans. So we needed \nto increase that security effort. And we have done that.\n  So this bill, this State-Commerce-Justice bill, is a major step, in \nmy opinion, but not a final step, hardly even a midway step really. It \nis just a part of the beginning steps, but a major thrust in the \nbeginning steps toward getting together our counterterrorism effort. \nBut as I mentioned earlier, it all depends to a great extent on the \ncapacity of the administration to pull together these various agencies. \nAnd that has to start at the top.\n\n  Also in this bill were two pieces of language--three actually--that \nhave been passed by the Senate relative to terrorism in order to give \nour police and law enforcement community more flexibility and more \ncapability, which passed this body by 90 to 0. They were a multipoint \nwiretapping and another wiretapping right and also a study on taggants \nrelative to tracing explosives and the institution of that. That \nlanguage is also in this bill.\n  So it is a bill that has a lot of activity in the area of trying to \naddress the terrorist threat. Specifically, the international terrorist \nthreat is, I mentioned, the true concern, should be our true concern, \nin the area of trying to get ahead of this wave of potential violence \ndirected at the United States. Now, on that score, the Government \ncannot do everything. The Government has never been able to do \neverything, in my opinion. It certainly cannot do everything in this \narena. It is the primary player. The agencies which we have \nresponsibility for have been described as the Defense Department in \nthis area of counterterrorism. But there still has to be a \nresponsibility among the communities of our citizenship. There still \nhas to be a responsibility in our corporate community.\n\n  On that point, I have written, along with some of my colleagues who \nwish to join me, a letter to the companies who manage Internet access. \nAs I mentioned yesterday, we all recognize that the Internet is the \nWild West of information. I, for one, have absolutely no interest in \nregulating it. I think it would be a mistake. I think it would \nundermine the great potential of the new medium of education.\n  The fact is certain people are abusing the Internet. When you punch \nin the word ``explosive'' and trace that word on the Internet, you come \nup with something like 32,000 designations, of which 6,000--6,000--\ninvolve directions on how to make an explosive device, directions \ntitled, such as, ``How to make a pipe bomb and leave it at your \nfavorite airport or Federal office building.'' That is wrong.\n  What I have suggested in writing the leaders of these various \nentrepreneurial groups who are driving the economy of information, the \ninformation economy which is doing so much for our country, what I \nsuggest to them, maybe it is time they gave a little thought here as to \nwhat type of access they are affording people relative to the Internet. \nMaybe they should create some sort of self-policing mechanism which \nsays if something is clearly, clearly, on the Net for the purpose of \nexplaining how to kill people, such as making a pipe bomb and leaving \nit at your favorite airport or Federal office building, that accessing \nthat information should not be easy. It should not just involve typing \nin the word ``explosive.''\n  When they index these items, maybe they decide not to index some \nitems, recognizing that is a type of censorship they may not want to \nparticipate in. In this instance, it may be appropriate. In any event, \nwhen they index these systems, whether it is Yahoo, Magellan, or \nNetscape, generally, or America Online or CompuServe or some Microsoft \nsystem, they ought to make it more difficult to get that type of \ninformation, that you ought to go through more hoops before you can \naccess. Granted, that might not stop the truly committed individual, \nbut it will certainly make it more difficult for the casual pursuer of \nthis information. That is why I am sending this letter.\n  I am not sure what processes could be put in place. I think there \nought to be some thought given. It should not come from the \nGovernment--in other words, the Government saying, ``You do this,'' as \nmanagers of the Internet, as people who create the access systems for \nthe Internet. That will lead to all sorts of, in my opinion, more \nsignificant issues of freedom of speech and officiousness of \nGovernment.\n  This should be a self-policing exercise. These folks should have the \ncommon sense and the civic attitude to proceed to try to develop \nsomething. These are creative and imaginative people that have come up \nwith these systems. If put in a room, I suspect they could come up with \ncreative and imaginative solutions to this problem.\n  That is a brief summary--not that brief, actually--but a summary of \nwhere we stand in the counterterrorism exercise relative to the FBI, \nespecially, but it is my concern relative to this administration and \nhow it should pursue it and the Internet, and how it should be \naddressed in that arena.\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to discuss \nbriefly one of the aspects of the immigration conference report which \nwill come before the Senate either today or shortly after we return \nfrom recess. I think that it is very important that we reform our laws \nto provide increased resources to protect our borders and combat \nillegal immigration.\n  Nevertheless, I have been very much concerned about a number of \nprovisions of the immigration bill. The provision which concerns me the \nmost is the so-called Gallegly amendment, which would give the States \nthe option to limit education opportunities to children of illegal \nimmigrants. In my opinion, it is unthinkable in America to deny \neducation to any children, regardless of their status, whether their \nparents are illegal immigrants.\n  That is something I feel particularly strongly about because both of \nmy parents were immigrants. My mother came to this country as a child \nof 5 with her parents from a small town on the Russian-Polish border. \nMy father came from Ukraine Russia, literally walked across Europe with \nbarely a ruble in his pocket, sailed steerage--the bottom of the boat--\nto come to America to make a better life for himself. He did not know \nat the time he had a return trip ticket to France, not to Paris but to \nthe Argonne Forest, where he fought in World War I as a buck private, \nto make the world safe\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\nfor democracy, and carried shrapnel in his legs until the day he died.\n  My parents had legal status as immigrants, but sometimes that is a \nhard thing to determine. I do not think any child ought to be deprived \nof educational opportunities because of the status of his parents, even \nif they are illegal immigrants.\n  I have been strongly opposed to the Gallegly amendment. I have agreed \nto sign the conference report, however, because of a significant change \nwhich I have insisted upon. That change is that, in addition to some \nother modifications which have already been made for a child in the \nfirst grade to complete the sixth grade and a child in the seventh \ngrade to complete the 12th grade, the modifications I pressed to have \nincluded, and I think have been included by agreement, would provide \nfor a comprehensive study to be conducted by GAO, the General \nAccounting Office, at the end of 2\\1/2\\ years, which would determine \nwhat impact the Gallegly amendment had on the children who were \nexcluded from education, what impact it had with respect to juvenile \ndelinquency, the crime rate, what impact it had on their educational \nstatus, what impact it had on their family status, and what impact it \nhad on reducing illegal immigration. Following release of the study \nthere will be a mandatory vote on repeal of the Gallegly provision in \nthe Congress, both Houses, within a very short period of time, whatever \nthe results of the GAO report may have been.\n  If the Gallegly amendment was not repealed on that vote, then there \nwill be a similar study after 5 years, and then another mandated \nautomatic vote on the repeal of the Gallegly provision by the Congress.\n  It is my judgment, Madam President, that if the Gallegly amendment is \nsubjected to a vote at 2\\1/2\\ or 5 years, it would be repealed by the \nCongress and signed by whomever might be the President. Whether it is \nPresident Clinton or Senator Dole, the then President would sign it. I \nthink if the Gallegly amendment were standing alone now, it would be \nrejected by the Congress.\n  I do not think that the entire immigration conference report ought to \nbe rejected because of this single provision, considering the \nmodification that I have presented, which, as I say, I think is being \naccepted and will be in the conference report. I wanted to make that \nbrief explanation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know the majority leader will be here \nshortly. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss the schedule for \nthe remainder of the day with him when he comes.\n  Let me just say that I apologize for not having the opportunity to \nhave been here this morning. I know there have been a number of \ndiscussions underway with regard to the schedule and individual issues.\n  The distinguished Senator from Texas, the Presiding Officer, made a \nnumber of points this morning regarding the stalking bill that she has \nmade in the past. I am told she suggested that her stalking \nlegislation, which passed the Senate last week after an amendment to \nthe bill was worked out, is being held up in the House and that she \nreferred to a commitment I made to her to try to help her get it \npassed. I am told she suggested that, because the bill has not cleared \nthe House in the last week, that I have not lived up to that \ncommitment.\n  As several Senators pointed out earlier this morning, sometimes it \ntakes more than a week for the other body to act. At any rate, I \nunderstand that the problem is not as dire as earlier suggested--and \nthat the circumstances surrounding this stalking legislation certainly \ndo not warrant objections to action on the Executive Calendar. I wanted \nto confirm this, but I can now say with authority--I have the \nreferences before me --that the entire language of the Senator's \nstalking bill, word-for-word, is currently in the defense authorization \nconference report that is in the Senate. This language was apparently \naccepted by the House and Senate conferees. She was one of those \nconferees, so I am sure she understood that.\n  I am confused as to why that was not recognized this morning, \nyesterday, or at some point, because she made quite a point of saying \nthat we had not worked in good faith. Well, clearly, the conferees were \nthere and could have objected to the inclusion of that language, and \nthey did not. So the language is in the defense authorization \nconference report, and I hope that she feels that that represents a \nfairly significant development in terms of getting her policy \naccomplished. I am very disappointed that the other half of the \nstalking legislation that passed last week--the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey that she praised so strongly and so \nappropriately the other night --was not included. The Senator from \nTexas has given me her word, as has the majority leader, that they \nwould work with us to get that legislation enacted as well. I know that \nshe will live up to that commitment, just as the majority leader and I \nhave attempted to work in good faith to live up to ours.\n  The reference, I might point out, to the Senator from Texas's \nstalking language is section 1069 of the defense authorization \nconference report. The page in the Congressional Record, dated July 30, \n1996, was page 9055, in the House section.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that section of the conference report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 1069. PUNISHMENT OF INTERSTATE STALKING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 110A of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 2361 the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 2261A.

Madam President, let me just say that while I did not \nhear all of the discussion this morning, I heard about it. I only say \nthat we are prepared this afternoon to work with the majority leader to \npass the conference report on minimum wage, to pass the conference \nreport on health care, with the understanding that the last-minute, \nnonauthorized addition of a provision dealing with a certain drug \npatent would be removed from the conference report, and to pass the \nconference report on safe drinking water. We would be prepared to do \nthat, along with the CFTC nominations, and the item on the Executive \nCalendar dealing with the nominee for the district judgeship in \nMinnesota.\n  So that is a good deal of work this afternoon. I see that the \nmajority leader is here. We had the opportunity to discuss this matter \nearlier, and I look forward to resolving the matters I have just \nmentioned with him. We are prepared to enter into a colloquy at this \ntime. I yield the floor for that purpose.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I apologize to the minority leader for not \nbeing here. I got waylaid by the Secretary of Defense, who is anxious \nabout some nominations, particularly the Chief of Naval Operations. I \ntalked\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\nwith him on that and some other matters. As I understand it from our \ndiscussion, we would be prepared to move the nomination of the judge, \nthe CFTC nominees--two of those--and then go to the health insurance \nconference report.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the distinguished majority leader will yield, as I \nunderstand it, our staffs have discussed the matter and the way in \nwhich it would come up. There would be a correcting resolution that \nwould be offered, and we would consider that, and it is my \nunderstanding that we would then hold the bill until the House has \npassed the correcting resolution. But in that time we could take up the \nother legislation as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think there may be a problem with that, but I would like \nto discuss that some more in a moment.\n  After that--after we work through however we are going to handle the \nhealth insurance conference report and get a time agreement, I \npresume--and some Senators want to be heard on that, like Senator \nDomenici and Senator Wellstone, and Senator Specter has an interest \nthere, too--then we would go to the safe drinking water conference \nreport, and small business tax relief, which includes the minimum wage \nconference report.\n  I think we do need to talk further about how to handle the health \ninsurance conference report with regard to the Con. Res.\n  I would like to ask specifically about the military nominations. I \nunderstand there is a lengthy list of generals, colonels, majors, \nwhatever, but most importantly, the Chief of Naval Operations. I \nunderstand there is a real need for that to be filled.\n  Mr. NUNN. And the space command general, also.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. NUNN. I was going to inquire about the nominations. I see the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee on the floor. I know we would \nboth want to inquire about whether we would have the chance to pass the \ndefense authorization conference report, passed by the House last \nevening, which I believe the Senator from South Carolina believes we \ncan pass within an hour, maybe a shorter time than that.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, the House passed the defense \nauthorization bill yesterday in one hour. I think we can pass it here \nin one hour. All I ask is that my colleagues not object to bringing it \nup. This is a matter of deep concern to the whole Nation, to those in \nthe service, and to the defense of our country.\n  We need to take this bill up and pass it. It has a lot of things in \nit that need to be acted upon. We also have some military nominations, \nuniform people. There is no reason in the world to hold them up. These \nare nonpartisan matters. They don't affect anybody personally, but they \naffect the whole Nation. I hope we can get this bill up, pass it \nbriefly, and send it on to the President.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, does the Senator wish to respond on the \npossibility of getting these nominations considered this afternoon?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, Mr. President, I would be happy to respond. We \nwant very much to be able to clear the calendar of all nominations. We \nwould like very much to deal with all of the military nominees and \npromotions. They are nonpolitical. The majority leader has pledged that \nfor the entire month of July he would like to deal with the \nnonpolitical nominations on the judiciary as well. I am sure we can \nwork out an arrangement whereby the military and judiciary--all the \nnonpolitical nominations--can be dealt with. I look forward to working \nwith him and both of you to see that that happens this afternoon.\n  It is also my hope that we can deal with a number of conference \nreports. Our desire is to try to accelerate these considerations. An \nhour would work very fine with us. If we can work out an arrangement \nwhere that can be done, I look forward to taking that up today.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Since defense is a nonpartisan matter, and Senator \nNunn, the ranking member of the committee, favors going ahead, and I as \nchairman favor going ahead, and it is purely nonpartisan--that is the \nway we handle defense, and that is the way it should be handled--why \nnot take it up and pass it? We can get through with it in an hour.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I agree.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Do you object to bringing it up? Don't put it in the \ncategory of other things. Keep defense as a nonpartisan matter. That is \nwhat we are trying to assure that ought to be done.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is right. We want to keep it nonpartisan.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Everything is not nonpartisan. This affects the whole \nNation. This affects the defense of this country.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand, and the chairman knows that better than \nanyone does. He has worked admirably to get to the point where \nconsideration of the conference report could be taken up this afternoon \nin a nonpartisan way. Both the ranking member and the chairman have \ndone an excellent job. But I must say we have worked together all month \nlong on a whole range of bills. A lot of what we have done this month \nhe has cooperated on. We have cooperated in a nonpartisan way in \ngetting the defense bill to this point.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Please do not put defense in the group of these other \nthings. This is nonpartisan. This is for the good of the whole Nation. \nEverybody feels defense is nonpartisan. Why not bring it up now? We \ncould pass it in 1 hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, if the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee will allow me, we will continue to work on that. I am very \nmuch committed to getting the defense authorization conference report \nconsidered. It should be done. I want to have it done. I cannot allow \nit to be tied to political judges.\n  I cannot help but smile when my distinguished colleague and good \nfriend, the minority leader, refers to judges as nonpolitical. Give me \na break. But we have worked together through thick and thin for the \nlast month. We will keep doing that.\n  So let me try this for now. Perhaps we could go ahead and do the \njudge, the CFTC, and go ahead and go to the safe drinking water \nconference report, because everybody is for that. We can get started. \nAnd we will talk about these other two during that time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9483-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9484-S9485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, I will control the time on our side.\n  I ask the Chair that I be notified when I have used 8 minutes of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair will notify the \nSenator when 8 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues in \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee in bringing the conference \nreport of the Safe Drinking Water Act before the Senate. The committee \nhas been working on this since 1993, and our efforts have received \nbroad, bipartisan support at every step. I particularly pay tribute to \nthe ranking member of this committee, who was the chairman of it during \nthe prior 2 years, the senior Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus. He \nhas done an excellent job and has been a real stalwart in achieving \nreforms to the Safe Drinking Water Act. What we have before us is, to a \nconsiderable extent, based upon the fine work he did while he was \nchairman and the committee was under his guidance.\n  We all agree reform of the Safe Drinking Water Act is necessary. \nPublic health has been strengthened, there is no question, over the \nstandards that have been issued over the past several years. But these \nnew standards and new treatment have put a strain on the water \nsuppliers. This bill includes many provisions to ease that burden.\n  What is in the bill? There is a drinking water revolving loan fund \nthat the President first recommended. In addition to all that, the \nStates are authorized to reduce monitoring costs by developing their \nown testing requirements. The States may grant variances to small \nsystems that cannot afford to comply with the national standard. We are \nnot rolling back any health protection that is now provided. No \nexisting standard will be weakened.\n  In addition to the SRF grants, there are new programs to prevent \npollution at the source. This program lets the cities and towns go to \nthe headwaters and see if they cannot clean up the pollution there, \nrather than permitting the pollution to come down the river and then \nthe city has to invest in a very, very expensive water purification \nplant. All of that makes sense.\n  The bill pushes hard for more and better science, including research \nprograms to determine whether some groups, like children or pregnant \nwomen or people with particular illnesses, are likely to experience \nadverse affects from drinking water contaminants.\n  Before describing the major provisions in detail, I wish to thank our \ncolleagues for the hard work they have done. Particularly, I thank \nSenator Kempthorne, who was chairman of the subcommittee that dealt \nwith this bill. Senator Kempthorne, over many months with great \npatience and superb knowledge of this bill, brought forward this \nlegislation which we now have before us, in essence. His efforts in \nbehalf of State and local governments and others is widely recognized. \nThe trust that Senator Kempthorne had built up with local officials \nwas, I believe, essential in achieving the compromise that is always \nnecessary when you sign a bill into law.\n  Senator Reid, the ranking member of that subcommittee, was a partner \nin that effort and did excellent work. I mentioned the fine work that \nSenator Baucus has done, and Senator Warner, likewise, and others.\n  I also want to thank the House leadership that we worked with, \nChairman Bliley and Congressman Dingell and Waxman and others who are, \nobviously, members of the conference committee.\n  We had help from the office of water at the EPA, including Bob \nPerciasepe, who heads the drinking water office.\n  Mr. President, if somebody were to ask what is the one thing we can \ndo that will most improve the safety of drinking water in the United \nStates, I think the answer would be help the small systems. There are \n54,000 small drinking water systems in the United States, in trailer \nparks, in villages, in small communities. There are thousands of these \nsystems that are operated by very small towns. Many of these very small \nsystems do not have,\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nobviously, the technical or financial resources to consistently provide \nsafe drinking water. They cannot keep up with the testing and \nmonitoring and determining which contaminants are and which are not so \ndangerous over a short period of time. The operators have little or no \ntraining.\n\n  These small systems have been overwhelmed by the regulations imposed \nby the existing Safe Drinking Water Act, so the conference report that \nwe are bringing before us now, and passing, hopefully, in a short time, \naddresses the problems of these small systems. How? First, as I \nmentioned, a grant program, a State revolving loan fund starting off at \n$725 million, that is for 1 year, provides Federal assistance to build \ntreatment plants, if that is what is required in these communities. \nThis system was proposed in 1993 by President Clinton. As I say, we \nauthorize it for $1 billion, hopefully with an appropriation this year \nof $725 million.\n  That is the first big thing. The second is that each State adopts \nwhat they call a capacity development strategy, to help these small \nsystems. A State strategy might include what the State decides when \nthey ask, what can we do to help each of these small communities? It is \nnot always necessarily money for investment. Sometimes it is money for \ntraining the operators in these small communities, or technical \nassistance on how do you develop a new safer water supply. It may be \nthe ground water in the present area is contaminated but there may be \nother sources, deep wells or whatever it might be, that could produce \nnew and safer water. So we are relying on the States to take the lead \nin designing this capacity enhancement strategy.\n  What are some of the other things that can be done under this bill? \nThe States are authorized to grant variances to small systems that \ncannot comply with the stiff requirements you impose on the big cities \nwhere they can afford it. A portion of the SRF funds may be set aside \nfor technical assistance, as I mentioned before, the cost of training \noperators. And the States may reduce the monitoring requirements. There \nis no point in testing constantly for a substance that never occurs in \na certain section of the country. Why make the small systems constantly \ngo through that monitoring for a contaminant that is not found in that \nsection of the nation, as I mentioned before?\n  When we brought this bill before the Senate it passed 99 to nothing. \nThe House, in many provisions, included our language word for word, for \nexample, in the standard setting. The standard setting is based upon \nscience and technology that I believe makes much more sense than the \nexisting situation. For some contaminants, this approach to standard \nsetting can impose large costs nationwide while producing only small \ngains. So we believe the science approach that we provided will reduce \nthose large investments that have to be made.\n  So, I believe we have here an excellent piece of legislation. Again, \nI congratulate my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Rhode \nIsland his 8 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Chair for notifying me. We will hear from \nother Members of our side who will have an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jan \nHarrington and Mike Burton, both fellows in Senator Bob Kerrey's \noffice, be granted the privilege of the floor during the consideration \nof the conference report on this subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I, like my good friend and chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, strongly support the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of 1996.\n  We all know that the Safe Drinking Water Act needs to be reformed. We \nhave heard all kinds of stories. They are largely true. We have had \nproblems in many of our cities, our large cities. We heard about \nMilwaukee, Washington, DC, and the cryptosporidium problems, as well as \nsome problems in small communities.\n  It is basic, it is fundamental: Americans should be able to drink \ntheir water and rest assured that the water they drink is safe, that \nthey will not get sick, whether they are in the comfort of their own \nhome or whether they are visiting the Nation's Capital or wherever they \nmight be in our country.\n  The current version of the Safe Drinking Water Act, is helpful in \nthis direction, but, in many respects, it produces more paperwork than \nit does progress. It is my belief that this conference report helps \nchange that.\n  What does it do? First, it reforms the regulatory process. This is \nvery important. It makes it much more streamlined, and reduces redtape. \nIt cuts monitoring costs. This is extremely important. The monitoring \ncosts for some contaminants are extremely high, and Americans would be \namazed at how expensive it is.\n  The bill also creates a new revolving loan fund so communities will \nhave the resources to get the technology they need. It also requires \nwater systems to give the people they serve more information about the \nquality of the drinking water the system provides. Consumers will have \nmore notice and more information. And the bill addresses operator \ntraining. It is important to have operators who know what they are \ndoing.\n  Overall, it cuts redtape and, at the same time, increases the \nprotection of public health.\n  Senator Chafee has described some measures in detail. I agree with \nhis assessment. I think this bill is a solid compromise. In praising \nit, I would like to emphasize two points.\n  First, as has been stated, this bill is especially important to rural \nStates, to small communities. In my State of Montana, we have over 900 \nseparate drinking water systems. Almost all of them serve fewer than \n10,000 people.\n  Some of the systems serve trailer parks and remote clusters of homes. \nThey are operated part-time by folks who are just trying to be good \nneighbors. They are very small systems.\n  The current version of the law requires small drinking water systems \nto install the same treatment technology as large urban water systems \nthat serve hundreds of thousands of people. In some cases, this doesn't \nmake sense. Small systems do not benefit from what economists call \n``economies of scale.'' That is, they cannot spread their costs among a \nlarge number of ratepayers. The same high cost of technology has to be \nspread among fewer ratepayers, resulting in a much higher cost to the \nratepayers.\n  If we force smaller systems to use big-city technology, not only can \nthey not afford the cost, but they will go under. What will that mean? \nThat means people in the area have to revert to using unhealthy well \nwater, not water which is treated, but well water which is untreated.\n  This point was hammered home to me by the head of the Montana Rural \nWater Association, Dan Keil. I will never forget meeting with Dan about \n6 years ago. He told me about legitimate problems with the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. We were in the Heritage Motel in Great Falls, MT. \nHe made a very deep impression upon me.\n  I know Dan Keil is very happy today, now that the Senate is finally, \n6 or 7 years later, dealing with the problem that needed to be \naddressed. At that time, he explained to me how impractical some of the \npresent requirements are. I looked into it, and I agreed with him, they \nare impractical.\n  We are now dealing, I think, with most of those problems. One of the \nmost important issues is the variance provision in this conference \nreport. Here is how it works.\n  If a system has 10,000 people or fewer, they may request a variance \nto install special small-system technology identified by EPA. That is \nimportant. That means that a small system that cannot afford to comply \nwith current regulations through conventional treatment can instead \ncomply by installing affordable small-system technology.\n\n  The States review the variance to ensure the technology adequately \nprotects the public health. In those cases where the system serves \nbetween 3,300 people and 10,000 people, the variance must be approved \nby the EPA. That is going to help. It is going to help address the twin \nobjectives of protecting public health and using cost-efficient \ntechnology.\n  Second, over the last few years, there has been a lot of talk about \nreforming\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nour environmental laws. No doubt about it, although our laws are quite \ngood--they help make the water in our country cleaner and more pure and \nthe air we breathe more healthy--they need some reform. They are a bit \noutdated.\n  One noteworthy provision in this bill is transferability. What does \nthat mean? Essentially, the provision allows a State to transfer \ndollars from the revolving loan fund in the Clean Water Act to the new \nrevolving loan fund in the Safe Drinking Water Act. A State can loan \nthe funds to a community that can use those dollars to pay for \ntechnology that it needs to address some of the problems in the \ndrinking water.\n  A State can do the opposite, too. They can transfer from the Safe \nDrinking Water Act loan fund to the Clean Water Act loan fund. This \nprovides more flexibility to allow a State to meet its needs, or a \ncommunity to meet its needs. Washington, DC, is not passing something \non to the States that has been described in the past as a one size fits \nall, view, but rather giving a lot more flexibility to States. This is \nextremely important.\n  Another innovative provision is radon. Radon has been a vexing \nproblem because, the proposed radon standard for water is tighter than \nthe amount of radon that occurs in outdoor air.\n  Radon affects people in their homes. We have basically come up with a \nmultimedia. It allows States to set a lower standard for radon in \ndrinking water only if the State has an alternative indoor air program \nthat achieves just as much public health protection as the drinking \nwater standard would achieve.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, no legislation is perfect. This one is \nnot perfect. It contains some flaws. It has a series of special \nprojects, commonly known as pork, which will draw resources away from \nthe new drinking water loan fund. I think those projects should not be \nin the bill, but we could not get the bill passed, incredibly, without \nsome of them.\n  But it is a good bill nevertheless. We have made some progress. It is \ngoing to help move the ball forward.\n  In closing, I want to acknowledge the leadership of the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Chafee. I must say that all of us who have \nworked with the chairman of our committee are very impressed with him. \nHe is basically a down-to-Earth, commonsense fellow. He calls them as \nhe sees them. He is very generous with his time, very generous with his \ncompliments and very generous with the people he is working with. In \naddition, he keeps his eye on the ball; that is, moving the \nenvironmental ball forward in a commonsense way.\n  It has been kind of tough the last couple of years. We have not \npassed environmental legislation that is solid, commonsense and \nbalanced. Senator Chafee has done a good job to help advance this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to acknowledge the excellent work of the staff, \nparticularly Jimmie Powell. I don't know anybody who knows this issue \nbetter than Jimmie, with the possible exception of my two staff, Jo-\nEllen Darcy and Mike Evans, who know it just as well. They have been \njust terrific.\n  I am particularly appreciative of Jo-Ellen. When they were trying to \nwrap this bill up 2 or 3 days ago and they wanted to quit, Jo-Ellen \nsaid they were not going to leave until they wrapped it up that night. \nThey didn't leave, and they wrapped it up. That is a testament to Jo-\nEllen's hard work.\n  I pay particular thanks to Senator Kempthorne, chairman of the \nsubcommittee. Senator Kempthorne, like Senator Chafee, is a commonsense \nfellow. Maybe that is because he is from a Western State like Montana. \nAlso, Senator Reid from Nevada. He is not out there to try to harm \nanybody, does not have a political ax to grind. He is trying to get the \njob done in a very balanced way.\n\n  I see Senator Boxer on the floor. There is nobody more tenacious and \nhard working and a greater champion for environmental causes. And in \nthe case, she was particularly strong on the right-to-know provision, \nwhich was her brainchild. I know that Senator Boxer is very pleased we \nincluded that provision in the conference report.\n  People worked hard on this. I am very grateful for the time and \neffort they put into it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Montana for his very generous comments about the work I have done \nand others and our staff. And I want to join him in his salute to Jo-\nEllen Darcy and Mike Evans and the others on his staff who really were \ntremendous.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the person who took this on, mastered it, pushed it \nforward. And the bill we have before us is really, to a great extent, \nthe bill that Senator Kempthorne brought from his committee that passed \nin this Senate 99 to 0. So if kudos are deserved around here, they are \ndeserved by Senator Kempthorne.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much.\n  May I say how much I appreciate those remarks by the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee.\n  To paraphrase Samuel Taylor Cole- ridge: Water, water, everywhere, \nand with the passage of this Safe Drinking Water Act conference report, \nwe'll be able to drink every drop.\n  Just over 9 months ago, in a unanimous, bipartisan vote of 99 to 0, \nwe passed the bill that I introduced along with Senators Chafee, \nBaucus, and Reid to reauthorize the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  I will say right here that without that sort of partnership with \nthose Senators, we would not be here today. Our bill improved public \nhealth, gave States and local governments the flexibility that they \nneed to target their scarce resources on on high priority health risks, \nand laid the foundation for a safe and affordable drinking water supply \ninto the 21st century.\n  Following the efforts of the Senate, the House of Representatives \nlast month passed their safe drinking water bill, passed largely on the \nwork that was accomplished here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Today we have the opportunity to complete the process and approve the \nconference report on the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. \nOur job today is a significant one because, surely, there is nothing \nmore important than the health of our families and friends, and in \nlarge measure, that is exactly what is riding on this legislation. When \nyou think about it, drinking water is really the only product or \nservice that communities provide that directly affects the health and \nwell-being of every person every day. Unfortunately, the current law \noften makes it unnecessarily difficult and costly for many communities \nto provide safe and affordable drinking water.\n  During the negotiations on the Unfunded Mandates Act, I met with \nexecutive committee members of the National Governors' Association to \ndiscuss our strategy for passage of that bill. Those Governors told me \nthat after passage of the unfunded mandates legislation, their priority \nwould then turn to fixing the current Safe Drinking Water Act. And so \nwe moved and made that our No. 1 priority after passage of the Unfunded \nMandates Act.\n  I began the process determining that we should have three goals. We \nneeded to write a law that first and foremost would protect and improve \npublic health, and second, we wanted to write a law that would work, \none that would put substance and content over bureaucracy for \nbureaucracy's sake, and, finally, we needed to write a law that would \nreduce Federal unfunded mandates.\n  The bill that we are voting on today achieves those three goals. It \nwas written with the advice of many public health experts, State and \nlocal government officials, and water providers. And I listened to what \nthey had to say. So this bill reflects their concerns and their \nrecommendations as to how to improve the way the drinking water is \nregulated.\n  When I began working on this legislation, I determined that there \nwere key factors that must be incorporated. First, we must protect \npublic health.\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\n And we did. We eliminated the arbitrary requirement that the \nAdministrator of EPA regulate 25 new contaminants every 3 years. \nInstead, the administrator is given the authority and flexibility to \ntarget her regulatory resources on those contaminants that are actually \npresent in drinking water and that, based on the best available, peer \nreviewed science, are found to pose a real health risk to humans.\n  For the first time, we provided tens of millions of dollars for \nimportant health effects research, including research on the health \neffects on cryptosporidium, arsenic, and disinfectants, and their \npotential effect on other sensitive subpopulations, like children, \npregnant women, and the elderly.\n  I said we would give States and local governments greater flexibility \nto tailor Federal requirements to maximize their resources and meet \ntheir specific needs. And we did.\n  The bill also gives States the sole authority to design and implement \ncapacity development strategies to ensure that drinking water systems \nhave the financial, technical and managerial resources they need to \ncomply with this law. Under the old regulatory approach, we would have \nrequired States to adopt a strategy and submit it to EPA for review and \napproval. But we do not do that here. Once a State adopts a capacity \ndevelopment strategy, EPA has no authority under this law to second-\nguess it or penalize the State by withholding Federal funds.\n  The bill also recognizes that in many cases it is easier and more \ncost-effective to prevent contaminants from getting into source water \nfor a drinking water system, rather than to try to remove them by \nregulation after they are in the system. This bill encourages States to \ndevelop source water protection partnerships between community water \nsystems and upstream stakeholders to anticipate and solve source water \nproblems before they occur. These are voluntary, incentive-based \npartnerships.\n\n  Our experience in my home State of Idaho has repeatedly demonstrated \nthese kinds of programs work, and work well. Locally driven solutions \nthat stakeholders themselves develop in a nonregulatory, nonadversarial \nsetting usually achieve a far greater level of protection than could \notherwise be gained through mandatory restrictions on land use or other \nFederal regulations. I fully expect that these voluntary source water \npartnership programs will quickly become a valuable tool for States and \nlocal government to improve public health, target local risks, and \nmaximize resources.\n  I said that we would make this law work for small and rural systems. \nAnd we did.\n  We allow States to modify expensive monitoring requirements for small \nsystems so that they do not have to spend their very limited resources \ntesting for contaminants that are not detected in their drinking water. \nIn many communities in Idaho, this new flexibility alone could save \nsystems hundreds of thousands of dollars every year.\n  I said that we would reduce unfunded mandates. And we did.\n  First of all, our bill reduces the number of mandates that are \nimposed on States and local governments under the current law. Then, \nsignificantly, we commit substantial Federal resources to assure that \nthe Nation's drinking water supply is safe.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed our bill as is now \nrequired under the Unfunded Mandates Act, and just yesterday confirmed \nthat this legislation does not impose unfunded mandates. It stated, \n``the bill would change the Federal drinking water program in ways that \nwould lower the costs to public water systems of complying with \nexisting and future requirements. On balance, CBO estimates that the \nbill would likely result in significant net savings to State and local \ngovernments.''\n  Mr. President, in summary, I just say, for the first time ever, we \nare providing the funds to the States and communities so that they can \ndeal effectively with their water systems. For the first time ever, we \nare providing for source water protection. For the first time ever, we \nare prioritizing those areas that truly are contaminants, and going \nafter those.\n  But I particularly want to thank my colleagues, Senator Chafee, who \nis the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, for his \nleadership and efforts on this bill, combined with those of Senator Max \nBaucus of Montana, who was the chairman in the previous Congress, and \nSenator Harry Reid, who is the ranking member on the Senate \nsubcommittee we serve on. Again, without that sort of partnership, \nbipartisan partnership, we would not be here. I also want to \nacknowledge Senator Bob Kerrey who is one of first ones that really \ncame forward and said, let us make this work. And it did work.\n  I also want to thank majority leader Trent Lott for the help and \nencouragement he provided during the conference to help get this bill \ncompleted.\n  I would like to thank my staff for their hard work and dedication to \nthe cause. To Buzz Fawcett and to Ann Klee. They are truly dedicated \nand extremely talented individuals. I want to thank Jimmie Powell from \nSenator Chafee's staff. Jimmie's dedication to the Safe Drinking Water \nAct and his knowledge of the law and the facts made him invaluable to \nthe process. Every State, city, and rural water district in America can \nsay thank you.\n  I would like to thank Jo-Ellen Darcy and Mike Evans and Ann Loomis \nand Scott Slesinger, Mike Smith, Gregory Daines, and Stephanie Daigle, \nSteve Shimberg, and Tom Sliter.\n  The Senate conferees remained united throughout the conference. And \nit was due to the uncommon abilities and the good humor of all the \npeople that I have just named that it was successful.\n  Finally, I would like to thank, on a personal note, my wife Patricia \nand my children Heather and Jeff who know about the sacrifice that goes \ninto these sorts of efforts: The long hours that keep you from being \nhome, as you try to make something positive happen. It is the families \nthat I think really offer the sacrifice. But in this case I believe it \nis worth it, because for all the kids of this country, it is safer \ndrinking water. We have done our job. We stepped up to the challenge \nand we accomplished it.\n\n  Again, I thank the chairman and the ranking member. I thank all \nMembers of this Senate--99 to 0--for the tremendous bipartisan support. \nThis Congress is on record. We have positive environmental legislation \nthat is good public health and good for this blessed environment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I yield now several minutes to the Senator \nfrom Virginia who is the second ranking member on the committee. He has \nworked very hard on this bill, and he is unable to be here long, so I \nask that he might proceed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I compliment the managers of this bill and the chairman \nof the subcommittee. Through their effective leadership in guiding this \nconference, we are able to return to the Senate an exemplary bill. I \nwas happy to be a part of the conference.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill favorably addresses the \nneeds of small systems and establishes a new pollution prevention \napproach under the source water partnership program.\n  Mr. President, this conference report clearly demonstrates that we \ncan produce legislation that strengthens our protection of public \nhealth, provides relief from excessive Federal regulations and offers \nmore streamlined requirements for local drinking water systems to \ncomply with the law.\n  Our foremost priority has always been to give consumers confidence \nthat the water that comes from the tap is safe to drink. This bill \nfulfills that priority.\n  The cornerstone of this bill is the establishment of the State \nRevolving Loan program. Funds will be provided to States to make either \nloans or grants to assist communities with the construction of \ntreatment facilities necessary to meet the Federal standards. These \nfunds are critically needed by our small systems who often don't have a \nlarge rate base to support the construction of new treatment plants.\n  Also during our conference discussions, much attention was focused on \nthe need to require local drinking water systems to provide all of \ntheir customers with Consumer Confidence Reports. These reports are to \ninform customers of the content of their drinking water. It needs to be \nmade clear that the Senate bill mandated that water systems immediately \nnotify, within 24 hours, their customers whenever a contaminant exceeds \na Federal health based standard. This is a\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\nsignificant improvement from current law.\n  I did have concerns about proposals during the Senate debate to \nexpand this requirement on our drinking water systems. I did not want \nthis reporting to unduly alarm our citizens about the presence of \ncontaminants in drinking water. The conference report includes a \nprovision on Consumer Confidence Reports, which I strongly support \nbecause it addresses my previous concerns in several ways. Most \nimportantly, it requires the reports to include a plainly worded \nexplanation of the contaminants that are found and of the health risks \nthat may result from violating the Federal standard.\n  It is important to make the distinction that detecting a chemical in \ndrinking water, many which occur naturally at very low levels, is much \ndifferent than violating a Federal standard. Federal standards are set \nat exposure levels which EPA determines are safe and will not adversely \naffect public health. The modification in the conference report ensures \nthat the public will be fully informed about the meaning of data and \nsampling collected by a local water system.\n  The conference report also ensures that the local water systems have \nthe trained personnel necessary to effectively run a treatment plant. \nVirginia already requires an effective operator certification program \nand the report requires all States to implement a training program for \nwater system operators. I support fully this provision because with \nrelief from the current monitoring requirements, we must be sure that \ntreatment plants are operated in a sound an efficient manner and that \npersonnel have the expertise to respond to unforeseen problems.\n  Throughout the committee's deliberations on revising the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, over the past 4 years, we have learned that small \nsystems are especially burdened by the current regulatory program. \nSmall systems, those serving less than 10,000 persons, represent over \n80 percent of the public water systems in this country. Monitoring \nrequirements, often the most expensive activity undertaken by water \nsystems, installation of treatment technologies, and funding \nconstraints have all overburdened our small systems and their capacity \nto meet the stringent requirements of the current law.\n  The Congress has responded to these calls for help and this bill \nholds great promise for assisting small systems. The revolving loan \nfund, alternative technologies that are affordable, monitoring relief \nand ensuring that operators are qualified to run treatment plans will \ngreatly enable our small water systems to deliver drinking water that \nis safe for our citizens.\n\n  Mr. President, the Source Water Protection Partnership Program is a \nnew step in pollution prevention. Having worked on this approach for \nseveral years, I am pleased that the conference contains the Senate \nprovision. With a modest investment of funds, source water partnerships \nwill prevent problems before they occur. The positive result will be \nthat water quality is improved and communities are relieved from \nbuilding expensive treatment systems.\n  A great deal of work went into the development of this approach and I \nmust commend the agricultural community for their cooperative working \nrelationship over the years. Our citizens involved in agriculture today \nare responsible stewards of our land and water. They want to be \ninvolved in a voluntary, solution based approach to these problems. I \nknow from the great progress we have made under the Chesapeake Bay \nprogram that this approach can be extremely effective on a national \nlevel.\n  Another issue of great concern to me has been the water quality \nproblems of the Washington Aqueduct and the District of Columbia's \nwater distribution system.\n  Since the Environmental Protection Agency's boil-water order in \nDecember 1993, I have been working to resolve the long-term financial \nconstraints of the system. Owned by the Federal Government, the \nWashington Aqueduct provides essentially a local service--municipal \nwater supply--to the District of Columbia and the Virginia \njurisdictions of Arlington and Falls Church.\n  Currently, the system's capital improvements are financed on a pay-\nas-you-go basis where the customers must pay up front the full cost of \nany construction project.\n  While user fees are collected for the District of Columbia's Water \nand Sewer Enterprise Fund, these resources finance the system's annual \noperating costs and cannot begin to meet the obligations of the \nsystem's extensive capital improvement needs.\n  The Conference Report provides for a reasonable approach to this \nproblem by providing authority for the Corps to borrow funds from the \nTreasury for the next three years. These funds will be used to continue \nthe improvements of the system as required by the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Within this 3 year period, the Corps and the \ncustomers are to work together to determine a final resolution of the \nownership of the Aqueduct. The Corps is authorized to transfer the \nAqueduct to a new or existing entity with the approval of a majority of \nthe customers. I would have preferred that all the customers agree to \nthe transfer, but that was not the view of my House colleagues. It is \nmy very strong hope that the Corps and the customers will make every \neffort to reach consensus on this matter before the borrowing period \nexpires.\n\n  It is critical that we resolve this matter because if no solution is \nreached at the end of 3 years then we return to the status quo. That is \ncontinued Corps ownership with no ability to provide long-term \nfinancing of the necessary improvements. This would be tragic for our \nrate payers who would suffer from extreme rate spikes to finance the \nremaining work on the Aqueduct.\n  Mr. President, I know that my colleagues expect this matter to be \nresolved within the next few years and I pledge to remain actively \ninvolved in this effort to see that there is a successful conclusion.\n  In closing, no legislation of this magnitude and in this short time \nframe can be completed without talented and dedicated professionals. I \nwant to recognize and thank the staff of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, Jimmie Powell, Jo-Ellen Darcy, and Mike Evans, and the \nstaff for Senator Kempthorne, Ann Klee and W.H. Fawcett.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Madam President, I take this moment to pay particular \ntribute to the Senator from Virginia for the work he did in connection \nwith providing funding for the city of Washington aqueduct. It \nsupplies, obviously, all the residents of Washington plus some \nresidents of northern Virginia. But for the attention and diligence of \nthe Senator from Virginia in connection with this matter, we would not \nhave dealt with it in the fashion we did.\n  I believe, as a result of the efforts of Senator Warner, the problems \nof the Washington water supply system will be solved in the not too \ndistant future. I pay tribute to what the Senator has done.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished chairman for his kind remarks \nand also his strong cooperation, together with the ranking member, in \nmaking possible the inclusion of this provision in this important piece \nof legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I know no one who fights harder for the environment, who is more \ntenacious with a greater bulldog tenacity than the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  That is meant as very high praise from me.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Being a bulldog is not necessarily the kind of pet \nyou want around the house, but it is not bad when it comes to a battle.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my satisfaction with the conference \nreport and hope that our colleagues will support it. The final bill \nwill enhance both the quality of our drinking water and America's \nconfidence in its safety.\n  Americans are concerned about the quality of their drinking water. \nThe sale of bottled water and water filters is skyrocketing. Fewer \npeople believe that the water out of their taps is clean and safe. \nTheir fears are not illusionary. Look at Milwaukee or Philadelphia. \nWashington, the Nation's Capital has repeatedly had to tell residents \nto boil their water.\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\n  Something had to be done. I believe the bill we crafted will enhance \nboth quality and confidence.\n  This was not an easy conference, as I am sure my colleagues will \nagree. Both bills resulted, from a set of delicate compromises, the \nHouse bill and the Senate bill. Any changes could raise significant \nopposition. I am happy the conferees were able to hammer out a draft \nwhich I believe is superior to either of the individual versions of the \nSenate or the House.\n  I will elaborate on a few of the provisions. Unlike the Senate bill, \nthe House version would have weakened the rights of citizens to sue for \nviolations of the water standard, even when the suits were needed to \nensure public safety. The House bill also failed to give States the \nflexibility to transfer money from the sewage treatment loan revolving \nfund to the drinking water fund and vice versa. This could delay high \npriority projects and would prove to be wasteful. I am glad the Senate \nversion prevailed on that issue, protecting the rights of the citizens \nand giving flexibility to the States.\n  At the same time, there is much in the House bill that is, in my \nview, superior to the Senate version. For example, I fully support the \nBoxer right-to-know amendment. As the author of a similar law that \nprovides information about toxic releases, I think this kind of \nlegislation is critical. Unfortunately, the amendment was not approved \nby the Senate, but the conference agreement includes provisions for a \nright-to-know law.\n  Mr. President, letting people know what is in their water supply is \nnot just common sense, it is common decency. The right-to-know \nprovision provides consumers with information on contaminants that have \nbeen detected in their water, even if the levels do not violate EPA or \nState standards. Since all water includes some contaminants, the \nconference language also provides for information on the specific \nimpact of those contaminants.\n  I am disappointed, however, that these provisions fail to provide \nsimilar requirements for bottled water. Many consumers buy bottled \nwater because they think it is cleaner than tap water. They have a \nright to know if that is true, and which pollutants, if any, remain in \nthe bottles.\n  Several years ago, Mr. President, the FDA published regulations to \nrequire the bottled water industry to regularly monitor its products \nfor contaminants. The industry fought these provisions and the FDA \nrelented. That concerned me. A study by the State of Kansas showed 15 \npercent of the bottled water tested had cancer-causing contaminants at \nhigher levels than allowed by EPA.\n  I am disappointed the conference report was watered down in this \narea. At least it does provide for a Federal Food and Drug \nAdministration study on the feasibility of such a requirement. I expect \nthe FDA will find it feasible to require the bottled water industry to \nprovide the same information which we are requiring of suppliers of tap \nwater to communities of 500 or above. After all, if that provision is \nnot too burdensome for public water providers, it cannot be too \nburdensome for the bottled water industry.\n  However, if the FDA does not appreciate the importance of providing \nthis information to the public, I will not hesitate to bring up \nlegislation to bring bottled water under the authority of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.\n  I also urge consumer groups to conduct tests on some bottled water \nsold in their areas and to prepare consumer confidence reports for the \ngeneral public. This, at least, will educate consumers until proper \nprovisions and safeguards are in place.\n  In addition to water quality, the controversial part of the \nlegislation dealt with radon. I am pleased the conference came out with \na provision that will help lower the risk from radon exposure to a \ngreater degree than either the House or the Senate bill would have. Mr. \nPresident, radon is a naturally occurring radioactive contaminant that \ncauses lung cancer by inhalation.\n  In New Jersey, radon exposure is believed to cause more lung cancer, \nmore than any other environmental cause. That is why I sponsored the \nIndoor Radon Abatement Act in 1988. The conference report builds on \nthat act by allowing States to implement programs that will decrease \nradon in the air, as an alternative to meeting the standard for radon \nin drinking water. A State can choose this option only if the proposed \nindoor air program provides greater public health benefits in complying \nwith the drinking water standard. Since radon is dangerous only when \ninhaled, this measure would significantly enhance efforts to reduce \nthis deadly contaminant.\n  Last, Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, \nthe chairman of the Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife \nSubcommittee, Senator Kempthorne, the ranking Democrat, Senator Baucus, \nin the committee and Senator Reid in the subcommittee. I also want to \nexpress my thanks to the staff for their hard work, Jimmy Powell, Jo-\nEllen Darcy, Michael Evans from the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, and W.H. Fawcett, representing Senator Kempthorne.\n  In particular, I congratulate my staff person, Scott Slesinger, for \nhis hard and diligent work. He made it possible for me to stay totally \ninformed as to what was going on and to make sure that our views were \nincluded in any of the comments that we finally sought. Without his \ntime and effort, this would have been a much more difficult assignment \nfor me. I am happy we have the bill we have.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield the distinguished Senator from Wyoming 4 minutes. \nI want to say the Senator comes from a State with lots of small \ncommunities with small waterworks and he has been particularly vigilant \nin seeing that those small communities were protected not only in \nsafety but also in the training of their operators who paid a lot of \nthe attention to the requirements of small communities. Senator Thomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I rise in strong support of the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments of 1996. We all travel through our States extensively, and \nthe topic of unnecessary regulation in the environmental areas comes up \nas often as any other topic when I hold meetings in Wyoming. Wyoming \nfolks are tired of the top-down approach mandating expensive \nregulations for questionable benefits.\n  This bill says we can do a better job of protecting public health, \nand at the same time, inject common sense into the process. This bill \nhelps State and local communities meet Federal standards by creating a \nFederal grant program to capitalize State revolving loan funds for \ndrinking water treatment.\n  The mandate that 25 new contaminants are regulated every 3 years, \nwhether at risk of human health or not is repealed. Finally, EPA will \nbe able to prioritize efforts and cost benefits are inserted into the \nprocess. The State role is increased. Systems will be able to focus \ntheir monitoring efforts on those contaminants that actually occur in \nthe systems.\n  Most importantly for my State, small communities will finally be \ngiven special consideration and assistance under the bill. States can \ngrant variances for systems that serve people under 3,300. That is 90 \npercent of the water systems in Wyoming. With EPA approval that number \ngoes up to 10,000. Small systems qualify for monitoring relief.\n  There are a few groups that will, once again, find an excuse to \noppose this legislation, just as they did when it passed the Senate 99 \nto 0. I agree with them, this bill is not perfect. For instance, I am \nskeptical of the so-called consumer confidence report. These reports \nwill not build confidence, in my judgment. They will simply create \nconfusion. They will simply create confusion. I call them consumer \nconfusion reports, at a cost of about $20 million per year. CBO says \nthat, on balance, this bill will save local water systems in State and \nlocal governments millions of dollars. That is good news to the \ntaxpayers.\n\n  This bill includes several provisions to ensure that Wyoming, the \nonly nonprimacy State, can take full advantage of the benefits of this \nbill. It makes sense, it furthers the protection of human health and \nenjoys widespread bipartisan support. S. 1316 is a bill the President \ncan support, he should support it without reservation, and we should \nget it on his desk quickly.\n  Mr. President, this is truly historic legislation and I was pleased \nto have\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\nthe opportunity to play a part in its development as a member of the \nSenate Committee on Environment and Public Works as well as the \nconference committee that crafted the compromise legislation before us \ntoday.\n  This legislation is historic for both what it does, and what it does \nnot do. What this bill does is trust folks in the states and local \ncommunities to protect their citizens, increases flexibility to meet \nstandards, injects common sense into the regulatory process, allows the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to set priorities and focus limited \nresources on the biggest health threats, and finally recognizes that \nsmall communities in Wyoming face unique challenges and need different \nstrategies to meet standards than New York City does. What this bill \ndoes not do is impose expensive unfunded mandates on localities, rely \non the Washington knows best command and control method of regulation \nor blindly force regulation for regulation sake without addressing the \ncosts and benefits. This is a massive shift in the way we approach \nenvironmental regulation that allows us to increase environmental \nprotection while reducing unnecessary costs to the regulated community, \nand I hope it becomes a model for other statutes that desperately need \nreform.\n  I am particularly pleased with the approach this bill takes in \nhelping small public water systems comply with the standards set by the \nSafe Drinking Water Act. As you know, Mr. President, small communities \nface unique challenges not found in large cities. These small systems, \nby their very nature, don't have the economies of scale found in large \ncities. Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency has always \nset standards and determined affordable technologies based on water \nsystems of 100,000 or more. What may be affordable for a system of this \nsize is obviously prohibitive in Pinedale, WY. There are several \nprovisions in this conference report that will help small systems \naffordably comply with the standards of the Safe Drinking Water Act and \ncontinue to protect the health of their citizens.\n  The vast majority of public water systems serve small cities. In my \nhome State of Wyoming, 90 percent of our public water systems serve \nfewer than 3,300 people. This bill gives States the authority to grant \nvariances from Federal standards for systems serving up to 3,300 \npeople, and for systems serving up to 10,000 people with the approval \nof the Environmental Protection Agency. Small systems are given \nflexibility to meet the new consumer confidence reporting requirements \ncontained in this bill. Under this bill, small systems can receive \nrelief from monitoring requirements that today require them to monitor \nfor contaminants that don't even occur in their water. This bill \nauthorizes $15 million per year to provide technical assistance to \nsmall public water systems and up to $30 million per year to pay the \ncost of mandated operator training for small systems. Finally, this \nbill creates a grant program for at least five university programs to \nsupport research, training and technical assistance with respect to \nproblems experienced by small systems. These small public water systems \ntechnology assistance centers will provide significant assistance to \nState and local governments in the development of programs to address \nspecial concerns relating to the water systems of rural communities and \nnative Americans. These centers will be particularly important to \nstates, like Wyoming, with relatively low population density that cover \nvery large geographic areas. Coordination of research, training, \ntechnical assistance and outreach efforts through these centers will \nplay an important information role for State and local governments. It \nshould be noted, Mr. President, that the Water Resource \nResearch Institutes located at the land grant university in each of the \n50 States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, \nand Guam, can provide similar information on rural water system \ntreatment technologies, development of alternate supplies, and training \nto enable compliance with State and Federal regulations. I hope the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency will better utilize these institutes as \npart of its drinking water programs.\n\n  In addition to the very important accommodations made for small \nsystems in this bill, important changes were made throughout the \ndrinking water program. I am extremely pleased about the increased \nflexibility that the legislation brings to the standard setting process \nunder the act. This legislation, with its emphasis on using the best \navailable scientific methodology for standard setting, facilitates \nefforts to bring more rationality to the process. The EPA has already \nstarted down this road with its risk characterization policy and its \ncarcinogen risk assessment guidelines and I think our approach in this \nlegislation will build on that effort, hopefully leading to the \nreevaluation of the standards for a number of substances. I am also \npleased that States retain ultimate discretion in this bill over the \ncontent of programs that implement a capacity development strategy, and \nthat existing State operator training programs will be allowed to \ncontinue unchanged under this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as with any compromise, this bill is not perfect. This \nbill truly is a compromise, reflecting hours of negotiations between \nRepublicans and Democrats here in the Senate, then days of hard work \nand negotiations between the House and Senate. In order to move forward \nwith this bill, and the significant benefits that go with it, it became \nnecessary to include some provisions that I oppose. For instance, I \nstrongly believe the provision in this bill that requires so-called \nconsumer confidence reports is misguided, will cost local water systems \nfrom $15 to $20 million per year and will not result in consumer \nconfidence, but instead will confuse consumers and destroy their \nconfidence in their local water supply. Fortunately, the Senate was \nable to make clear that these reports should contain language that will \ntell consumers that the presence of trace elements of contaminants are \nin all drinking water, including bottled water, and this does not \ncreate a health hazard. We were also able to increase flexibility for \nsmall systems to meet this mandate.\n  Despite some reservations, I strongly support this bill. We create a \nState revolving loan fund for drinking water infrastructure under this \nbill, to help local communities pay for needed improvements to their \nwater supply. We increase flexibility and reduce costs to local \ncommunities. The Congressional Budget Office says this bill will:\n\n       * * * change the federal drinking water program in ways \n     that would lower the costs to public water systems of \n     complying with existing and future requirements. On balance, \n     CBO estimates that the bill would likely result in \n     significant net savings to state and local governments. \n     Finally, the bill would extend the authorization of certain \n     existing appropriations and would authorize the appropriation \n     of additional federal funds to help state and local \n     governments meet compliance costs.\n\n  Finally, this bill recognizes the unique situation of the State of \nWyoming. Mr. President, Wyoming is the only State which does not have \nprimacy over the Safe Drinking Water Act. Chairman Chafee, Senator \nKempthorne, and Senator Baucus worked with me to ensure that the \ncitizens of Wyoming would be able to take full advantage of the \nbenefits of this legislation, despite the fact we don't have primacy. \nThe State of Wyoming will receive a minimum allocation from the new \nloan fund and will be able to apply for monitoring relief and \nvariances. Most importantly to me, the State of Wyoming will be able to \ncontinue their current operator training and certification program. We \nare very proud of that program, Mr. President, and it is fitting that \nStates continue to be allowed to structure their own programs and not \nbe forced to follow an EPA-directed structure, as the House bill would \nhave required.\n  Mr. President, many people deserve credit for passage of this \nlegislation. I want to thank Senators Chafee, Kempthorne, Baucus, and \nReid for their leadership. This bill would not have been possible \nwithout their hard work, and that of their staffs. Senator Kempthorne \nin particular took some unfair hits over the last few weeks. Well \nfinanced Washington-based environmental extremists attacked Senator \nKempthorne's integrity and questioned his resolve to get this bill \ndone. Mr. President, these attacks were outrageous, designed to prevent \nus from passing this important legislation and to build the coffers of \nthe environmental extremists. There is no excuse\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\nfor this behavior and I want to make it clear that this bill will be \nsigned into law thanks to Senator Kempthorne and despite the \nirresponsible behavior of a few groups who would rather scare the \nAmerican people with distortions than see positive reform to \nenvironmental laws. That's unfortunate, but we overcame their \nobjections to the Senate bill and approved it 99 to 0, and we should do \nthe same today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I add my voice in support of \nthis bill. I want to thank, particularly, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, the ranking member, Senator Baucus, and \nSenators Kempthorne, Reid, and the other members of the committee, who \nworked so hard. And I can say, on behalf of myself and my wonderful \nstaff, Linda Delgado, that working with the staffs of the chairman and \nthe ranking member has just been a joy to us.\n  Of course, I have some very special feelings about passage of this \nbill today, because an amendment that I worked very hard to get through \nthis U.S. Senate, the consumer right to know amendment, has been \nadopted by the conference. The Senator from Wyoming didn't think it was \na particularly good amendment, but I have to say that when one looks at \nwhat we are facing--I pick up this glass of water to drink what may be \nWashington, DC, water--and I think it is important that those of us who \ndrink this water, or tap water from anywhere in this country, know what \ncontaminants are in our drinking water.\n  I am very proud of this particular bill because, first of all, we won \non the issue of consumer confidence reports. I disagree with my friend \nfrom Wyoming, because he thinks they will confuse people. I think \npeople are smarter than that. I have always believed in giving people \ninformation. The way this information is portrayed will be clear and \nsimple, and I think it will be easy to understand. If it is not, it can \nbe revised so that it is even easier.\n  So I am extremely proud that we will require getting consumer \nconfidence reports out to people, so they will know what is in the \nwater they ingest, the water that is their lifeline. It seems to me a \nvery important thing.\n  I have to say that the conference and the House deserve a lot of \ncredit, but we built on the 40 votes we got here in the U.S. Senate. I \nwant to say to all my colleagues who supported the Boxer amendment, my \ndeepest thanks, because had we only gotten a few votes, we may not have \ngotten the agreement of our chair and our ranking member. Our chair and \nour ranking member knew there was support for the concept. I think the \ndifficulty arose in the details of the amendment.\n  The other part of this bill that gives me great pride deals with the \nsection on sensitive subpopulations. We attached it to the safe \ndrinking water bill in the last Congress and in this Congress. The \nlanguage in this bill requires that EPA drinking water standards be set \nat levels that take into account the special vulnerability of our \nchildren, our infants, our pregnant women, our elderly, the chronically \nill, and other groups that are at substantially higher risk than the \naverage healthy adult. The truth of the matter is that vulnerable \npopulations are much weaker than a 165-pound man. The way we have set \nthe standard throughout history has been for that very healthy, strong \nman. A little child, or someone who is ill, or an elderly person may be \nnegatively affected by water that would not hurt a healthy person.\n  Mr. President, this is an important milestone, in my opinion, because \nit seems to me that we ought to do this on every bill that impacts the \nhealth of our people. We should remember the children, the pregnant \nwomen, the frail elderly, the ill. They cannot afford to hire lobbyists \nto come into the Halls of Congress to knock on my door or your door, \nMr. President, and fight for their health and safety. They simply \ncannot do it. Little babies cannot do it. They count on us to protect \nthem. In this bill, we are doing that. We are taking into account their \nspecial needs.\n  So, today, I am very happy. In closing, I want to mention two other \nissues that relate to this bill, one of which is particularly important \nbecause the South Tahoe Public Utility District needs urgent help in \nreplacing its wastewater export pipeline system, which protects and \npreserves the water quality in that most magnificent of all lakes, Lake \nTahoe. We were able, thanks to the chairman and the ranking member, to \nlist this as a project that should be considered by the Administrator \nof EPA, should there be sufficient funds. I hope, Mr. President, that \nthe EPA Administrator will recognize the beauty and the vulnerability \nand the national gift that Lake Tahoe is, and that we will be able to \nhelp them fix their problem.\n\n  On the disappointment side, I don't have many. The chairman and the \nranking member were very helpful in getting authorization in this bill \nfor the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy, which \nis a consortium of universities in Mexico, California, Arizona, New \nMexico, and other States, which is going to look into the serious \npollution problems we have at our border region with Mexico. We had the \nauthorization, but the Science Committee in the House asserted its \njurisdiction and, unfortunately, removed this provision. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in the House from the San Diego area to \nresolve this problem.\n  To my chairman and my ranking member, let me say that a Senator could \nnot be more blessed than to be able to work with Senators like you and \nstaffs like the staffs that you have. I hope we can work together for \nmany more years.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee I want to \ncommend Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator \nReid for their extraordinary effort on this bill.\n  The safe drinking water bill we are passing today, is a significant \nstep forward in helping to ensure that one of the most fundamental \nneeds of any society--safe drinking water--is available to all \nAmericans.\n  This bill will lead to the crafting of a regulatory program to meet \nthis goal at the lowest possible cost and with the most flexibility \nfeasible for the thousands of local water supply systems.\n  This bill makes very significant progress in the protection of public \nhealth. It effectively addresses legitimate concerns about overly \nburdensome regulation and lack of funding. And it establishes the \ncritically important State revolving loan fund to help States and \nmunicipalities comply with Federal law.\n  Mr. President I want to highlight two specific items included in this \nbill which I worked very hard to achieve.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I have for \nyears worked to protect children and other sensitive subpopulations \nfrom contaminants in drinking water. I am therefore very pleased that \nthis bill includes language that reflects the amendment I successfully \nattached to the safe drinking water bill in the last Congress, and \nworked to incorporate into the bill this Congress. The language in this \nbill requires that EPA drinking water standards be set at levels that \ntake into account the special vulnerability of our children, our \ninfants, pregnant women, our elderly, the chronically ill, and other \ngroups that are at substantially higher risk than the average healthy \nadult. This is a very important step forward.\n  I am also pleased that this bill incorporates a strong version of the \nconsumer confidence reports amendment that Senator Daschle and I \noffered during Senate consideration of the bill. This is especially \nimportant in light of continued reports that many Americans are worried \nabout getting sick from tap water contaminants.\n  The new consumer confidence reports requirement means that consumers \nwill once a year get a report from the water company serving their \nneighborhood, about the source, the quality, and the safety of their \ndrinking water.\n  The information provided in the report will be simple and \nstraightforward.\n  Consumers have a right to be informed at least once a year about the \nlevels of contaminants found in their drinking water. These consumer \nconfidence reports will empower consumers to take precautionary \nmeasures to\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\nprotect themselves and the most vulnerable members of their family, \nsuch as a grandparent or a young child, for example, by boiling water \nor installing special filters.\n  It is a pleasure Mr. President, to see this conference report pass \ntoday.\n  In closing I would like to briefly mention two other issues:\n  I am pleased that the South Tahoe Public Utility District waste water \nexport system project was included on the list of special projects to \nbe considered by the Administrator of EPA if there are sufficient \nfunds.\n  The South Tahoe Public Utility District needs urgent help in \nreplacing its export pipeline system which protects and preserves the \nwater quality in Lake Tahoe. The export pipeline transports reclaimed \nwater from the wastewater treatment plant in South Tahoe out of the \nLake Tahoe basin to a nearby reservoir where the reclaimed water is \nstored and later used for irrigation and other purposes.\n  The existing pipeline is reaching the end of its useful life and must \nbe replaced quickly if we are to avoid the possibility of a \ncatastrophic spill resulting in serious environmental harm to Lake \nTahoe. Several serious leaks have already occurred over the last 2 \nyears, and the risk of a rupture increases the longer if takes to \ncomplete the replacement project.\n  The local community has raised $10 million towards replacement of the \npipeline, but a total of $30 million will be needed. The local \ncommunity is already paying sewer rates substantially higher than the \naverage in California. If the pipeline is to be replaced in a timely \nmanner, $10 million in Federal assistance is needed. While the local \ncommunity might be able to pay for the pipeline replacement over the \nlong term by enduring high utility rates, it will not get the job done \nas quickly as it could be done with Federal assistance. Such Federal \nassistance would enable the South Tahoe Public Utility District to \ncomplete the project in a more expeditious manner, reducing the chances \nof a large leak with serious environmental consequences for the lake.\n  Last, I would like to mention my disappointment that authorization \nfor the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy [SCERP], \nwhich was included in the Senate-passed bill, was not included in the \nfinal conferenced bill.\n  SCERP is a consortium of American and Mexican universities that works \nto address environmental problems along the United States-Mexican \nborder including but not limited to air quality, water quality, and \nhazardous materials. SCERP's members include San Diego State \nuniversity, New Mexico State University, University of Utah, University \nof Texas-El Paso, and Arizona State University. SCERP had its origins \nin the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which authorized the \nestablishment of an entity to research air and water quality and other \nenvironmental problems in the border region. Although SCERP is not \nspecifically authorized, it has been funded through congressional \nappropriations for the last 5 years in fulfillment of the Clean Air Act \nmandate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the distinguished Senator from California for her \nvery kind remarks. We express our appreciation to her.\n  Mr. President, I will yield soon 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire, Senator Smith. But before doing so, I want to say that \nSenator Smith has been deeply involved with this Safe Drinking Water \nAct from the beginning. He worked very closely with the authors of it \nand particularly was concerned about the small communities. There are \ntwo things he sought for these small communities. One is that they have \nsafe drinking water and, two, that they have it at an affordable price. \nI pay tribute to the work Senator Smith did in reflecting the views of \nhis constituents in New Hampshire. I give him sincere praise for his \nassistance.\n  I yield to Senator Smith.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Chafee, for \nhis very kind remarks. It has been a pleasure to work with Chairman \nChafee on not only this issue, but Superfund and other environmental \nissues throughout the last 2 years--actually, longer, but 2 years under \nhis chairmanship.\n  I also thank Senator Baucus for his good work on this. I compliment \nSenator Kempthorne, who has done an outstanding job in shepherding this \nlegislation to this point.\n  Everyone wants clean, safe water for drinking and bathing. But the \nability to provide this necessary commodity at an affordable price has \nbeen a real challenge in recent years. I think we have gotten to this \npoint because of the numerous problems encountered with the 1986 act. \nMany local governments and drinking water systems around the country, \nsome of which are in New Hampshire as well as other States, have been \nstruggling to comply with this long list of regulations while \nmaintaining reasonable water rates. The legislation before us will help \nto address this problem.\n  The folks who live in these communities do not want to drink dirty \nwater, but they want to be able to do what they have to do and have the \nreasonable opportunity to do it.\n  So when we talk about the issue of unfunded Federal mandates, the \nSafe Drinking Water Act is regarded by State and local governments as \nthe king of those unfunded mandates. So to address it, the bill now \nauthorizes $1 billion a year in a Federal grant to establish State \nrevolving loan funds. This is the first time for this. These funds will \nbe allocated to the States on an annual basis, which can then be loaned \nor granted to municipalities for drinking water projects. There are two \nprovisions of this program that I believe deserve special recognition:\n  First, the States can use up to 30 percent of the SRF to provide \ndirect grants to the most advantaged communities.\n  And, second, States can transfer funds between this new drinking \nwater SRF and the existing wastewater treatment SRF.\n  So these two provisions go a long way in providing our States \nflexibility and the communities the flexibility they need to maximize \ntheir resources with the environmental concerns that are of the most \nimmediate nature.\n  Also, the issue of radon is one that I have long been involved in, \nand there is still considerable debate about the amount of risk posed \nby low-level exposure to radon. But according to the American Water \nWorks Association, capital costs alone could reach $12 billion \nnationwide. And from a relative risk standpoint, we should consider the \nfact that radon in drinking water contributes less than 5 percent to \nthe total amount of radon exposure.\n  So given these statistics, I believe we chose a responsible course in \naddressing the radon issue. The bill directs EPA to set a new standard \nbased on risk assessment conducted by the National Academy of Sciences \nand also would allow for an alternative, less stringent standard \nequivalent to outdoor air levels. Certainly no one would want to have \nall the wells, or 90 percent of the wells, in particular States ruled \nundrinkable because of standards like that. It would just cause chaos. \nThis is a reasonable solution that will both protect public health and \nsave money.\n  Finally, I thank the managers for also including the provision to \nestablish five small-system technology centers across the country to \ndevelop and test new technologies for the smallest of systems. One of \nthese centers, I hope, may be established at the University of New \nHampshire, which has an extensive background in this area and will be a \nhuge asset to the New England region.\n  So I am pleased today that we are at the point that this bill will \nbecome law, that the President of the United States has indicated he \nwill sign it, and that it has broad-based support, bipartisan support, \nand support among hundreds of communities throughout the United States.\n  Also, I thank my staff assistant Christine Russell for her hard work \nand help on this issue throughout the year.\n  With that I yield back any time I have, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass legislation to \namend the Safe Drinking Water Act to give State and local communities \nthe flexibility to ensure that consumers\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\nhave safe drinking water, and send it to the President for his \nsignature. For the past several years, I have worked closely with \ncommunities in my State to support legislation that throws out the one-\nsize-fits-all approach and the costly mandates of the current law, and \nto replace it with greater flexibility and a commonsense approach. \nToday all the hard work of these communities paid off.\n  Several years ago, I began working with communities across my State \nthat were frustrated with the one-size-fits-all approach of current \nlaw. The current law tied the hands of the State to work with local \ncommunities by mandating prohibitively expensive treatment technologies \non the smallest of water systems--the cost of which would have bankrupt \nsome of our State's smaller communities. In 1994, I held a safe \ndrinking water forum in Moses Lake, WA to hear first hand from local \nleaders how to fix the current law. Over 100 people turned out for that \nhearing, and their message was clear--the current law was broken and in \nneed of repair. Together with local government leaders I supported \nlegislation in the 103d Congress that overwhelmingly passed the Senate. \nUnfortunately, that legislation did not make it to the President's desk \nfor his signature.\n  This year, however, was different. This year, the Senate \noverwhelmingly passed S. 1316. Included in that legislation, and in the \nconference report that the Senate will pass today are important reforms \nto the law that this Senator believes will ultimately facilitate \ngreater compliance with the law--without the bureaucracy and redtape. \nThe conference report addresses some of the most critical concerns \nraised by local governments in Washington State. The conference report \nestablishes a Safe Drinking Water Act State revolving loan fund to \nassist communities in financing system improvements to comply with the \nact, similar to the Clean Water Act State revolving loan fund; throws \nout the mandate that EPA regulate 25 additional contaminants based upon \na benefit-cost analysis; the legislation also gives States the ability \nto grant variances to small systems in order to facilitate greater \ncompliance with the act.\n\n\n                  section 106 of the conference report\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member \nof the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and their staff, \nfor including my amendment in the conference report that recognizes \nthat future treatment technologies will have the capacity to provide \nsafer water than that provided by traditional filtration. Section 106 \nof the conference report establishes a limited alternative to \nfiltration, if the system can utilize another form of treatment that \nwill provide greater removal of pathogens, than that of filtration. The \nneed for this amendment was brought to my attention by the city of \nSeattle. The city has two water supply sources, the Cedar River \nWatershed, and the Tolt River supply. Because of turbidity problems in \nthe Tolt supply, the city is in the process of implementing filtration \ntechnology on the Tolt. Conversely, the Cedar River supply does not \nhave turbidity problems--it consistently tests below average for \nturbidity--and the city is seeking an alternative to filtration for the \nCedar River supply.\n\n  Currently the Cedar is an unfiltered system, and therefore must \ncomply with the surface water treatment rule. The rule sets forward 11 \nspecific criteria, and calls for extensive monitoring of the system, to \nensure that the system continues to provide clean water to its \ncustomers. During 1992, the Cedar violated 1 of the 11 criteria, and, \nconsequently, was required to initiate filtration plans. Shortly \nthereafter the city entered into an agreement with the State and EPA \nregion 10 to achieve compliance with the rule without filtration.\n  Seattle has been working closely with EPA region 10 and the \nWashington State health department for the past several years to find a \nway to treat the Cedar supply, without filtration. Filtration would \ncost the city roughly $200 million, but the city believes that the \nprocess of ozonation would better meet the city's drinking water needs. \nThe Ozonation process would only cost $68 million. Ozonation is a \nprocess that is considerably less expensive than filtration and is \nbelieved to be the next up and coming technology for ensuring clean \ndrinking water.\n  The ozonation process is proven to be more effective than filtration \nin getting rid of harmful pathogens in a water supply, like \ncryptosporidium and giardia. Filtration technology would inactivate \n99.9 percent of cryptosporidium, but ozonation would inactivate 99.999 \npercent of the cryptosporidium. The increase of .099 is considered a \ngreater increase in the level of human health protection.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank all of the people in Washington State \nwho took the time to call or write me about the need to reform the Safe \nDrinking Water Act--their message came through loud and clear. By \ngiving State and local communities the flexibility to address unique \ndrinking water problems, the conference report completely and totally \nrejects the ``Washington, D.C. knows best'' way of thinking. When this \nlegislation is signed into law communities across Washington State will \nhave safe and affordable drinking water. This legislation is a victory \nfor consumers across our State, and for the local governments that \nworked hard for its passage. I am proud to support the conference \nreport to reform the Safe Drinking Water Act, and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act conference report. Government's most important \nresponsibility is to protect public health and safety. Safe drinking \nwater is the lifeblood of our society and the basic foundation of good \nhealth. This bill incorporates sound scientific principles and protects \npublic health and safety. The Safe Drinking Water Act keeps our promise \nto the American people.\n  This bill provides flexibility to State and local governments, \nenabling them to better assist water utilities in complying with \nFederal health and safety standards. This is a win-win situation \nbecause it provides utilities with the resources to meet safety \nstandards without putting them out of business.\n  This legislation not only protects the safety of our drinking water, \nit will create jobs in construction. Modernizing our infrastructure is \none of the best investments we can make. This bill helps burst the myth \nthat environmental protection comes at the expense of economic \ndevelopment. The reality is that good environmental policy is good \nbusiness.\n  Staying on the cutting edge of environmental technology presents the \nAmerican economy with a large and growing market here and around the \nworld. While the United States is already a leader in this burgeoning \nmarket, we should seize the initiative to expand our leadership even \nfurther.\n  Marylanders have told me they want adequate resources devoted to \nmaking drinking water safe and clean. I believe this bill is the best \nway to move forward toward the safest, cleanest drinking water for \nMaryland and America.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am pleased to join with my colleagues in support of \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. This conference report \nrepresents a thoughtful, bipartisan effort which weds protection of \npublic health with the flexibility necessary for cost-effective \nimplementation. It emphasizes using more and better science in \nidentifying contaminants, and training water system operators to meet \nthe established guidelines. It will improve protection of vulnerable \npopulations, including pregnant women, the sick, and the elderly. It \ncreates a new Federal grant program to help water systems struggling to \ncomply with Federal requirements.\n  The conference report contains a provision that is of particular \ninterest to New York State. Three upstate watersheds provide New York \nCity with its drinking water, which has been of such high quality \nhistorically that the City has had no need to filtrate its water. In \nrecent years, however, it has become evident that a comprehensive \nwatershed protection program is necessary to preserve the purity of the \nregion's water. As such, New York City and State have launched a \ncollaborative effort to safeguard the fragile upstate ecosystem, an \neffort which I feel will be instructive to other cities and regions of \nthe country. The bill will provide financial support for monitoring the \nsuccess of this pilot program, which will likely prove effective for \nother municipalities.\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n  I also wish to praise the provisions of this conference report which \nwill allow the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to consider \nrelative costs, health benefits, and competing health risks when \nformulating new standards for drinking water. This is a rational \napproach which will help us allocate resources more effectively and \nefficiently.\n  Environmental legislation places too much emphasis on risk \nassessment, resulting in an ineffective use of science. This perverse \nsituation stems from directing EPA, explicitly or implicitly, to \nregulate environmental pollutants to safe levels of exposure. In so \ndoing, EPA must scientifically determine what is safe.\n  The problem is simple: the premise is false. Science cannot define \nsafety. Decisions about what is safe--what is an acceptable risk--are \nbased very much on personal or societal values--informed by science, \nyes, but based on values. Therefore, when legislation forces agencies \nto use science to determine safe levels of exposure, the effect is to \nset EPA and other agencies up for failure. Risk managers have no \nincentive to take any action other than to err on the side of safety.\n  This bill enables EPA to avoid imposing costly regulations resulting \nin little or no benefit. It prudently allows EPA to incorporate \neconomic, scientific, and social considerations in achieving its safe \ndrinking water goals efficiently and effectively. It arms EPA with the \nbest tools to address existing and potential problems with the Nation's \ndrinking water supply, in reasoned and measured steps, and it \nestablishes new requirements for keeping the public apprised of the \nquality of their water.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their hard work \nand willingness to compromise on the Safe Drinking Water Act \nAmendments, and I strongly urge its passage.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senate is about to take up and, I trust, pass the \nconference report on the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996. \nThis is a strong, but balanced, environmental bill. It was written with \nthe advice of many public health officials across the country, \nincluding those who are responsible for providing the very water that \ntheir families and friends drink every day. Their advice helped make \nthis a common sense bill that will solve real life problems, without \ncreating new ones. This is legislation that will truly make drinking \nwater safer for all Americans.\n  Not surprisingly, this bill has strong bipartisan support in both the \nHouse and Senate, and the support of virtually every organization \nrepresenting State and local governments and water agencies responsible \nfor providing safe and affordable drinking water. This bill, first \nintroduced by Republican Senator Dirk Kempthorne, will improve public \nhealth and reduce unnecessary costs and Federal regulation.\n  The legislation fundamentally changes the way drinking water is \nregulated. It will improve public health protection, gives States and \nlocal governments greater flexibility to target their scarce resources \non priority health risks, and reduce Federal unfunded mandates.\n  The legislation requires that a meaningful cost-benefit analysis be \ndone whenever EPA issues a drinking water standard. The legislation \nrequires EPA to use peer-reviewed science to identify and regulate \ncontaminants that pose the greatest risks to public health. This is \ncritical if we are going to protect public health without bankrupting \nStates and local governments that have to implement Federal standards.\n  The bill strengthens the partnership between States and the Federal \nGovernment. For the first time, States will have the authority to \ntailor Federal requirements to meet their needs.\n  The legislation helps small systems. Most small systems don't have \nthe financial resources or technical expertise to meet treatment \nrequirements that were really designed for very large systems. Under \nthis legislation systems serving fewer than 10,000 people can get \nregulatory relief to use alternative treatment technologies that may be \nless expensive but still protect public health. Small systems also may \nreceive special financial assistance.\n  The legislation encourages voluntary measures to prevent \ncontamination of source water. The bill provides financial incentives \nfor States, communities and stakeholders to work together in a \nnonregulatory context to develop programs to prevent contaminants from \ngetting into source water. This provision is endorsed by the national \nagricultural community.\n  The legislation gives States financial assistance to get the job \ndone. The legislation authorizes $6 billion in grants to the States \nover the next 6 years to improve drinking water, and does so in the \ncontext of the Republican plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. \nThe States use this grant money to capitalize a loan fund for local \ncommunities to construct and upgrade their drinking water systems.\n  The legislation reduces unnecessary unfunded mandates that increase \nthe costs of drinking water without improving drinking water. The CBO \nsays the Senate bill, on which this final bill was based would likely \nresult in significant net savings over current law. For example, EPA \nnow arbitrarily regulates 25 additional contaminants over 3 years \nregardless of whether they are found in water or whether they present a \nhealth risk. This mandate was expensive, didn't improve public health \nand diverted resources away from stopping killer waterborne diseases. \nIn its place, this legislation gives EPA flexibility to regulate \ncontaminants that actually occur in drinking water and pose real health \nrisks.\n  The legislation includes a modified right to know or consumer \nconfidence provision. This provision was part of the House bill. Senate \nnegotiators improved the House language by providing greater \nflexibility for small systems and adding language to make the reports \nmore meaningful to consumers.\n  This bill is important for the reforms it contains. It is also \nimportant for what the bill represents. This bill is bipartisan, and it \nshows that issues of public health and environment needs not be \npartisan. There are many Senators who deserve credit for passage of \nthis conference report. This bill was first introduced by Senator Dirk \nKempthorne of Idaho whose 10 months of careful and bipartisan \nnegotiations led to the Senate approving his bill 99-0 last November. \nHe worked tirelessly to get this bill enacted into law. Last Sunday, \nfor example, he spent more than 6 hours negotiating with the House in \nwriting this bill. This is Senator Kempthorne's second major bill to \nbecome law this Congress, and it is a remarkable accomplishment for a \nSenator in just his 4th year in the Senate. Last year, Senator \nKempthorne led the congressional effort to pass the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act. And it is significant that the Congressional Budget Office \nsays this Safe Drinking Water Act comply with the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act. In fact, as I have already noted, CBO says this bill will \n``likely result in significant net savings over current law.''\n  I also want to commend other Senators who worked long and hard to see \nthat this bill passed. Senator John Chafee, the chairman of the \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee was getting this bill through \nhis committee, the Senate floor and through conference. I also commend \nthe bipartisan group of Senate conferees--Senators Warner, Thomas, \nSmith, Baucus, Reid, and Lautenberg who helped develop the original \nbill and the final bill with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes remaining on your side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield all of our remaining time to the \nvery distinguished Senator from Nebraska, who, I might say, Mr. \nPresident, although he is not a member of the committee, has been so \ndeeply active in this issue to make sure that we get to the Safe \nDrinking Water Act that I at times thought he was a member of the \ncommittee. He is one of the main reasons why we are here today. I very \nmuch tip my hat to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, let me first pay my compliments to Senator \nChafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Reid.\n  This is a very difficult piece of legislation. If you had asked me a \nweek ago\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nif I thought we would be able to get to conference and final passage \nbefore the August recess, I would not be very optimistic about it. In \nfact, I was prepared to take up the measure on radon in the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill for the fourth year in a row. I do not know how we \nmanaged to get it done. I am very grateful for its completion. For all \nof the rural communities of Nebraska--90 percent of our public water \nsupply is in communities under 2,500 population--they all thank you. \nThis bill probably saved our State millions of dollars over the next 10 \nyears.\n  All the consumers of drinking water will have safer drinking water as \na consequence of this change, and we are very grateful to Senator \nChafee, Senator Baucus, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Reid.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. It is likely to have, \nI think, a unanimous vote here in the Senate at an age when people \nwonder whether or not Republicans and Democrats can work together. It \nis a significant improvement in our law. I am very grateful that we are \nenacting it.\n  Chairman Chafee and Senator Baucus deserve our thanks and \nappreciation for their leadership on this issue. I also want to thank \nSenator Kempthorne for his personal commitment to resolving the tough \nissues involved in providing the public with safe drinking water and \nfor his determination and willingness to take the time necessary to \nwork out a compromise, and Senator Reid who, like me, comes from a \nrural State that has a lot to gain by the passage of this conference \nreport. I know they have put their best into this legislation and I \nappreciate their efforts.\n  One of the aspects of this bill that I have supported since the \nbeginning of the debate 3 years ago, is that it gives States and \ncommunities more flexibility to meet safe drinking water standards. For \nexample, the bill establishes a State revolving fund [SRF] to help \nfinance drinking water systems. It authorizes the fund at $1 billion \nper year through 2003. The flexibility built into the bill allows \nStates to transfer up to one third of the funds between the newly \nestablished safe drinking water SRF and the already existing Clean \nWater Act Revolving Fund. Furthermore, the bill allows for 30 percent \nof the State's revolving fund to be used as grants for disadvantaged \ncommunities. States deserve a chance to put their resources where they \nare most needed.\n  Nowhere is this more clear than in dealing with the public health \nthreat of radon. For the last 3 years, through the appropriations \nprocess, I have kept EPA from publishing a drinking water standard for \nradon. The reason I did this is because regulating radon in water does \nnot make sense when the known health threat for radon is through \ninhalation, not ingestion. Ninety-five percent of the risk is from \nradon in soil, not water. This bill allows States to use a multimedia \napproach, that focuses on getting rid of radon in homes and schools \nthat enters these facilities through the soil, instead of putting their \nlimited resources into getting radon out of water.\n  I have long believed that the way to solve this issue is through a \nmultimedia approach. Under this bill, EPA will use a risk assessment \ncompleted by the National Academy of Science to promulgate a radon \nregulation. Once the maximum contaminant level [MCL] is established, if \nit reduces radon in water to a lower level than that in the air \noutside, EPA will promulgate an alternative maximum contaminant level \nwhich is equal to the amount of radon in air outside or approximately \n3,000 picocuries per liter. States will be able to use that alternative \nMCL if they have a multimedia program which is approved by EPA.\n  It is a win-win solution, allowing taxpayers to get the must public \nhealth protection for their money and ensuring the water is safe.\n  This is a good approach and I'm glad that I can now stop going to the \nAppropriations Committee to ask for their assistance on the radon \nissue.\n  One of the largest costs of compliance with the Safe Drinking Water \nAct is monitoring.\n  States have to monitor contaminants in drinking water whether they \nexist in their water systems or not.\n  All Nebraska communities have asked that the current system be \nrevised to let them test for contaminants that exist in Nebraska. \nCurrent law allows for a waiver process. However, the process is \nexpensive and time consuming, and the benefits accrue to the local \nsystems while the costs are incurred by the States. I fought hard to \nsee that these provisions be changed.\n  This bill calls on EPA to revise current monitoring rules and it \ngives States the authority to give monitoring relief to small systems \nfor a 3-year period if the systems don't have the contaminant. \nAdditionally, States can adopt alternative monitoring requirements if \nthey have a source water assessment program.\n  Aside from radon and monitoring, standard setting posed a major \nproblem. As we all know, in the 1986 amendments we decided to regulate \n25 new contaminants every 3 years whether they were needed or not. This \nstrict method of establishing standards caused some contaminants to be \nregulated without a sound scientific basis.\n  I pushed for a change in that process. I believe that EPA needs to \nspend more time working with other public health agencies prior to \nconsidering a regulation. That is why, through the new contaminant \nselection process, EPA must consult with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, more specifically the Centers for Disease Control to \ndetermine which contaminants should be researched to see if they should \nbe regulated.\n  Once contaminants are thoroughly research--and this bill provides \nmoney to do just that--EPA must conduct a benefit-cost analysis prior \nto the promulgation of a regulation. That's the way decisions ought to \nbe made. I've fought hard to see this provision implemented and I am \nconfident that it will allow EPA to make the best choices for the \nprotection of public health. Decisions that will allow a State or \ncommunity's resources to be directed toward the greatest public health \nthreat.\n  I fully support this bill. I have worked hard to ensure that it \nprovides the best public health protection possible, flexibility for \nStates, and affordability for small systems. I applaud the work of the \ncommittee and I thank them for their willingness to allow me into the \ndebate and negotiations.\n  I want to stop here so this bill can be passed and sent on to the \nPresident for signature.\n  I close again by applauding the heroic efforts of the chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, Senator Baucus from \nMontana, Senator Kempthorne from Idaho, and Senator Reid from Nevada. I \nwould also like to thank their staff, in particular Jimmie Powell, \nSteve Shimberg, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Mike Evans, Tom Sliter, Ann Klee and \nGreg Daines. It simply would not have been possible without their \nbelief that water systems in our Nation need to be safe and that we \nneed to change the way we regulate in order to accomplish that \nobjective.\n  I am very, very grateful. But, more importantly, the people of \nNebraska are very grateful for your hard work, your diligence, and \neventually your success.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska, Senator Kerrey, for the very generous remarks he made. He was \nhip deep in this when we started some 4 years ago, and although he is \nnot on the Environment Committee, he has followed it extremely closely \nand has been extremely helpful and constructive to us. So I thank him \npersonally.\n  In conclusion, I thank the staff: Ann Klee and Buzz Fawcett with \nSenator Kempthorne; Jo-Ellen Darcy, Mike Evans, and Tom Sliter with \nSenator Baucus; Ann Loomis with Senator Warner; Mike Smith with Senator \nThomas; Scott Slesinger with Senator Lautenberg; Gregg Daines with \nSenator Reid; Chris Russell with Senator Smith; Diane Hill with Senator \nKerrey, and, of course, from the majority staff of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Steve Shimberg, Jimmie Powell, who was the lead \non this, who was absolutely phenomenal, and Stephanie Daigle. All of \nthem deserve a lot of praise and thanks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee will join with me in also thanking Administrator Browner; Bob \nPerciasepe, Assistant Administrator; and Cynthia Dougherty, and a \nformer administration official who worked very hard on this \nlegislation, Jim Elden.\n  This administration has shown leadership on this issue by making it \nan environmental priority back in 1993. Today, we have made that \npriority a reality. We have a divided Government, as we all know. It \ntakes cooperation to get things done. They were an integral part of the \nsolution. We are all very thankful.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I certainly join in those thanks.\n  Now we are ready to go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before we begin the vote, I believe we are prepared to get \na consent agreement on the next two bills, and I would liked to get \nthat done. I would like to make sure that the minority leader is here \nand has a chance to read it over.\n  Why not outline what we have here and when he comes, we will actually \nput it in the form of unanimous consent.\n  This unanimous consent agreement would be that immediately following \nthe disposition of the safe drinking water conference report vote, the \nChair lay before the Senate the health insurance reform conference \nreport, and it be considered as having been read and it be in order for \nSenator Wellstone to make a point of order that the conference exceeded \nthe scope with respect to section 281 of title II, subtitle H, and \nfollowing the ruling of the Chair, Senator Wellstone be recognized to \nappeal the ruling of the Chair; that the appeal be limited to 10 \nminutes to be equally divided in the usual form; following the vote on \nthe appeal, if overturned, the point of order be null and void, and \nthat the Senate immediately agree to the Senate Concurrent Resolution \nnow at the desk correcting enrollment of the conference report.\n  So that would be the first part of how we would deal with the health \ninsurance reform package. And then we would ask that after adopting the \ncorrecting resolution, there be 2 hours for debate on the conference \nreport to be equally divided between Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy, \nwith 30 minutes of the Kassebaum time under the control of Senator \nDomenici, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the \nconference report be laid aside; it would be made the pending business \nat the direction of the majority leader after notification of the \nDemocratic leader, and that the Senate then proceed to an immediate \nvote on the adoption of the conference report without further action or \ndebate.\n  So there would be two parts to that consent with regard to the health \ninsurance reform package, first the one with regard to the point of \norder on section 281, and then we would have 2 hours of debate on the \nconference report itself, with 30 minutes specifically earmarked for \nSenator Domenici.\n  Then we would further ask consent, after that is agreed to, that the \nconference report to accompany the Small Business Tax Relief Act, H.R. \n3448, be limited to--we will have to get the exact time, I think 60 \nminutes there--for debate, to be equally divided between Senators Roth \nand Moynihan, and the conference report be considered as having been \nread, and following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote on adoption of the conference report without any \nfurther action or debate.\n  Does the Senator, the distinguished Democratic leader, have a comment \nor question about this?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I understand it, our staffs are just \nnow combing through the language, and I think within a few moments we \nwill be prepared to enter into the agreement. I did not hear all of the \nexplanation from the distinguished majority leader.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. When the Senator is ready. I think I will read it. I will \njust read it again so everybody can hear it, but I wondered if the \nSenator had any questions he wanted to raise.\n  I might note if I could, if we could get that agreed to, we would \nhave this vote and then we would have a total under that of 3 more \nhours of debate on the two bills, plus the time that would be taken, \nwhich should not be very much, on the section 281 correction, and then \nwe would couple that with votes. That would all be completed by around \n8 or 8:30. And then whatever wrap-up we would have at that point, if we \ncould get an agreement on the defense authorization bill, any other \nunanimous-consent requests, of course, we would do those then. But I \njust want the Members to know it would involve a vote now, another vote \nin 2 hours, and then another vote 1\\1/2\\ hours or so after that.\n  Mr. President, I will yield for a question of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I do not think the majority leader would find a rebellion \nif that 2 hours of debate were reduced.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be more than willing to see it reduced.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. We completed a whole conference report here in 1 hour \nequally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. There are some Senators who would like to be heard on this \nhealth insurance issue, including, I know, Senator Domenici and Senator \nKennedy and Senator Wellstone and others. They can always yield back \ntime. I know it is not something we like to do in the Senate very much. \nIf anybody would like to yield back time, I do not think Senator \nDaschle would object and I know I would not object, and we could finish \nearlier.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield----\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. To one other possibility, one other possibility would be \nto have the votes and people who care to talk about these things talk \nafter the votes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to deem all the votes having occurred now and \nhave the rest of the night for debate.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We ought to be able to work something out maybe during \nthe course of this vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Perhaps we could get a unanimous-consent agreement right \nafter that vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. Why not do that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I note the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is here. I spoke with him earlier in the day, and he \nseemed to have a case of laryngitis, I thought, and perhaps he will not \nhave the steam for 2 hours or an hour. I say that hopefully.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think I still have the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader still has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since the Senator is having laryngitis, I \nwill not insist that he respond at this time. Let us have the vote. We \nwill work on the final time agreement during the vote, and hopefully we \ncan shorten that time and we can get our work done. So I yield the \nfloor.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No, they have not been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Pryor] and \nthe Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 98, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 263 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--98\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Brown\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frahm\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Heflin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnston\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pressler\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Simon\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Murray\n     Pryor\n       \n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe Members will be very interested in \nthis unanimous consent request. This will give them the idea of what \nwill be happening over the next hour and a half, and some feel, maybe, \nof what might be in store for the balance of the night. We still have \nsome things we are trying to work through. But this is a very important \nagreement. I am pleased we have it worked out. I think it is fair to \nall concerned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9485-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9498-S9499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the safe drinking water conference \nreport--which we have just done--the Chair lay before the Senate the \nhealth insurance reform conference report, and it be considered as \nhaving been read, and it be in order for Senator Wellstone to make a \npoint of order that the conference exceeded the scope with respect to \nsection 281 of title II, subtitle H, and following the ruling of the \nChair, Senator Wellstone be recognized to appeal the ruling of the \nChair, and that appeal be limited to 10 minutes to be equally divided \nin the usual form, and following the vote on the appeal, if overturned, \nthe point of order be null and void, and the Senate immediately deem \nagreed to a Senate Concurrent Resolution now at the desk correcting the \nenrollment of the conference report.\n\n  To put that in everyday language, there will be a point of order \nmade, and the Chair will rule after 10 minutes of debate equally \ndivided. Then action would be taken, and then that would go as a Senate \nConcurrent Resolution over to the House for disposition. We believe we \nhave everything agreed to, both here and over there. And this is the \nway to deal with this issue as it now stands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the adoption of the correcting resolution, there be 85 \nminutes--85 minutes--for debate under the control of Senator Kennedy, \n70 minutes under the control of Senator Kassebaum, with 30 minutes of \nthe Kassebaum time under the control of Senator Domenici, and following \nthe conclusion or yielding back of time, the conference report be laid \naside to be made the pending business at the direction of the majority \nleader, after notification of the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not. Fellow \nSenators, I have been heard to say I would do anything I could to kill \nthis bill because of what happened with reference to the mentally ill. \nBut I have conferred with our distinguished leader. And, frankly, I am \nvery proud of what he is doing around here. He is making the Senate \nwork, and we are getting some things done. And to be honest, the only \nthing I could do is make you all stay around here tonight and tomorrow, \nif a couple of us could stand on our feet all night. And I do not \nchoose to do that because I think, in the end, this bill is so good for \nthe American people, and that will be expressed by the votes of this \nbody.\n  But I would like those who have resisted a very modest amendment \nwhich we agreed to, which was a compromise, to know--and I told our \nleader this--that this issue is not going away. In fact, I will \nintroduce a freestanding bill today with many cosponsors. And it will \njust be on the very simple proposition that we attempted to resolve \nthis on, not the full amendment that came about here on the floor.\n  I would like everyone to know, including our distinguished leader, \nduring the month of September there will be opportunities to vote \nagain. And I do not intend to let this issue go by. So all of you can \nbe looking at it because you are going to be voting again, except the \nnext vote is a very simple one, just so, so small in dimension that \nhardly anybody can really object on the grounds of costs. So everybody \nshould know that. And with that, I agree to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  I understand, I say to Senator Kassebaum, of your 70 minutes, in the \nevent you have a few of them left over, you would yield those to me, \nalso in the event those on my side need more than the 30 minutes. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you for what you are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for his \ncomments. And Senator Daschle, both he and Senator Wellstone, I thank \nfor their cooperation. We know how strongly you feel about it. The \nSenator has been very fair. We appreciate it very much.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the time on the conference \nreport to accompany the small business tax relief bill, H.R. 3448, be \nlimited to 60 minutes under the control of Senator Moynihan, 30 minutes \nunder the control of Senator Kennedy, and 60 minutes under the control \nof Senator Roth, and the conference report be considered as having been \nread, and following the conclusion or yielding back of the time, the \nSenate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report without \nfurther action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that at 6 o'clock this \nevening, if the House has adopted the correcting resolution with \nrespect to the House insurance reform conference report, and consent \ncan be granted to postpone the above-listed debate time, then the \nSenate proceed to two back-to-back votes, the first on the adoption of \nthe health care conference report, to be followed by a vote on adoption \nof the small business tax relief conference report, and any remaining \ndebate time not previously consumed be in order following the vote with \nrespect to the small business tax conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask if the Senate receives an identical \nconcurrent resolution correcting the enrollment, it be deemed agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without \nfurther action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the distinguished Democratic leader have any comment \nat this time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the distinguished majority leader. This \nunanimous consent agreement is designed to try to accommodate all \nSenators. There are a number of Senators, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico has indicated, who wish to be heard on both of these \nconference reports, but there are a lot of other Senators who would \nlike to be able to plan their travel for early this evening.\n  What this could do is provide us the opportunity, if we can do it, to \nhave two stacked votes at 6 o'clock, one on the conference report on \nthe minimum wage-small business package, the other on the health bill.\n  I hope we can get cooperation on both sides to accommodate those two \nvotes no later than 6 o'clock. I believe we can, and I applaud the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\nleader for his effort in getting us to this point.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his comments and his frankly \nsuggesting we could do the two votes at 6 o'clock, as well as his \ncooperation.\n  I know a lot of Senators have a lot of other issues they are \ninterested in. We are still working some other issues and some, I \nbelieve, for instance, the Emerson food donation bill, a food bank \nbill, which I think we can get that cleared. We will be talking about \nother issues, so I hope rather than ask about all these bills, maybe we \ncan go ahead and get started on the debate. I see Senator Nunn, and I \nknow he is very much interested in some nominations.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. If I could just take 2 seconds here, I am glad progress is \nbeing made.\n  I join the chairman of the committee, Senator Thurmond, in his plea \nthat we pass the defense authorization bill. It will take a total of \nabout 20 minutes, based on what I know now.\n  Even more urgently, I urge that we clear the nominations, the \nmilitary nominations. We have posts all over the world that depend on \nthese nominations. It is extremely important that we do the nominations \nthis evening. Whatever else is still in dispute when we go home \ntonight, I hope the nominations on the military side are cleared.\n  I can assure my colleagues that if Senator Thurmond and I are given \n20 minutes, equally divided--we will probably cut that down, if \nnecessary--we can finish debate on the defense authorization bill and \nconference report, which passed the House last night, have the stacked \nvotes at 6 o'clock, and have that vote right after that.\n  I hope we would be able to get agreement on both sides.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \nmajority leader?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, would the majority leader \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thought all the unanimous-consents had \nbeen agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The last consent was not agreed to. The \nSenator from Michigan has reserved the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Earlier in the week, the majority leader indicated there \nwould be an effort made to offer up the nominations of the circuit \njudges as well as the district court judges. Is that effort going to \ncontinue?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will continue to work on those nominations. We have shown \nan abundance of good faith. We have confirmed 17 judges. We are not \ngoing to be able to get more of them cleared tonight, but we will \ncontinue to work on these as we go on into the fall.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As the majority leader knows, one of the judges I am \nfamiliar with, Eric Clay, has the support of both the Republican and \nthe Democratic Senators from Michigan, and he is from Michigan. Is \nthere any possibility now that would be offered this evening?\n  Mr. LOTT. We will continue to work with the Senator on that. Senator \nAbraham has talked to me about that. We will continue to work on that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Nunn in their petition to the \nleadership of the Senate that we do address the authorization bill. I \nspoke earlier on that, and that particular military measure, coupled \nwith the nominations pending before the Senate, are absolutely \nessential pieces that have to be passed before we depart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to thank the able Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Nunn, for his remarks on these defense matters, and \nalso Senator Warner of Virginia.\n\n  Defense, I say again, is nonpartisan; military matters and \nnominations are nonpartisan. Why there is an objection here to the \ntaking up of nominations of the President of the United States for \nmilitary nominations is beyond me. Why there is objection here to the \ntaking up a defense bill agreed to on both sides, that we can finish in \n20 minutes, an objection to taking it up is beyond me. After all, \ndefense is for the whole country. These military nominations are for \nthe whole country.\n  I hope that the leadership on the Democratic side that is objecting \nto taking up these matters would relent and let us go ahead and pass \nthese matters. The House yesterday passed this defense conference \nreport in 1 hour. I think we can pass it in 20 minutes.\n  Again, I ask the leadership on the Democratic side to reconsider this \nmatter and take up these defense matters which are for the benefit of \nthe whole country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9498-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9499-S9500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I have to \nthank Senator Pryor from Arkansas, who has been so diligent on these \nissues, and also Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, in the dark of night, in this conference committee for \nthis bill, the insurance reform bill, there was a provision that was \nput in, which was a 2-year patent extension for a prescription drug \ncalled Lodine. I think the effect of this would be that for 5 years it \nwould be impossible for consumers to purchase a generic drug. My \nunderstanding is that the manufacturer is paying the Federal Government \n$10 million each year, or $20 million, because this would be additional \ncosts, since the Medicaid assistance would go up more than it would if \nin fact consumers had access to the generic drug. In addition, the \ncompany will be providing reimbursements to some of the States because \nof the additional Medicaid costs.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that this is a gigantic ripoff for the \nrest of the consumers because the generic drug would give consumers \naccess to affordable treatment, those who are suffering from arthritis. \nSo that, I think, is egregious. Clearly, I think it is the wrong thing \nfor us to do.\n  The point of this challenge, however, has to do with the process. \nThere was an attempt to stick this provision into the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and there was a very strong letter from \nSenator Pryor and Senator Chafee saying, don't do that. But this was \nstuck into the committee late at night, not known to very many Members. \nIt had never really passed out of\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\nany committee. It hadn't passed out of any committee in either House, \ncertainly not the two committees with jurisdiction over this \nlegislation. Therefore, it was not within the scope of this conference \ncommittee to stick this provision in.\n  So, Mr. President, my point and the reason that I raise this point of \norder is that I think what was done really was a violation of the way \nthe process is supposed to operate. On a very legal, technical point, \nit was a violation. This had not been dealt with by committee in either \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, I have to say, I was a college professor and used to \nteach political science courses, and I knew conference committees were \ncalled the third House of the Congress, but I had no idea that this \nkind of action could be taken, really, in the dark of night, not an \nopen process, not accountable to the citizens of the country. It was \nthe wrong thing to do, and it is for this reason that I raise this \npoint of order and that I appeal the ruling of the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I reserve the remainder of my time, and I will yield \non your time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. In that case, I will yield to the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, contrary to the statement by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, this matter has been considered in the Judiciary \nCommittee as part of the markup on the drug patent bill. It was on the \nfloor as a part of the Hatch amendment, which was a part of the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  This measure was also considered by the House, which passed a 2-year \npatent extension for this drug on separate occasions; in 1992 and again \nin 1996. It has been so considered as a matter of basic fairness. The \nFDA delayed action on this matter for some 97 months, contrasted with \n27 months on the average.\n  This matter has been considered extensively. I raised it in open \nsession in the Agriculture Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee \nearlier this week. It had been in the House Agriculture appropriations \nbill and was dropped in conference. I do not vouch for the provision \nwhere it was added to the health care bill after conference. I do not \nknow about that and was not a party to that.\n  But we have a very basic problem in America about research \nexpenditures for drugs that benefit sick people. These drugs benefit \neverybody including the elderly, the young, and those not in either \ncategory. If we are going to expend a very substantial sum of money on \nresearch, there is going to have to be a reasonable return. We have a \npatent period, and the patent period was not honored in this case. The \nmanufacturer here, Wyeth-Ayerst, is a major Pennsylvania constituent of \nSenator Santorum's and mine, employing thousands of people in the \nPhiladelphia suburbs. If they are to be able to continue, they are \ngoing to have to have a reasonable return.\n  Those who added it to this bill did so because this is a health bill. \nOne way or another, these sorts of matters must be considered. I am \nvery sympathetic to generic manufacturers, and I have a very strong \nvoting record for senior citizens on issues like this. But if we are to \nhave the kind of research, productivity and the great miraculous \nadvances, we are simply going to have to have a reasonable rate of \nreturn on the patent period that is realistic. That is why on the \nmerits and as a matter of fairness, I have advocated this position \npublicly and do so today, because I think it is an appropriate and \nsound position.\n  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I think the Senator has articulated the arguments on \nthe merits very well. This is an appropriate remedy. I just ask the \nSenator from Minnesota if he has ever heard of the drug Daypro. It is a \ncompeting drug that had the same problems going through the FDA as \nLodine, the same problems, the same delay. But in the 1996 omnibus \nappropriations bill, Daypro got an extension. I don't recall the \nSenator from Minnesota objecting to that extension, asking for that to \nbe removed. But they got one, too.\n  So what we have now is a competitive disadvantage. We have one \ncompany with a similar drug, a similar prescription, getting an \nextension and another drug with the same FDA problem not getting an \nextension. This is a health care bill. The Chair has ruled that it is \nwithin the scope of this bill. So I think what is going on here is, \nfrankly, not a special interest, but simply a matter of fairness that \nwe are trying to address. I think what has gone on here is really a lot \nof actions that--as the Senator said, this bill passed here in the \nSenate, passed in the House. It is not a new provision. It has had \ncommittee discussion. This thing is not anything new to any Member of \nthis floor. We should have left it alone and created the fairness that \nthis Senate acted on and the House acted on in the past.\n  Again, I agree with the Senator from Minnesota, and I don't agree \nwith sticking things in conference that weren't originally there. I \nunderstand that objection. But this is not a red herring proposal. This \nis a sound proposal. This is a fair approach, and I think we are going \nto see either this or, frankly, the repeal of the Daypro. One or the \nother is going to happen again sometime in the next couple of months.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate working with both of my \ncolleagues. For all I know that other provision was stuck in conference \ncommittee in the dark of night. I did not catch it. I really appreciate \nwhat you have said. I think we would probably disagree maybe on the \nsubstance because I think by postponing the time that this can be \ngeneric. We really provide more cost to the consumers. But it seems \nlike what you have said--and hopefully we can all agree on this--this \nshould not have been stuck in the conference committee the way it was. \nIt was not appropriate, and that is why I challenged the ruling of the \nChair.\n  I think from the point of view of the way our process operates it is \na huge mistake to legislate this way. That is why I hope that I will \nreceive strong support on this challenge. And my understanding is that, \nif we prevail on the voice vote, this will become a successful \nconcurrent resolution which will be a technical correction resolution \nthat I introduced on behalf of myself, and also Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts.\n  Again, I thank especially Senator David Pryor for really bringing \nthis to my attention.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would take strong exception to any \nlanguage if it refers to anything which my distinguished colleague, I, \nor others in the advocacy of this position have done. We have spoken of \nit directly. I did so earlier this week in the conference, and we do so \non the floor today.\n  We need medical research. We need these wonder drugs to be produced. \nIt is a matter of fairness as to how we are going to compensate those \nwho produce them. If we are to have them for the consumers, we will \nhave to be able to pay for them. And I think ultimately we will have to \ntake this matter up on the merits, and I think at that time we will see \nthat it is an appropriate position which Senator Santorum, I, and \nothers have advocated.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my both my colleagues from Pennsylvania that \nthey clearly are two Senators who are always more than willing to be \nstrong and determined and honest in their positions in public.\n  This amendment is not at all aimed at the Senator from Pennsylvania. \nIt is aimed at something that I think is wrong with this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Should the decision of the \nChair stand as the judgment of the Senate?\n  The ruling of the Chair was not sustained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9499-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9500-S9501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3103\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to make a brief comment on the \naddition of the special-interest provision that was added in the \nlegislation without knowledge of the Democratic conferees and, to my \nknowledge, Republican conferees.\n  I am pleased that a provision to benefit a particular pharmaceutical \ncompany will now be dropped from the very important health care \nlegislation.\n  The provision was surreptitiously included in the conference report \nwithout the knowledge of the conferees. Clearly, it did not belong in \nthis legislation.\n  I simply point out that the provision was rejected when previous \nefforts to put it into other bills were attempted. An initial attempt \nto include the special deal was rejected in the defense authorization \nbill. A second attempt was made to include it in the agriculture \nconference report, and that was rejected also. Now it has been rejected \nin the health reform conference, and we were right to reject it.\n  Let me just conclude by saying, strike three, this provision is out \nand good riddance.\n  I will highlight the points in the GAO report that was issued. It \nsaid that Lodine is a ``me, too'' drug which provides no significant \nhealth benefit or therapeutic breakthrough which would justify \nexpedited review, such as AIDS or cancer.\n  FDA found that the Lodine submission was ``piecemeal, voluminous, \ndisorganized, and based on flawed clinical studies.''\n  The Lodine submission to FDA did not contain ``enough data to prove \nefficacy, until September 1989.''\n  It has already received special consideration under the Waxman-Hatch \namendments. We passed that to try to take into consideration companies \nthat felt they had not been treated fairly before the FDA. We have \nincluded in the Record the excellent statement that has been made by \nboth Senator Chafee and Senator Pryor. First of all, we note that no \nhearings or deliberations of any kind have been held in either the \nHouse or Senate as to whether any public purpose would be served by \ngranting this extension. Then, finally, the CBO says the patent \nextension will cost the Federal Government and taxpayers $10 million. \nThese resources would be far better applied and are urgently needed \nunder the submissions jurisdiction.\n  The other point I will mention, the Lodine patent extension includes \nlanguage barring importation of active ingredients. This would prevent \ngeneric competitors from conducting the essential preclinical tests and \nclinical studies to prepare for marketing, as they are permitted and \nrequired under the 1984 act. This specific clause further extends the \npatent extension by as much as 5 years and market exclusivity by as \nmuch as 7 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9500-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9501-S9526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1996--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now operating under control of \ndebate time.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand by the previous \nagreements, we have divided up the time for the next few hours between \nthe Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and also on the minimum wage legislation, \nbut that there has been agreement to vote on these measures at 6 \no'clock. So there is an expectation that it would be at 6 o'clock.\n  So I expect that during the course of the next period of time that we \nhave between now and 6 that perhaps that time could be divided, if it \nis agreeable with Senator Kassebaum; that we might just divide the time \nbetween she and I until 6 o'clock.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I anticipate, of course, if there is more time \nallocated to us, that will take us past 6 o'clock. As you know, Senator \nDomenici and Senator Wellstone want a large share of that time to be \nequally divided. We will try to do so. But we will have to make sure \nthat time is allocated to them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think the Senators will be fair. But \nit seems to me that the spirit of the understanding would provide a \nportion of that time to the Senator from New Mexico. I think the spirit \nof it was that a portion of that time would go directly to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If we have 55 minutes, I suggest that we divide it \nbetween Senator Kassebaum and myself. And then we will allocate it to \nour Members between now and 6 o'clock, if that is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I allocate to myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today, we stand on the threshold of \npassing long-overdue reforms to our Nation's health insurance system.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, the bipartisan conference \nagreement before us today will help at least 25 million Americans each \nyear who now face discrimination and live in fear that their health \ninsurance coverage will be canceled if they change jobs, lose their \njob, or become sick.\n  It was exactly 1 year ago today that the Senate Labor Committee \npassed the core provisions of this legislation by a unanimous vote. For \nmany months prior to that time, Senator Kennedy and I worked together \nwith insurance companies, consumers, Governors, State regulators, large \nemployers, small employees, and other to forge a bipartisan consensus \nwhich would bring us to this day.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long, and sometimes bumpy, road. But the \nspirit of cooperation and bipartisanship that began this process 1 \nyears ago has allowed us to overcome very difficult obstacles that \nthreatened--but never derailed--our drive to pass common-sense health \nreforms that would provide real health security.\n  Whilte there has been a great deal of debate and polemics over the \nlast few months about extraneous provisions, Senator Kennedy and I have \nnever lost sight of our primary goal. The heart and soul of the \nKassebaum-Kennedy bill that passed the full Senate unanimously are \nfirmly embedded in the conference agreement before us.\n  Mr. President, beginning July 1, 1997, every American who has played \nby the rules will be able to keep their health insurance coverage even \nif they change jobs, lose their job, or have a preexisting illness.\n  Last night, the House of Representatives passed the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act by an overwhelming vote of 421 to 2. \nToday, we will have the opportunity to do the same and to send this \nbill to President Clinton for his signature.\n  This is a dramatic victory for the American people--not only because \nthe bill will help millions of Americans with preexisting illnesses, \nbut also because--I believe--the process of compromise, negotiation, \nand bipartisanship that was the hallmark of this bill will go a long \nway toward restoring Americans' faith that their Government can work to \naddress their most pressing concern.\n  Depending on who was speaking yesterday, one would think that health \nreform was entirely the province of one party. But as Senator Kennedy \nand I both know, this effort has been bipartisan from the start.\n  Senator Kennedy and Representative Archer worked together to develop \na compromise on medical savings accounts that broke a months-long \nimpasse on the bill.\n  The majority and minority leaders, as well as Senator Dole, deserve \nmuch credit for breaking the gridlock over this bill.\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, I would just like to say a special word of \nappreciation to the majority leader. I think that Senator Lott has \ndevoted a great deal of time and energy to making sure that we could \nreach this point this evening before we go out on our recess.\n  And there also has been significant bipartisan support in the House \nfrom Representatives Thomas, Bliley, Bilirakis, Waxman, Hyde, Dingell, \nand others. I especially want to recognize Representative Hastert of \nIllinois for his leadership in bringing together members of both \nparties to reach agreement on this very important bill.\n  I regret that we could not do more to help small employers. In an \neffort to avoid controversy that could have derailed the legislation, \nboth the House and Senate small business pooling provisions were \ndropped from the conference agreement. Representative Fawell from \nIllinois is perhaps the greatest advocate of this reform, and Senator \nJeffords, from Vermont, also has worked very diligently to help small \nemployers enjoy the same economies of scale as large employers. My hope \nis that those Members and others will continue to show leadership in \nthe future to find constructive bipartisan solutions in this area.\n  I also regret that this legislation does not include malpractice \nreforms that could significantly lower costs for consumers.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I know many of my colleagues are disappointed \nthat the bill does not do more to help end discrimination against those \nwith mental illnesses. I know that Senator Domenici and others will \nspeak to that issue later. But I would just like to express my \nappreciation to Senator Domenici who has devoted his time and heartfelt \nefforts to achieving legislation to address parity in insurance \ncoverage for those with mental illness.\n  We did not do enough in this bill, and I certainly can understand \nthose who wish we could have done more. However, the bill does \nrepresent significant progress for those with mental illness and other \nchronic conditions. The bill expressly prohibits employers and insurers \nfrom denying coverage to individuals because of preexisting mental \nillnesses as well as physical illnesses, and people who suffer with \nmental illnesses will be able to change jobs without the fear of losing \ntheir health coverage.\n  I also have received letters in recent days from nearly 30 groups, \nincluding the American Association of Retired Persons, the American \nMedical Association, the American Hospital Association, the American \nCancer Society, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Heart Association, the March of Dimes, and \nothers.\n  Let me read from one of these letters:\n\n       The American Cancer Society estimates that more than one \n     million people will be diagnosed with cancer this year. Ten \n     million Americans alive today have a history of cancer. Under \n     current insurance practices, many of these people will be \n     denied coverage if they change jobs or lose their job, or \n     they will be squeezed out of their existing plan because of \n     their health status. The health insurance reform bill \n     addresses these critical issues by limiting preexisting \n     condition restrictions and ensuring greater portability of \n     coverage. * * * The modest reforms contained in [this bill] \n     will go a long way toward protecting people with chronic \n     illness and their families. * * * \n\n  So, Mr. President, let us move forward. Let us cap this bipartisan \neffort with another strong vote today and send this historic \nlegislation to the President's desk for his immediate signature.\n  There is no controversy about the central elements of the bill. There \nis no question that the President will sign the legislation. There is \nno question that--despite its long delay--the President, and members of \nboth parties, in both the House and the Senate, can take credit for \npassing these sensible reforms.\n  And there is no question that the American people will be the real \nwinners today. This bill will guarantee that those who need coverage \nthe most are not shut out of the system. It is a small step forward, \nbut it is a historic step. And it will mean the world to millions of \nAmericans who will no longer live in fear that they will lose their \nhealth coverage when they change jobs or lose their job.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference agreement, and to send \nthis important measure to the President today.\n  Mr. President, I think many will be helped by this bill. While it is \nnot a great leap, it is an important, historic step forward in \naddressing many of the American people's most pressing concerns about \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the final moments before we are going \nto have legislative completion of this Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, I once \nagain commend the chairman of our committee, Senator Kassebaum, for her \nleadership and work in fashioning this legislation, which reflects the \nstrong bipartisan support of her committee. As she has rightfully \npointed out, it was a year ago today that the committee reported it \nunanimously. It did take us a period of time, some 8\\1/2\\ months, \nbefore the Senate finally considered the legislation, and then passed \nit unanimously. So this does really reflect an extraordinary \nlegislative achievement and accomplishment.\n  As we come into the final days and hours of this part of the \nCongress, I think all Americans are very much in the debt of Senator \nKassebaum for all she has done on this legislation and on many other \npieces of legislation, and it is important for the record to note it. I \nthink the Members of the Senate respect and understand that.\n  Secondly, Mr. President, this legislation is right and necessary not \njust because, as the leaders of all of the great religions have pointed \nout, it is morally imperative for those who have some preexisting \ncondition or some illness, or disability. It is not only right because \nwe have virtual unanimous support from the business, consumer, and \nlabor communities, but most powerfully it should pass because it has \nthe support of the working families in this country.\n  There will be many who will try to claim credit for the legislation. \nBut ultimately this legislation was passed for the parents, those \nparents who today are worried about a child who may have some \ndisability and wonder what in the world is going to happen to their \nchild when they reach maturity and they are no longer included in that \nparent's policy. Those parents know that today it is virtually \nimpossible for that child to be able to get some kind of health \ninsurance.\n  Victory can be expressed by workers, who currently can see a new \nopportunity for themselves and for their families by moving up in terms \nof the employment opportunities but hesitate to do so. They hesitate to \nattempt to fulfill the great American dream because they wonder whether \nthat job which is out there and offered to them in which they feel they \ncan do a superior job may not provide that degree of coverage for a \nmember of their family, for their wife or for one of their children. As \na result, they turn down that opportunity. The American dream becomes \nsomewhat more remote and distant to them.\n  It is a victory for those older workers, in my State of Massachusetts \nand around the country who, as a result of downsizing, changes in \ndefense procurement, and changes in our commercial markets, become \ndown-sized and put out, effectively to pasture, and wonder whether they \nare going to be able to acquire any kind of health insurance because \nmaybe they are not as physically able as they were at an earlier period \nof time. These older workers--who have worked hard, paid their dues \nover the long period of time and who may be a little ill--now have this \nanxiety--just when they are looking at their golden years in \nretirement.\n  It is the entrepreneur, the individual who wants to start up their \nown business but knows that because a member of their family has some \nillness, they are virtually prohibited from acquiring any kind of \nhealth insurance. Today, their hopes and dreams are further diminished.\n  When the final vote on the Kassebaum-Kennedy is taken later today, it \nwill pass overwhelmingly. It will pass because it is bipartisan \nlegislation. It will pass because it is supported by over 200 groups in \na broad-based coalition representing consumers, business,\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nlabor, and responsible insurance companies. It will pass because the \nconference committee agreed to limit the controversial medical savings \naccount proposal to a genuine test--not a full-blown program--and to \naccept meaningful portability reforms. Most of all, it will pass \nbecause the American public deserves and demands action.\n  I want to give special praise to the chair of our committee and the \nleading sponsor of this bill, Senator Kassebaum. It was her leadership \nthat resulted in a unanimous vote from our committee. It was her vision \nand commitment that made it possible for this bill to pass the Senate \nwithout crippling amendments. She was tireless in her efforts to reach \na constructive compromise to get a bill that all of us can support. As \nshe nears retirement from the Senate, this bill is her gift to the \nAmerican people. The American people owe her a great debt of gratitude, \nand I'm proud to have served with her on the Labor Committee for all \nthese productive years.\n  This bill will end many of the most serious health insurance abuses \nand provide greater protection to millions of families. It is an \nopportunity we can't afford to miss.\n  The abusive practices addressed by this bill create extensive and \nunnecessary suffering. Ending them will bring greater opportunity and \npeace of mind to millions of Americans. Twenty-five million Americans a \nyear will be helped by the provisions of this bill. Everyone knows a \nfamily member or friend who has been hurt because of the abuses this \nbill will end.\n  Millions of Americans are forced to pass up opportunities to accept \nnew jobs that would improve their standard of living or offer them \ngreater opportunities because they are afraid they will lose their \nhealth insurance. Many others have to abandon the goal of starting \ntheir own business because health insurance would be unavailable to \nthem or members of their families.\n  Parents who have a child with a health problem worry that their son \nor daughter will be uninsurable when they are too old to be covered by \nthe family policy. Early retirees find themselves uninsured just when \nthey are entering the years of the highest health risks. Other \nAmericans lose their health insurance because they become sick, lose \ntheir job, or change their job--even when they have faithfully paid \ntheir insurance premiums for many years.\n  With each passing year, the flaws in the private health insurance \nmarket become more serious. More than half of all insurance policies \nimpose exclusions for preexisting conditions. As a result, insurance is \noften denied for the very illnesses most likely to require medical \ncare.\n  The purpose of such exclusions is reasonable: to prevent people from \n``gaming'' the system by purchasing coverage only when they get sick. \nBut current practices are indefensible. No matter how faithfully people \npay their premiums, they often have to start over again with a new \nexclusion period if they change jobs or lose their coverage.\n  Eighty-one million Americans have conditions that could subject them \nto such exclusions if they lose their current coverage. Sometimes these \nconditions make them completely uninsurable.\n  Insurers impose exclusions for preexisting conditions on people who \ndon't deserve to be excluded from the coverage they need. Sometimes, \ninsurers deny coverage to entire firms if one employee of the firm is \nin poor health. Even if people are fortunate enough to obtain coverage \nand have no preexisting condition, their policy can be canceled if they \nhave the misfortune to become sick--even after paying premiums for \nyears.\n  One of the most serious consequences of the current system is ``job \nlock.'' Workers who want to change jobs must often give up the \nopportunity because it would mean losing their health insurance. A \nquarter of all workers say they are forced to stay in a job they \notherwise would have left--because they are afraid of losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  When we originally debated this legislation on the Senate floor, I \nspoke of just a few of the millions of Americans who have been \nvictimized by the abuses in the current system.\n  Robert Frasher from Mansfield, OH works for an employer who offers \nhealth coverage to employees. But the insurance company won't cover him \nbecause he has Crohn's disease.\n  Jean Meredith of Harriman, TN and her husband Tom owned Fruitland \nUSA, a small convenience store. They had insurance through their small \nbusiness for 8 years. But Tom was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma, and their insurance company dropped them because they were no \nlonger profitable insurance risks. Without health insurance, Tom \nMeredith had to wait a year to get the surgery he needed. After \nspending $60,000 dollars of his own funds, his cancer recurred and he \ndied a year ago. Tom Meredith might still be alive today, if he hadn't \nbeen forced to wait that year.\n  Diane Bratten from Grove Heights, MN and her family have insurance \nthrough her employer. Because of a history of breast cancer now in \nremission, Diane and her family would not be able to get coverage if \nshe decided to change jobs or was laid off.\n  Nancy Cummins of Louisville, KY lost her health insurance when her \nhusband's employer went bankrupt. When their COBRA coverage expired, \nthey were uninsured for 3 years until they qualified for Medicare. \nDuring this period, she suffered three heart attacks, which left their \nfamily with $80,000 in debts.\n  Jennifer Waldrup of my home state of Massachusetts was covered by her \nhusband's health insurance until his employer went out of business. \nWhen she applied for coverage under her own policy, she was turned down \nbecause she had multiple sclerosis. Her employer tried to help, but \ncould not find an insurer who would insure here. Her husband had to \ncash in his life insurance to pay her medical bills.\n  Tom Hall of Oklahoma City testified before our Committee. He \nfaithfully paid for premiums for 30 years under the group policy of the \nconstruction business he co-owned. When the company dissolved and he \nbecame self-employed, the same insurance firm refused to give him \ncoverage because he had a heart condition. He lives in fear that his \nlife savings will be wiped out.\n  This legislation is a health insurance bill of rights for Robert \nFrasher, for Jean Meredith, for Diane Bratten, for Nancy Cummins, for \nJennifer Waldrup, for Tom Hall--and for millions of other Americans as \nwell.\n  Those who have insurance deserve the security of knowing that their \ncoverage cannot be canceled, especially when they need it the most. \nThey deserve the security of knowing that if they pay their insurance \npremiums, they cannot suddenly be denied coverage or be subjected to a \nnew exclusion for a preexisting condition when they change jobs and \njoin another group policy, or when they need to purchase coverage in \nthe individual market.\n  This health insurance reform bill corrects these fundamental flaws in \nthe private insurance system. It limits the ability of insurance \ncompanies to impose exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under the \nlegislation, no such exclusion can last for more than 12 months. Once \nsomeone has been covered for 12 months, no new exclusion can be imposed \nas long there is no gap in coverage--even if people change jobs, lose \ntheir job, or change insurance companies.\n  The bill requires insurers to sell and renew group health policies \nfor all employers who want coverage for their employees. It guarantees \nrenewability of individual policies. It prohibits insurers from denying \ninsurance to those moving from group coverage to individual coverage. \nIt prohibits group health plans from excluding any employee based on \nhealth status.\n  These rules are important for helping people with a wide range of \nhealth conditions. They also address the relatively new but serious and \ngrowing concern that genetic screening information will be used to deny \ncoverage to people who aren't sick yet--a concern that prevents many \nfrom getting the medical tests that could help protect them against \nfuture illness.\n  Also, because of this bill, victims of domestic violence will know \nthat they can seek help without jeopardizing their insurance coverage.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation guarantees that no one who \nfaithfully pays their premiums can have their insurance taken away or \npreexisting conditions imposed, even if they change jobs or lose their \njob.\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\n  There has been a sudden rush in recent day to claim credit for this \nbill as it reaches final action. This is not a partisan bill. It was \ndeveloped by a Republican Senator and a Democratic Senator. Members on \nboth sides of the aisle have made important contributions. But the \nAmerican people should be clear as to who fought to pass this bill--and \nwho fought to derail it.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill was approved by the Labor and Human \nResources Committee on August 2, 1995--exactly 1 year ago today. It was \napproved by a unanimous vote of 17-0. And then it languished for months \non the Senate calendar because Bob Dole and the Republican Senate \nleadership tried to kill it by a system of rolling, anonymous holds. In \nfact, it would still be on the Senate calendar today, if it had not \nbeen for the courageous leadership and timely intervention of President \nClinton.\n  Let there be no mistake about the facts. This bipartisan bill was \npassed because President Clinton led an all-out effort. And it almost \ndied because Bob Dole and the Republican leadership tried to kill it. \nThey blocked it for months because they were more concerned about the \nprofits of insurance companies than the health care of America's \nfamilies. The party that tried to slash Medicare was at it again.\n  President Clinton's eloquent call for action on the bill in the State \nof the Union Address on January 23d this year was the trumpet that blew \ndown the wall of Republican obstruction. The President focused the \nattention of both the press and the public on the legislation--and on \nthe secret maneuvers that were stabbing it in the back. The obstruction \nfailed. President Clinton's State of the Union Address lit a fire that \nBob Dole couldn't extinguish.\n  Two months later, on February 6, Bob Dole agreed in principle to let \nthe bill come before the Senate. At that time, hardly by coincidence, \nhe was in the middle of a difficult campaign in the New Hampshire \nprimary.\n  And even after he agreed in principle to bring up the bill, he still \nmanaged to postpone action for more than 3 months--until April 18--so \nthat insurance companies who profit from the abusive practices of the \ncurrent system would have more time to organize their opposition and \nprepare their poison pills.\n  One of the poison pills was medical savings accounts [MSAs]. The \nHouse and Senate Republicans tried to force Congress to swallow that \npill, even though it would clearly jeopardize passage of the entire \nreform. This radical and untried concept was fueled by lavish campaign \ndonations from the Golden Rule Insurance Company--one of the worst \nabusers of the current health insurance system. Authoritative, \nindependent analyses of the concept warned that widespread use of \nmedical savings accounts could easily drive up premiums for other \ncitizens by 60 percent or more. In the words of the Congressional \nBudget Office, medical savings accounts ``could threaten the existence \nof standard health insurance.''\n  The Republican plan lacked even the most basic consumer protections \nfor people who selected MSAs. Deductibles could be as high at $5,000 \nper individual and $7,500 per family. There was no limit on how high \ntheir total out-of-pocket costs could rise.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform bill is supposed to \nmake the insurance system better for the American people, not undermine \nit through untested programs or expose people to excessive health care \ncosts. But that is exactly what Senator Dole and the House Republicans \ntried to do. When medical savings accounts were proposed on the Senate \nfloor, Senator Dole led the effort--and was soundly defeated.\n  House Republicans also demanded other protections for the insurance \nindustry that would have made a mockery of the entire bill. Under their \nproposal, the promise of portability became a hollow one. Insurance \ncompanies could offer only one policy to sick people at a prohibitive \ncost. A family plan would have cost $18,000 a year under the Republican \nplan.\n  This scheme would have been a setup for the insurance industry and a \nsetback for health reform, if Democrats had not stood firm. The \nintransigence of the House Republican leadership stalled the bill until \nJuly 25--4 months after it passed the Senate. Until the last day of the \nconference, they continued their attempt to undermine the portability \nprovisions. Because President Clinton and Congressional Democrats stood \nfirm, the American people are the winners.\n  Obviously, this bill is not a cure-all for the health care system. \nBut it is an important first step on the road to further reform.\n  We all know the problems that continue to exist. Between 1990 and \n1994, the number of uninsured Americans rose 18 percent--from 34 \nmillion to 40 million citizens. The average person who becomes \nuninsured today will stay uninsured twice as long as in the 1980s. \nAccording to a recent study, the number of uninsured could rise by \nanother two-thirds--to 67 million Americans--over the next 7 years. The \npercentage of Americans with job-based insurance will fall from 61 \npercent in 1989 to 45 percent by 2002.\n  These trends will not change because of the legislation we are \nenacting today. Too many families will still be just one pink slip away \nfrom losing their coverage. Too many families forced into unemployment \nor retirement by corporate downsizing will not be able to afford the \ninsurance they need--even if they cannot be denied the right to \npurchase it simply because they are ill.\n  Tens of millions of other Americans have no coverage today because \nthey work for employers who won't provide it and because they can't \nafford it themselves. They will get no relief from this bill.\n  Too many senior citizens will continue to pay more than they can \nafford for the health care they need. Too many children will still not \nget the healthy start in life they deserve.\n  Across the landscape of America there is not a family that has not \nbeen affected by some preexisting condition, some illness, some \ndisability. There is not a family that does not know a neighbor or \nfriend that has not been presented with this kind of fear and anxiety.\n  So, Mr. President, we move this legislation forward, and we are very \nhopeful that when this measure is actually signed by the President of \nthe United States, we will be helping to lift that sense of anxiety and \nfear and frustration from among our fellow Americans when they have \nbeen turned down by the fiercest and most abusive policies of insurance \ncompanies.\n  We know that this legislation is not going to resolve all the \nproblems, but there will be those families, there will be those \nparents, there will be the members of the family, there will be the \nolder worker, there will be the entrepreneur who will know they can \nlook to the future with additional hope and anticipation in fulfilling \nthe American dream.\n  So, although this is not all of what some of us may have wanted, this \nis a meaningful, important piece of legislation that can make an \nextremely important and significant difference in the quality of life \nfor our fellow Americans. The passage of the legislation is the \nbeginning of a journey, not an end.\n  Next year I hope, under President Clinton's leadership, and I would \nsay a Democratic Congress, we will take the next step forward toward \nassuring every American family the basic right to health care.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I agree with the ranking member of the \nLabor Committee on some things. But the last part of his statement I \nwould, perhaps, have to have some question about.\n  I yield 5 minutes, now, to the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask if the senior Senator from Kansas \nwill yield to me for 10 seconds?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I will so yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy, I know your desire for next year, but \nI would remind you, you had the Senate and House for 2 years with the \nPresident, and you did not get anything done with health care. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to yield to myself. I think \nI have a right to recognition--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Massachusetts \nshould be warned the Senator from Kansas yielded to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today we fulfill a promise to the American \npeople. We bring greater security to American families. We offer peace \nof mind to\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\nhard-working, responsible men and women who are providing for \nthemselves and for their families.\n  There has been no question on either side of the aisle--or throughout \nAmerica--about the need to make necessary improvements in our health \ncare system.\n  The improvements in this legislation primarily focus on making health \ncare coverage accessible and affordable. It goes without saying that we \nhave the highest quality of care, the best technology, the finest \nhealth care personnel found anywhere in the world.\n  Our objective, then, is to initiate fundamental reforms in access to \nhealth care without doing irreversible harm to quality, research and \ntechnology. This legislation is an excellent first step toward \naccomplishing our objective.\n  Unlike the health care reform effort made 2 years ago, this \nlegislation does not harm the system in the process of reforming it.\n  Rather, this legislation meets the most pressing needs associated \nwith reform: Increased portability; limitations on pre-existing \nconditions exclusions; guaranteed renewability of health care \ninsurance; and, improved means for small businesses and self-employed \nindividuals to provide health care coverage, including long-term care.\n  I want to particularly thank Senator McConnell for his leadership and \nactive participation in these reforms, especially in the area of long-\nterm care. Likewise, I want to acknowledge the work done by Senator \nCohen toward preventing health care fraud and abuse. I want to thank \nSenator Grassley for the work he has done in the area of coordination \nand duplication of Medicare-related plans, and Senator Bond who has \nbeen instrumental in his work for administrative simplification.\n  This has certainly been a team effort--a valiant effort by Senators \nand hard-working staff. I am proud of what we have accomplished. Beyond \nthe critical reforms I have already outlined, this legislation also \ntakes a very important first step toward a program that I have long \nadvocated--that is the medical savings account. Medical savings \naccounts provide a fundamental way to make health insurance affordable \nto small business employees and self-employed individuals, and this \nbill provides for a 4-year demonstration project--a project in which \nself-employed individuals and companies of 50 or fewer can participate.\n  Mr. firm belief is that this project will prove the success of \nmedical savings accounts, and we will then be in a strong position to \nprovide MSA's for Americans everywhere.\n  Beyond these important reforms, this legislation also helps control \nthe cost associated with health care by creating new tools in our fight \nagainst health care fraud and abuse. While I would like to see our \nefforts to control fraud and abuse go much further, the provisions in \nthis bill represent a good starting point.\n  Along with providing these tools, this legislation improves the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs and the private health care system \nthrough uniform standards that will cut out much of the redtape in \nhealth care.\n  It is important to note, Mr. President, that this bill does not pre-\nempt State privacy laws. Instead, it provides protection for an \nindividual's health information.\n  Each of these changes represents a significant improvement over \ncurrent law. Combined they represent a strong first step toward \nreforming America's health care delivery system in a way that improves \nwithout destroying. And this is critically important to the American \npeople.\n  Two years ago they rejected the wholesale restructuring of our health \ncare system. They understood that reform, as it was proposed then, was \nthrowing the baby out with the bath water. It was tampering dangerously \nwith one-eighth of our Nation's economy, and a system that had the \nhighest standards of quality in the world. What we do with this \nlegislation is make the reforms they want--the reforms they need--\nwithout destroying all that is good and working in the current system.\n  With this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, we \nkeep our promise. We effectively address the problems facing the \nNation's health care system in an incremental fashion.\n  I am honored to be a part of this momentous effort--I appreciate all \nthe work that's been done by valiant staff members--and I am heartened \nby the positive, bipartisan way in which we have succeeded.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I am very, very surprised at my good friend from New Mexico, talking \nabout what has been achieved, that this has only been achieved under a \nRepublican Congress. Where were the Democrats? I will tell you where \nthe Democrats were not. They were not cutting Medicare and cutting \nMedicaid so we could have tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in \nthis country. And where the Democrats were not is waiting 8\\1/2\\ months \nto bring this bill up, which the Republicans are crowing about at this \ntime. That is where the Democrats were.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise in support of the Health Insurance Portability \nand Accountability Act of 1996. It makes elemental and much-needed \nimprovements in health care coverage for Americans by guaranteeing \n``portability'' of health insurance for employees who change jobs, and \nby eliminating the current practice of denying coverage to persons with \npreexisting health conditions. These were the areas in which there was \nby far the greatest consensus when the President's health care \nlegislation was considered in the Finance Committee in 1994, and I am \npleased that agreement has been reached to make these changes.\n  However, I am not pleased with the resolution of another issue in \nthis bill: the provision to prevent persons from renouncing their \nAmerican citizenship and moving abroad in order to avoid U.S. taxation. \nThat dubious practice has come to be called ``expatriation'' among \nmembers of the tax bar, although that is not a very illuminating term. \nThe word expatriate derives from the Late Latin expatriare, to banish. \nEx, out of. Patria, native country. Perhaps a term that better reflects \nthe tax consequences of the issue will emerge in time.\n  The conference report on the health legislation before us today \ncontains as a revenue offset the House expatriation version, rather \nthan the Senate provision. The Senate provision also was included in \nthe small business tax relief legislation marked up by the Finance \nCommittee on June 12, but it was later dropped in the conference on \nthat legislation. I am convinced that the House proposal will leave in \nplace a continuing tax incentive to renounce citizenship in order to \nevade taxes.\n  This issue gained notoriety in late 1994, when expatriation by \nseveral very wealthy individuals was widely reported. On April 6, 1995, \nshortly after the issue arose for the first time in Congress, I \nintroduced S. 700, a bill to close the loophole in the Tax Code that \npermits ``expatriates,'' as they have come to be called, from escaping \nU.S. taxation.\n  Although expatriation to avoid taxes occurs infrequently, it is a \ngenuine abuse. The Tax Code currently contains provisions, dating back \nto 1966, intended to prevent tax-motivated relinquishment of \ncitizenship, but these provisions have proven difficult to enforce, and \nthey are easily circumvented with the assistance of resourceful tax \ncounsel. One international tax expert described avoiding them as \n``child's play.'' Under current law, individuals may, by \nrenouncing their U.S. citizenship, avoid taxes on gains that accrued \nduring the period in which they acquired their wealth--and while they \nwere afforded the many benefits and advantages of U.S. citizenship. \nEven after renunciation, these individuals are permitted to keep \nresidences and reside in the United States for up to 120 days per year \nwithout incurring U.S. taxes. Indeed, certain wealthy Americans have \n``expatriated'' while still maintaining their families and homes in the \nUnited States. They need only take care to avoid being in the United \nStates for more than 120 days each year.\n\n  Meanwhile, ordinary Americans who remain citizens continue to pay \ntaxes on their gains when assets are sold, or when estate taxes become \ndue at death.\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\n  I regret to say that the expatriation issue has been and, in light of \nthe decision taken by the conferees on the health insurance reform \nbill, may continue to be the subject of more controversy than it \nprobably deserves. In the interest of making the record complete, I \nwill briefly review the history of the issue's consideration in the \nCongress.\n  On February 6, 1995, the President announced a proposal to address \nexpatriation in his fiscal year 1996 budget submission. Three weeks \nlater, on March 15, 1995, during Finance Committee consideration of \nlegislation to restore the health insurance deduction for the self-\nemployed, I offered a modified version of the administration's \nexpatriation tax provision as an amendment to the bill. My amendment \nwould have substituted the expatriation proposal for the repeal of \nminority broadcast tax preferences as a funding source for the bill. \nThe amendment failed in the face of united opposition by members of the \nmajority on the committee. The vote against the amendment was 11-9.\n  Later in the markup, Senator Bradley offered the expatriation \nprovision as a free-standing amendment, with the revenues it raised to \nbe dedicated to deficit reduction. Senator Bradley's amendment was \nadopted by voice vote.\n  After the Finance Committee reported the self-employed health \ndeduction bill, but before full Senate action and before our conference \nwith the House, the Finance Committee held a hearing to review further \nthe issues raised by expatriation. At our hearing, we heard criticisms \nof some technical aspects of the provision, as well as testimony \nraising the issue of whether the provision comported with Article 12 of \nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the \nUnited States ratified in 1992. Section 2 of Article 12 states: \n``Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.''\n  Robert F. Turner, a professor of international law at the U.S. Naval \nWar College, testified that the expatriation provision was problematic \nunder the Covenant because it constituted a legal barrier to the right \nof citizens to leave the United States. The State Department's legal \nexperts disagreed, as did two other outside experts who provided \nwritten opinions to the committee: Professor Paul B. Stephan III, a \nspecialist in both international law and tax law at the University of \nVirginia School of Law; and Mr. Stephen E. Shay, who served as \nInternational Tax Counsel at the Department of the Treasury under the \nReagan administration.\n\n  Given this division in authority, it seemed clear that the Senate \nshould not act improvidently on the matter. Genuine questions of human \nrights under international law, and the solemn obligations of the \nUnited States under treaties, had been raised. We therefore sought the \nviews of other experts. Opinions concluding that the expatriation \nprovision did not violate international law were received from \nProfessor Detlev Vagts of Harvard Law School and Professor Andreas F. \nLowenfeld of New York University School of Law. The State Department \nissued a lengthier analysis supporting the legality of the provision, \nand the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service \nreached a like conclusion.\n  However, there were contrary views, most notably the powerful opinion \nof Professor Hurst Hannum of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy \nat Tufts University, who first wrote to me on March 24, 1995.\n  This is where things stood when the House-Senate conference met on \nMarch 28, 1995. At that time, the weight of authority appeared to \nsupport the validity of the provision under international law, yet very \nreal questions remained unresolved. The underlying bill had to move at \ngreat speed. As my colleagues well know, the legislation restoring the \nhealth insurance deduction for the self-employed for calendar year 1994 \nhad to be passed and signed into law well in advance of the April 17, \n1995 tax filing deadline, so that self-employed persons would have time \nto prepare and file their 1994 tax returns.\n  The conference committee had to decide immediately whether to retain \nthe expatriation provision. There was no time for further inquiry into \nits validity under international law. We accordingly chose not to risk \nmaking the wrong decision, which might violate international law and \nhuman rights. We elected not to include the provision in the conference \nreport. The conferees instead adopted a provision directing the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation to study the matter and report back.\n  That decision, which was the only prudent one at the time, was met \nwith some not very pleasant criticism in the Senate. This was \nsurprising, since I believed it was axiomatic, particularly on our side \nof the aisle, that Government should proceed with great care when \ndealing with human rights--particularly the rights of persons who are \ndespised. The persons affected by the expatriation proposal--\nmillionaires who renounce their citizenship for money--certainly fell \ninto the category of persons who are easy to despise.\n\n  Since that time, a general consensus has developed that the Senate \nprovision does not conflict with the obligations of the United States \nunder international law. Professor Hannum, after receiving additional \nand more specific information about the expatriation tax, wrote a \nsecond letter on March 31, 1995 stating that he was ``convinced that \nneither its intention nor its effect would violate present U.S. \nobligations under international law.'' And in the interim, there has \nbeen time to consider other approaches to the problem. On June 1, 1995, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation published its report on the tax \ntreatment of expatriation.\n  Shortly thereafter, on June 9, 1995, Chairman Archer introduced an \nexpatriation bill that adopted a different approach than S. 700, which \nwas the bill introduced by the Senator from New York. A second Finance \nCommittee hearing on expatriation was held on July 11, 1995 to consider \nthe two competing approaches. The Senate thereafter incorporated in its \nversion of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 a slightly modified version \nof the bill I introduced. The Senate bill adopted the accrued gains \napproach rather than the House alternative as the superior response to \nthe problem. However, the House prevailed in conference and a version \nvery similar to the Archer bill was included in the final Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995, which was later vetoed by President Clinton.\n  That same House provision has now been incorporated in the conference \nagreement before us on the health insurance reform bill.\n  Adoption of the House expatriation proposal rather than the Senate \nproposal is being justified, in part, based on the fact that the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has scored it as raising substantially more \nrevenue than the Senate version. These revenue estimates are difficult \nto believe, because almost any member of the tax bar would concede that \nthe Senate proposal would deter tax-motivated expatriations far more \neffectively than the House proposal. In contrast to the Joint Tax \nCommittee, the Treasury Department estimates that the Senate proposal \nwould raise substantially more revenue than the House version. This \ncomports with the views of most tax experts.\n  Here is why I believe the House provision is unsatisfactory. Under \nthe Senate provision, an expatriate with a net worth of over $500,000 \n(or average annual tax liability in excess of $100,000) generally would \nbe taxed on his asset appreciation existing at the time of \nexpatriation. Alternatively, an expatriate could elect to continue to \nbe taxed as if a U.S. citizen--i.e., to be subject to worldwide tax on \nhis assets until their disposition. The provision also offers \nalternatives for delayed payment of the tax on accrued gains, with \ninterest.\n\n  Rather than impose a tax on accrued gains, the House bill attempts to \nbuild on the current law approach of taxing only a portion of the \nincome generated by assets of expatriates during the 10-year period \nfollowing expatriation. This approach will fail to eliminate the very \nsubstantial tax advantages that currently inure to persons willing to \ngive up their citizenship.\n  Under the House proposal, several categories of taxpayers would \ncontinue to owe no tax at all should the IRS be unable to prove a ``tax \navoidance motive'' for expatriating. As under current law, patient \ntaxpayers would avoid all tax on accrued gains by simply holding their \nassets for ten years. Gains recognized after that period\n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\nwould never be taxed by the United States. A wealthy expatriate needing \nmoney during the 10-year period could simply borrow money using his or \nher assets as security.\n  Under the House provision, no tax at all would be owed on income or \ngains from foreign assets following expatriation, as under current law. \nGiven the enormous incentive to own foreign assets, experienced tax \npractitioners would continue to find ways to convert U.S. assets into \nforeign assets in order to avoid tax on the income earned during the \n10-year period.\n  The House approach also would risk nonpayment of amounts owed, as it \nrelies on the voluntary payment of taxes for 10 years following \nexpatriation, well after the taxpayer has moved beyond the reach of \nU.S. courts. In contrast, the Senate version generally would not \nrequire looking beyond the facts at the time of expatriation, making it \nmuch more likely that taxes owed would be collected. Further, taxpayers \nwould be required to provide security for delayed payment of taxes.\n  Another flaw in the House bill is that it will unilaterally override \nexisting tax treaties. In its report on expatriation, the Joint Tax \nCommittee staff stated that the House version may ultimately require \nthat as many as 41 of our 45 existing tax treaties be renegotiated and \nthat it might be necessary for the United States to forego benefits to \naccomplish renegotiation.\n  As the first Senator to have introduced legislation to end tax \navoidance by so-called expatriates, and as one who urged that it be \nacted upon expeditiously, I am disappointed that the expatriation \nchanges I have sought, and that have been passed by the Senate on three \nseparate occasions, have been set aside in favor of far less effective \nmeasures. I believe the honor of the tax-writing committees is at issue \nhere. The action taken today will allow this issue to fester for some \ntime to come because the new rules will not measurably reduce the tax \nadvantages of expatriation.\n\n  On another matter, I also wish we could have addressed the issue of \nmental health parity in this conference report. In April, I voted for \nthe Domenici-Wellstone amendment to the Senate version of the \nunderlying bill. It would simply have required health plans to provide \ncoverage of mental health services equal to that provided for acute \nmedical services. The amendment got 65 votes.\n  Subsequent scoring of the amendment by the Congressional Budget \nOffice determined that it would be relatively expensive. Senators \nDomenici and Wellstone then prepared a scaled-down version of their \namendment which would have required health plans to provide equal \ntreatment only of annual and lifetime limits. This alternative would \nhave cost approximately one-tenth of what the original amendment would \nhave cost.\n  Unfortunately, this modest revised proposal was also unacceptable to \nthe majority members of the conference. Subsequent proposals by Senator \nDomenici to scale back the parity requirement even further were also \nrejected without the benefit of consideration by Senators appointed to \nthe conference, or even by our staffs. After the initial meeting of the \nconference in the Ways and Means room on July 26, 1996, the conferees \nwere never assembled to discuss this or any of the elements of the \nfinal conference agreement.\n  For these reasons, I chose not to sign the conference report on this \nlegislation. We could have done better on expatriation, and on mental \nhealth parity. Even so, I am prepared to vote for this legislation \nbecause its central features--the health insurance reforms--are \nimportant and overdue. I congratulate Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum \nfor their hard work and persistence on this legislation, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  The Presiding Officer. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Iowa, [Mr. \nGrassley] had wished to speak, because the State of Iowa has done some \nvery innovative things regarding the question of health care insurance, \nbut we are running out of time. He is going to address his full \nstatement and make it a part of the Record at some point as we find \ntime at the close of this debate. I would like to right now, though, \nyield 15 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nwe may not agree on the issues we just spoke of, but we agree on the \nissue I am going to speak of, and for that I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, about 8 months ago, I \nwent to a meeting in Gallup, NM, at an Indian hospital. I noticed \nsitting in the audience a very, very handsome Indian woman. My guess is \nthat she was probably 55, 58 years of age. And she stood up and said, \n``Thank you, Mr. Domenici.''\n  I said, ``What are you thanking me for?'' And she began to cry.\n  When she finished, she said, ``Thank you for asking the Indian Health \nService to give the modern drug called Clozaril to my schizophrenic \nson. He has been catatonic for 22 years. And thank you for giving him \nback to me. He is home now, and he is performing on almost a hundred \npercent in my house.''\n  Frankly, I did not deserve the accolade, but I was on a TV show just \nyesterday about the issue of ``should we stop discriminating against \npeople like that young Indian boy who is not on Indian health \ncoverage,'' and a representative of business said to me, ``Well, you \njust want to provide money for all these ladies that want to go see \ntheir shrinks.''\n  To which I said, ``You have not read my amendment, and most of the \nmentally ill people that I am seeing and have become friends with over \nthe last 15 years, whose children have manic depression, deep \ndepression, schizophrenia or one of the serious, serious mental \ndiseases which are almost universally accepted as being diseases of the \nbrain--you would not be talking about shrinks when it comes to the kind \nof treatment and care that psychiatrists, who have already disavowed \nFreud''--and I might say to my friend from New York, I am not reluctant \nto tell the psychiatrists in America that I believe Freud is dead and \nthat the treatment of mentally ill people does not require 50 visits to \nthe ``shrink,'' so to speak, but it does require that qualified doctors \nand health care centers diagnose and treat the severe mental illnesses \nas diseases.\n  All we ask for in this bill, of all the things we could have asked \nthem to provide, we asked for two things, and listen carefully, I say \nto my fellow Senators, because we are going to do this sooner or later. \nWe said, if you provide mental health coverage, you must provide the \nsame lifetime coverage as you do for everybody else covered, the same \ntotal lifetime coverage and the same annual coverage. That is all we \nasked for.\n  We did not ask, nor did we say, that for those who are worried about \nthe shrink, we did not say that you had to cover that. In fact, it is \nclear that they could require any kind of copayments they want. They \ncould require a number of visits being exempt from coverage, if that is \nwhat worries them. All we said is if you cover them, don't discriminate \nagainst them, and then when they are in the fourth year of a serious \nillness say, ``Oops, there's no more coverage, we only gave you $50,000 \nworth of lifetime coverage.''\n  Incidentally, that is ordinary for American insurance today. While \nthey cover the other ones for $1 million if you have cancer or heart \ntrouble or you have a transplant--$1 million--in the same policy, they \ncover mental illness, however, $50,000 for your life. If that is not \ndiscrimination, I have never seen it, and if that is not a denial by \nour community of a reality and hiding your head, then I cannot believe \nit.\n  I honestly believe that the mentally ill should get more protection \nthan these two components of what we offered the conferees by way of \nresolution, and I might say, none of my remarks are directed to Senator \nKennedy, Senator Moynihan, or Senator Kassebaum. I believe we would \nhave received this treatment had they been the ones making the \ndecision.\n\n  But I will say to the American business community, you have some \nlobbyists representing you that it seems to me, at least, when they \nonce get a set of facts in their heads, they forget to use their \nbrains. And so what they say is, what Domenici offered with Wellstone \non the floor cost too much.\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\n  And then I say, ``Did you look at what we offered in compromise?''\n  ``What compromise?'' While they have been saying in the newspapers it \nwill bankrupt them.\n  Frankly, there are many great American businesses toward which these \ncomments are not directed. There already are major ones that cover with \nfull parity, not just parity of annual and lifetime caps, and I do not \naddress these remarks at them. But I submit, you have to face up to \nreality and get away from the fear that comes with talking about people \nwho have severe mental illness and the trepidation and consternation. \nJust look around your neighborhood, for the CEO's of American \ncompanies, look among the hierarchy of your company, and if you don't \nfind somebody who has a relative with schizophrenia or severe manic \ndepression or severe clinical depression or bipolar illness, then you \nare a rare, rare exception to the society of the United States, because \nthat is the way it really is.\n  I have been privileged to meet thousands of relatives of the severely \nmentally ill of this Nation. We think at any given time there are \nbetween 3 and 5 million people with severe illnesses. Frankly, I want \nto send them a little ray of hope. I don't want them to think we are \ngoing to remain as we have been forever.\n  So, today, with the Senate's permission, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be permitted to send a bill to the desk and that it be reported to \nthe appropriate committee. I do not ask for any special favors today. \nBut it is very simple.\n  All it says is if employers and the insurance community cover the \nmentally ill, they can set whatever standards they want. They can deny \ncoverage for the first 10 visits to a medical doctor psychiatrist if \nthey choose, but they cannot say that your total lifetime coverage is \nany different than the coverage for the other more well-known and \nlonger defined physical ailments, and the same with the annual payment.\n  That is the bill I am sending, with my observations. This is for \nSenator Wellstone and about eight other Senators who join me, and \nSenator Moynihan joins now. I am asking Senator Kassebaum and Senator \nKennedy to hold hearings as soon as we come back in September, and I \nbelieve they are going to.\n  That means we are going to bring this little bill out of that \ncommittee, hopefully with their support, and we are going to present it \nagain, even in September, when we are trying to get out of here.\n  So for those in the business community who think they have seen the \nlast of this, just get those fellows ready for September so they will \nhave something to do around here.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Will you allow the Senator from Connecticut, the insurance \ncapital of this country, to be listed as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You have it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will you be kind enough to include me as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Kennedy, Senator Grassley, Senator Kassebaum, I \nam delighted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask it \nbe referred to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the bill will be received \nand will be referred.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be remiss if I did not thank a lot of Senators, \nbecause many have been asked about this and many are going to support \nthis.\n  I want to say this is a great bill, the bill we are going to pass \ntoday.\n  I just want to make one reminder again to those who oppose the bill \nthat I sent to the desk. There are some representing the business and \ninsurance who say they do not want any mandates. What is the bill we \nare passing today? What is the bill we are passing today? Is it not a \nmandate? Of course it is a mandate.\n  Let me tell you, nobody is even talking about the cost anymore \nbecause it is so right. But it will cost a lot more than what that \nlittle bill Domenici sent to the desk will cost. To spread the risk of \npreexisting conditions is going to cost a lot of money, but we think it \nis the right thing to do. Somehow they do too, the business community \nand the insurance community. So let me now yield the floor and say, I \nam very, very grateful for the chance to present this again, soon. And \nI thank Senator Kassebaum for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to join what I know is the \noverwhelming number of Members here in saluting the Senator from New \nMexico as well as our good friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone. I \nthink many of us still remember the eloquence with which the Senator \nmade his impassioned plea when the Senate debated his amendment. He has \nbeen committed and dedicated to the sensible and responsible health \npolicy that includes mental illness. And he is absolutely correct.\n  I look forward to working closely with the Chair, Senator Kassebaum, \nto move that legislation out and look forward to standing side by side \nwith him as we hopefully will pass that legislation. I think he has \ndone a great service for the Senate. I join in commending him for his \neloquence, as well as Senator Wellstone. I see the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller. I yield the Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I just simply say this. This is not small, this legislation, Mr. \nPresident. It is not universal health coverage, but it is going to \naffect between 25 and 30 million Americans, and about 300,000 West \nVirginians. And it is extraordinary that it is being done.\n  Usually, in the past, we have passed a bill or tried to, and then \nfailed. We have backed away from action. This year we did not. Because \nof Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, we came forward and we took \non a hard job. And they did it. And they deserve enormous praise.\n  It means that I am going to be able to call Karen McPeak, who I spoke \nwith today. She and her husband have two children, two boys. They have \nhepatitis and hemophilia. They were making $80,000 a year between them, \nhad two cars, a house, savings, the rest of it.\n  Because they could not get their two boys insured because they had \npreexisting conditions, they went through their savings, they then lost \ntheir house, they lost both their cars, they then gave up their jobs. \nThey went on Medicaid in order to take care of their two sons, all of \nthis because they are good parents. And that is the only way open to \nthem in the system today.\n  This bill will change forever what will happen with the McPeak \nfamily. The children will be covered. The parents will be able to go \nback to the life that they knew. This couple is only one of those in \nWest Virginia. And I rejoice along with them.\n  I close by simply saying this. I can report back to West Virginians \nnow that we have branded a preexisting condition something which \ninsurance companies will insure. The portability of health insurance \nfrom one job to another is something which we will vote on and make the \nlaw of the land.\n  I know there have been difficulties. I know there have been disputes. \nBut today I think it is important to celebrate what it is that we in \nfact have actually done. And then tomorrow let us move on to the \nbroader field of universal health care coverage in one way or another. \nBut let us do that.\n\n  I have no way of expressing my respect to the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Kansas, both of them giants on this. \nAnd America and West Virginia are better off. And I am very proud to be \nassociated with voting for this bill. I thank the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by quickly commending our colleague from \nNew Mexico, who has now left the floor. But\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\nI just want to associate myself with his remarks and, as he mentioned \nat the time, to become a cosponsor of his bill. And I deeply appreciate \nhis efforts and the efforts of Senator Wellstone on behalf of the \nmentally ill in this country and their families.\n  I am sure I speak for many of our colleagues here when we commit to \nhim and others that worked so hard on this that this will be a \npriority, and as the Senator from New Mexico stated so eloquently, it \nwill happen, and will pass. We regret that it is not happening today.\n  Second, Mr. President, while we are still a number of weeks away from \nthis Congress adjourning sine die, I want to use the opportunity here \ntoday to say to our colleague from Kansas--and I do this with some \nreluctance because I do not want her career to be placed in jeopardy by \nhaving the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee \ncommending her too flowingly and put her in some jeopardy with her \nconstituency--but this is yet one more example of her leadership, this \npiece of legislation.\n  It is entirely fitting and proper that, in fact, her name is so \nclosely associated with this bill, as it has been with so many pieces \nof legislation over her career that have benefited so many millions of \npeople in this country and abroad. I am very proud of the fact that \nthis last day before we adjourn for several weeks that we are \ncompleting a piece of legislation that bears her name, and that \nmillions of people, millions and millions of people, will be benefited \nas a result of this effort.\n  Second, Mr. President, it is hard to mention the subject of health \ncare at any point over the last three decades and not mention the name \nof the cosponsor of this bill. For more than 30 years every single \nmajor effort, every single major effort that I can think of that \ninvolved improving the quality of health care for Americans has borne \nthe name of Edward M. Kennedy.\n  It is certainly no accident that this piece of legislation bears his \nname as well. It is not an abstraction, this effort. He knows painfully \nwith his own family and children how difficult these issues can be. I \nam just proud that this body finally acted after so many months, months \nthat in my view should not have been wasted in dealing with an issue \nthat should have joined every Member of this body, regardless of party \nand ideology, to support the simple propositions that people with \npreexisting conditions, that people who lose jobs ought to be able to \ncarry with them the basic kind of health care that would relieve them \nand their families of the stark fear of being caught in the cracks, of \nbeing uncovered, at the time of a medical crisis.\n  It was 31 years ago, Mr. President, that Medicare became the law of \nthe land. Obviously, that piece of legislation was in many ways far \nmore comprehensive than the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation. But there is \na similarity between these two proposals and bills. By the stroke of a \npen, Lyndon Baines Johnson, on that day in 1965, by the stroke of a \npen, he literally placed millions and millions of people beyond the \nfear of a health care crisis. The mere stoke of his pen enfranchised \nmillions of people and protected them from health care crises.\n\n  Today when we pass this bill--and within days or hours, I hope, the \nPresident of the United States, President Clinton, who has been such a \nstrong supporter of this effort, will sign this legislation into law, \nand 25 million Americans immediately will be protected, immediately \nprotected. There is no requirement that we go through a lot of agency \nactivity and bureaucracy and regulations. But merely by passing this \nlaw and signing his name, we will relieve the fear and burden for 25 \nmillion Americans. And for that I say, a deep sense of thank you to \nSenators Kassebaum and Kennedy for their efforts and their battle. \nThank you.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the thoughtful \ncomments of the Senator from Connecticut who has been a very dedicated \nmember of the Labor Committee, who has worked to get this accomplished \nfrom the very beginning. I appreciate his valuable support and efforts.\n  I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Simpson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas who came \nhere when I did. We exit together as we entered together. It has been a \ngreat privilege to serve with this remarkable woman and see the \nlegislative history that she leaves; and my friend from Massachusetts, \ntoo, who I have enjoyed thoroughly in my time here, even though \ncertainly there are times when he tests every bit of my patience, and \non more than many occasions. But I will miss him, too. I commend them \nboth.\n  I just want to briefly follow up on the comments of the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I had made some comments yesterday about my disappointment \nwith one aspect of this conference report. We have had such a \nproductive week here, and on so many things. But I do feel a sense of \nreal hollowness over the failure to include even some modest version of \nthe mental health parity in this bill.\n  I am a cosponsor and I spoke on the bill originally when it passed \nhere 68-30, a sweeping definition there, when it was approved. Senators \nDomenici and Wellstone worked doggedly trying to assure that at least \nsome limited form of that amendment came through this process. It had \nbeen my privilege to assist them in that cause. They have worked very \nhard.\n  The events of the last few days show again that the wall of \ndiscrimination against the mentally ill is very real. It is still too \npowerful for any of us to overcome, apparently. That is a very sobering \nfact.\n  I know my colleagues will not give up this fight, none of us will, \neven though this singular battle has been lost. I pledge I will \ncontinue to assist them. There is a great deal of work to be done in \neducating and enlightening the American people on the realities of \nmental illness.\n  It is troubling and disturbing to me that there still continues to be \nthis stigma associated with mental illness. The unspoken message here \nis that people afflicted with mental illness are somehow not as worthy \nof treatment as those afflicted with cancer or heart disease or other \nphysical ailments. No one in this Chamber would consciously ever say \nsuch a thing, but this is the message we are sending through our \nactions.\n  That is why it is so important for this Congress to revisit this \nimportant issue. We should certainly not let this bill and its silence \nwith respect to mental health be any kind of final word on this issue. \nWe will revisit this one in September.\n  I commend my colleague from New Mexico, and again thank Senator \nKassebaum and Senator Kennedy for this remarkable work product which we \nall deeply appreciate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes and 19 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Kennedy-Kassebaum--what a team. What an achievement--25 million \npeople protected because, working together in a bipartisan way, they \nhave broken the gridlock here in Washington.\n  Nancy Kassebaum, who always exhibits grace, civility, and decency, \nand Ted Kennedy, an absolute lion in this Chamber on whatever issue he \ndecides to weigh in on, thank goodness they weighed in on these issues \nof portability, so the people, when they change jobs, can take their \nhealth insurance policy with them. And preexisting conditions--millions \nof Americans will no longer be precluded from coverage because of a \npreexisting condition. This Senate should thank you both. America \nshould thank you both.\n  I would be remiss if I did not register disappointment, as well, \nbecause we did pass on the floor of the U.S. Senate by a vote of 68 to \n30, a sweeping change, to say that those who suffer from mental illness \nwill not be discriminated against. A mental illness should be treated \nthe same way as a physical illness.\n  Mr. President, 68 to 30, this Senate spoke with their votes and said, \n``No more discrimination.'' Yet, when we look at what came back from \nconference, through no fault of the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthrough no fault of the Senator from Kansas, what came back from the \nconference\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\ncommittee on mental health is the square root of zero--nothing, not \neven the most modest achievement, not even the most modest advancement.\n  I am very pleased to join Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone in \ncosponsoring a bill that seeks to address this question when we return \nin the fall. Let me just say again, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nKassebaum, I am confident, will be lions in that effort, as well.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Health \nInsurance Reform Act. There are three reasons why I support this bill. \nIt makes health insurance portable--people can take it with them from \njob to job. It provides health insurance to people with preexisting \nmedical conditions. And it makes health insurance more available to \nworking Americans. I am pleased to vote for this bill.\n  Health insurance is a priority for Maryland's families. It's a top \npriority for me. I strongly support this commonsense health insurance \nreform. It's a safety net for working Americans and their families. \nThis bill ends ``job lock.'' Working Americans won't be afraid to \nchange jobs. They no longer have to fear that they'll lose their health \ninsurance coverage if they do.\n  I know a mother in Baltimore who supports her family in a \nmanufacturing job. Her husband stays home and cares for their disabled \nchild. She has been offered a higher paying job. But she can't take it. \nI think that's outrageous. She knows if she changes jobs that her son \nwill lose the health coverage he so desperately needs. This bill is \ngood news for people like her. She could make that job change under \nthis bill.\n  This bill helps people who have preexisting medical conditions. They \nwon't be penalized any longer by insurance companies. They can now get \nhealth insurance if they have a disease like diabetes. I am pleased \nthat the bill has the potential to help millions of women and their \nfamilies. The legislation will help a woman who starts a new job with \nan employer who provides health insurance.\n  Under the Health Insurance Reform Act, a woman or her family can't be \ndenied insurance coverage. She and her family can't be denied coverage \nfor a preexisting condition. A woman who is pregnant will get immediate \ncoverage for pregnancy care even if she is already pregnant. Her \nnewborn or adopted child will also receive health insurance coverage. \nThis just isn't good for families. It makes good business sense.\n  The bill makes health insurance more available to working Americans. \nIt goes along way to eliminating barriers to coverage. There are more \nthan 40 million Americans without health insurance. More than 1 million \nworking Americans lost their insurance over the last 2 years. Workers \nwho are self-employed will be able to take a greater tax deduction for \nhealth expenses. It treats long-term care expenses as medical expenses \nfor the purposes of tax deductibility. This bill helps those who \npractice self-help.\n  I was disappointed that we were not able to enact comprehensive \nhealth insurance reform. After that debate came to a close, I pledged \nto continue the fight to reform health care--day after day and month \nafter month. This is an important first step in that direction. I thank \nmy colleagues Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their hard work \nin bringing us this far. But didn't get here without tremendous \nstruggle.\n  Despite broad bipartisan support, this bill has been held up for \nweeks and months. But we persevered. I wanted to get this bill passed \nthis year. And now we have done that. We have won the day. And helped \nmany Americans gain accessibility and portability to health insurance \ncoverage.\n  There is much more that I would like to be able to do to make \ninsurance coverage affordable, accessible, portable and undeniable. I \nwould like to see coverage for long-term care. I would like to see a \ncomprehensive benefit package for women and children. But this is a \nvery important step. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve the \nlives ofmany Americans. I am pleased to support this bill.\n  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will today \napprove the conference agreement on S. 1028, the Health Insurance \nReform Act. Since the House of Representatives has already acted \nfavorably on this legislation, it will be only days before President \nClinton can sign this important legislation into law. This new law will \nhave been a very long time in coming.\n  We need not review the circuitous path that these health reforms have \ntaken since the Clinton administration took over in 1993. But I believe \nit is fair to say that even these limited reforms could never have \nhappened without the leadership of the President and First Lady, who \nbrought into virtually every American home their passionate and \npersuasive pleas to reform our Nation's health care system. And without \neffective and devoted legislative warriors, led over the decades by \nSenator Kennedy and joined in recent years by our distinguished \nChairwoman, Senator Kassebaum, I believe that we would not be here \ntoday passing this bill.\n  Mr. President, as my 36 years on the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee draw to an end, I could not be more pleased that we will \nfinally see the fruition of so many years of work on health insurance \nreform issues. The bill before us will correct many of the flaws of our \ncurrent system, including enhancing portability of insurance from job \nto job, and limiting the current practice of permitting exclusions for \npreexisting medical conditions. But, as I have said many times before, \nthis bill does not accomplish many other things that need to be done. \nMost notably, the bill does nothing to make insurance more affordable \nto people who need it, including those with preexisting medical \nconditions. Just today, I got a phone call from a constituent from \nPawtucket, RI, who has a thyroid condition and who wants to know \nwhether under this legislation, her insurer will be able to charge her \nmore. I regret very much that I will have to tell her that her insurers \ncan, indeed, charge her more. And I regret very much that I will have \nto report to the many Rhode Islanders who support the Domenici-\nWellstone mental health parity provision that opposing forces prevailed \nin deleting this provision from the conference agreement.\n  Health care reform being the lightning rod issue that it is, I \nrecognize--and I hope that the American people recognize--that while \nthis bill represents only incremental change, it is an important step \nforward. We all know that much, much more needs to be done if every \nAmerican is to have access to high quality, affordable health care. And \nI hope that my colleagues who will remain in the Senate and that those \nwho succeed me will take up the challenge as early as possible in the \nnext Congress.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I want to thank all of my colleagues \non the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, who approved this \nbill unanimously just 1 year ago. And I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank the many committee staffers who assisted us so \nably in crafting this important legislation. I offer a special tip of \nthe hat to Senator Kennedy's senior health adviser, David Nexon, who \nhas been of such great assistance to me and to my staff over these many \nyears.\n  I look forward to voting for this legislation and even more, to its \nbecoming law.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, in the spring of 1995, the Medicare \ntrustees, on a bipartisan basis, issued an urgent warning that the \nMedicare hospital trust fund will go broke by the year 2002, unless \nmajor changes are made to protect the system. Since that alarm was \nsounded, the Congress has been wrestling with ways to bring Medicare \nspending under control, in order to forestall impending bankruptcy and \nto strengthen Medicare for both current and future beneficiaries. This \nyear the situation is even more critical. The 1996 trustees' report \nprojects bankruptcy for the trust fund by the year 2001.\n  I stated at the time of the trustees warning that, at a minimum, we \nshould pass legislation to crack down on the fraud and abuse that \ndrives up the costs of health care for senior citizens and taxpayers. \nEstimates are that Medicare loses over $18 billion each year to fraud \nand abuse, and that fraudulent schemes cost the entire health care \nsystem and our economy as much as $100 billion each year.\n  Today, we are reaching a historic milestone by passing one of the \nmost comprehensive and tough anti-fraud\n\n[[Page S9511]]\n\npackages ever contemplated by Congress. It has been a long road--over 3 \nyears to be exact--but as the author of the antifraud and abuse \nprovisions I am proud that this Congress, in a bipartisan way, did the \nright thing.\n  Specifically, my proposal creates tough new criminal statutes to help \nprosecutors pursue health care fraud more swiftly and efficiently, \nincreases fines and penalties for billing Medicare and Medicaid for \nunnecessary services, over billing, and for other frauds against these \nand all Federal health care programs, and makes it easier to kick \nfraudulent providers out of the Medicare and Medicaid program, so they \ndo not continue to rip off the system. Most importantly, the bill \nestablishes an antifraud and abuse program to coordinate Federal and \nState efforts against health care fraud, and substantially increases \nfunding for investigative efforts, auditors, and prosecutors.\n  In early 1993, I first embarked upon writing an antifraud bill. This \nwas based on the recommendations of a health care fraud task force set \nup by the Bush administration and on an investigation by the Senate \nSpecial Committee on Aging, which I chair. That legislation became the \nbasis for the fraud and abuse section of all the Republican health care \nreform bills proposed in 1993 and 1994 as well as for the \nadministration's proposal. It was one of the few truly bipartisan \nissues contemplated during that contentious debate. In late 1993, the \ncriminal provisions of my bill passed the Senate unanimously as part of \nthe crime bill but were deleted during conference. Last year, my \nproposal passed Congress as part of the budget reconciliation bill and \nwere also used as framework by the administration in its budget \nreconciliation proposal. As we all know, the President vetoed that \nbill. Today, it stands as an integral part of the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nhealth insurance reform proposal, finally on its way to the President \nfor signature.\n\n  Health care fraud is an equal opportunity employer that does not \ndiscriminate against any part of the system. All Government health care \nprograms--Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPUS, and other Federal and State \nhealth plans, as well as private sector health plans, are ravaged by \nfraud and abuse.\n  Similarly, no one type of health care provider or provider group \ncorners the market on health care fraud. Scams against the system run \nthe gamut from small companies or practitioners who occasionally pad \ntheir Medicare billings because they know they'll never get caught, to \nlarge criminal organizations that systematically steal millions of \ndollars from Medicare, Medicaid, and other insurers. According to the \nFBI, health care fraud is growing much faster than law enforcement ever \nanticipated, and even cocaine distributors are switching from drug \ndealing to health care fraud schemes because the chances of being \ncaught are so small--and the profits so big.\n  The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nfor example, has cited problems in home health care, nursing home, and \nmedical supplier industries as significant trends in Medicare and \nMedicaid fraud and abuse. Padding claims and cost reports, charging the \nGovernment and patients outrageous prices for unbundled services, and \nbilling Medicare for costs that have nothing to do with patient care \nare just a few of the schemes that are occurring in these industries.\n  It is time that we crack down--and shut down--these schemes that are \nbilking billions of dollars from Medicare and other health care \nprograms. If we have asked honest health care providers to take cuts in \nreimbursement and asked Medicare and Medicaid recipients to pay more \nout-of-pocket costs to bring spending under control, we have an \nabsolute duty to ensure the American public that their health care \ndollars are not lining the pockets of criminals and greedy providers \nwho are manipulating the system through fraud and abuse.\n  The proponents of strong anti-fraud proposals responded to a mandate \nfrom beneficiaries that we need to control spending and ease the burden \non taxpayers. The anti-fraud provisions in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill \ndid precisely that in a reasonable, measured manner that did not \ninfringe on personal liberties nor penalize innocent mistakes.\n\n  The fraud provisions substantially mirror existing fraud statutes and \nare designed to give enforcement more precise tools to protect \nconsumers against fraud and abuse. The proposal simply provides \nadequate resources for prosecutors and investigators, long strapped by \nbudget cuts and under staffing, to go after serious patterns and cases \nof abuse. The bill closes loopholes in current law and provides \ncriminal penalties for a defined set of serious and egregious \nviolations, such as embezzlement and misappropriation of assets. \nProsecutors would continue to have an extremely high burden to prove \nthat the violations were committed knowingly and willfully.\n  Despite such a reasoned approach, we were inundated at the last \nmoment by scare tactics and blatant mischaracterizations. There were \nfull page ads depicting a doctor shackled in stocks claiming that \ndoctors would land in jail for committing honest mistakes. There were \neditorials that grossly distorted the intent and scope of the \nprovisions in a fashion that minimized the very real threat that fraud \nposes to our health care system and, indeed, to the solvency of \nMedicare. I am sympathetic to the concerns of physicians and other \nhealth care providers that the practice of medicine has become \nexcessively regulated. I also believe that physicians raise legitimate \nconcerns that too often managed care plans manage costs alone at the \nexpense of quality of care for patients and unduly limit physicians' \ndecisions on how to best treat their patients. To blame all of these \ntrends on the health care fraud provisions, particularly at the last \nstage in the negotiation process, was misguided and inaccurate. I am \nproud that my Republican and Democratic colleagues were not intimidated \nby these falsehoods and proceeded on a straight path to passing strong \nlegislation.\n  As the author of these provisions, and as someone who has been \ninvolved in the negotiations of these provisions over a 3-year span, \nthere are a couple of issues I wish to clarify as we debate final \npassage of the conference report.\n  First, the fraud and abuse control program established in the bill \ncontemplates increased collaboration between the Department of Justice \nand the Office of the Inspector General [OIG] in health care law \nenforcement. It was not my intention, however, to expand the legal \nresponsibility of the Office of Inspector General to private health \nplans. The jurisdiction of the OIG remains as it exists today, with \nonly those augmentations of its authority specifically authorized in \nthe bill.\n  Second, it was my intention that the costs covered by the funds \nappropriated to the Federal Bureau of Investigation provided for in the \nmandatory appropriation section include those associated with the \nhiring of additional agents and support resources as supplemental \nfunding to address the burgeoning health care fraud problem.\n  Third, the moneys from the control account which are directed to the \nOffice of the Inspector General are primarily intended to increase the \nability of that office to investigate health care fraud and ensure that \nMedicare funds are properly spent. If the Office of the Inspector \nGeneral is assigned the duty of preparing the advisory opinions, I \nwould expect the Secretary and the Attorney General to consider a \nspecific grant of funds for this purpose from any discretionary moneys \nin the control account as an addition to the amounts already available \nto the OIG. We would not want to see a reduction in the effort to \ninvestigate fraud, in order to provide staff for the advisory opinion \nfunction.\n  Finally, as the author of the original enhanced guidance to providers \nsection, I would like to make some affirmative and declarative \nstatements on the actual advisory opinion language. Although advisory \nopinions are an appropriate means of giving guidance to the industry on \nsome issues, it is clearly unwise to have the agencies in the position \nof opining on the intent of the person requesting the opinion. To have \na Government agency make an independent determination of what is in \nsomeone's head, based solely upon what that person chooses to tell the \nagency, is a highly questionable Government function.\n  That is why I want it clearly stated for the record of debate what \nhas been\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\nstated during conference and indeed what has been stated by advisory \nopinion proponents for the last 3 years that this issue has been \ndebated. Advisory opinion advocates have stated definitively and \nconsistently in conference and during many lengthy negotiations that \nthe advisory opinion provision does not require a finding of intent. \nNot only do I adhere to that view, I will do everything possible to \nensure while I am still here, and while this provision will be reviewed \nprior to implementation by the agencies, that such an expectation is \nfollowed. I will also ensure that after I am gone those who have \noversight authority here in Congress, and those who are in the \nleadership, make sure that such an expectation is followed.\n  I know that the Attorney General has spoken to the Speaker of the \nHouse, the Senate Majority Leader, the chairmen of the House and Senate \nJudiciary Committees as well as numerous members of the Ways and Means \nCommittee and Finance Committee about her concerns relating to the \nissuance of advisory opinions. None of the existing advisory \nopinion mechanisms available to the Federal Government require an \nindependent determination of intent. To reiterate, statements were made \nby the conferees that this was the expectation here as well. I, \ntherefore, expect the agencies to design a process for advisory \nopinions which does not require such a determination. I also expect \nthat this advisory opinion process will sunset 4 years after the date \nof enactment of this bill as is required by the bill.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I would like to applaud members for \nthis major antifraud victory. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, these provisions will yield billions in scorable savings. I am \nconvinced that the long-term savings are much greater, and that \nbillions more will be saved once dishonest providers realize that we \nare cracking down on fraud, and that they can no longer get away with \nillegally padding their bills to pad their own pockets. For years, I \nhave been saying that Federal law enforcement often feel like the mouse \nhas outsmarted the mousetrap, because they lack adequate tools and \nresources to penalize egregious cases of fraud. While I know that this \nbill does not solve this enormous and complicated problem, I can state \ntoday that the mousetrap has sprung.\n  I would like to thank Senators Roth and Dole, for all of their \nsteadfast support and assistance over the years; Alec Vachon of the \nFinance Committee and Harry Damelin of the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, for all their hard work and perseverance; Sue Nestor, \nformerly of the Finance Committee, for all her hard work before she \nleft the Senate; and Helen Albert, Mary Gerwin, and Priscilla Hanley, \nof my staff, for their dedication to passage of this important \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          mental health parity\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, when we in the Senate unanimously passed \nthe health insurance reform bill in April, we included an amendment \noffered by Senators Domenici and Wellstone that provided for parity \ncoverage for mental health services.\n  I was proud of our vote. We did the right thing by ensuring that \npersons who suffer mental illness are treated fairly by insurance \ncompanies.\n  The conferees stripped the Domenici-Wellstone amendment out of the \nbill. However, by our April vote, this Chamber made a commitment to \nfairness in insurance coverage for persons with mental illness.\n  The health insurance reform bill is about fairness. Just as the bill \nnow prevents insurers from dropping people's coverage when they change \njobs or for other reasons, the bill should also have prevented insurers \nfrom discriminating against persons suffering mental illness. Leaving \nthe Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity amendment out of the bill \nis wrong.\n  I know that the business and insurance communities raised some \nconcerns about the cost and impact of the Domenici-Wellstone amendment \nwith the conferees. I also know that Senators Domenici and Wellstone \nanswered every concern raised.\n  While I view the CBO estimate for the cost of the original amendment \nas extremely reasonable, I understand that Senators Domenici and \nWellstone offered a compromise to the conferees that would have \nprovided parity coverage only for annual and lifetime caps.\n  This compromise slashed the cost of the original amendment by 90 \npercent. CBO determined that the compromise would increase private \ninsurance premiums by four-tenths of 1 percent, of which employers \nwould pay only sixteen one-hundredths of 1 percent.\n  My fellow colleagues, these figures are so low, that employers could \nmeet this slight premium increase by raising their deductible by a mere \n$5 per year.\n  I understand that insurance and business interests also raised \nconcerns about the loss of workers' insurance due to the compromises' \ncost. Considering CBO's extremely low cost estimate, no one could \npossibly contend that passage of the compromise would cause workers to \nlose their insurance.\n  The compromise went even further. It permitted businesses to deliver \nmental health services through ``carveout'' arrangements and to adjust \ndeductibles, copayments, and visit limits for mental health services as \nthey saw fit. Small businesses would have been completely exempt from \nthe parity standard.\n  I believe that Senators Domenici and Wellstone should be commended \nfor developing a compromise that the conferees should have accepted.\n  Now, we have made a promise to persons suffering mental illness in \nthis country. We have promised they will treated fairly, just as this \nbill promises fairer health care coverage for other Americans.\n  I will personally join with Senators Domenici and Wellstone to ensure \nthat we make good on our promise.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, to our citizens outside of the beltway, \nWashington politics seem to be the cause of all that ails us. The \ndisease is easy to diagnose: Washington politics getting in the way of \nreal cures. However, I am pleased to stand up today and say that \nmaybe--just maybe--the games have paused as Congress finally passes \nthis incremental step in health care reform.\n  Health care reform. Three words that have become part of many's \nvocabulary over the last 3\\1/2\\ years. Obviously, health care reform \nefforts have been going on since the delivery of health care became \nsomething of an organized system. But Federal health care reform has \nnever seemed so necessary as it has in the past few years, and so \nviable as it is right now, for two critical reasons.\n  First--because the American public has been bombarded with rhetoric \nabout all of the things that are wrong with their health care system.\n  Obviously, the U.S. health care system is not without flaws, but I \nthink it is important that the treatment not be worse than the \nailments. The ``shot in the arm'' posed by the Administration during \nthe 103rd Congress in 1993 and 1994 was roundly rejected by the \nAmerican public. The Health Security Act, drafted by the First Lady and \nher team of elite health care reform gurus, was 1,342 pages of promises \nfor ``universal coverage'' for American citizens under a federal \nprogram of limited mandated benefits, price controls and tax increases. \nThe tome sent up to Capitol Hill prescribed that centralized \nbureaucracies run this national program, that the Federal Government \nregulate medical schools, and that Washington decide what \npharmaceuticals and medical procedures would be paid for.\n  This proposal would have resulted in a further disconnect between the \npatient and the payer. We have seen through other Federal programs that \nseparating those making demands on the system from those paying for the \ncare ends up both driving up costs and limiting the availability of \nservices. This is not what the American public had in mind as it got \ninvolved in asking Washington for positive change in federal policies.\n  Once the glitter and hype was peeled away, Americans realized \nthis proposal meant no choice in benefits or providers, higher taxes to \ngenerate revenue that would be shifted to pay for business subsidies \nand the like, and the inevitable result of government rationing of \nhealth care services. After a year of intense debate, the Health \nSecurity Act died a painful, but appropriate, death.\n\n  Second, having determined during the debate over President Clinton's \nHealth Security Act what the American public does not want, we were \ngiven the opportunity to provide the people with what they do need. And \nwhat they need is the Health Insurance\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996--the legislation that has \nbecome known as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.\n  This legislation grew out of the testimony that was heard in \ncountless Senate hearings on health care reform. It grew out of the \nrecognition that some basic flaws in the regulation of health care \ncaused American families monumental problems: workers are unable to \ncarry their health insurance from one job to the next--portability. \nIndividuals are subject to unfair discrimination in their access to \nhealth insurance if they have a medical condition that has required \ntreatment before they joined that health plan.\n  These are simple, clear concepts. We know how to address them. \nHowever, we also know that it took us 3 years of policy development to \nget to the point where there was a bill that was appropriate in scope, \nand met the majority of needs our constituents told us they had. A long \nand arduous process had resulted in legislation that also obtained \nsupport from our Democratic colleagues--it looks as though we are close \nto allowing policy to triumph over politics.\n  This legislation was further improved with cultivation. During \nconsideration of the bill on the Floor of the Senate, Members decided \nto act on some other ideas that had been long discussed as part of \nhealth care reform on both sides of the aisle. Medical savings accounts \nare not a new idea. More favorable tax treatment of long term care \ninsurance is not a new idea. Increasing the self-employed tax deduction \nto 80% to provide equity is not a new idea. But these are all important \nideas, that have received support on both sides of the aisle during the \nlast several years of debate.\n  Why are important aspects of health insurance reform like MSA's \nsuddenly so controversial? Because once again Washington politics got \nin the way of good policy work. Some Washington politicians have \ndecided it is more important to score a political victory than to pass \nthe type of health care policy that the American public wants: policy \nbased on freedom of choice; policy that ends discrimination and \npromotes fairness and equity; and policy that forges a stronger \nrelationship between patients, their physicians, and those who are \npayers for medical services, whether that payer be the individual \ncontrolling their own health care dollar, the Government, or an insurer \nwho has offered a plan tailored to best meet the consumers' needs.\n  Mr. President, I believe that through a great investment of time and \na tremendous amount of research we have found a cure for a great deal \nof what ails the American health care insurance system, and American \ncitizens can begin to benefit from these long sought after changes to \nthe health care system in the United States.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today hope is restored as we turn the \ndesire for health care reform into reality. When the Kassebaum-Kennedy \nbill is signed into law, which will happen very soon, some of the most \nmaddening, often cruel problems with America's health care system will \nbegin to get fixed.\n  When you look at all the hard work that went into getting this bill \nhammered out and on the brink of enactment, we could fill Olympic \nStadium with the people who deserve some of the credit. But two \nindividuals win the health reform gold medals in achieving this victory \nfor millions and millions of Americans. The senior Senators from Kansas \nand Massachusetts have been true champions in leading what turned into \na legislative marathon for health care reform. On behalf of the people \nof my State, and from my own heart, I thank both colleagues for their \nincredible feat.\n  Over the past few years, Americans had every reason to wonder if \nCongress would ever be capable of doing anything ever again about the \nhealth care problems that cause them so much pain. When the fight for \ncomprehensive health reform failed, it was hard to see how we could \never get out of the ditch of partisan politics, special interests, and \nfear that did us in.\n  But while plenty of special interests and politicians wanted health \ncare reform to die, millions of Americans were still waiting \ndesperately for something to be done.\n  The Senators from Kansas and Massachusetts realized that we had to \ntake a different tack. We had to target just a few of the most serious \nproblems in the health care system, and offer solutions that made \nobvious sense.\n  It took persistence, patience, cooperation, and compassion to get \nthis bill to this point today. With this legislation, millions of \nAmericans will be able to get the health insurance they desperately \nwant and need--or I should say that this will happen soon, since one of \nthe compromises was that the insurance reforms won't be effective until \nJuly of next year.\n  When that date is reached, the rules will change. Working Americans \nwill be freed from the trap that locks them into jobs and situations \nsolely because a change will mean losing their health insurance. \nPreexisting conditions will no longer mean an endless nightmare for the \nmillions of children and adults who have some illness or medical \nproblem that's the very reason they need health care. Small employers \nwon't be shut out from the health insurance marketplace.\n  When I talk about the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, I can picture the West \nVirginians--parents, children, small business owners, health care \nprofessionals--who have begged for help.\n  Now, I can report back to the West Virginian who shared his agony \nover not being able to get coverage for his cancer, because it was \nbranded a pre-existing condition, that the law will soon require an \ninsurance company to sell him that coverage. Now, I can send word to \nWest Virginians who want to switch jobs, move to a different community, \nor even start their own business that they can hold onto their health \ninsurance while they pursue any of these goals for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  And most importantly, now I can tell all West Virginians, and we can \ntell all Americans, that health care reform is not dead, it's not code \nfor gridlock, and it's not a pipedream.\n  The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill also represents the art and necessity of \ncompromise. Some proposals that would have helped numerous families \nwere dropped, because opposition just couldn't be overcome.\n  And one proposal, to open the door for medical savings accounts, \nworries me. It is labeled a ``demonstration,'' and I just hope that \nCongress will be honest and responsible about taking a true look at how \npeople do when they turn from conventional insurance to tax breaks and \ncatastrophic-only coverage. I know that most people don't plan on \ngetting sick or having an accident or developing a serious disease, and \nI fear that an MSA will go from being a financial benefit into an \noverwhelming burden for many Americans when the unexpected happens.\n  But I also know that we won't achieve any positive health reforms \nwithout making concessions. And the work will always be difficult. \nThere are too many insurance companies that want to chase after healthy \ncustomers, and avoid the sick. There will always be ideology that gets \nin the way of telling the private sector to do anything differently, no \nmatter how many families are hurting. There will always be fear of the \nunknown, no matter how many problems exist in the present.\n  Today, however, let's celebrate what is getting done. And then \ntomorrow, let's move on to the next round of health care reform. Today, \nlet's thank Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their gift to at \nleast 25 million Americans, and many thousands of West Virginians. And \nthen tomorrow, let's be inspired by their leadership to get even more \ndone for millions more who still suffer because they can't get or \nafford decent health care.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, 3 years ago, this Senate blocked \nattempts to act on comprehensive health care reform. While that year's \neffort to achieve the major reforms that are so needed and so long \noverdue did not succeed, the problems that led the President to make \nthat proposal have not disappeared. Far from it.\n  As a nation, we spend 15 percent of our gross domestic product on \nhealth care, over $1 trillion. No other industrialized nation spends \nmore than 10 percent of their GDP and the gap is widening. Yet today, \nthere are over 40 million Americans without health insurance, and over \n23 million of those Americans are employed. Over 1 million working \nAmericans have lost health care coverage over the past 2\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\nyears. And 60 percent or more of all Americans worry about losing their \ncurrent health insurance coverage. The case for reform, therefore, is \nperhaps even more compelling now than it was 3 years ago.\n  I am proud that today the Senate is taking a significant step toward \nreforming the health care system. The Kassebaum-Kennedy Health \nInsurance Reform Act is not the panacea for our health problems, but it \ndoes represent progress. It is an important step in the right \ndirection.\n  This bill has many good features. Perhaps the most important is the \nlimits on exclusions for preexisting conditions. This bill says that no \none can be denied health insurance coverage for more than 1 year due to \na medical condition. If there is any concern which every person has \nabout health insurance, it is the ``trap'' of preexisting conditions. \nAll too often, individuals find themselves excluded from coverage \nbecause of a preexisting condition. Some 81 million Americans have \npreexisting conditions that could affect their insurability. And more \nthan half of all American workers are enrolled in health insurance \nplans that impose some form of preexisting condition exclusion. When \nyou consider that most Americans will have seven or more jobs in the \ncourse of their working life, the preexisting condition problem affects \nvirtually every American family. The General Accounting Office [GAO] \nestimates that 21 million Americans will be helped by the limits on \nexclusions for preexisting conditions included in this health care \nbill.\n\n  In my own State of Illinois, almost 8 million people have private \nhealth insurance and almost 2 million are uninsured. This bill will \nmake a critical difference in their lives, and in the lives of \nsimilarly situated people all across the Nation.\n  This bill also includes portability provisions which will end ``job \nlock'' by making health coverage portable between jobs. For Americans \nwho might want to leave their jobs to start their own businesses--or \nwho might have to leave their jobs because of corporate restructuring--\nbut who might have a preexisting condition or a family medical history \nthat would currently make it difficult to impossible for them to \npurchase an individual health policy, this bill will make a huge \ndifference. It will guarantee their access to health insurance.\n  Families with a small child suffering serious health problems will no \nlonger face the prospect of being unable to obtain health insurance if \nthe parents change jobs. It is tough enough for families to deal with a \nserious health problem affecting one of their children without having \nto face the additional problem of losing access to health insurance if \nthey are laid off, restructured out of their jobs, or want to change \njobs for new or better paying jobs.\n  Similarly, this bill will guarantee that small businesses with only a \nfew employees will not lose their group health coverage because one of \ntheir employees develops a serious health problem, as is the case now. \nMoreover, it will help make health insurance more affordable for those \nsmall groups, making it more likely that more small businesses will \nprovide health insurance benefits for their employees. Furthermore, the \nincrease in the deductibility of health insurance expenses from 30 \npercent to 80 percent for self-employed individuals will make health \ninsurance more affordable for those thousands of people who operate \ntheir own businesses.\n\n  I am also pleased that members have been able to reach a bipartisan \nagreement on medical savings accounts [MSA]. Issues surrounding the \navailability of MSAs have held up movement on this important \nlegislation too long. The compromise provision would provide many small \nbusinesses and self-employed individuals access to more affordable \nhealth insurance options. The MSA options will provide valuable \ninformation as to the impact of broader scale high-deductible health \nplans on cost control and general insurability.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act represents a practical, caring \nattempt to deal with the real health care problems facing so many \nAmericans, based on their everyday realities. This bill is all about \nincremental reform--but nonetheless real reform. It will help virtually \nevery working American, as well as millions of Americans who are \ntemporarily out of the work force. And it will work because it is based \non what is actually going on in the world of people who need health \ncare.\n  It's worth thinking a bit about those everyday realities of life. \nStatistics tell us that the average American works at a job about 4\\1/\n2\\ years. As I stated earlier, over the course of a working career, an \naverage American working person could hold seven or more jobs. That \nfact alone makes it all too clear just how important it is for \nAmericans to have portable health care coverage. And that fact alone is \na good indication of how necessary it is to end preexisting condition \nrestrictions that result in Americans having to pay enormous sums for \nnew health care policies, losing access to health insurance altogether, \nor having to avoid--at virtually all costs--changing jobs in order to \nretain affordable health care.\n\n  Access to affordable health care is no less important to the American \npeople than pension planning, not only because Americans can't enjoy \ntheir retirement if they are in poor health, but because they face \nbeing bankrupted by health care costs if they are not able to retain \naccess to affordable health insurance. Being able to roll over \ninsurance coverage, therefore, is just as important as being able to \nroll over pension savings. Maintaining health security, therefore, \ndeserves the same level of attention we give retirement security, any \nmeasures that protect and enhance that health security deserve the same \nkind of consensus support.\n  Facing the loss of health insurance is a debilitating fear for all \ntoo many Americans, and without reform, it is all too great a risk for \nevery American. This bill will end that fear, and it does so in a \nmanner that makes sense and will work. It is far from the total answer \nto our health problems, but I do not think we should underestimate the \nimportance we will be achieving once this bill becomes law.\n  I want to conclude by congratulating the chairman of the Labor and \nHuman Resources, Senator Kassebaum, and the ranking democratic member \nof that committee, Senator Kennedy, for their leadership and for all \nthe hard work they have put in to bring the bill to this point. I want \nto particularly congratulate them for the bipartisanship they displayed \nin putting this bill together.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted to cast my vote for this \nbill--it is an important first step in ensuring health security for \nworking Americans.\n  Health security has always been, and always will be, a Democratic \npriority. It is at the top of our agenda, and we won't give up until \nevery American has access to meaningful, affordable coverage.\n  Unfortunately, even this small step was controversial.\n  Senator Dole promised 2 years ago that health reform would be the \nfirst thing Republicans would focus on if they controlled Congress. As \nit turns out, health reform was nearly the last thing they focused on. \nAnd only because we insisted they finally act.\n  This bill was approved unanimously in the Senate Labor Committee \nexactly 1 year ago on August 2, 1995. But for 8 months, secret \nRepublican ``holds'' delayed it.\n  When the bill finally reached the Senate floor on April 18 1996, the \nRepublican leadership tried to attach to the bill poison pills, like \nMSA's to kill it. Then, 4 more months passed as the Republican \nleadership tried to stack the conference committee to ensure that MSA's \nwere included in the final bill.\n  In the meantime, the Republican leadership tried to water down the \nbill's portability provisions to guarantee that health insurance can be \ncarried from job to job. But they did not succeed.\n  I am delighted and relieved these ``delay and destroy'' tactics were \nfinally abandoned and that Republicans joined us in fixing the most \nbadly broken parts of health system. Make no mistake--this bill is \nbadly needed.\n  One Republican Senator told the Washington Post last year that \n``Health care is not very bright on anybody's radar screen, if it shows \nup at all.'' That's not what I hear in South Dakota and across the \ncountry. This issue is still very much on the minds of Americans.\n  When health reform failed in 1994, Americans' problems securing \ncoverage\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\ndidn't go away. The problems fueling the health care and insurance \ncrisis still exist today. Forty million people are without insurance, \nand insurance remains prohibitively expensive for far too many people. \nThe public expects and wants us to tackle this issue.\n  The bill before us breathed new life into health reform efforts. \nStill, it does not come close to solving all our health care problems--\nit is a modest, incremental downpayment on reform.\n  But this bill does deal with one of the most pressing problems in our \nsystem--portability. Indeed, GAO says this legislation could help up to \n25 million Americans each year, at no cost to taxpayers. This bill \ngives workers dismissed from their jobs or looking for better jobs \npeace of mind.\n  This bill means that never again will fear of losing their insurance \ntrap people in their jobs.\n  Still, passage of this bill is the beginning of the debate, not the \nend of it.\n  Every single day in this country, 60,000 people lose their health \ninsurance. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of that group will be \nhelped by this legislation. We must do more to provide real health \nsecurity to every American.\n  As we celebrate this bill's passage, let us pledge to tackle even \nmore difficult issues. We must ensure that every child has health \ncoverage. We must eliminate barriers to pregnant women getting prenatal \ncare. We must make coverage more affordable for small businesses. We \nmust ensure every child is immunized appropriately. We must end cherry \npicking by insurance companies. We must ensure rural Americans have the \nsame access to quality care their urban neighbors enjoy.\n  In sum, we must guarantee every American access to affordable, \nquality coverage. This will be on the top of the Democrats' agenda in \nthe next Congress.\n  Despite its limitations, this is an important bill. It's a victory \nfor the President, who put this issue on our collective radar screens. \nIt's a victory for Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum, who worked so hard \nto make this happen. It's a victory for Democrats, who consider this a \npriority item.\n  Most importantly, it's a victory for America's working families.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted that Americans will finally \nreceive the benefits of the health care reforms contained in the \nKennedy-Kassebaum bill--benefits which the General Accounting Offices \nestimates will help over 21 million people.\n  But I want to talk today about one particular person who will benefit \nfrom this bill, a woman from Florence, MA, who wrote me recently about \nher daughter. She supports this bill, she said, because her daughter \nhas diabetes and the family had a terrible time finding health \ninsurance that would cover her. In her letter she told me, ``I think \nit's immoral for health insurance companies to cut off coverage even \nwhile the people they cover are paying their premiums. No health \ninsurance company should have the power to do this to their clients.''\n  Millions of Americans have medical histories or preexisting \nconditions that make it difficult to get comprehensive insurance \ncoverage. As many as 81 million Americans have preexisting medical \nconditions that could affect their insurability. Many people are locked \nin their jobs because they fear they will be unable to obtain \ncomprehensive insurance in new jobs. And many people who work in small \nbusinesses often have trouble getting insurance especially if 1 \nemployee has medical problems.\n  This bill takes very important steps forward to correct these \nproblems. But we must do more so that ultimately we have coverage for \nall Americans. Currently, 40 million Americans live without health \ninsurance, and 23 million of the 40 million are workers, according to a \nstudy by the Tulane University School of Public Health. Furthermore, an \naverage of more than 1 million children a year have been losing private \nhealth insurance since 1987. In Massachusetts alone, there are more \nthan 130,000 children--one-tenth of all the children in my State--who \nare without any health insurance, private or public, for the entire \nyear. And many more children lack health insurance for part of the \nyear. A recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association \nreported that almost one-quarter of U.S. 3-year-olds in 1991 lacked \nhealth insurance for at least a month during their first 3 years, and \nalmost 60 percent of those lacked insurance for 6 or more months. It is \ntime that we help the American people get the health insurance they \nrightfully deserve.\n  Mr. President, this Congress continues to have an unacceptable record \nwhen it comes to addressing the real needs of American workers and \nfamilies. Political divisions and Presidential politics have become an \neveryday feature of Senate floor action, making it impossible for us to \ndo much of the people's business. Fortunately, this bill is a notable \nexception.\n  Finally, I want to applaud the vision, commitment, and political \nsavvy of the distinguished chairman of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, Senator Kassebaum, whom I greatly admire, and the \ndistinguished ranking member of that committee, the senior Senator from \nmy State, who has been a leader for his entire career on health care \nissues. To a very considerable extent we all are in their debt as we \nsend this legislation to the President, because it was their \ncommitment, stamina, and statesmanship that worked past what again and \nagain appeared to be intractable differences of opinion among 535 \nmembers of the House and Senate. This is a tremendous victory for the \nAmerican people, but it is also a richly deserved personal victory for \nboth Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy. I will proudly vote to send \nthis bill to the President's desk for his signature.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, Yesterday, when the Senate passed \nwelfare legislation we took an important first step toward reforming \nour failed welfare system. Similarly, the health care reform bill \nbefore us today takes another important first step toward addressing \nsome of the serious flaws that exist in our Nation's health care \nsystem.\n  We must ensure that this health care bill becomes a step in the right \ndirection, a step away from excessive government regulation and a step \ntoward a health care system based on free-market principles that \nbenefits and empowers individuals.\n  I am very pleased that the conference report includes the foundation \nfor the full implementation of Medical Savings Accounts, this is the \nsingle most important feature of this legislation.\n  When we debated medical savings accounts in April, opponents of the \nprovision argued that anyone who want to include MSA's really wanted \njust to kill the Kassebaum bill. I believe that the conference \nagreement has proven them wrong.\n  This real issue behind medical savings accounts is a question of \nwhether health care reform should move toward greater government \ncontrol of our health care system, as President Clinton advocates, or \nwhether health care reform should place more decision making authority \nin the hands of individuals. Once individual Americans have the power \nto control how their own health care dollars are spent, they will never \nallow the government to take that power back.\n  I am certain that when the four year trial period for medical savings \naccounts ends successfully, the Congress will overwhelmingly endorse \nMSA's as an unlimited nation-wide policy.\n  Mr. President, while this conference report is a first step, it is \nnot too soon to consider what our next steps should be. We badly need \nmeaningful reform of our medical malpractice and antitrust laws as well \nas full deductibility of health care expenses for the self-employed.\n  The health care reform conference report will improve the health care \ncoverage available to individual Americans. But to preserve those \ngains, we must make sure that future health care legislation seeks \nfree-market solutions, not big-government solutions.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, like most bills, the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act contains both good and more \nworrisome provisions. Some of the better provisions, such as \nportability, are not perfect and others of importance, such as mental \nhealth parity, are now completely absent.\n  One important provision in this bill that has not received much \nattention is administrative simplification. It sounds innocuous enough. \nIt aims to\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\ncut administrative costs by standardizing the way medical information \nis electronically stored and transmitted. No one is against cutting \nhealth care costs.\n  This standardization, however, accelerates the creation of large data \nbases containing personally identifiable information. All this \ninformation is transmitted over electronic networks. We need to be very \ncareful about how safe and secure that information is from prying eyes. \nSome of it may be extremely sensitive and could be used in a malicious \nor discriminatory manner.\n  Not only do we need to hold this information securely, we also need \nto give individuals control over who actually has access to their \nmedical records. We have been working in this Congress this year to try \nto come up with federal privacy laws for medical records. Senators \nBennett, Leahy, Kassebaum, Kennedy, Domenici, Wellstone and Mack have \nall been concerned with the need to craft meaningful privacy \nlegislation. I commend their efforts in this area. It has been \nextremely difficult legislation to craft, however.\n  The States themselves have enacted some medical privacy laws. For \ninstance, several States have passed laws that protect the \nconfidentiality of mental health records or HIV status. We should not \npreempt such protections. I am glad to see that the preemption of State \nlaw in this area has been removed from this bill. I commend the Finance \nCommittee, and particularly Anne Marie Murphy of my own staff, for \ntheir work in helping to rectify this problem.\n  I am still troubled by the possible time lag between the enactment of \nstandardization and the development of privacy regulations by the \nSecretary of HHS. The way this provision is currently drafted, \nstandards will be developed by standard setting organizations that are \nmainly business groups, solely on the basis of cost, within 18 months \nof enactment of this Act. HHS will submit to Congress detailed \nrecommendations on standards with respect to the privacy of \nindividually identifiable health information within 12 months of \nenactment of this Act. If Congress does not act on these \nrecommendations within 36 months of enactment, the Secretary of HHS \nwill promulgate privacy regulations within 42 months of enactment. \nThere is, therefore, a possible time lag of 36 months between standard \nsetting and privacy regulations.\n\n  This puts the cart before the horse. Obviously, privacy should come \nfirst. I don t think there is one Senator here who would like to have \nhis or her own medical privacy play second fiddle to business costs.\n  Furthermore, this order of cost first, privacy later, may in fact be \nmuch more disruptive to business. For example, it does not make good \nprivacy sense to use social security numbers as a unique health \nidentifier; it would be far too easy for others to decode these. It \nmight, however, make for easy, cost-effective, standardization. If the \nstandards developed need to be fully revised to take account of privacy \nconcerns, then business will be forced to standardize twice, with \nprobably twice the expense.\n  It makes much more sense to have the standards developed with both \nprivacy and cost in mind and for the standards to be enacted after and \nin accordance with the privacy regulations. I would urge my colleagues \nto alter these dates and modify this section to couple these two very \nadmirable goals of cost reduction and medical records privacy.\n  In general, although there are weaknesses in this bill and it is far, \nfar less reform than we need, I am pleased that we are finally moving \nahead with modest initiatives in the area of access to health \ninsurance. Many Americans will be helped by this legislation. It should \nbe clear, however, to anyone who looks at what is happening to health \ninsurance coverage in this country that this bill is just a first step \nof many we need to take to meet the health care needs of our Nation. \nThis is especially true in regard to children, where we will fall even \nfarther behind as a result of the Welfare bill we just passed, and in \nregard to equitable coverage of people with mental illnesses.\n  Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone deserve great credit for \nfighting for equitable treatment in coverage for the mentally ill. I \nhope they will win this fight in the near future. I will do everything \nI can to help in this effort before the end of this Congress.\n  I hope it will also not be long before the Senate acts to ensure \nuniversal access to health care coverage for all children and pregnant \nwomen. More than 9.3 million children and half a million expectant \nmothers in our Nation have no health insurance of any kind. Projections \nare that by the year 2002 we will have 12.6 million children without \ncoverage and nearly 5 million more may be added to that as a result of \nproposed changes in Medicaid. When we passed the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill \nearlier this year, the Senate accepted a sense of the Senate resolution \nI offered stating that the issue of adequate health care for our \nmothers and children is important to our nation's future and that the \nSenate should pass health care legislation ensuring health care \ncoverage for all of our nation's pregnant women and children. The \nSenate must be held to account on this resolution.\n  It is unacceptable in our rich country to permit these inequities to \ncontinue and to permit so many of the most vulnerable in our society to \nbe denied assurance of even basic health care. While I applaud everyone \nwho worked so hard to bring this agreement to the floor, I hope those \nwho follow us in the next Congress will move on from here to make more \nfundamental progress toward the fair, just and accessible health care \nsystem all of our citizens deserve in this great Nation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the legislation before us today--the \nconference report on the Kassebaum/Kennedy Health Insurance Reform \nAct--gives this body a unique and historic opportunity--to pass a \nsensible, incremental and common-sense health reform measure that will \nhelp millions of Americans.\n  Our actions today will give an estimated 25 million Americans a much \nneeded and deserving helping hand.\n  This bill would guarantee to American working families--if you change \nyour job you will not lose access to health insurance. This bill will \nlimit pre-existing condition exclusions. It will guarantee renewability \nof health insurance policies. And it will help self-employed \nindividuals, by increasing the deduction for health insurance expenses.\n  It's been a long difficult process to reach this point. But, finally \nthese most basic health insurance reforms will become law, exactly 1 \nyear after the Labor and Human Resources Committee unanimously reported \nthe bill.\n  This bill will not solve every problem in our health care system, but \nit's an important first step. It is good public policy and it deserves \nthe support of every member of this body.\n  Frankly, I feared that the majority party would prevent this day from \nhappening.\n  This legislation passed in the Labor Committee 1 year ago, but \nobjections by members of the majority party prevented this bill from \nreceiving consideration by the Senate until the following April.\n  President Clinton came to the Congress in January and in his State of \nthe Union address urged us to quickly pass this legislation. But still \nit took 4 months for the majority party to respond.\n  Finally, when the Senate was allowed to consider the bill it passed \n100-0. These days, not too much in this body is agreed upon in a \nbipartisan manner. But the unanimous support for the Kassebaum/Kennedy \nbill is a clear indication that this legislation is an effective, fair, \nand most important, bipartisan measure.\n  But again, even after this unanimous vote, the majority tried to load \nthe bill with controversial provisions, rather than move to quickly \npass a bill we could all agree upon.\n  Mr. President, this legislation should have passed last year and if \nwe had done so, the American people would already be reaping the \nbenefits. However, I am pleased that reason prevailed and today we can \nfinally deliver these important protections to the American people.\n  While this bill is an important step forward, I consider it only a \nfirst step in an ongoing process. Many problems remain in our health \nsystem. I won't\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\ngo into all of them today. But I do want to talk briefly about \ncontinuing problems in guaranteeing children access to health care.\n  Our system simply does not work for millions of America's children. \nWe all lose when the worker of tomorrow is crippled for life by the \nuntreated illness of today. We all lose when completely preventable \ndiseases like measles ripple through the child population.\n  The General Accounting Office, in a series of reports issued to me \nthis summer have reported on trends in children's health insurance that \nare cause for genuine alarm.\n  In 1994, the percentage of children with private insurance coverage \nreached its lowest point since the census began consistently tracking \ncoverage.\n  In 1987, almost 74 percent of our Nation's children had private \ncoverage. By 1994, that number had dropped to 65 percent.\n  While Medicaid has certainly helped millions of children who would \notherwise be without coverage, the number of children without any \ninsurance rose to its highest point in 1994. Ten million children under \nage 18, or 14.2 percent, were uninsured in 1994.\n  In States such as Alabama, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, \nand Texas, almost 20 percent or more of children are without health \ncare coverage. That means 1 out of every 5 children in these States are \nlacking coverage.\n  Too many of our children do not have access to basic health. So, I \nhope, Mr. President, that no one thinks that we've made the health care \nsystem right, because we still have a long way to go.\n  Let us not forget that approximately 40 million Americans continue to \nlack health care coverage. Of those, 12 million are children under the \nage of 21. We still have a commitment to those people to make this \nmeasure the first, not the last, step on the road to meaningful health \ncare reform.\n  So today, we have a historic opportunity to help millions of \nAmerica's working families keep their health care coverage. It is a \nchance that must not slip away, and so I urge all my colleagues to join \nme in supporting this common sense and sensible reform measure.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this conference \nreport. This is a good first step in trying to provide affordable \nhealth care coverage to all Americans. This bill will ensure that \npeople who move from job to job will be able to keep their health \ninsurance, even if they have a pre-existing condition. It also will \ngive the same protection to people who lose their jobs and must get \nhealth insurance on their own.\n  This bill also provides some tax incentives for families to better \nafford health care. The legislation increases the health insurance \ndeduction for self-employed individuals from 30 percent to 80 percent, \nbringing health care coverage within reach of many more Americans.\n  This bill also expands the tax deduction for nursing home and long \nterm care coverage. This will help families better cope with the \nstaggering costs of nursing home coverage for their loved ones. In some \nfacilities, a year in a nursing home can cost over $30,000.\n  This bill also includes an experiment in Medical Savings Accounts \n(MSA's). The Senate originally rejected the concept of MSA's by a bi-\npartisan vote. But the House Republicans insisted on a full blown \nimplementation MSA's even though we have never even evaluated the \nefficacy of such health policies. Fortunately, this conference report \nonly includes a limited demonstration of MSA's. This makes sense \nbecause this concept is untested. I am concerned that MSA's could drain \nthe young, healthy and wealthy out of the traditional insurance system. \nThis could leave old and sick people to cope with escalating insurance \npremiums, making it even tougher to afford health insurance. Therefore, \nI am pleased that this is only a time limited experiment.\n\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, this bill does not include the so-\ncalled mental health parity amendment authored by the Senators Domenici \nand Wellstone. This amendment passed overwhelmingly in the Senate but \nwas completely dropped in conference. I hope that some day this \namendment will become law so that we can do away with insurance \npolicies that provide more coverage for physical illnesses than for \nmental illnesses. Families with members who have mental illnesses \ndeserve this much.\n  Mr. President, while this bill makes improvements in our health care \nsystem, we must remember that this is only a first step. We have much \nmore work to do in the next Congress to move toward providing health \ncare coverage for all Americans. This should continue to be our goal.\n  Tragically, there are now 41 million Americans who do not have health \ninsurance, up from 37 million in 1993. For the most part, these are \nworking Americans. Eighty-four percent of the uninsured work, but they \ndo not get health insurance at their jobs.\n  We must do something to rectify this. We must continue to enact \nlegislation so that one day no family is without health security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I support the conference agreement on H.R. \n3103, the Health Insurance Reform Bill. I am pleased that the Congress \nis taking long overdue final action on this legislation which is so \nimportant to working Americans and their families. As you know, it was \napproved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee 1 year ago \ntoday, and it passed the Senate in April. Once again, I would like to \ncommend Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy for their untiring \nefforts to work with our colleagues and all interested parties to forge \nthe bipartisan bill we will pass today and send to the President for \nhis signature.\n  The bill we are passing today is not comprehensive health care \nreform, but it is an important step forward in addressing problems in \nour current health insurance system. People who maintain continuous \nhealth insurance coverage will not be denied insurance for preexisting \nconditions, after one initial 12-month exclusion, even if they change \njobs or insurance plans; and individuals who lose their jobs or change \njobs will be guaranteed the opportunity to continue their insurance \nthrough a group or individual plan.\n  A compromise was made on medical savings account [MSA] provisions \npassed by the House of Representatives but rejected by the Senate. The \nbill provides for a four year pilot program in which up to 750,000 \ntaxpayers with high-deductible health insurance plans can make tax \ndeductible contributions to a medical savings account. At the end of \nthe 4-year period, Congress would have to vote to expand the MSA \nprogram.\n  This legislation also increases the health insurance deduction for \nself-employed individuals from 30 percent to 80 percent over a 10-year \nperiod, provides for a medical expense deduction for long term care \ninsurance, and allows terminally ill individuals to receive tax free \nbenefits from their life insurance.\n  I regret that the Domenici-Wellstone amendment, which passed the \nSenate, was not included in this conference report nor was any \ncompromise that the sponsors proposed. This amendment would require \nprivate health plans to provide medically necessary mental health \nservices that are equal to the medical services provided. A great deal \nof progress has been made in diagnosing and treating mental illnesses, \nand I believe that we should provide health insurance coverage that \nwill make this care affordable to people who need it. I will work with \nmy colleagues during the remainder of this Congress to ensure that in \nthe future people with mental illnesses have equal access to the care \nthey need.\n  The Health Insurance Reform Act will provide peace of mind to many \nworking Americans who have health insurance but fear losing it, and it \nis a major improvement in our current health insurance system.\n\n\n   providing tax exemption to state high risk health insurance pools\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am pleased that the conference report for the Health \nInsurance Reform Act includes a provision which confirms the \navailability of the Federal tax exemption for State health insurance \nrisk pools which has been pending in Congress for the last several \nyears. The purpose of a health risk pool is to make available health \nand accident insurance coverage to individuals\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\nwho, because of health conditions, would otherwise not be able to \nsecure health insurance coverage. Health risk pools are one option \ncontemplated by the Health Insurance Reform Act that States could \nimplement as part of their health care reform efforts to seek to ensure \naccess to health insurance.\n  Since 1976, 28 States have enacted legislation establishing a health \ninsurance pool aimed at protecting uninsurable and high-risk \nindividuals. Most of the pools were established in the last 10 years.\n  For example, the Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool Association \nAct was enacted by the Mississippi State Legislature during the 1991 \nlegislative session and became effective April 15, 1991. At that time \nMississippi became the 25th State to enact such legislation. This act \ncreated the Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk Pool \nAssociation to implement such a health insurance program. Members of \nthe association include insurance companies, nonprofit health care \norganizations and health maintenance organizations [HMO's] which are \nauthorized to write direct health insurance policies and contracts \nsupplemental to health insurance policies in Mississippi. The \nassociation also includes third-party administrators who are paying and \nprocessing health insurance claims for Mississippi residents.\n  Over the past 4 years, the association has issued medical insurance \npolicies to approximately 1,200 Mississippians. The association is \nfunded by premiums paid by policyholders and quarterly assessments \nagainst members of the association. The assessments are necessary to \nsupplement the premiums and operate the program on a financially sound \nbasis. There is no public funding--State or Federal--involved.\n  Currently, over 100,000 individuals nationwide are members of a State \nhealth risk pool. Nationally, there are an additional 1 to 3 million \npeople who are uninsured and uninsurable, and who could be eligible for \ninclusion in a State health risk pool.\n  As my colleague knows, unfortunately, several State health risk \npools, including the Mississippi Comprehensive Health Insurance Risk \nPool Association, have applied for and have been denied exemption for \nFederal taxation under Internal Revenue Code sections 501(c)(4) and/or \n501(c)(6). Generally, the Internal Revenue Service's [IRS] rationale \nfor such denial has been that the sole activity of the health risk \npools is the provision of health insurance for individual \npolicyholders. The IRS perceives health risk pools as a regular \nbusiness ordinarily carried on for profit, which primarily provide \ncommercial type insurance. Moreover, the IRS takes the position that \nhealth risk pools are primarily serving the private interests of its \nmembers and not the common interest of the community as a whole.\n  Would my colleague agree that the IRS's position is incorrect?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Is it not the case that health risk pools have been \ncreated by statute in the several States to serve a public function of \nrelieving the hardship of those who, for health reasons, are unable to \nobtain health insurance coverage? Additionally, that these pools do not \ncarry on an activity ordinarily carried on by insurance companies and \nnot designed to make a profit? Further, that they are established by \nState statute and none of the net earnings benefit any private \nshareholder, member, or individual?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Federal Government should serve as an impetus for, \nnot an impediment to, State health care reform. We should do all we can \nto increase the ability of States to help the uninsured. The Health \nInsurance Reform Act recognizes the value of health risk pools and \nincludes vital roles for health risk pools in their health care reform \nlegislation.\n  Would my colleague not agree that in order to allow States \nflexibility in designing effective health care plans, State health risk \npools should be exempt from taxation and that it was never the intent \nof Congress that health risk pools be subject to taxation?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. I would agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would my colleague agree that it is the intent of \nCongress through this legislation to clarify that health risk pools be \nexempt from taxation?\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. The Senator is correct. This legislation will clarify \nthe intent of Congress that health risk pools should not be subject to \ntaxation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank my colleague for her assistance. By passing this \nlegislation, we will promote State-based health care reform by \nexpressly confirming that State health risk pools are exempt from \nFederal taxation, notwithstanding the IRS' position. By clarifying the \nintent of Congress, the IRS should recognize this legislation as \nconfirming the interpretation of existing law, and not creating new \nlaw, and accordingly grant tax exempt organization status to all health \nrisk pools that have applied for such status.\n\n\n                       organ donation insert card\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am pleased that the conference committee on the Health \nInsurance Reform Act has included a small, but lifesaving provision \nthat Senator Frist and I offered as an amendment to the Senate bill. I \nam referring to the organ donation insert card provision.\n  This measure, which I first introduced in 1994, would require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to send out information about organ and \ntissue donation with each tax refund mailed in 1997. This provision \nwill help give a new chance at life to the more than 46,000 Americans \nwho are desperately waiting right now for an organ or tissue \ntransplant.\n  Many opportunities for a lifesaving organ donation are missed each \nyear because family members hesitate to authorize organ or tissue \ndonation when their loved one dies. By providing information to 70 \nmillion Americans next year, we can raise awareness about the need for \ndonors and, in the process, we will save lives.\n  I do want to mention a concern I have about one of two technical \nchanges made to the organ donation insert card amendment during \nconference. At this time, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Frist, a cosponsor of this Amendment, and Senator Roth, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, to clarify Congress' intent with \nregard to this provision.\n  The conference agreement alters my original provision to read that \norgan donation information will be included with tax refunds mailed in \n1997 to quote ``the extent practicable'' unquote. I want to make it \nclear that I feel strongly that providing this information to millions \nof Americans is not only a cost effective way to save lives but is also \na practical measure that does not pose an unreasonable burden on the \nDepartment of the Treasury.\n  Mr. FRIST. Senator Dorgan, is it true that the Treasury Department \nregularly includes insert cards with the refunds it mails each year?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Tennessee is absolutely correct. This \nyear, for example, taxpayers who receive a refund also received \ninformation about how to purchase Olympic commemorative coins. In 1994, \nan advertisement for World Cup Soccer commemorative coins was mailed \nalong with refunds.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is my understanding that the cost to the Treasury \nDepartment of printing and inserting this information is negligible. \nSince the Federal Government already incurs this cost on an annual \nbasis, I do not believe this would create a burden. Is that also your \nbelief?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, it is. I would like to ask the distinguished \ngentleman from Delaware [Senator Roth], to clarify for us what the \nconference committee intended by making this technical change to the \nSenate's amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. The conference committee's intent regarding this change was \nto ensure that there be no delay in the mailing of refund checks \nbecause of this provision. The language ``to the extent practicable'' \noriginally read ``to the maximum extent practicable'' to address any \npotential administrative issues that may arise. For example, if the \nInternal Revenue Service ran out of organ donor cards we would not want \nto insinuate that the check could only go out if a donor card was \nenclosed. The Treasury Department specifically asked us to delete \n``maximum'' from the language.\n  It was not the conference committee's belief that this provision \nshould\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\ncause a delay, and we fully expect that the Treasury Department will \nmake every effort to ensure that all of the individual taxpayers who \nare mailed refunds in 1997 will also receive organ donation \ninformation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Thank you Senator Roth and Frist. I want to again thank \nSenators Kennedy, Kassebaum, and Frist, Congressman Richard Durbin, and \nthe many supportive organizations who have worked with me to get this \nprovision enacted.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of final passage of the Health \nInsurance Reform Act. It has not been an easy road to agreement on this \nbill, but for the sake of the American people, I am glad we were able \nto put aside our differences and reach a compromise on those issues \nwhere we do agree.\n  We are fortunate in our country to have one of the finest health care \nsystems in the world. But unfortunately, not all Americans have access \nto that health care system or can afford the escalating prices of care.\n  This bill is not the total answer to those issues. In fact, compared \nto the health care plan proposed by President Clinton several years \nago, which I did not support because I thought it was too bureaucratic, \nthis bill is very, very modest.\n  Having said that, the Health Insurance Reform Act is a significant \nstep forward in helping Americans who are routinely denied health \ninsurance coverage through no fault of their own, and I am pleased to \nbe a cosponsor and supporter.\n  Earlier this year, I received a heartbreaking letter from a mother in \nWilliston, ND whose infant son was born with a rare disease called \nmyelamacia. He often stops breathing and doctors have no idea how long \nhe will live or what his quality of life will be. Michael is actually \nlucky because, right now, he is covered under his mother's employer-\nbased health insurance plan.\n  But Michael's mother is desperately worried about how long his \ncoverage will last. For one thing, Michael currently must live at the \nAnne Carlsen Center for Children in Jamestown, ND, which is quite a \nlong distance from Williston. Michael's parents would like to move \ncloser to their son so they can spend more time with him, but they are \njustifiably afraid that if Michael's mom switches jobs, Michael will \nlose his insurance coverage.\n  Michael's parents are not alone. A survey has found that one-quarter \nof Americans who would have otherwise switched jobs did not because \nthey feared losing their health insurance coverage.\n  This legislation basically says to insurance companies, if someone \nhas been a good customer of yours, paying their premiums regularly for \nyears, you cannot drop their coverage simply because he or she gets \nsick or switches jobs.\n  This bill puts limits on the amount of time that insurance companies \ncan deny coverage for individuals with preexisting medical conditions, \neven for those who change jobs or whose employer switches insurance \ncompanies. It also requires insurance companies to renew the health \ninsurance coverage of individuals or groups as long as they pay their \npremiums. The bill will also help to ensure that those with preexisting \nconditions will be able to purchase affordable individual insurance \npolicies if they lose their group health coverage.\n\n  This bill also contains provisions which will help many of North \nDakota's small business owners and sole proprietors. I have been \nfighting for one of these provisions ever since I came to Congress, so \nI am particularly pleased that we are acting to level the playing field \nfor sole proprietors.\n  Under this bill, farmers and other self-employed individuals will be \nable to deduct a higher percentage of their health insurance premiums. \nRight now, large corporations can deduct 100 percent of their health \ninsurance expenses, but sole proprietors may only deduct 30 percent of \ntheir health insurance premiums. This bill will gradually increase the \namount that the self-employed can deduct to 50 percent by 2003 and to \n80 percent by 2006. I would prefer that they be allowed to deduct all \nof their insurance costs, as corporations already can, but this will go \na long way toward making health insurance more affordable for farmers \nand other self-employed individuals.\n  This bill also will allow some small employers and their employees to \nexperiment with medical savings accounts, or MSA's. This is a highly \ncontroversial issue, and I'm glad we were able to reach an agreement \nthat allows us to move forward on this legislation.\n  I think MSA's are an intriguing idea. Common sense tells you that \nmaking health care consumers think more carefully about the type and \ncost of care they receive will likely have some positive impact on \noverall costs.\n  At the same time, however, I do have concerns about the impact that \nMSA's could have on the traditional insurance pool. The trial approach \ntaken in this bill will minimize any negative effects on the insurance \nmarket while allowing us to evaluate the value of MSA's.\n  Finally, I want to mention one more provision included in this bill. \nIt is a small, easily overlooked provision which I offered, but it is \none that will save lives, and I want to thank Senators Frist, Kennedy, \nKassebaum, and the many other Senators, Members of the House of \nRepresentatives and supportive organizations who have worked with me to \nget this provision included. I am referring to the organ donation \ninsert card provision.\n  This measure, which I first introduced in 1994, would require the \nSecretary of the Treasury to send out information about organ and \ntissue donation with each tax refund mailed in 1997. This provision \nwill help give a new chance at life to the more than 46,000 Americans \nwho are desperately waiting right now for an organ or tissue \ntransplant.\n  Many opportunities for a lifesaving organ donation are missed each \nyear because family members hesitate to authorize organ or tissue \ndonation when their loved one dies. By providing information to 70 \nmillion Americans next year, we can raise awareness about the need for \ndonors and, in the process, we will save lives.\n  In closing, I want to thank Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum and both \nof the leaders for their tireless work to move this worthwhile \nlegislation to this point. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the Health \nInsurance Reform Act and to finally have this opportunity to vote to \nsend it to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about this health \ninsurance reform legislation now before us. After months of gridlock on \nthis bill, I am glad that the Senate finally has a chance to once again \nconsider and pass this straightforward legislation. I must confess, \nhowever, that I find it puzzling that this bill has been held up for 3 \nmonths over the issue of medical savings accounts--particularly in \nlight of what we are trying to accomplish by passing this legislation.\n  I am a strong supporter of medical savings accounts. I truly believe \nMSA's empower health care consumers by giving them the freedom to \nchoose how they spend their health care dollar. Medical savings \naccounts provide the competitive choice which not only enables folks to \nkeep pace with inflation, but counters the increases that will result \nfrom the guaranteed-issue component of this legislation. Nonetheless, I \nam pleased that this bill creates at least a full-blown test for the \nMSA.\n  Though it disturbs me to know that we could have sent this meaningful \nlegislation to the President for his signature months ago, the delay on \nthis bill has given me the opportunity to hear the thoughts of \nliterally thousands of Montanans on this issue, folks who have written \nto me, folks who have called me, and folks I've seen while traveling in \nthe State. Given all the input I have received on this legislation over \nthese last few months, one thing is certain, the folks in Montana are \nreaffirming what they have been telling me for years--that they want \nthe commonsense measures contained in this bill passed into law.\n  It is no secret that the health insurance system in this country is \nin need of some fine tuning. And I know that many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle and in both Chambers of Congress would agree \nwith that assessment. It is estimated that 43 million Americans went \nwithout health insurance in 1995 and roughly 23 million of those are \nworkers. Though we can't guarantee every American health care \ncoverage--nor would I ever support a\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\nplan to do so--we can address the barriers that keep health insurance \nout of the reach of most of these folks; access and affordability. And \nthis health insurance reform legislation does just that.\n  There is little doubt in my mind that the Health Insurance and \nPortability Act will greatly reduce the barriers to obtaining health \ninsurance coverage for millions of Americans by: one, limiting an \ninsurer's ability to withhold coverage for people with pre-existing \nmedical conditions; two, making it easier for workers to get and \nmaintain health coverage; and three, because of its provisions \nguaranteeing coverage, this legislation will make it easier for workers \nto change jobs or start their own businesses without fear of losing \nhealth care coverage.\n  This bill also contains many other important provisions. I am \nespecially pleased with the significant improvements in coverage for \npregnant women, newborns, and adopted children. This bill will also \nmake health care more affordable by providing the government with the \nmeans to crack down on health care fraud and abuse in the health care \nsystem, specifically in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. What's \nmore, self-employed people will be able to deduct from their taxes 80 \npercent of their health insurance premiums by the year 2006, up from \nthe 30 percent which current law allows. In addition, this bill \nincreases tax breaks for small companies. Those provisions are \nespecially important for my State, where 98 percent of our businesses \nare considered small businesses and have fewer than 50 employees.\n  What so personally excites me about this bill is a provision that I \nintroduced to this bill that requires reimbursement for telemedicine \nservices under Medicare. As many of my colleagues know, I have been a \nstrong advocate of telemedicine since my election to the Senate. I \ntruly believe that establishing a telecommunications infrastructure is \na part of the solution to providing affordable and accessible health \ncare. Telemedicine is being used now in Montana, and across the United \nStates, to bring health care services to those who currently don't have \naccess. Getting health care services can be a challenge, especially \nwhen folks in my State and in other rural areas face situations where \nthey are 180 miles away from a specialist. But even if specialists are \nwilling and able to visit their patients via telemedicine, the Health \nCare Financing Administration will not reimburse them for those \nservices.\n  Mr. President, HCFA has been reviewing demonstration projects to \nanalyze the cost effectiveness of providing health care services via \ntelecommunications and how to reimburse the health care providers. The \nHCFA study has no expected deadline, but the provision contained in \nthis bill will require HCFA to complete its study and report back to \nCongress by March 1, 1997. If we pass this bill today, that gives HCFA \nalmost 8 months, in addition to the time they have already spent \nstudying the issue, to determine the reimbursement of services provided \nvia telemedicine. I don't feel this proposal is unreasonable. In fact, \nsince this study is already ongoing, there is no cost associated with \nthis. I am simply asking that HCFA finish the study and let rural areas \nand urban residents access the health care services that are currently \nout of reach geographically.\n\n  I realize that there are many Americans, including a number of folks \nin Montana, who have serious concerns with this legislation. Folks in \nmy State seem to be particularly concerned that this legislation is \njust a step toward implementing the failed Clinton health care plan and \nwill turn our health care system over to the Government. What's more, I \nhave heard from a number of Montanans who are concerned about health \ninsurance costs going up for all health care consumers. I appreciate \nand understand these concerns--I don't want to see either of these \nthings take place. In fact, like most Americans, I am completely \nopposed, and I opposed then, the type of big-government, big-\nbureaucracy health care agenda that the Clinton administration proposed \nin 1994. Most people don't want a single-payer, government-controlled \nhealth insurance system deciding what is best for them and neither do \nI. That is why this bill only addresses those aspects of health \ninsurance reform that folks have identified as important and necessary, \nand want to see passed.\n  Though I realize that this bill will not solve all the problems with \nour Nation's health care system--and I have concerns with certain \naspects of the act as well--this legislation does take a giant step \ntoward eliminating many of the worst abuses that exist in the private \ninsurance market. Most important, it does all this without \nsubstantially raising costs for current health insurance policyholders, \nwithout meddling with those parts of the system that work, and without \ntaking away the ability of States or the private sector to initiate \ntheir own reforms.\n  Mr. President, the Republican-led 104th Congress has once again given \nus an opportunity to change a system that has consistently failed \nmillions of Americans and American families. I want to take a moment to \nthank the Republican leadership and all of those who have worked so \nhard, in both parties, to bring this legislation back to the floor. I \nalso want to commend Senators Domenici and Wellstone for their work on \nmental health parity. Though this provision has been stripped from the \nbill, I believe their efforts will help move our country forward in \ntreating the nearly 5 million Americans suffering from severe mental \nillness. I particularly want to commend the senior Senator from Kansas \nfor leading the way on this issue. I also want to thank Senator \nKassebaum for the time and dedication she has given over the years to \nthe citizens of our country. I am truly sorry that Senator Kassebaum \nwill be leaving us at the end of the 104th Congress. Not only will the \nU.S. Senate lose a fine legislator but a fine person. On that note, \nbecause of Senator Kassebaum's efforts, and with the overwhelming \nbipartisan support this bill received in the House yesterday, it looks \nas though we are going to see our way clear and bring about these much \nneeded reforms to our health insurance system.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe this health insurance reform \nlegislation is the best hope we have to help America's--particularly \nMontana's--families and small businesses cope with burdensome health \ncare costs. Not only will this legislation end job lock and the \nmisfortune of pre-existing conditions that prevent thousands of \nAmericans from buying coverage but it will also strengthen our health \ncare system for years to come. In short, because this health insurance \nreform bill contains so many commonsense measures, I was pleased to \nsupport this bill when it first came before this body in April. And \nbecause the legislation that is again before us today will immediately \nand measurably improve the lives and protect the health of millions of \nAmerican workers and families without putting folks out of business, \nraising taxes or turning the health care system over to the government, \nI am going to vote to send this bill to the President. I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will do the same. This bill's time has come. \nLet's not squander the opportunity we have today.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the conference \nreport accompanying the health care reform legislation. Members of \nCongress have worked for many years to pass health care reform \nlegislation, and it has been a long road. I would like to congratulate \nthe co-sponsors of this legislation, Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy. At \na time when most would have doubted that any health care reform bill \ncould pass this year, they persevered. And this legislation is a \nfitting tribute to the senior Senator from Kansas who retires at the \nend of this year.\n  In recent years, we have fought to reduce the number of Americans \nwithout access to health insurance and slow the rate of growth in \nhealth care costs. Two years ago we had a nationwide debate on health \ncare reform. There were many competing proposals, and ultimately we \nfailed to reach a consensus on comprehensive health reform legislation.\n  In the wake of that failure, we have put aside our differences and \ntaken a more incremental approach to health care reform. Rather than \nforcing dramatic change in our health care system, we are making small, \nyet important changes in the health insurance market which will give \nworking Americans something very important--peace of mind.\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\n  Once this legislation is enacted, Americans will know that if they \nchange jobs they will be able to move from one group health insurance \nplan to another without worrying that preexisting conditions will limit \nor exclude them from coverage. Once this bill is enacted, families will \nno longer face being locked into their jobs for fear of losing health \ninsurance coverage. This bill would also assure that if a worker lost \nhis or her job or accepted a job without health insurance coverage, \nthey would have the opportunity to purchase a health insurance policy \nwithout limitations or exclusions for preexisting conditions.\n  This legislation also includes provisions introduced by Senator \nCohen, to crack down on individuals who knowingly commit fraud in or \nhealth care system. Not only will this help to control health care \ncosts in the private insurance market, but it will also reduce the \nfraud which plagues the Medicare Program. The bill includes provisions, \nauthored by Senator Bond, to create uniform, standards for the \nelectronic transmission of health care information in an effort to \nstreamline and lower administrative costs.\n  Finally, the language includes important tax provisions to make \nhealth insurance more affordable for the self-employed by allowing them \nto deduct a greater percentage of their health insurance costs. It also \nclarifies that the cost of long-term care insurance is deductible--\nencouraging more Americans to purchase private long-term care \ninsurance. I am hopeful that this provision will lessen the burden of \nlong-term care costs on our Medicaid Program, which many seniors fall \nback on once they exhaust their life-savings on nursing home care.\n  I recognize that there are those who are disappointed in the final \noutcome of some of the provisions in this legislation. Probably the \nmost glaring is the omission of the Domenici-Wellstone provision \nproviding parity for mental illness. During Senate consideration of the \nhealth reform proposal, I voted against the mental health parity \namendment as well as other key provisions. I did so to assist the \nmanagers of the bill in trying to keep the bill free of controversial \nprovisions that could have slowed down the process. I also had concerns \nthat the amendment was too encompassing. I am hopeful that Congress \nwill act in the near future on a narrower version of this important \nlegislation.\n  In conclusion, no one got exactly what they wanted on every aspect of \nthis bill, myself included. Nonetheless, I think we all should take \nsatisfaction in the passage of this legislation and recognize that \ngreat things often come form humble beginning. Thank you Mr. President.\n\n\n                     clarifying certain definitions\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with respect to the corporate-owned life \ninsurance provision in the conference agreement to the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, I would like to clarify the \ndefinition of a fixed and variable rate of interest as it relates to \nthe deduction of interest on pre-1986 life insurance contracts.\n  It is my understanding that a life insurance contract with an option \nto elect a variable rate of interest, which has borne the same rate of \ninterest since its date of issuance, is considered a contract with a \nfixed rate of interest. If the interest rate under this contract is \nchanged to a variable rate as the result of the exercise of an election \nunder the contract, the contract would then be considered a contract \nwith a variable rate of interest.\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In 1945, President Harry Truman proposed universal \nhealth insurance, putting on the public agenda, the goal of universal \nhealth insurance, a goal that still eludes us. Too many Americans find \nthat just when they most need health insurance, it is not there. It is \nterminated. They are denied its purchase, because they are sick. They \nare determined to be uninsurable.\n  The bipartisan bill before us today does not provide health insurance \nto every American. We still face that challenge. But the bill before us \ntoday takes an important step toward making health insurance more \nsecure.\n  This bill provides some health security in several ways:\n  No Arbitrary Terminations: Insurers will not be able to impose \npreexisting condition limitations for more than an initial 12-month \nperiod. This means that employees can change jobs without fear or \nfacing a new preexisting condition exclusion.\n  Guaranteed Access: Insurers will be required to offer insurance to \nall groups, regardless of the health status of any member of the group \nand employees could not be denied group coverage based on their health \nstatus.\n  Guaranteed Insurance Renewal: Groups and individuals who have \ninsurance will be able to renew their policies as long as they have \npaid their premiums.\n  Individual Coverage Guaranteed: People who leave their job where they \nhave had 18 months of prior employer group coverage and who have \nexhausted their extended [COBRA] coverage would be guaranteed access to \nan individual policy.\n\n\n                           need for the bill\n\n  The problems this bill addresses are real:\n  Twenty-three million Americans lose their insurance every year; 18 \nmillion people change insurance policies annually when someone in the \nfamily changes jobs.\n  Over 9 million Americans changed jobs in 1995; millions more wanted \nto. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 4 million \nemployees are locked into their jobs because they fear that the insurer \nfor the next employer will refuse to insure them because of their \nhealth condition, something the industry has called a preexisting \ncondition. GAO has said that 21 million Americans could benefit by \nprohibiting preexisting condition exclusions.\n  Small employers are often unable to get insurance because a few of \nthe employees are ill; insurers refuse to insure. Small employers lack \nthe leverage of big employers in negotiating good prices and policies. \nIn California, 84 percent of the uninsured are in working families. \nFifty-two percent of uninsured employees work in small firms.\n  And finally, there are 10 to 20 million Americans seeking to buy \ninsurance on their own--individual policies. These individuals, who are \nnot part of a large pool where risk can be spread out, find that \ninsurers refuse to sell to them or price the policies so high they are \nunaffordable.\n\n\n                         genetic discrimination\n\n  I especially appreciate the inclusion of provisions barring genetic \ndiscrimination in health insurance, along the lines of S. 1600, a bill \nI introduced with Senator Mack.\n  Last fall, as cochairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator Mack \nand I held a hearing on the status of genetics research and use of \ngenetic tests. We learned we are all carrying around between 50,000 and \n100,000 genes scattered on 23 pairs of chromosomes and that every \nperson has between 5 and 10 defective genes, often not manifested.\n  Approximately 3 percent of all children are born with a severe \ncondition that is primarily genetic in origin. By age 24, genetic \ndisease strikes 5 percent of Americans. Genetic disorders account for \none-fifth of adult hospital occupancy, two-thirds of childhood hospital \noccupancy, one-third of pregnancy loss and one-third of mental \nretardation.\n  About 15 million people are affected by one or more of the over 4,000 \ncurrently identified genetic disorders.\n\n  We are learning virtually everyday about the explosion of knowledge \nin genetic science. We know that certain diseases have genetic links, \nlike cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, cystic \nfibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  But understanding genetics brings a new set of problems. Witness \nafter witness at our hearing raised fears of health insurance \ndiscrimination. And it is not just fear. It is also reality. We heard \nabout insurers denying coverage, refusing to renew coverage, or denying \ncoverage of a particular condition.\n  In a 1992 study, the Office of Technology Assessment found that 17 of \n29 insurers would not sell insurance to individuals when presymptomatic \ntesting revealed the likelihood of a serious, chronic future disease. \nFifteen of thirty-seven commercial insurers that cover groups said they \nwould decline the applicant. Underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross-Blue \nShield plans said they would turn down an applicant if\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\npresymptomatic testing revealed the likelihood of disease. The study \nfound that insurers price plans higher--or even out of reach--based on \ngenetic information. Another study conducted by Dr. Paul Billings at \nthe California Pacific Medical Center, reached similar conclusions.\n  Here are a few examples, real-life cases:\n  An individual with hereditary hemochromatosis--excessive iron--who \nruns 10K races regularly, but who had no symptoms of the disease, could \nnot get insurance because of the disease.\n  A health maintenance organization that had covered a child since \nbirth, denied therapy after the child was diagnoses with \nmucopolysaccharidoses [MPS].\n  A Colorado insurer terminated the policy of the family of a 3-year-\nold with the same disease.\n  An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed at 14 days of age with PKI \n[phenylketonuria], a rare inherited disease, which if left untreated, \nleads to retardation. Most States require testing for this disease at \nbirth. Her growth and development proceeded normally and she was \nhealthy. She was insured on her father's employment-based policy, but \nwhen the father changed jobs, the insurer at the new job told him that \nhis daughter was considered to be a high risk patient and uninsurable.\n  The mother of an elementary school student had her son tested for a \nlearning disability. The tests revealed that the son had Fragile X \nSyndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Her insurer dropped \nher son's coverage. After searching unsuccessfully for a company that \nwould be willing to insure her son, the mother quit her job so she \ncould impoverish herself and become eligible for Medicaid as insurance \nfor her son.\n  Another man worked as a financial officer for a large national \ncompany. His son had a genetic condition which left him severely \ndisabled. The father was tested an found to be an asymptomatic carrier \nof the gene which caused his son's illness. His wife and other sons \nwere healthy. His insurer initially disputed claims filed for the son's \ncare, then paid them, but then refused to renew the employer's group \ncoverage. The company then offered two plans. All employees except this \nfather were offered a choice of the two. He was allowed only the \nmanaged care plan.\n  A woman was denied health insurance because her nephew had been \ndiagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and she inquired whether she should \nbe tested to see if she was a carrier. After she was found to carry the \ngene that causes the disease, the insurer told her that neither she nor \nany children she might have would be covered unless her husband was \ndetermined not to carry the CF gene. She went for several months \nwithout health insurance because she sought genetic information about \nherself.\n  These denials not only deprive Americans of health insurance, they \naffect people's health. If people fear retaliation by their insurer, \nthey may be less likely to provide their physician with full \ninformation. They may be reluctant to be tested. This reluctance means \nthat physicians might not have all the information they need to make a \nsolid diagnosis or decide on a treatment.\n  All of us are at risk of illness. We all have defective genes. I hope \nthat the addition of my language can help ease the fears of many \nAmericans and discourage insurers from using genetics as a reason to \ndeny insurance.\n\n\n                           AN IMPORTANT STEP\n\n  This bill, while it does not address all the problems, does take an \nimportant step. As a measure of its importance, yesterday morning when \nagreement on the bill reached the public, my staff got a call at 9:15 \na.m.--6:15 a.m. California time--from a worried constituent, asking, \n``Will it help me?''\n  This bill can help make health insurance available to those Americans \nwho want to buy it. It can bring peace of mind to millions of \nAmericans. It can restore to insurance what insurance is supposed to \nbe.\n  I hope we will promptly send this bill to the President for his \nsignature and close this loophole in our erratic patchwork of health \ninsurance.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, H.R. 3103, the Health Coverage Availability \nand Affordability Act of 1996, could very well sound the death knell \nfor the past years of liberal efforts to socialize medicine. The truth \nis, it puts us well on our way to providing a meaningful health care \nreform for millions of working Americans.\n  H.R. 3103 guarantees that American workers can keep their health \ncoverage if they change or lose their jobs, which will be greatly \nreassuring to millions of American workers having pre-existing \nconditions. Now they will be able to change jobs without fear of losing \ntheir health insurance. The portability provision, as it is called, \nenables employees to be covered immediately upon taking another job--\nregardless of their health status.\n  Mr. President, American dissatisfaction with the existing health care \nsystem has gained much of its momentum from the spiraling costs of \nmedical care in the United States. In 1993, nearly $940 billion was \nspent on health care, more than 14 percent of the GDP; this percentage \nhas been rising steadily for years. Tax relief and medical savings \naccounts provide the best of all solutions by enabling patients to make \ntheir own choices with their own money. Workers and their families--not \ngovernment bureaucrats--should decide how much to spend on health care \nand which health care benefits best meet their needs.\n  This bill, H.R. 3103, will partially correct a senseless disparity in \nthe Tax Code concerning the deductibility of health insurance premiums. \nWhereas under current law businesses are allowed to deduct such \npremiums, fully, as a business expense, self-employed workers receive \nonly a 30-percent deduction--thereby increasing the cost of doing \nbusiness. This bill raises to 80 percent the amount of health insurance \nthey can deduct from their Federal income taxes, it allows the \ndeductibility of premiums for long-term care policies.\n  Medical savings accounts [MSA's] expand consumer choice and \nultimately will reduce health care costs by spurring competition and \ngreater cost-consciousness in the use of health care. MSA's confer upon \nindividuals financial incentive to spend their health care dollars \nwisely by turning part of the savings over to employees, in effect \nrewarding efficiency.\n  Mr. President, many private businesses are already using cash \nincentives to reduce health care costs while, at the same time, \nachieving great employee satisfaction with the health care afforded \nthem. MSA's provide workers with a great deal of choice and freedom. A \nstudy by the Rand Corp. estimates that MSA's could help low-income \nworkers reduce health care spending by up to 13 percent.\n  In a truly American way, MSA's harness free enterprise to promote \nsorely-needed efficiencies in the health care economy.\n  The fight over MSA's is fundamentally about power. MSA's return power \nto the American worker. Proponents of socialized medicine recognize \nthat once MSA's are passed, they will dramatically become a bulwark \nagainst the liberals' hopes for a government-controlled health care \nsystem. Although this limited MSA program will not and cannot instantly \nsolve the problem of the affordability and availability of health \ninsurance, it will be a major step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, the majority of Americans are calling for health care \nreform. I believe further progress can be made by further changes in \nthe Tax Code. But this legislation puts us on the right track.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today over 62,000 Vermonters are included \nin the 40 million Americans who are without health insurance. \nUnfortunately, this number is increasing every year. Health insurance \nhas simply become less available and affordable.\n  The health insurance reform bill before us today is a small step, but \na step in the right direction. It puts an end to the practices of \ndenying health insurance to people with chronic illness and denying the \nrenewal of policies of people that become ill. It makes health care \nmore affordable by increasing the health insurance tax deduction for \nself-employed individuals from the current 30 percent to 80 percent \nover the next 10 years and makes the cost of long-term care, such as \nexpenses for nursing home and home health care, tax deductible just as \nother medical expenses are today.\n\n[[Page S9523]]\n\n  The passage of this bill is a hard-won battle. I do have concerns, \nhowever, about the magnitude of the experimental provision to allow \n750,000 health care policies to be withdrawn from traditional insurance \nsystem to create a medical tax shelter for routine medical bills. I \nplan to watch this demonstration closely to make sure that it does what \nit is intended to do--increase the number of insured--and not just \nincrease premiums for people that have traditional health insurance \npolicies.\n  While, as I said, this bill moves us in the right direction, I have \nto be clear that its passage is bittersweet. This bill does not address \nthe larger issue of the skyrocketing cost of health care which will \ncontinue to be a looming problem that Americans face. And I am \ndisappointed that the final bill does not include a provision to end \ndiscrimination against people with mental illness by requiring insurers \nto treat mental illness coverage the same as coverage for physical \nconditions.\n  I am also very concerned that the bill before us today calls for \nnationwide data networks for health information to be established \nwithin 18 months but contemplates delay of the promulgation of any \nprivacy protection for 42 months. That is not the way to proceed. When \nthe American people become aware of what this law requires and allows \nby way of computer transmission of individually identifiable health \ninformation without effective privacy protection, they should demand, \nas I do, prompt enactment of privacy protection.\n  Despite these concerns, the steps that this bill takes are long \noverdue. Two years ago, Congress was engaged in a great battle over how \nto get health care costs under control and make health care services \navailable to all Americans. That battle heeded few results and left \nmillions of Americans frustrated and disappointed that health care \nwould continue to be out of their reach. The obstacles that prevented \nAmericans from buying health insurance have not gone away and Congress \nnow owes it to Americans to pass this bill to address some of the \nissues that these individuals face.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senate passage of H.R. \n3103, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. \nI am proud to have been an original cosponsor of its predecessor, S. \n1028, the Kennedy-Kassebaum proposal that was originally introduced in \nJuly of last year. Although I do not believe that this legislation is \nas strong as the bill that passed the Senate last April, these changes \nare still long overdue. As many as 25 million Americans will benefit \nfrom these modest yet meaningful reforms to the insurance market--as, \nfor example, they move from job to job or lose employer-sponsored \ncoverage as the result of corporate downsizing.\n  This bill takes an incremental approach to health care reform by \nfixing the most egregious flaws in our employer-based health insurance \nsystem. I believe that we must move far beyond this bill, to \ncomprehensive health care reform, in order to ensure that every \nAmerican and legal resident knows that they have health insurance \ncoverage. However, we must do what we can, now, to make the first \nneeded changes to the American health care system.\n  Right now, we can help the many Americans who are currently excluded \nfrom meaningful health coverage because they are subject to preexisting \ncondition exclusions or are unable to purchase an individual policy. \nThis bill will address these significant problems.\n  This bill's great strength is that it will enable American workers to \nrespond to our changing economy. Today, workers risk losing their \nexisting coverage when they seek new skills or new opportunities. If \nthey can find a replacement policy through a new employer or in the \nindividual market, it may leave them under-insured. They can be subject \nto a preexisting condition exclusion that excludes a part of their \nbody, or a significant health problem, from coverage, even though they \nhave maintained insurance coverage for many years. Because of these \nconstraints, many Americans don't dare switch employers or career-\npaths. This job-lock phenomenon, which has reportedly affected 25 \npercent of all Americans, would be eliminated by this bill.\n  In addition, the portability and renewability protections in this \nbill will give more Americans the health coverage flexibility they need \nto survive in our changing economy. This bill takes a responsible \napproach to ensuring continued access to health care--in the individual \nmarket if necessary--for workers who are displaced by corporate \ndownsizing and other lay-offs. Because our economy is fluid and \nunpredictable, we need to fix these flaws in our employer-based health \ninsurance system.\n  I believe that this is critically important legislation, but I also \nbelieve that this legislation could have been better. It should have \nincluded provisions requiring equitable treatment for mental health \ncare--if not the parity provision originally championed by Senators \nDomenici and Wellstone, then the compromise proposal on benefit limits \nthat Senator Domenici introduced today. I am also concerned that the \nportability provisions for group to individual coverage were weakened \nby the conference committee. I think that the original bill's \nguarantees for individuals who lose group coverage and seek insurance \nin the individual market took the right approach. Insurers should be \nrequired to offer a broad range of insurance policies to these \ncustomers. The conference agreement will allow insurance companies to \noffer only two policies--and even though the bill includes some \nrequirements for these plans, I am concerned that insurers may be able \nto charge these individuals exorbitant rates.\n  I also can't pretend that this proposal will fix all of the problems \nin the American health care system. Many Americans will benefit from \nthis proposal. But many of the 40 million Americans who are currently \nuninsured will not be among them. I am particularly concerned that so \nmany children continue to be uninsured. In a recent study, the GAO \nanalyzed the recent decline in health insurance among children and \nconcluded that this decline in coverage has been concentrated among \nlow-income children. This report also noted that the proportion of \nchildren who are uninsured--14.2 percent, or 10 million children--is at \nthe highest level since 1987. I believe that all children should have \nhealth insurance, and that this insurance should cover children's \ncomplete developmental needs.\n  In addition, health insurance premiums will continue to be \nunaffordable for many, and the significant individual insurance market \nreforms will not affect people who are already uninsured. Our \npopulation will continue to age and Medicare and Medicaid spending will \ntherefore continue to escalate. Overall health expenditures--Federal \nand State programs, private insurance and out-of-pocket spending which \nalready consume more than 12 percent of GDP--will continue to grow.\n  We need to recognize that these insurance reforms represent an \nimportant step, but only a first step. Until all Americans are \nguaranteed health coverage, we cannot claim to have fixed the health \ncare crisis. We clearly failed 2 years ago. We need to ensure that \nevery American, regardless of their ability to pay or the generosity of \ntheir employer, maintains a meaningful right to health care. We also \nneed to ensure that every American bears their individual \nresponsibility pay for their health care--to the extent possible--and \nthe information they need to make informed decisions about the quality \nand price of their care.\n  I applaud Senators Kassebaum and Kennedy for their determination and \nhard work on this bill. Their efforts, over a number of months, to \nbring this proposal up before the Senate, and their perseverance since \nthe Senate passed this bill in April, have been remarkable. I believe \nthat the compromises included in the conference report reflect the \nlegislation's original intent to improve access to health insurance for \nmillions of working Americans. We still have worked to do, but this \nbill is a meaningful first step.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it has been a long journey to this moment \nin history, as we prepare to approve the conference agreement on H.R. \n3103, the Kassebaum/Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act of 1996, and \nsend it to the President for his signature. What we thought would be a \nsprint because the ideas made so much sense turned out to be a \nmarathon.\n  As one of the original cosponsors of this important legislation, I am\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\npleased the impasse which prevented this bill from moving forward has \nbeen resolved.\n  After months of delay, the American people will soon realize the \nbenefits of the time and energy that have been devoted in making this \nlegislation a reality.\n  The Republican leadership in the House and Senate are to be commended \nfor their steadfast commitment to reach an agreement with the White \nHouse on such contentious issues as medical savings accounts, insurance \nportability, mental health parity, and advisory opinions.\n  Overall, this legislation embraces many key elements of health care \nreform that have been pending in Congress for over five years, even \nbefore the 1994 health care overhaul proposal by President and Mrs. \nClinton.\n  In my opinion, H.R. 3103 is a good bill. It represents meaningful, \nworkable, and targeted health care reform that will provide a \nsignificant measure of assistance to millions of Americans.\n  The underlying insurance reforms included in the bill have now been \nenhanced by additional provisions that strengthen and improve the scope \nof the legislation.\n  Although much of the controversy over the past several months \ncentered on issues unrelated to the insurance provisions, it is \nimportant that we not lose sight on the importance of the insurance \nreforms.\n  This bill will provide greater assurance to an estimated 25 million \nAmericans that they can carry their health insurance coverage from job \nto job, without losing that protection, as well as obtain health \ninsurance irregardless of preexisting health problems.\n  These protections are clearly the hallmark of the Kassebaum/Kennedy \nbill.\n  These protections are important because access to health insurance \nremains one of the fundamental problems facing Americans in today's \nhealth insurance market. The unfortunate fact of today's insurance \nmarket is that there is too little protection for individuals and \nfamilies with significant health problems.\n  This legislation is clearly aimed at correcting that problem.\n  By restricting the use of preexisting limitations or exclusions on \nindividuals, H.R. 3103 will increase access to health coverage as well \nas provide portability of insurance coverage for those wishing to \nchange jobs.\n  Although these changes have been described as incremental by some, \nthey are significant improvements in the manner in which Americans \nobtain health insurance. Through the enactment of this bill, Congress \nis sending a message that the status quo is unacceptable.\n  This bill will help a significant number of people and for that \nreason alone it is worthy of passage.\n  Aside from the insurance reforms, there are a number of other \nprovisions added in the House and on the Senate floor to the underlying \ninsurance bill.\n  For example, the bill creates a newly coordinated Federal, State and \nlocal health care antifraud and abuse program that will dramatically \nincrease the enforcement authority of the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services and Justice.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have been \nparticularly interested in the development of the antifraud provisions. \nIt is clear from the hearings conducted in the Judiciary Committee as \nwell as other committees in Congress that more effective law \nenforcement tools are needed to fight health care fraud.\n  The problems have been well-documented by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine, Senator Cohen, who developed the underlying legislation \nfrom which many of the fraud provisions of H.R. 3103 were developed.\n\n  I strongly support tough and effective measures to address fraud and \nabuse. But in our efforts to deter, detect and prosecute fraudulent \nbehavior, we need to ensure that these efforts do not penalize innocent \nbehavior or unintentionally bog down the delivery of health care.\n  The practice and delivery of health care is overwhelmingly conducted \nby honest and well meaning individuals who should not be suspected of \nwrongdoing merely because they are physicians, hospital administrators \nor other health care providers.\n  Creating a cloud of suspension over the entire health care community \nwill not solve the fraud problem when only a few are guilty of \nwrongdoing.\n  We need to ensure that new antifraud and abuse provisions provide \nclear and unambiguous guidance on what constitutes fraudulent behavior.\n  Equally important is that antifraud provisions avoid penalizing \ninnocent individuals for inadvertent or clearly innocent behavior.\n  I would remind my colleagues that antifraud proposals over the past \nseveral years have essentially proposed to expand the scope of existing \nantifraud and abuse laws applicable to health care providers. A clear \ncase is the application of the antikickback laws which are, at best, \ncomplex and confusing and are not easily conveyed in the context of \nmanaged care.\n  Overly broad applications of these laws are particularly worrisome.\n  As an example, the legislation creates a new Federal criminal statute \nunder title 18 of the U.S. Code against health care fraud. Fines and \nimprisonment for up to 10 years can be imposed for violating provisions \nof the new statute.\n  Within the practice of health care, legitimate disagreements \nregarding medical judgment and treatment decisions should not be cause \nfor imposing legal penalties. It is critical that the antifraud \nprovisions be carefully crafted to avoid punishing unintentional acts \nby health professions.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased the conference report contains language I \nproposed that specifically defines any new Federal health care offense \nto include both a knowing and willful standard of intent.\n  The addition of willful in this standard is essential to ensure that \ninadvertent or accidental conduct is not deemed criminal. The standard \nis now clear that criminal liability will be imposed only on an \nindividual who knows of a legal duty and, intentionally, violates that \nduty.\n  Without this clarification, legitimate disagreements regarding a \nphysician's medical judgment and treatment decisions could have been \nthe basis for imposing criminal penalties.\n  Another issue which surfaced during consideration of the antifraud \nprovisions concerned the impact on the provision of alternative and \ncomplementary health care.\n  As my colleagues know, I have championed the cause of alternative and \ncomplementary medicine. I am sensitive to concerns within this \ncommunity regarding unintended negative implications of the fraud \nlanguage on the provision and practice of nontraditional and nonmedical \nforms of health care.\n  I want to make it clear to my friends in the alternative and \ncomplementary medicine community that under this bill the practice of \ncomplementary, alternative, innovative, experimental or investigational \nmedical or health care itself, will not constitute fraud.\n  I have specifically addressed these concerns in the legislative and \nconference report language to clarify any misunderstandings or \nambiguity arising from the implementation of the fraud provisions.\n  In this regard, I want to thank the National Nutritional Foods \nAssociation, the American Chiropractic Association and the American \nPreventive Medical Association for their input.\n  While it is easy to focus only on the laudable benefits of the \ninsurance provisions in this bill, because they are so important, we \nmust not lose sight of the very significant tax provisions that are \nalso included in this legislation. These provisions will work to make \nhealth insurance more affordable, to ease the financial burdens of \nlong-term care, and to allow individuals to use individual retirement \naccount funds for catastrophic health expenses without penalty.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that this bill increases the \npercentage of health insurance costs that can be deducted by the self-\nemployed to 80 percent. This provision takes a huge step toward \ncorrecting what has long been a gross inequity. No one has ever been \nable to defend the policy of allowing corporations to fully deduct \nhealth insurance expenses, but allowing the self-employed to deduct \nonly a small portion. At a time when we are trying to encourage the \ncreation of new businesses, especially by those who have\n\n[[Page S9525]]\n\nbeen laid off from large corporations over the past few years, this \nlack of full deductibility has been a real disincentive.\n  Although this bill takes us most of the way there by getting to 80 \npercent deductibility, I want to note that our job is far from finished \nin this area. First, 80 percent is not enough. We must find a way to go \nthe rest of the way and allow for full deductibility.\n  Second, under this bill, it takes us 10 years to go from the 35 \npercent that is deductible under the current law to the 80 percent \nlevel that this bill finally provides. I urge my colleagues to not sit \nback and relax on this issue. I hope that in the next Congress, we can \nfind a way to get to full deductibility and sooner.\n\n  The long-term care provisions of this bill are also very important, \nMr. President. As our population ages, millions of families will find \nthemselves facing the problem of how to pay for needed health care for \naged loved ones. Up until now, the Medicaid program has borne the brunt \nof these expenses in cases where the individual or family did not have \nthe resources to cover the often very significant cost of nursing home \ncare or skilled nursing assistance.\n  It is clear, however, that our Medicaid system will simply not be \nadequate to cover such expenses as we move into the next century and \nthe public's capacity to pay for these huge expenses are pushed beyond \nthe limit.\n  The bill before us begins to address this problem by making it easier \nfor individuals and families to pay for long-term care insurance, \neasier for insurance companies to provide such coverage, and more \nbeneficial to employees of companies that provide such insurance as \npart of an employee benefit package. These changes are key in moving \nthe majority of the responsibility for long-term care expenses from the \npublic sector to families and individuals.\n  Many of these tax provisions are very similar to changes I have long \nadvocated in long-term care legislation. These provisions are, in fact, \ncomparable to the long-term care provisions included in the quality \ncare for life legislation I introduced earlier in this Congress. I \nbelieve these provisions will serve to begin to shift public attitude \nfrom one largely of government dependence to one of personal \nresponsibility. Private insurance is vital to making this shift, and \nthese provisions will all make it much easier for insurance to be a \nviable alternative.\n  Mr. President, I also want to comment on a small, but important, \nprovision, that will help thousands of Americans who are hit by high \nmedical expenses. This bill allows for penalty-free withdrawals from \nindividual retirement accounts to pay medical expenses that exceed 7.5 \npercent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.\n  When the IRA concept was first enacted into our tax law, penalties \nwere placed on early withdrawals to discourage any use of the money \nbeside that for which it is mainly intended--to provide funds for \nretirement. This was wise, Mr. President.\n  However, we also need to recognize that when devastating illness \nstrikes a family, the need for cash is immediate. This provision helps \nin cases where a family is hard hit with medical expenses but has the \nmeans to help pay them in IRA funds. I also commend the provision that \nallows IRA funds to be used to pay for health insurance premiums in \ncases of unemployment. This provisions should help many families who \nmight face the ugly choice of dropping health care coverage when the \npaycheck temporarily stops.\n  Also included in the conference report is a four year pilot project \nfor medical savings accounts, or MSA's.\n  Beginning in 1997, MSA's are available to employees covered under an \nemploy-sponsored high deductible plan of a small employer or self-\nemployed individual. Taxpayers (including the self-employed) will be \nallowed to make tax-deductible contributions within limits of an MSA.\n  The number of taxpayers benefiting annually from an MSA contribution \nwould be limited to a threshold level of 750,000 taxpayers.\n  I strongly support MSA's. I believe they will provide needed \nincentives for Americans to become more cost conscious as purchasers of \nmedical services. MSA's will clearly give people more control over \ntheir health care dollars with the opportunity to save unspent MSA \ndollars for future health and long-term care needs.\n  Mr. President, overall this legislation represents an appropriate \nbalance between the role of the Federal Government with the private \ninsurance market in addressing the health-related problems currently \nfacing many of our citizens.\n  However, we must recognize that we are breaking new ground with the \nenactment of this bill. The level of Federal involvement proposed in \nH.R. 3103 in the affairs of the historically private marketplace of \ninsurance products does indeed raise concerns. We will not ignore these \nconcerns in the implementation of this new legislation, and we will \nreview carefully the long-term impact of these provisions.\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to say to the gentleman from New \nMexico, Senator Domenici, that I, too, am disappointed that the \nconferees could not work out language on mental health.\n  I voted for that amendment, because I strongly believe we need to do \nmore to address the problem of mental health insurance coverage for the \nmillions of Americans who suffer from mental illnesses that are as \ndevastating to individuals and families as physical ones.\n  During our preconference sessions, I worked with my colleagues to see \nif there were alternatives to parity which could be pursued in this \nlegislation, because I truly believe that we are not doing enough on \nmental health. One idea I put forward was to direct increased resources \nto mental health through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration.\n  I put this proposal forward in a good-faith effort to increase our \nfederal presence on mental health. I understand the concerns of my \ncolleagues that this would not go far enough when compared to the \nDomenici amendment, but nevertheless I regret that the bill does not \ncontain any mental health provision. I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Nevertheless, on balance, I am convinced that this bill will serve \nthe interests of the American people who have long sought responsible \nhealth insurance reform.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not take this \nopportunity to recognize the efforts of the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources, Senator Kassebaum, who is \nto be commended for her leadership and perseverence, in developing this \nlegislation.\n  I can think of no fitting tribute to her than the enactment of this \nhealth reform bill.\n  Her dedication, hard work, and common sense have been hallmarks of \nher career in the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me also thank the ranking minority member, Senator Kennedy, who \nhas also been an instrumental player and leader in the development of \nthis legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report to H.R. 3103.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining 2 minutes.\n  Today, in spite of 18 months of Republican attempts to deny a pay \nincrease to the most underpaid American workers, Congress will, at long \nlast, send the President legislation to raise the minimum wage. \nFinally, 5\\1/2\\ years after the minimum wage was last increased, \nCongress is taking steps to ensure that all workers can earn a living \nwage.\n  This day has been a long time coming; 18 months ago, in February \n1995, I introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $5.65 an \nhour in three 50-cent increments, and joined Senator Daschle 1 month \nlater to introduce S. 413, which would have raised the minimum wage by \n90 cents in two increments--on July 1, 1995 and July 1, 1996.\n  A year ago, on July 31, 1995, I offered a resolution expressing the \nsense of the Senate that the Senate should take up the minimum wage \nincrease before the end of last year. It received only two Republican \nvotes and was defeated.\n  I was unable to get a hearing on our bill until December, and--month \nafter month--the Republican chairman of the Labor Committee refused to \nschedule a markup session to consider it.\n  Finally, with the very skillful assistance of the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle, I was able to offer our bill as\n\n[[Page S9526]]\n\nan amendment to another bill in March, and obtained a strong vote in \nfavor of a 90-cent increase in the minimum wage. The Republican leader \nat the time, Senator Dole, responded by pulling the parks bill from the \nfloor of the Senate. He then tied the Senate in procedural knots for \nweeks, rather than allow a second vote on our bill.\n  It was only after Senator Dole left the Senate to campaign for the \nPresidency that we succeeded in scheduling a vote on our bill, and only \nafter threatening to shut down the Senate. I hope every American \nremembers that this victory for the working poor became possible only \nafter Senator Dole left Washington to become a private citizen.\n  Now 13 months have passed since the first of the increases in our \noriginal bill would have taken effect. The Republicans' delaying \ntactics have cost minimum wage workers almost $4 billion. I hope every \nAmerican remembers how tenaciously and how long the Republicans have \nfought to prevent this increase in the minimum wage.\n  By contrast, in vote after vote, my Democratic colleagues have been \nunited in their support of fair wages for all workers. I want to salute \nthem for that unity and thank them for their support throughout this \nlong fight.\n  Thanks to the perseverance of my Democratic colleagues, the poorest \nAmerican workers will see their incomes increase by 22 percent. By the \ntime next year that the second increase takes effect, they will see \ntheir incomes increase by $1,800 a year, enough to pay for 7 months of \ngroceries or a year of community college.\n  Unlike the punitive welfare reform bill Congress has just passed, \nthis raise in the minimum wage will actually improve the lives of \nmillions of people. It will lift 300,000 people out of poverty, \nincluding 100,000 children, and save families across the Nation from \nhaving to make cruel economic decisions, such as choosing between \nkeeping the utilities turned on and paying for groceries or medicine.\n  The real problem for much of the welfare population is their \ninability to find jobs that pay enough to support them and their \nfamilies. If work does not pay a living wage, requiring welfare mothers \nto work will do nothing to end their poverty.\n  It is unfortunate that this good legislation for low-wage workers was \ncoupled with a package of tax giveaways to large and small businesses. \nI regret that many objectionable changes to our tax laws are being made \nunder the cover of raising the minimum wage.\n  On balance though, H.R. 3448 is legislation that should be passed. \nThis long awaited raise in the minimum wage should be delayed no \nlonger.\n  These are important factors for hard-working men and women in this \ncountry. This is an extremely important achievement and accomplishment. \nI look forward to casting my vote in favor of the increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I say how very grateful I am to so \nmany for all of the efforts that have gone into making the passage of \nthe House insurance reform possible tonight.\n  It is not possible to name all the names, and I ask unanimous consent \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Labor Committee: Dean Rosen, Susan Hattan, Anne Rufo, David \n     Nexon, Lauren Ewers.\n       Finance Committee Majority: Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, Julie \n     James, Mark Prater, Doug Fisher, Gioia Bonmartini, Alex \n     Vachon, Brig Gulya, Sam Olchyk, Donna Ridenour.\n       Minority: John Talisman, Patti McClanahan, David Podoff, \n     Laird Burnett, Keith Lind.\n       Majority Leader: Annette Guarisco, Vicki Hart, Susan \n     Connell.\n       Minority Leader: Rima Cohen.\n       Joint Committee on Taxation: Ken Kies, Mary Schmitt, \n     Carolyn Smith, Cecily Rock, Brian Graff, Judy Xanthopoulos.\n       Congressional Research Service: Beth Fuchs, Madeleine \n     Smith, Kathleen Swendiman, Jennifer O'Sullivan, Celinda \n     Franco.\n       Thanks to the staff of: House Ways and Means Committee--\n     particularly Chip Kahn, Elise Gemeinhardt, and Kathy Means; \n     House Commerce Committee--Howard Cohan, Melody Harned; House \n     Economic Opportunities Committee--Russ Mueller; Congressional \n     Budget Office Staff; House and Senate Legislative Counsels--\n     particularly Bill Baird, Ed Grossman, John Goetcheus, and \n     Julie Miller.\n\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Without the dedicated efforts of our staff, it would \nnot have been possible. I mention Dean Rosen, Susan Hattan of my staff, \nand David Nexon and Lauren Ewers of Senator Kennedy's staff, and many \nothers who have spent countless time and effort.\n  It is an important piece of legislation. I am very proud we have \naccomplished it in a bipartisan fashion. It could not have been done \nwithout them.\n  Senator Kennedy mentioned the minimum wage legislation which we will \nbe voting on as well, in back-to-back votes. I will speak after those \nvotes on something I regard very important to the success of both \nwelfare reform and the minimum wage, and that is job training programs.\n  Without our willingness to be more innovative and skillful in how we \nhandle job training problems, we will not succeed with the type of \nwelfare reform or minimum wage that enables us to have skilled young \npeople and retrained older people entering our job markets. I think \nthat is an important component of the success of those bills.\n  I yield any remaining time, but say again how proud and grateful I am \nto all who have had a hand in the passage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9501-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORRECTING THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3103\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senator yield me 10 seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield.\n\n\n                         Explanation of Absence\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like for the record to reflect that \nour good friend and colleague, David Pryor, has missed votes yesterday \nand today because of the death in his family of his father-in-law and \nthe funeral today. I want the record to reflect that because it was not \nofficial business.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the last half hour, we have \nexperienced a double-header victory for the American people: health \ncare and a raise in the minimum wage. In a sense, both these bills had \nnine lives, and they needed all of them. But they have come to a \nsuccessful resolution this evening and, hopefully, they will be on the \nPresident's desk in the very near future.\n  I would like to just take a moment--I know others want to address the \nSenate and we still have time for discussion on these two measures--but \nI do want to at this time express my very, very strong personal \nappreciation for the support, the assistance, and the help of our \nleader, Senator Daschle, for his leadership throughout the process on \nboth of these pieces of legislation, as well as so much other \nlegislation.\n  I pay tribute, as I did earlier, to Senator Kassebaum for sponsoring \nthe legislation and for all that she has done to move it forward.\n  To Senator Harkin for his work on the genetic information, the fraud \nand abuse provisions. He has been tireless in both of these areas, as \nwell as many others.\n  Senator Wellstone's work on domestic violence, the mental health \nissues has been enormously important, and although we did not achieve \nthem in this legislation, I think all of us have an understanding we \nare going to revisit those issues in September, and I look forward to \njoining with Senator Wellstone, Senator Domenici and others for, \nhopefully, an important downpayment on that issue to try and reflect \nwhat is the reality, and that is a mental illness should be treated \njust like every other illness in our health care system.\n  To Senator Simon for his work on the privacy issues.\n  To Senator Mikulski and Senator Dodd who were extremely active and \ninvolved in the markup and are always involved, Senator Dodd \nparticularly, on children's issues and Senator Mikulski on the impact \nof this legislation and also the minimum wage legislation on women in \nour society.\n  To Senator Breaux for his help in making the compromise possible.\n  And to all the others who helped.\n  I also thank all of my staff who worked so tirelessly: David Nexon \nwho has done such an extraordinary job over many years and has devoted \nthe better part of his life to trying to improve quality health for \nAmerican people. I think all of us at this time are mindful of the \nextraordinary quality of individuals on our staff who really make such \nan enormous difference in the legislative achievements and for changes \nin policy.\n  Carey Parker; Nick Littlefield, our overall staff director for his \ntirelessness in both of these endeavors; Lauren Ewers, who has been a \nkey member of our health staff; Jim Manley; Dennis Kelleher, Sue \nCastleberry, April Savoy, Brian Moran.\n  I, too, want to thank Dean Rosen and Susan Hattan of \nSenator Kassebaum's staff.\n\n  I think we have been fortunate on our committee to have Republican \nand Democratic staff. There have been extremely important and \ncooperative, and have high talent on both sides of the aisle. Senator \nMoynihan's staff, Laird Burnett and Jon Talisman, have been enormously \nhelpful.\n  Finally, I also thank Minority Leader Gephardt in the House of \nRepresentatives for his strong support and advocacy in working with all \nof our friends and Members of our party.\n  Congressman Dingell, Congressman Waxman and the others in the House \nwho participated in the conference committee. I am grateful to all of \nthem.\n  With respect to the minimum wage, this uphill effort against the odds \ncould not have succeeded without the leadership and support of \nSecretary of Labor Bob Reich and the contributions of his Department. \nMany people there lent us their expertise, but let me single out \nAssistant Secretary Geri Palast, Chief Economist Lisa Lynch, John \nFraser at the Wage and Hour Administration, and Seth Harris at the \nOffice of Policy.\n  Many organizations made a difference in this effort, but I want \nespecially to thank the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Women's Legal \nDefense Fund, the Mon Valley Unemployed Council, and the Business and \nProfessional Women USA for all of their help. As always, the AFL-CIO \nand its unions worked very hard for this legislation,\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\neven though very few union members earn wages low enough to be affected \nby this increase. They did so because they honor work and care about \nthe well-being of every American--not just their members. Chris Owens \nworked with all of these groups to help educate the public and the \nCongress.\n  Finally, on my own staff, Sarah Fox devoted her phenomenal energy to \nthis bill for a year before leaving to join the National Labor \nRelations Board. And Ross Eisenbrey, a congressional fellow detailed \nfrom the Department of Labor, worked very hard over the last 16 months \nto help us accomplish this 22 percent pay increase for millions of \nAmericans.\n  I thank the majority leader for his help and assistance and courtesy \non these issues, as on others.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9527-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9528-S9530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Johnson\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On that list, Mr. President, appears the name of Admiral \nJohnson, who will take over as Chief of Naval Operations, succeeding \nAdmiral Boorda, a man for whom all of us had the highest respect, a man \nin whom the Navy, from the lowest ranking enlisted sailors to the top \nflag officers, had confidence. In the wake of the tragedy concerning \nAdmiral Boorda, it will be a challenge for Admiral Johnson to lead the \nNavy. But having gotten to know him, having talked to many, many naval \nofficers who know him, both active and retired, I can say that he is \nregarded as the man best qualified in the U.S. Navy today to assume \nthis role of leadership at this time in the Navy's history.\n  Mr. President, I would like to read from a letter forwarded to me by \na former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Trost. Admiral Trost once \nserved with me in the Department of the Navy. He was my naval aide. He \nwrites as follows: ``Admiral Johnson enjoys the confidence of his \nfellow flag officers who see him as the team leader who will lead them \nin successfully meeting the challenges which face our Navy now and in \nthe future. He is the officer deemed best-suited to lead our superb \nNavy onward into the 21st century.''\n  May the new Chief have ``fair winds and following seas.''\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I do not support the nomination of Admiral \nJohnson for the top uniformed position in the Navy, Chief of Naval \nOperations. I take this position because I believe that the stormy seas \nthat the Navy has experienced in recent years call for the selection of \nNavy leaders who can serve as an inspiration not only in their \nwarfighting specialties and military prowess, but who also demonstrate \na solid commitment to the avoidance of the slightest appearance of \nconflict of interest.\n  In this case, Admiral Johnson received substantial sums of money, \nover $175,000 over the last 6 years, to serve on the board of an \ninsurance company, USAA, which caters to military officers. I know that \nhis acceptance of this position was legitimate, and was entirely legal. \nI do not know how much\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\ntime the position demanded of Admiral Johnson in his off-duty hours. I \ndo not raise any issue of wrongdoing in this matter. But there is the \ninherent appearance of conflict of interest in serving as an active \nduty Admiral while appearing to endorse a commercial insurance service \ncatering to other naval officers, by virtue of the fact that he \naccepted a paid position on its Board of Directors. I note that the \nSecretary of Defense has now disallowed this practice of serving on \nsuch boards for renumeration, but I think it does not show the kind of \njudgement I would expect of someone whose personal example must guide \nthe Navy after an era with too many instances of misconduct and poor \njudgment on the part of Navy leaders.\n  I support the Navy. It involves tough, demanding work, with long \nperiods of family separation serving in dangerous environments across \nthe world. The spirit of courageous service and the expertise the Navy \ndaily demonstrates in warfighting and in making ready for warfighting \nneeds to be matched with better judgement in areas involving apparent \nfinancial conflicts of interest. These issues of character need to be \naddressed in a way that will serve as a sorely needed example in a \nsociety where standards and values seem to be slipping away from where \nthey should be. This is the message I wish to convey in stating my \nopposition to this nomination. Let the record show that, if a roll call \nvote were taken on this nomination, I would be recorded as voting \n``no.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Adm. Jay Johnson to serve as Chief of Naval Operations.\n  As the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, I have taken a very close look at Admiral Johnson's record \nof service, his leadership qualities, his vision for the Navy and his \ncharacter to insure he will lead the Navy with distinction and honor \ninto the next century.\n  Based upon all of the information provided to the Armed Services \nCommittee and a private meeting in my office, I have concluded Admiral \nJohnson is the best person to assume the challenges and opportunities \nthat appear on the horizon for the next Chief of Naval Operations.\n  Admiral Johnson has an exceptional record of performance as a naval \naviator. During his career, Admiral Johnson has also served with \ndistinction in numerous command positions such as Commanding Officer \nVF-84, Commander Carrier Air Wing One, Commander Carrier Group Eight, \nCommander Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group, Commander Second Fleet, \nCommander Striking Fleet Atlantic, and Commander Joint Task Force 120. \nIn March, 1996 Admiral Johnson reported for duty as the 28th Vice Chief \nof Naval Operations.\n  A review of Adm. Jay Johnson's record indicates leadership qualities \nthat will serve him well as our Nation's next Chief of Naval \nOperations. I strongly support Admiral Johnson's confirmation to serve \nas the next CNO. I have every confidence Admiral Johnson will serve our \nNation well in this important position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9528-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to pay a special tribute to \nthe leadership of two Senators on the issues that we have just passed. \nThere are a lot of people who often question what happens around here \nand the meaning of the life of being a Senator, and some people have, \nobviously, chosen to engage in a different life and move on, some out \nof frustration from what you can get done around here.\n  I think the example of my senior colleague, Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, on the legislation that we have just passed, both the \nhealth care bill and the minimum wage, is precisely what being a U.S. \nSenator is all about and why it is so important for people to be able \nto make a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens.\n  Both of these bills have happened because of many people, and Senator \nKennedy graciously mentioned many of those involved in it.\n  But I think all of us know that on day after day after day he was \ndown here on the floor blocking, pushing tenaciously, advocating on \nbehalf of people who do not often have a loud voice on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate. Millions of Americans will now earn more and millions of \nAmericans will preserve more of their income as well as the fabric of \ntheir lives as a consequence of his extraordinary commitment to these \ntwo issues. I think the entire Senate should salute the meaning that he \nhas given to being a Senator and a legislator in the course of these \nefforts.\n  For Senator Kassebaum, who will be leaving the U.S. Senate, I think \nthat this health care bill would not have been on the floor, \nnotwithstanding Senator Kennedy's great efforts, had she not stood up \nand made it clear that this bill was going to find its moment on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate. She stood up to the leadership on her side \nand made that clear.\n  So this bill is a legacy to two Senators who have cared and remain \nsteadfast in their sense of priorities and of public rectitude. I \nwanted to pay tribute to both of them for those efforts. And there are \nmany, many Americans whose lives will be better because of what has \nbeen achieved here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts has said \nit so well. I wish to associate myself with his remarks.\n  This is a very important day for all of us. But I cannot think of \nanyone who deserves more credit and more commendation for the \ntremendous work that it has taken to get us to this point of passage of \nessential health reform than the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy.\n  It has been my great pleasure to work with him, not only on this \nlegislation but on so many other matters. In the view of many of us, he \nis a professional's professional. His dedication, his intelligence, his \nintegrity, his willingness to compromise and work with Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle on both sides of the issues has been proven \nthroughout this effort to pass this health bill.\n  His persistence and perseverance to ensure that at some point in this \nsession we would enact the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill is a tribute to him \nand to the extraordinary effort that he has put forth. So I want to \ncommend him, commend his extraordinary staff and all of those \nresponsible for bringing us to this point this afternoon.\n  As the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts indicated, the \nSenator from Kansas also deserves our thanks and a great deal of credit \nfor working so diligently with Senator Kennedy and all of us to bring \nabout this very important accomplishment.\n  This is a day that will affect many, many millions of Americans, \nAmericans who care deeply about their health and the health of their \nfamilies, Americans who deeply need help to find and afford adequate \nhealth insurance. We are going to be able to help families do that in \nlarge measure, thanks to the accomplishments and to the extraordinary \nleadership demonstrated today by Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9530-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9530-S9531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HEALTH CARE AND MINIMUM WAGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to say how pleased I am on behalf \nof the people of California that we have made such progress on raising \nthe minimum wage tonight and passing a long overdue health care bill. \nThe things that we did tonight are going to ripple throughout this \ncountry. There has been much discussion of the trickle-down effect. \nPeople who work hard at the bottom end of the economic ladder deserve \ndignity and an income to support their\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n\nfamilies. Today is a good day for them. It is a good day for all of us.\n  I also want to pay tribute to the senior Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy. I had the privilege and honor of standing with him at \nnumerous press conferences and briefings. We brought small business \npeople out who said that they paid their people more than the minimum \nwage, and they were proud of it. They had loyal and hard-working \nemployees.\n  At another, we had working women tell us that the difference to them \nbetween the hourly wage they are getting and the wage they will get \nafter this 90-cent-an-hour increase meant that they could pay for some \nlong overdue doctor bills. So we have done something very fine here \ntoday.\n  And health care--two of the provisions of the Clinton health care \nbill were taken out of that bill and passed in the form of a Kassebaum-\nKennedy bill. People can take their health insurance with them from job \nto job. It is a lifting of a burden and a worry. People with pre-\nexisting conditions, like high blood pressure, will not be denied \ncoverage. We should be very, very proud as we leave here this evening.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to call attention to one issue that \nwas not so good, not so kind, not so nice to the American people. When \nthe minimum wage bill left the Senate, it had in it a provision that I \nwas honored to author. It would have protected widows and widowers from \npoverty when the working spouse with a pension dies first. Currently, \nwhen the working spouse dies with a pension, the surviving spouse's \npension is cut 50 percent under the only pension option required by \nfederal law.\n  We can fix this problem without any cost. We can offer those couples \nwhen they do their pension planning an option that ensures the \nsurviving spouse pension is not cut in half. We could have done that in \nthis bill. We did it in the Senate's bill on an overwhelming 96-2 vote. \nBut the House leadership took the provision out.\n  I look forward to coming back here after the break and working with \nmy colleagues on the Family First agenda that Senator Daschle has laid \nout: Income security, pension security, health care security, security \nin our communities by putting more police on the beat.\n  These are the things Democrats are working for. I know we can reach \nacross this aisle, as we did on the two bills that just passed, to \ncarry out that agenda. Then we can really feel good about what we do \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9530-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9531-S9532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH INSURANCE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Congress has been struggling to address \nthe problems of our health care system for at least 4 years now. We \nhave a bill before us which constructively addresses some of these \nproblems. And the President has indicated that he will sign it.\n  The bill preserves the essence of the Kassebaum bill. It provides a \nmedical savings account opportunity. It increases the health insurance \ndeduction for the self-employed. It will facilitate and encourage the \npurchase of private long-term care insurance. And, it will provide \nmajor new weapons in the fight against health care fraud and abuse.\n  Senator Kassebaum's legislation addresses some of the most \ndistressing health insurance problems of Americans. It should increase \nthe availability of health insurance by requiring insurers to issue \nhealth coverage to businesses which want to purchase health insurance \nfor their employees.\n  It should substantially increase the portability of health insurance \nby limiting the ability of group health plans to impose pre-existing \ncondition exclusions on workers moving from one job to another. Workers \ninsured in one job will now be able to move to another job without fear \nof losing their health insurance. It will also improve portability for \nindividuals moving from the group to the individual health insurance \nmarket.\n  The bill still defers to health insurance reforms passed by the \nstates. In my State, we enacted earlier this year a good health \ninsurance reform law. The Kassebaum bill defers to State insurance \nreforms which substantially achieve the ends the Kassebaum bill seeks. \nSo, my expectation is that Iowans will continue to receive health \ninsurance under the terms of the Iowa reforms.\n  But many States have not enacted health system reforms. Should those \nStates continue without their own reforms, the Kassebaum bill will \nprovide their citizens with these protections.\n  The bill includes a medical savings account program. As the sponsor \nof one of the major medical savings account proposals in the Senate, I \nam very pleased to see that the conferees agreed to include a modified \nversion of the original proposal introduced by Congressman Archer and \nmyself.\n  The provisions contained in the bill retain the essential structure \nof the MSA concept. I would have preferred to see the maximum annual \ncontribution to an MSA account be larger than 65 or 75 percent of the \ndeductible for an individual or a family. I would have preferred that \nmore than 750,000 be able to participate. I do not see as a major \nlimitation the fact that participation will be limited to smaller \nbusinesses and the self-employed. That's where the problem of the \nuninsured is greatest; hence, MSA's make sense for those individuals.\n  If I have any concerns about the MSA provisions, Mr. President, it is \nthat I have been given to understand that the those provisions are \nelaborate and complicated. Given this, I can only hope that the MSA \nprogram laid out in this bill will not fail because of this complexity. \nIf we must have a trial of this concept, we have the right to expect \nthat it will have a fair chance to succeed, and not hamstrung by overly \ncomplicated rules and regulations.\n  The farm community and the small business community strongly support \nthis MSA concept. In my State of Iowa, a great many people are familiar \nwith high deductible health insurance policies. I believe that many \nIowa farmers and small businesspeople will want to participate in this \nprogram.\n  Another feature of the bill that will be welcomed by the small \nbusiness community in my State is an increase in the deductibility of \nhealth insurance premiums for the self-employed from 30 percent to 80 \npercent by the year 2006.\n  One of the great inequities in our health care system is that \nbusinesses that offer health insurance as an employee benefit can \ndeduct the cost of that insurance from their Federal taxes. The \nemployees of those companies get those benefits, which are a part of \ntheir earned compensation, tax free. The self-employed, however, get \nonly the current law 30 percent deduction for what they must spend for \nhealth insurance.\n  The bill provides a medical expense deduction for payment of \nqualified long-term care insurance premiums and expenses. This should \ngive a boost to the use of private long-term care insurance. Given our \nFederal budget deficit problem, and the difficulty we are going to have \nas a government and society paying for the benefits we have already \npromised, we simply must encourage increased use of private long-term \ncare insurance. These provisions should help.\n  Second, Senator Cohen's waste, fraud and abuse legislation is \nincluded in the bill. These provisions constitute a substantial \nincrease in the remedies available to law enforcement for combatting \nhealth care fraud and abuse. The General Accounting Office has \nestimated that fraud represents as much as 10 percent of total health \ncare spending.\n  Perhaps 10 percent does not sound like much. But 10 percent of more \nthan $900 billion per year is a huge amount of money. We must do our \nvery best to insure that we are not defrauded of any of this money and \nthat not a penny is wasted.\n  Mr. President, we have been promising these incremental reforms since \nat least 1992. Most of us have been saying, since at least 1992, that \nwe could easily enact reforms such as those in this bill. We should \npass it.\n  Mr. President, I feel that I should conclude by making clear to my \nown constituents what this bill is not designed to do. I think we will \nbe making a serious mistake if we over-sell what it is designed to do \nand, therefore, what it will accomplish. If we do exaggerate what this \nbill is designed to do,\n\n[[Page S9532]]\n\nthe American people will be very disappointed and disillusioned when \nthey discover that the bill does not live up to their expectations.\n  Therefore, I want to make clear, at least to the people I serve in \nIowa, what this bill has never been designed to do.\n  It does not attempt to make health insurance more affordable;\n  It would not completely eliminate denial of coverage for pre-existing \nconditions;\n  It would not provide portability between different individual \npolicies; and\n  It would not necessarily mean that currently uninsured individuals \nwould have to be sold a health insurance policy.\n  Having said that, let me conclude by saying that this monumental \npiece of legislation is the kind of incremental common sense reform \nindividuals and families across the country have been looking for. I am \nproud to support it and I urge the President to sign it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9531-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9532-S9533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GOOD SAMARITAN FOOD DONATION BILL\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2428, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2428) to encourage the donation of food and \n     grocery products to nonprofit organizations for distribution \n     to needy individuals by giving the Model Good Samaritan Food \n     Donation Act the full force and effect of law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to support the passage of the \nGood Samaritan Food Donation Act, H.R. 2428. This important measure \nwill encourage the charitable distribution of food by establishing a \nsingle national liability standard for the good-faith donation of food \nand grocery products. It has been named in honor of my good friend, the \nlate Bill Emerson, who staunchly advocated this measure as well as \nother nutrition programs during his service in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I believe it is a fine tribute to his interest and \ncommitment to ensuring that hungry Americans are properly fed. I would \nalso like to commend Senator Bond and Senator Leahy for their efforts \nin seeing this bill brought to the floor as quickly as possible.\n  Liability concerns are the overriding reason why unsalable, but \notherwise wholesome, food is destroyed rather than donated to charity. \nIn 1990, Congress attempted to address these concerns with enactment of \nthe Model Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which gave States a model \nstatute to enact in order to provide some measure of protection from \nliability. All 50 States and the District of Columbia have enacted some \nform of legislation aimed at extending liability protections to donors \nand distributors of donated food. Unfortunately, States have taken a \nwide variety of approaches to this issue, leaving donors and \ndistributors of food with a confusing patchwork of laws with which to \ncontend.\n  It is my understanding that none of the various State laws have been \ntested in the courts. Nevertheless, the fear of potential liability \ncontinues to discourage potential donors 6 years after passage of the \nmodel statute. When Second Harvest, the Nation's largest network of \nfood banks, commissioned a survey last year to examine the factors \naffecting food donations, the fear of liability remained the single \nmost important reason why food is destroyed rather than donated.\n  Computerization and new inventory practices by some of the Nation's \nlargest food retailers and distributors have meant less food is wasted \nin this country. For food banks, this new efficiency has made it more \ndifficult to obtain food donations. Fear of liability only makes their \nessential work harder.\n  By enacting this measure, Congress will be helping to ensure that \nfood banks can respond to the needs of the hungry in our communities. \nThis modest bill should be just the first step in a sustained effort to \nsee that other obstacles to charitable activities are removed as well.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 5148 and 5149\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I understand there are two amendments at the desk, one \nby Senator Leahy and one by Senator Kennedy. I ask unanimous consent \nthey be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes \n     amendments en bloc numbered 5148 and 5149.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendments be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (No. 5148 and 5149) were agreed to, en bloc, as \nfollows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5148\n\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 3, line 11, and insert the following:\n       (C) by striking subsection (c) and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Liability for Damages From Donated Food and Grocery \n     Products.--\n       ``(1) Liability of person or gleaner.--A person or gleaner \n     shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability arising \n     from the nature, age, packaging, or condition of apparently \n     wholesome food or an apparently fit grocery product that the \n     person or gleaner donates in good faith to a nonprofit \n     organization for ultimate distribution to needy individuals.\n       ``(2) Liability of nonprofit organization.--A nonprofit \n     organization shall not be subject to civil or criminal \n     liability arising from the nature, age, packaging, or \n     condition of apparently wholesome food or an apparently fit \n     grocery product that the nonprofit organization received as a \n     donation in good faith from a person or gleaner for ultimate \n     distribution to needy individuals.\n       ``(3) Exception.--Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to \n     an injury to or death of an ultimate user or recipient of the \n     food or grocery product that results from an act or omission \n     of the person, gleaner, or nonprofit organization, as \n     applicable, constituting gross negligence or intentional \n     misconduct.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5149\n\n       On page 2, line 8, insert ``the title heading and'' before \n     ``sections''.\n       On page 2, strike line 15 and insert the following:\n       Samaritan'';\n       (C) in subsection (b)(7), to read as follows:\n       ``(7) Gross negligence.--The term `gross negligence' means \n     voluntary and conscious conduct (including a failure to act) \n     by a person who, at the time of the conduct, knew that the \n     conduct was likely to be harmful to the health or well-being \n     of another person.'';\n       On page 3, line 11, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       On page 3, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       (E) in subsection (f), by adding at the end the following: \n     ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede \n     State or local health regulations.''.\n       On page 4, after line 1, insert the following:\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for the \n     National and Community Service Act of 1990 is amended by \n     striking the items relating to title IV.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, H.R. 2428 provides limited immunity from \ntort liability for nonprofit food banks. I am pleased to support the \nbill now that it includes my amendment clarifying that nothing in the \nbill supersedes State or local health regulations.\n  Tort liability is a central pillar of our legal system. It protects \nconsumers by providing an incentive for reasonable care, and it ensures \nreimbursement for those who are injured by negligent conduct. Any \nexceptions to the general rules of tort liability must be narrowly \ntailored.\n  I do not object to the effort embodied in this bill to provide a \nmeasure of additional protection against liability for food banks. \nThese organizations engage in important work, and they deserve our \nsupport. I have some concerns about the scope of the protection we are \nextending to food banks. I would have preferred a definition of gross \nconduct which made clear that conduct, including a failure to act, by a \nperson who knew or should have known that the conduct was likely to be \nharmful to the health or well-being of another person would still be \nactionable. But I am satisfied that the standard contained in this bill \nstill requires that food donors and food banks exercise care to ensure \nthat the food they donate or distribute does not harm the people \nreceiving the food.\n  My amendment makes explicit the fact that nothing in this Good \nSamaritan Food Donation Act supersedes State or local health \nregulations. If we diminish the protections afforded by the tort laws, \nit is vital for the health\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\nand safety of those who consume donated food that regulatory \nprotections remain in place.\n  I also remain concerned about subsection (b) of the bill, which \ntransfers this provision from the National and Community Service Act to \nthe Child Nutrition Act. But I will not object or seek to amend that \nsubsection based on my understanding that the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee will continue to exercise jurisdiction over this provision in \nconjunction with the Agriculture Committee.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri if my understanding of this \njurisdictional matter is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts that we have \nreached that understanding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent the amendments be agreed, to en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5148 and 5149) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be \ndeemed read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2428) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate supported \noverwhelmingly the passage of H.R. 2428, the Bill Emerson Good \nSamaritan Food Donation Act.\n  This is a tremendous tribute to my good friend and colleague from \nMissouri, Congressman Bill Emerson, who represented southeast \nMissouri's Eighth Congressional District for 16 years. Bill Emerson was \nwell known in this body, and certainly to many around this city, and \nwas loved by the people of southeast Missouri. He had a long and \ndistinguished career of service in the U.S. Congress.\n  Bill was especially well known for his work in agriculture and in the \nfight against hunger, including being an ardent supporter of food \ndistribution programs. One of his legislative priorities this session \nwas a bill that would make it easier for millions of tons of unused \nfood by restaurants, supermarkets, and other private businesses to end \nup in food pantries and shelters rather than in garbage cans and \ndumpsters.\n  The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act is identical to \nlegislation championed by Bill Emerson before his death. In the past, \nprivate donors have been reluctant to make contributions to nonprofit \norganizations because they are concerned about potential civil and \ncriminal liability. With this legislation, private donors will be \nprotected from such liability, except in cases of gross negligence and \nintentional misconduct. Those in need will truly benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I am happy to be a part of this commonsense approach to fight \nhunger, and I appreciate the cooperation of all Members involved in \nthis process.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to say this bill was a long time \ncoming. We have been hassling through a variety of different \namendments. I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator Kennedy, and others \nfor their cooperation in finally getting this bill to pass.\n  This is a bill that really is a tribute to a friend of mine and many \nhere in this body, Bill Emerson, who recently passed away after a long \nbout with cancer. Bill did tremendous work in the area of nutrition on \nthe Agriculture Committee in the House. This is a fitting tribute, a \nbill that will bear his name, that will provide much more food for food \nbanks to be able to feed needy families all over this country.\n  I am very proud to have been involved with this effort. Thank you, \nMr. President.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say, along with many others \nwho have talked about some of the really important legislation that has \nbeen accomplished in the last few weeks in Congress, along with the one \nthat I have worked the hardest for, and the one that I think will have \na lasting impact, not tomorrow and not next year, but 20 years from \nnow, and that is the homemaker IRA's.\n  When I got to the Senate, I was very surprised that there was still \nthe inequity against homemakers being able to save for their retirement \nsecurity in the same way that someone who works outside the home is now \nable to do. In fact, this penalizes the one-income-earner family when \nthe homemaker stays home and raises children. I think we should be \nencouraging homemakers to be able to do that, rather than discouraging \nthem. That is why Senator Mikulski and I introduced the homemaker IRA \nbill in 1993.\n  We have been working for these 3 years, and this year, Senator Roth, \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee took up our cause. He and \nChairman Bill Archer said that this would be a priority for them, and I \nwant to thank Chairman Archer and Chairman Roth for not only saying it \nwould be a priority, but for delivering on that promise. They have \ndelivered homemakers of this country an equal opportunity to save for \ntheir retirement security.\n  What this means, Mr. President, is that a homemaker will now be able \nto set aside $2,000 a year toward retirement security, accruing tax-\nfree. That can make a difference of over $150,000 in a lifetime of \nsavings, so that now a one-income-earner couple, if they both save the \nmaximum amount for 30 years, would have around $350,000 as a nest egg. \nThat could make a big difference in retirement planning, especially for \npeople who are squeezing to make ends meet so that one parent can stay \nhome and raise the children.\n\n  So this is a wonderful accomplishment. It is one for which will not \nbe appreciated, probably, in the near future because it does have to \naccrue into retirement. But this was a great bipartisan effort.\n  I do want to commend Senator Lott for helping us move this through. I \nwant to commend Senator Roth and Congressman Archer for shepherding it \nthrough the committees in the House and Senate. I just want to say how \nmuch I appreciate Senator Mikulski, Senator Feinstein, Nancy Johnson, \nand Jennifer Dunn and Susan Molinari on the House side, along with \nBarbara Kennelly, for making sure that this did become an \naccomplishment of this session of Congress.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9533-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9533-S9535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1997--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in a moment, I am going to propound a \nunanimous-consent request that we move to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 3230, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \nyear 1997. I note the absence of members of the other party on the \nfloor. Obviously, they will want to be notified of this. I do not \nintend to pull any surprises here. I will be propounding that UC in a \nfew moments.\n  The reason I do this, Mr. President, is that we have worked long and \nhard and very diligently this year to avoid the problems that we \nencountered last year in not moving the defense authorization bill for \nfiscal year 1996 as quickly as we would have liked. There were some \nissues that were contentious, and we had difficulty resolving some of \nthose issues.\n  There was a determination on the part of the chairman and members of \nthe committee this year to avoid the problem we had last year. I \ncommend Senator Thurmond for the extraordinary work that he led in \nbringing this item to closure in a timely fashion. We held hearings \nearlier than we ever have, we held markups earlier than we ever have--\nat least since I have been on the committee--and we moved forward in an \nextraordinarily efficient way. We resolved the contentious issues and \nthe differences between Members and between our parties on those \nissues, and we have legislation which now has passed both the House and \nSenate, and we have a conference report that we ought to be prepared to \nvote on.\n  Now, the reason why this is so important is that within this \nconference report are a number of significant items that are important \nto the security of\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\nthis Nation. Most important is funding for antiterrorist activities \nthat goes to various committees. And there probably is not a more \npressing issue before the American people right now other than this \nterrorist activity that has taken place in the United States and \nquestions as to what the response of the Congress and the \nadministration is going to be.\n  This legislation provides for $122 million for the strengthening of \ndomestic preparedness to deal with threatened or actual use of nuclear, \nchemical, biological, or radiological weapons. We are facing a new \nworld today, a world that leaves no American safe in their home, on the \nstreets, at the Olympic games, in New York City, in Indianapolis, IN, \nor anywhere else. It is vitally important that we move forward in \nproviding for adequate counters to these threats that exist to the \nAmerican people. This legislation begins the process of doing just \nthat, and the $122 million that is authorized in this authorization \nbill is important to accomplish that purpose.\n\n  If we cannot move forward before we break for recess, we will have \ndelayed, for at least 30 days, and probably more, moving this \nlegislation onto the President's desk for signature, so that we can \nbegin the process of dealing with the terrorist situation that we face.\n  There is $201 million in here to carry out the provisions of the \nDefense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act, the Nunn-Lugar Act. \nThis is a cooperative effort between the United States and the former \nSoviet Union. It is important to the security of the United States.\n  We have a number of other items in here, including pay raises for \nmilitary uniform personnel and civilian personnel. We have a dental \ninsurance plan for retired service members and their families. We have \nmoney in here, or authorization, to support research into the gulf war \nveterans' illness. We have $466 million of authorized funds for \nconstruction of new barracks, dormitories and family housing.\n  For those Members who are familiar with the situation that exists \nwithin the military on family housing, who have bases in their \ndistricts or in their States, they know of the vital importance of \nmoving forward with the rehab and construction of existing housing and \nthe construction of new housing for our military. More than 60 percent \nof current military housing is labeled as substandard by military \nstandards. It is housing that you, I, or anybody on this floor would \nnot let our families live in, if we could help it. Yet, our service \nfamilies have no choice. It is an urgent priority of the Secretary of \nDefense, the Department of Defense, and this Congress to begin to rehab \nand provide adequate housing for our military.\n  On and on it goes. There is $6 billion for increasing funding for \nprocurement of ships, aircraft, and tactical systems; $3 billion for an \nincrease for research and development; increased funding for \ndevelopment of a national missile defense system and a tactical missile \ndefense system that protects our troops in the field and Americans here \nat home.\n  I could go on, Mr. President, but we are faced with a situation that \nunnecessarily delays our ability to provide necessary authorization for \nvital national security interests that are important to the United \nStates. I, for one, do not understand why we can't go forward with \nthis. I believe I would at this point----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Indiana tell me, were the \nDemocrats who signed this conference report--my understanding was that \na majority of the Democrats on the committee signed this conference \nreport, is that correct?\n  Mr. COATS. This conference report is overwhelmingly supported by \nMembers of both parties, Democrats and Republicans. I do not have the \nexact numbers.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. My understanding is that all but two Democrats signed \nthis conference report.\n  Mr. COATS. That is my understanding. The issues that divided us \nwithin this report have been resolved and accepted and signed by all \nbut two Members.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Indiana if it \nis his belief that, so often when there is a conflict anywhere in the \nworld where we may have to commit troops, that the one statement that \nyou hear universally from this body and the House of Representatives \nis, ``We support our troops.''\n  Do you believe that if we take action on this defense authorization \nbill that would be a strong signal to our troops that we support them \nand that there is nothing that can stand in the way of authorizing that \nbill tonight, and send the message that we support our troops?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Idaho that, if \nthere were outstanding issues over which we had legitimate differences \nand we had not been able to resolve those differences and that is one \nreason not to go forward, that might be understandable. But the issues \nhave been resolved. Democrats and Republicans have agreed to the \nresolutions of the contentious issues.\n  So, whether it is missile defense, or a pay raise, or readiness, or \nmodernization, or funds to combat terrorism, all of those issues have \nbeen decided in the conference. We have done so in an expeditious \nfashion, and the American public has asked us to come here and do our \nwork. I do not know of anything more important--I do not know of any \nmandate the Congress has in the Constitution that is more important--\nthan providing for the national defense. I do not know of any issue \nthat is more important for Members of the Senate than being able to say \nto the people that they represent that we have provided for the \nnational security of the United States. That is our foremost \nobligation.\n  As I said, were there outstanding differences of opinion on issues \nthat we had not been able to resolve, I can understand why we might not \nbe able to do this before this Congress recesses for a 30-day period of \ntime. But, since that is not the case, since there is agreement, since \nit is a bipartisan agreement, I believe we ought to, in the interest of \nnational security and the interest of combating terrorism, go forward. \nAnd I for one do not understand why we can't do that.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one further \nquestion?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This morning I received a personal phone call from \nthe Secretary of Defense, William Perry, who thanked me as a member of \nthe committee for all of the efforts that the committee put forth so \nthat we could have this bill completed in conference, and the fact that \nit was here before the Senate. The Secretary indicated that he was so \npleased with this authorization of the conference report, and he said \nthat he was communicating to the President his strong desire that the \nPresident sign this bill because this is what the Pentagon wants, and \nthis is what the administration wants.\n  Is that the Senator's understanding as well? And, again, is there any \nreason in the world we should not move on this tonight and give the \nadministration what they have asked for?\n  Mr. COATS. I think the minority leader is about ready to tell us the \nreason we can't move forward tonight. Again, that just points to the \nbipartisan support. The administration has signaled through the \nSecretary of Defense, President Clinton's appointed Secretary of \nDefense, that they are happy with the bill. They thank us for moving \nforward with the bill in an expeditious fashion. They do not want to \nget into the situation that we got into last year any more than we want \nto put them in that situation. I have received similar calls. It \nappears to be a piece of legislation important to the United States, \nimportant to the national security, one that is supported by Democrats \nand Republicans, one that is supported by the administration, and, yet, \nwe are not able to resolve to go forward in what Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Nunn a few hours ago said we can dispose of in 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I also want to add to that laundry list of support that \nthe House passed this bill with a vetoproof\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\nmajority. This has overwhelming support in the House of \nRepresentatives. As the Senator mentioned, the President would like \nthis bill.\n  I am anxious for the Senator to propound his unanimous consent to see \nwhy we cannot move forward with this very vital piece of legislation \nfor our national security.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will now do that. I am sure the minority \nleader would like to comment on it. But I ask unanimous consent that we \nproceed immediately to the conference report to accompany H.R. 3230, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments made \nby the distinguished Senator from Indiana and my other colleagues.\n  This is the bill. It is over 1,000 pages. I will not ask the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana whether he has read every page or \nnot. But I daresay that I suppose that, if anybody has, he has, as \nthoughtful and as studious as he is. But there are very few people in \nthis body who have read this report. It is 1,000 pages long. We got it \nyesterday. Two Democrats on the conference refused to sign this report \nbecause they had very serious concerns about it that they would like \nthe opportunity to discuss.\n  This is the most expensive legislation that we will pass this year in \none bill. I intend to vote for it, I think. I want to read it over the \nnext couple of weeks myself. I think I will be supporting it. But I \nmust say it wouldn't be a bad idea if we just took a little time, had a \nlittle chance to read it, and discuss whether or not it is the bill we \nwant to vote for. That is all we are asking.\n  I have heard a lot of comments about how this would only take 20 \nminutes or 15 minutes. I must say when you have a bill like this of \n1,000 pages, I can recall many times we have been on the floor--whether \nit was health reform or many other bills--when someone has risen, and \nsaid with indignation, ``We can't pass this because we do not know what \nis in it.'' I heard that speech from my colleagues on the Republican \nside probably a half-dozen times in the last Congress.\n  So I do not think it is too much to ask, Mr. President, that we have \nthe opportunity to look at it, read it, hopefully talk about it, have a \ngood discussion, and analyze it. After all, it is the defense of the \nUnited States that we are talking about here. We should not minimize \nit. We certainly should not demean it. And I am not implying that \nanyone is. But this is a very critical decision. This is something we \nought to be careful about.\n  So we just are not prepared tonight, now that everybody is gone and \nwere told that there would be no more votes, to bring this up under any \ncircumstances, especially under a unanimous consent agreement without \nany debate or any thoughtful deliberation, and without having read \nthis. I can't do that. Not many of my colleagues can do that.\n  So let us just take another breath, take another look, and we will be \nready to go when we come back in September.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the fact that \nthe minority leader is willing to read the bill over the August recess. \nI just want to let him know, as a member of the committee who has \nhelped negotiate the bill and is familiar with all aspects of the bill, \nthat I will leave him my phone number in case he has questions. He can \ntrack me down, and I will be happy to answer those.\n  But I would state to the minority leader that, as he well knows, we \nfrequently bring a bill that comprises a great number of pages to the \nfloor and pass them with less tribulation than would be accorded this \nparticular bill. We do so because they have been subject to weeks, if \nnot months, of negotiations between members of the committee, between \nleadership, between all of those involved, and all of those who have \nquestions about the various issues.\n  So when the bill finally arrives at the floor, when it finally comes \nhere for final passage, we are all very familiar with it, and we know \nwhat the differences are between us. In this particular instance, \nprobably the most knowledgeable Member of the U.S. Senate as to the \nnational defense issues facing this country is not a Republican but a \nDemocrat--Senator Sam Nunn, chairman of the committee for many, many \nyears, now ranking member of the committee. It was Senator Nunn that \njust an hour ago stood on the floor and said we have resolved all the \ndifferences here; there is no reason why this should take very long. \nAnd that was propounded not by a Republican. That was propounded by the \nDemocrat ranking member of the committee. The distinguished chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Thurmond, agreed. Those of us who serve on the \ncommittee, both Republicans and Democrats, indicated that we have \nlooked at it. We have been meeting in rooms for weeks attempting to \niron out the small details and the differences on this.\n  There really are no outstanding issues. We could talk about issues, \nbut they have already been discussed and they are already familiar to \neverybody here. I would also point out to the minority leader that just \ntoday the minimum wage conference report came to us, the safe drinking \nwater conference report came to us, the health bill came to us \nyesterday, defense came on Wednesday.\n  Now, of those four--minimum wage, safe drinking water, health, \ndefense--defense is the one that got here first. Those other three were \npassed today without extended debate, with very limited debate. Why? \nBecause all of the details had been worked out, because we have been \ndebating the bill for months and various committees have been meeting \nand all of us had the opportunity to look and determine what is in the \nbill, to raise questions about any details we had concerns about, and \nto resolve the differences. All of that has been done.\n  So anybody who has been watching this proceeding knows that we have \njust passed three major pieces of legislation that have been in \nnegotiation for months, and yet they were brought to the floor with \nless time to debate than the defense bill. As important as those bills \nare--health, safe drinking water, and minimum wage conference reports--\nI do not believe they stand higher priority than the national defense \nof the United States.\n  I regret that the minority leader felt constrained to object to this \nbill. I regret that we have to delay moving forward to the important \nprovisions in this legislation that affect all Americans.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9533-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9535-S9541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMALL BUSINESS JOB PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Under the unanimous \nconsent agreement, following the vote, we were supposed to complete the \ndebate on the health legislation and then proceed to the legislation on \nthe minimum wage and small business taxes. We are anxious to move ahead \non the small business tax legislation.\n  What is necessary to get us on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. By a previous consent \nagreement, debate on the conference report to the Small Business Job \nProtection Act, H.R. 3448, is the pending business. The Senator from \nDelaware has 60 minutes under his control, the Senator from New York \nhas 60 minutes under his control, and the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kennedy, has 30 minutes under his control.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself such time as I may take, and I will be very \nbrief.\n  It is my understanding that there are no requests for time on the \nminority side. Is that correct?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is correct. My distinguished chairman, as always, \nhas so stated the facts. But there is a small semantic issue here. Some \ncall this the small business relief act; others on this side call it \nthe minimum wage bill. But\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\nwe will not resolve that tonight, nor need we.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Could I ask the distinguished ranking member whether or not \nhis side is willing to yield all time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I may speak directly to the Senator--I ask unanimous \nconsent to do--exactly.\n  Mr. ROTH. So I think both sides are willing to yield back----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I cannot speak for the Senator from Massachusetts, who \nis not present.\n  That is the case.\n  Mr. ROTH. Could I ask, would it be possible to check that with the \nstaff?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I have just so done and am informed that is the case.\n  I see the Senator from Kansas is present, however.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I was going to speak, after the \nchairman and ranking member finish speaking, on a component I believe \nwas important to consider along with the minimum wage and the welfare \nreform legislation.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this has certainly been a busy month. I \nappreciate not only the perseverance of my colleagues, but also the \nwillingness of the many valiant staff members who have been working \naround the clock--both here and on the House side.\n  This Congress began with great promise, and I'm pleased to say that \nwe are drawing near conclusion with great accomplishment. With the \npassage of this small business legislation Americans everywhere will \nhave tools necessary for increased opportunity, greater achievement, \nand more certain security. This is important. It's important for our \nfuture, for the well-being of American families, and for the strength \nof our communities.\n  And what a departure this is from the past--from the old philosophies \nthat ran this city. It was then that Washington seemed to have only \nthree criteria when it came to American businesses: if they moved, tax \nthem; if they kept moving, regulate them; if they stopped moving, \nsubsidize them.\n  I believe this legislation demonstrates that those days are over. \nThis legislation demonstrates that this Congress understands that \nopportunity for Americans, security for our families, is directly tied \nto the strength of small business.\n  There are 22 million small business owners who provide paychecks for \n6 out of 10 Americans. These risk takers provide more than half of our \neconomy's output, and what we're demonstrating with this legislation is \nthat this Congress is ready and willing to help create an environment \nwhere there can be greater growth, opportunity, and jobs--and \nenvironment where these small businessmen and women can hire, expand, \nand modernize.\n  Among the many important provisions offered in this legislation, \nfirst and foremost is an increase in the amount of equipment eligible \nfor expensing. We raise the current law level of $17,500 per year to \n$25,000 per year, beginning in 1997 and fully phased in by the year \n2003.\n  Next, we include a package of subchapter S corporation reforms that \nwill permit more shareholders in S corporations, the use of S \ncorporations for estate planning purposes, and increased flexibility \nfor subchapter S corporation business use.\n  We also include a package of pension simplification provisions. An \nimportant element of this package is a new pension plan directed to \nsmall business, known as SIMPLE. The SIMPLE plan developed by Senator \nDole will enable small business owners to set up pensions with less \nrecord keeping and guaranteed benefits to their employees. \nAdditionally, tax exempt organizations, as well as State and local \ngovernments, will be able to offer section 401k pension plans.\n  One provision in this legislation that I'm particularly proud of is \nthe new spousal IRA. This will permit homemakers to contribute up to \n$2,000 per year to an IRA, the same amount as their spouse. This \nrepresents an increase of $1,750 over current law, and will go a long \nway toward creating self-reliance and retirement security for American \nfamilies.\n  Among other important changes offered by this legislation is a 6-\nmonth delay in the effective date for electronic filing of taxes for \nsmall business. In other words, small businesses will be provided more \ntime to become familiar with, and prepare for, the electronic filing \nprogram that was part of NAFTA.\n  These, Mr. President, are some of the major provisions of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996. In addition to these important \nchanges, we offer a package of extensions of expiring tax provisions.\n  These include an extension of the tax-free treatment of employer \nprovided education expenses. Other important extensions cover the \nresearch and development tax credit, the orphan drug tax credit, and a \nnew work opportunity tax credit. Along with these were extend tax \ndeductible contributions of appreciated stock to certain charities, the \nsection 29 tax credit for alternative fuels produced from biomass and \ncoal facilities, and a moratorium on the collection of diesel tax paid \nby recreational boaters at marinas.\n  Another very important provision in this legislation--one that is not \nso much associated with strong businesses as it is with strong families \nand a strong America--is the new credit for adoption expenses. This tax \ncredit will provide $6,000 for special needs adoptions and $5,000 for \nother adoptions. This, Mr. President, will go a long way to helping \nloving parents provide homes for children who will now be raised in \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, these are only a few of the many components of this \nimportant legislation. One final change, I would like to mention is \nthat extension of the generalized system of preferences trade program, \notherwise known as GSP. This extension will run through May 31, 1997, \nand will help our exporters better compete in the global economy.\n  It's important to note that this conference agreement is a bipartisan \neffort--a bipartisan effort that is fully paid for. It contains \nincentives that will go a long way toward creating an environment for \ngrowth, job creation, economic security, and real opportunity for \nAmericans. With the changes we propose in this legislation, small \nbusiness men and women will have greater incentives and resources to \nmove our economy forward.\n  As I've said many times, taxation and regulation have profound \ninfluences on the ability of nations to create jobs. What we do with \nthis legislation is take some of the burden off the backs of American \nsmall business men and women. My hope is that this is only a beginning.\n  Mr. President, as we complete action on the H.R. 3448, the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996, I would like to take this \nopportunity to thank the many staff members who worked long and hard on \nthis bill.\n  Senate Finance Committee majority staff--Lindy Paull, Frank Polk, \nMark Prater, Dough Fisher, Brig Gulya, Sam Olchyk, Tom Roesser, \nRosemary Becchi, Lori Peterson, Erik Autor, and Jeremy Preiss.\n  Senate Finance Committee minority staff--Mark Patterson, Jon \nTalisman, Patti McClanahan, Maury Passman, and Debbie Lamb.\n  Senator Lott's staff--Annette Guarisco and Susan Connell.\n  Senator Daschle's staff--Larry Stein, Alexandra Deane Thornton, and \nLeslie Kramerich.\n  House of Representatives Ways and Means majority staff--Phil Moseley, \nChris Smith, Jim Clark, Donna Steele Flynn, Paul Auster, Tim Hanford, \nJohn Harrington, Norah Moseley, Mac McKenney, Thelma Askey, and \nMeredith Broadbent.\n  House of Representatives Ways and Means minority staff--Janice Mays, \nJohn Buckley, Mildeen Worrell, Kathleen O'Connell, Beth Vance, Bruce \nWilson, and Maryjane Wignot.\n  Joint Committee on Taxation staff--Ken Kies, Mary Schmitt, Carolyn \nSmith, Joe Mikrut, Cecily Rock, Ben Hartley, Mel Thomas, Harold Hirsch, \nBarry Wold, Steve Arkin, Tom Barthold, Tom Bowne, Barbara Angus, Brian \nGraff, Leon Klud, Judy Owens, Laurie Mathews, Alysa McDaniel, Joe Nega, \nAngela Yu, and a special thanks to Bernie Schmitt and his excellent \nestimating staff who worked long into the night on several occasions.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. An increase in the minimum wage is long overdue, and \nthis legislation should be sent to the President before the August \nrecess. The value of the minimum wage has eroded due to inflation since \nit was last increased in 1989.\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\n  It is true that an increase in the minimum wage will reduce demand \nfor labor somewhat, although not significantly in my view. But if you \nare looking for a painless time to increase the minimum wage, it is \nnow. The current economic expansion is in its 66th month. Unemployment \nis down to 5.4 percent. The Washington Post recently reported that \nlabor shortages have developed around the country, so much so that some \nfast-food franchises are paying substantial signing bonuses to new \nemployees.\n  In response to concerns of some on the other side that the minimum \nwage increase will cause hardship to small businesses, the Finance \nCommittee took up the small business tax package last month. We worked \non a bipartisan basis to craft a small business relief bill all \nSenators could support. It was approved unanimously by the Finance \nCommittee on June 12, 1996. The bill passed the Senate with broad \nbipartisan support by a vote of 74 to 24 on July 9, 1996.\n  Unfortunately, many of the provisions that lent bipartisan support to \nthe small business tax title of the bill in the Senate were dropped in \nconference. I will briefly mention two matters of particular \nimportance: the tax exemption for employer-provided educational \nassistance, and the phaseout of the long-standing tax incentives for \nPuerto Rico codified in section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  The conference agreement inexplicably limits prospective extension of \nthe exclusion for employer-provided educational assistance to \nundergraduate education. Only undergraduate education is covered \nprospectively here, whereas both undergraduate and graduate education \nwere extended through 1997 in the Senate bill.\n  This provision is one of the most successful education programs the \nFederal Government sponsors. It encourages employees to upgrade their \nskills and thereby maintain and improve their productivity throughout \ntheir careers.\n  Roughly a million persons a year are assisted by their employers with \nhigher education expenses on a tax-free basis, a quarter of them at the \ngraduate level. Both employers and employees benefit. Many of our most \nsuccessful companies know the benefits of sending valuable employees to \nschool to learn a new field, or a field that has developed since that \nperson had his or her education. Employers understand the opportunities \nfor bringing a promising young person, or middle management person, to \nhigher levels of productivity, and pay them more in the process. This \nis an elegant piece of unobtrusive social policy.\n  Second, addressing the special tax rules for Puerto Rico is a \ndifficult subject, but the Senate approach was acceptable to the \nelected officials in Puerto Rico, and should have been adopted by the \nconference. The conference agreement fails to provide a continuing \neconomic incentive for investment in Puerto Rico after 10 years. Puerto \nRico still has significant economic problems, such as high unemployment \nrates and low median incomes. The island's unemployment rate is almost \n14 percent. While this rate is the lowest in 20 years, we are still \ntalking about an economy in which unemployment has routinely \napproached, and exceeded, 20 percent in the last two decades. It is \nalso an economy in which the median income of the American citizens who \nlive there is about $6,200, or half that of Mississippi, our poorest \nState.\n  Section 936 of the Tax Code has been in existence for 60 years, and \nnearly all have come to recognize that it is time to move to the next \nstage. However, we have a profound responsibility to that possession, \nwhich we obtained just short of 100 years ago in the aftermath of the \nSpanish-American War.\n  Under the Senate provision, adopted at the urging of this Senator, \na permanent, although reduced, wage-based credit for jobs located in \nPuerto Rico would have remained for existing employers. This would have \npreserved a limited measure of Federal support for Puerto Rico after \nthe remainder of the section 936 incentives are gone after 10 years. It \nwas the least that should be done, given that the people of Puerto \nRico--citizens of the United States--are being asked to pay for half or \nmore of these tax cuts for small business, none of which will benefit \nPuerto Rico.\n\n  Understanding the responsibility we have to this island and its \npeople, I hope that at a later time, as early in the next Congress as \npossible, we will return to this issue and adequately address our \nobligations to Puerto Rico. We must work together to provide effective \neconomic incentives for new investment in Puerto Rico to provide new \njobs and job security for Puerto Rican workers. The people of Puerto \nRico--who are not represented in Congress--have the right to be \nrespected and to have their interests advanced.\n  Thus, while I am disappointed by the resolution of the conference on \nthe small business tax package, I will vote for the conference report \nbecause of the importance of the increase in the minimum wage. I will \ncontinue to pursue the issues that were not resolved to my satisfaction \nin the conference report.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will yield such time as the distinguished Senator from \nKansas desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, I certainly thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth. I appreciate his help and leadership \non health insurance reform, and certainly as he worked with small \nbusiness tax relief as a part of the minimum wage package.\n  I supported the conference report, Mr. President, on small business \ntax relief which includes, of course, an increase in the minimum wage. \nHowever, I have strong reservations about raising the minimum wage \nbecause I have believed that in many instances with small businesses, \nparticularly the mom and pop operations, it will mean some loss of jobs \nor, indeed, reduced hours. But we will have to see.\n  I supported the conference report overall because I believe the \ndetrimental effects of the minimum wage increase will be offset by many \nof the small business tax relief provisions. However, as this minimum \nwage increase moves closer to becoming law, along with health care and \nwelfare reform, I believe it is important to point out that there is \nstill a gaping hole in our efforts to assist workers and improve their \neconomic security. Congress has yet to act on the legislation to reform \nour job training system, which is, I would suggest, in drastic need of \nrepair.\n  I listened with great interest to the debate that took place \nyesterday on welfare reform where Senator after Senator pointed out the \nimportance of training to bring welfare recipients into the work force. \nAs we debated the minimum wage bill through its passage and briefly the \nconference report, we heard the argument that this increase is needed \nto raise the living standards of those who are at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder. Yet we all know that the only way to improve the long-\nterm prospects of those at the bottom of the pay scale is to equip them \nwith the skills and education that will allow them to compete and move \nupward in today's changing workplace. It is ever more competitive, ever \nmore demanding of new skills and, unfortunately, the training \ninfrastructure that we have now in place is woefully inadequate. In \nfact, it is nothing less, I would suggest, than a national disgrace.\n  I will not take up the time of the Senate at this point to discuss \nthe scores of reports documenting with overwhelming evidence why the \ncurrent system is broken and must be fixed. I would just like to \nmention one of the latest GAO reports outlining the failure of current \nFederal programs.\n  The General Accounting Office compared control groups with \nparticipants in JTPA titles II-A and II-C, both programs for the \neconomically disadvantaged, the very people we are trying to help with \nthe minimum wage. Amazingly, the report found that there were no \nstatistically significant differences over time between the earnings of \nboth groups. This was one in which they were assisting the economically \ndisadvantaged and others where there had been no program offered.\n  In other words, the Federal training these disadvantaged participants \nreceived did nothing to improve their income. It had no effect. This is \nnothing short of a fraud on the American taxpayer and, more \nimportantly, a cruel hoax on the disadvantaged who think they are \ngetting help but end up no better off. I remain astounded that we \nshould want to continue funding these ineffective programs.\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\n  I am particularly disappointed with the Secretary of Labor, who \nsupports this increase in the minimum wage but is also responsible for \nthese job training programs which he knows are in a state of disarray. \nHe has done little to advance legislation to reform job training even \nthough bills passed both Houses with wide bipartisan margins. For 3\\1/\n2\\ years now, the Secretary has stressed the critical importance of \ntraining for the closing of the wage gap for those at the bottom. We \nhave talked often about this. He has been supportive of early efforts. \nYet he has done nothing to really try to improve our Federal job \ntraining system.\n\n  Even before the ink was dry, the Secretary recommended that the \nPresident veto the job training conference report. Secretary Reich's \nmain concern with the job training reform bill seems to be lack of \naccountability. But, according to the National Journal article:\n\n       When pressed, (Secretary) Reich acknowledged that his real \n     problem with accountability concerns the legislation's \n     failure to require participation of mayors in local boards \n     and federal approval of state workforce development plans.\n\n  In other words, his concerns are largely political. He wants to \npreserve the Federal Government's control, the status quo, and business \nas usual. This is not going to solve the problem.\n  We have such an opportunity to really try to be more innovative and \ntry to bring to the fore something that will reinforce what we are \nseeking to do with welfare reform and the minimum wage legislation. \nWhen it comes to job training, I suggest the status quo is \nunacceptable. We must move forward this year with comprehensive job \ntraining reform. After months and months of negotiations, and \ncompromises made on all sides, we now have a conference agreement that \nwill bring real reform to a broken system, consolidating duplicative \nprograms over some 80 programs. They will be combined and much \nduplication removed, giving the States the flexibility needed to design \nthe programs that fit their States, whether it be Kansas, Iowa, New \nHampshire, New York or California, and focus the resources there where \nthere is the greatest need--whether it would be in vocational education \nor a job services initiative.\n  The job training conference report will encourage real partnership \nbetween educators, job trainers and the business community. And it will \nfocus accountability on real results. If we are truly concerned about \nraising living standards, raising the minimum wage is only half the \nanswer. Proponents of the minimum wage have argued that you cannot \nsupport a family on $4.25 an hour, and that is certainly correct. You \ncannot support a family on $5.15 an hour either. Education and training \nare also needed to improve one's living standards, and right now we are \nwasting billions of dollars on dozens of ineffective programs that are \njust not delivering to those who need help the most. I personally \ncannot believe there is anything more important we could do to really \nenhance those who, we have argued for months, most need assistance, \nthan by being willing to address this issue.\n  I want to put my colleagues on notice that I will do everything I can \nto ensure the job training conference report comes to a vote this year \nand goes to the President.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, and I have asked Senator \nLott and Senator Daschle to bring this conference report up the week \nthat we return from recess. I tend to believe most of us are now asking \nthe majority leader to consider legislation the week we return. But I \nam hopeful our request will be met. I will continue to push this \nconference report because I believe it is too important--and the status \nquo is unacceptable--not only to the American taxpayer but, more \nimportant, to those who desperately need and want training education as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy that the Senate is finally \ntaking up the conference report on the Small Business Job Protection \nAct. The House has already overwhelmingly passed this measure in a vote \nof 354 to 72. Finally, we are making laws instead of rhetoric about tax \nrelief.\n  Finally, American families and entrepreneurs can get a break from the \ntax man.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I am proud of my part in moving \nthis legislation through the Finance Committee and through the bill's \nconference committee.\n  This bill is good, sound bi-partisan work. In my belief, great credit \nalso goes to Finance Chairman Roth for his leadership of the committee. \nTo ensure that his efforts will not go unnoticed, I want to remind all \nSenators that Chairman Roth completed work on three separate conference \nreports this week. This is no small accomplishment, and I extend my \ngratitude to my friend from Delaware.\n  For my State of Iowa, this conference report on the small business \ntax bill makes some vital improvements. Particularly, I want to point \nout the provisions enabling new loans for first time farmers. I hope \nthat this legislation will save the future of agriculture.\n\n\n                      Loans for First Time Farmers\n\n  I introduced this Aggie Bond legislation with Senators Pressler, \nBaucus, and Moseley-Braun. It improves the program that allows tax-\nexempt bonds to finance discount rate loans for beginning farmers.\n  Loans for beginning farmers are important because of the changing \nscene in agriculture and the inability of young farmers to get started \nin farming. Of particular importance are the statistics of the average \nage of farmers. In Iowa, our farmers average in their late fifties. In \n5 to 6 years, we will have 25 percent of our farmers retiring.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced that my State of \nIowa has 2,000 less farms today than it did only a year ago. Four other \nStates also lost 2,000 farms each. The largest decreases were in the \nStates of Ohio, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana. Clearly, farming States \nare still feeling the effects of the agricultural recession of the \n1980's.\n  Young people are discouraged about becoming farmers because they \ncannot afford to get started. Many want to continue the family farm \nwhen their parents retire and cannot.\n  This Aggie Bond legislation helps by lifting the present restriction \nthat disallows the bonds from being used to finance family to family \ntransactions. In other words, under present law, a young person cannot \nget a good loan to continue the family farm. This legislation fixes \nthat problem. I am very proud to be an agent of this important change.\n\n\n                  Contributions in Aid of Construction\n\n  Mr. President, this Conference Report also includes another unrelated \nimportant change for families trying to buy a home.\n  The provision is called Contributions in Aid of Construction. It \nrepeals an indirect tax that has been imposed on families building \nhomes since the 1986 Tax Act.\n  It will save families up to $2,000 off the price of a new home. \nCurrent law requires that water utilities pass a ``gross up'' tax onto \na family that wants to buy a home. The ``gross up'' tax can increase \nthe cost of extending water services to a new home by 70 percent. This \nconference report repeals this unfair ``gross up'' tax. It will foster \nhome ownership where it is currently out of reach.\n  Repealing the ``gross up'' tax is an outstanding addition to this \nSmall Business Job Protection Act. I am pleased to have introduced the \noriginal bill.\n\n\n                         Pension Simplification\n\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that the pension simplification \nprovisions in this bill represent a major step forward. Not much has \nbeen said about these provisions in the commentary about what we are \naccomplishing here this week.\n  But I think you can argue that these pension simplification \nprovisions could represent one of the major accomplishments of this \nweek of many substantial legislative accomplishments.\n  Their enactment should ultimately result in more pension plans being \ncreated, particularly by smaller businesses. Since it is that segment \nof the business community that has the greatest difficulty in offering \npensions to their employees, enactment of these provisions could result \nin a major increase in pension coverage.\n  Ultimately, that means more savings and more income for retirees.\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\n  We included in the bill a number of provisions which will help \nclarify the treatment of church pension plans.\n  We included last year in the Finance Committee's portions of the \nBalanced Budget Act a Pryor-Grassley bill designed to deal with many of \nthe problems the church plans were having with the rules pertaining to \nhighly compensated employees and to nondiscrimination.\n  Ultimately, those provisions were dropped from the legislation on the \ngrounds that they did not meet the requirements of the Byrd Rule.\n  The legislation that we are considering today will go a long way \ntoward taking care of the most serious of the problems faced by the \nchurch plans.\n  Mr. President, these simplification provisions have been on our \nCongressional agenda for several years. I understand that President \nClinton has indicated support for pension simplification provisions. It \nis high time they were enacted.\n  Finally, I just want to stress again the importance that today we are \nmaking laws instead of rhetoric about tax relief. Families and small \nbusinesses not only need it, they deserve it. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this conference report.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I strongly support the legislation before \nus today. I am pleased that Members from both sides of the aisle rolled \nup their sleeves and got the job done in a bipartisan way. In \nparticular, the ranking member, Patrick Moynihan, has done a fine job.\n  The positives of this legislation are many:\n  It benefits working families by raising the minimum wage which now \nhovers near a 40-year low.\n  It benefits orphaned and abandoned children seeking adoption by \nproviding a tax credit to families for adoption expenses.\n  This bill provides many tax benefits to small businesses encouraging \ninvestment and growth.\n  And, finally, it simplifies dozens of pension provisions for small \nbusinesses and working families, thereby, increasing pension savings.\n  Tens of millions of American workers will benefit from the increase \nin the minimum wage and from the tax incentives for small businesses, \nand we have helped them by working out our differences and allowing \nthis measure to move forward.\n  The current minimum wage is near a 40-year low in purchasing power, \nand amounts to an annual income of only $8,800. Clearly, a family is \nnot going to make it on $8,800 a year. Workers deserve a living wage \nfor their labor, and this raise in the minimum wage is well earned by \nthose workers. In 1995, 42,000 workers in my State of North Dakota \nreceived under $5.15 per hour for their work. This bill is an important \nand timely raise for them.\n  The minimum wage increase will also help families move off welfare \nand into jobs. Welfare reform will not work until jobs that pay a \ndecent, living wage are available. This raise increases the chances of \nthe poorest Americans staying off welfare. It goes hand-in-hand with \nour efforts to reform the welfare system.\n  I appreciate the recognition the conference committee gave to \norphaned children who are older, handicapped, or have other special \nneeds. Families which adopt these children will be allowed a $6,000 tax \ncredit for adoption expenses. Families adopting nonspecial needs \nchildren will be allowed a $5,000 credit.\n  We have an obligation to not only protect abused, neglected, and \nabandoned children, but we have a responsibility to help these \nvulnerable children find nurturing and stable families to adopt them.\n  The adoption tax credit is a good first step to help place children \nwaiting to be adopted. Many stable and nurturing families may not have \nthe resources to pay adoption expenses and other expenses such as \nbuilding ramps and modifying a home to make it accessible for an \nadoptive child with special needs. This will help.\n\n  I am also very pleased with the provisions benefiting small and \nstartup businesses. First, the increase in expensing of investment for \nsmall businesses by nearly 45 percent--from $17,500 to $25,000--will \nhelp thousands of small businesses in my State and around the Nation. I \nam pleased that this bill permanently extends that benefit to horse \nranchers as well.\n  Second, the modifications of the law relating to subchapter S \ncorporations will stimulate investment and growth of thousands of small \nbusinesses. The legislation expands the number of owners allowed from \n35 to 75 and provides other benefits to S corporations.\n  Third, the pension simplification provisions will help millions of \nAmericans working for small businesses provide for their retirement. \nAnyone who has ever waded through the morass that we call pension law \nwill understand how important these simplifications are to small \nbusiness owners. Owners of small businesses are too busy running their \nbusinesses and providing jobs to have to deal with the virtually \nincomprehensible language of the Tax Code and of the Internal Revenue \nService's rules and regulations. This pension simplification is a \nsignificant step forward. We need to make more.\n  One of the most important pension reforms will allow a family to \nprovide for the retirement of a spouse who chooses to stay home. \nSpousal individual retirement accounts of up to $2,000 per year for \nqualifying families for the spouse that chooses to stay at home to take \ncare of children ends the discrimination against families in which one \nparent works at home. The work of raising children is the most \nimportant job in our society.\n  Fourth, the extension of certain expiring tax provisions will provide \nincentives for investment in technology, for hiring hard-to-place \nworkers, for producing clean fuels from low-rank coals and lignite, and \nfor developing orphan drugs.\n  The rapid development and commercialization of new technologies is \nparticularly important to the incomes of working people. High-\ntechnology provides better jobs at better pay for millions of Americans \nand helps keep this Nation competitive in the international \nmarketplace. Additionally, the incentives to develop new technologies \nto turn our abundant coal resources into environmentally friendly fuels \nis critical if we are ever to make progress toward energy independence.\n  With regard to technology development, I am particularly disappointed \nthat we did not continue the R tax credit uninterrupted. Our high-\ntechnology companies deserve a consistent and supportive tax policy \nfrom their government. It is my hope we can revisit this issue next \nyear.\n  The revenue offsets have been greatly improved from the initial House \npackage, although I continue to have serious reservations about some of \nthem. Dropping the tax on court awarded damages for pain and suffering \nis a major improvement. Court-awarded damages for pain and suffering \nare meant to make the plaintiff whole and should not be considered \nincome.\n  Concerning employee stock ownership plans, I believe that it may be a \nmistake to take away a portion of the tax benefits used by ESOP's. \nEmployee stock ownership plans are a way for working families to buy a \npiece of America and to provide for their retirement needs.\n  I am also concerned that we are extending the airport and airway \ntrust fund excise tax without a serious review of all the issues. While \nthe extension is only for 6 months--until December 1996--it keeps in \nplace a system designed prior to airline deregulation. That leftover \ntax clearly discriminates against smaller communities which tend to \nhave high airline ticket prices. In addition, it makes little sense \nthat one passenger will pay two to three times more taxes on the same \nflight as his or her seat-mate. The burden each passenger places on the \nFAA is the same. While some argue that the excise tax discourages \nwasteful airline spending since costs plus the tax must be passed on, \nthis current tax also raises by ten percent the cost of every safety \nmeasure the airline undertakes.\n  Finally, I again want to compliment those who worked in a bipartisan \nfashion to achieve a result. Frankly, there are probably few Members on \neither side of the aisle that support every provision in this bill, but \ntogether, this package advances the Nation's interests. If enacted into \nlaw, it will have a positive effect on working families, small \nbusinesses, and adoptive families and their children. I recommend that \nit pass.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity,\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\nas we are about to vote on an extension of the Generalized System of \nPreferences, to raise a subject that is of great concern to all soybean \ngrowing States, including my State of Illinois, which is second only to \nIowa in the production of soybeans. A number of countries, including \nBrazil and Argentina, employ a tax system that works to distort trade. \nIt is designed to create an unfair competitive advantage for the \nprocessed agricultural exports of these countries at the expense of our \nexporters.\n  Let me briefly describe how this practice, known as a differential \nexport tax scheme, or DET, works. Using soybeans as an example, under a \nDET system, a much higher export tax is imposed on raw soybeans than on \nprocessed soybean products, such as soybean meal and oil. This serves \nto restrain exports of raw soybeans, giving a foreign country's \ndomestic oilseed processors a captive market, in effect, for raw \nsoybeans at a price that is depressed below world market prices. \nBecause these processors have artificially lower raw material costs, \ntheir costs of production are substantially less than those of U.S. \noilseed processors. As a result of this government interference, those \nforeign oilseed processors are receiving an indirect subsidy that \nclearly violates the spirit of free and fair trade, and, if provided as \na direct export subsidy, would be subject to World Trade Organization \nrules.\n  U.S. processors are placed at a terrible competitive disadvantage as \na result of this practice: They not only must continue to pay the world \nprice for raw soybeans, they are forced to sell their processed soybean \nproducts at world prices that are suppressed to the level of the DET-\nsupported export prices. This DET-induced downward pressure on world \nprice levels for these products has severely reduced revenues for the \nU.S. soybean processing industry. In addition, countries that rely on \nthis trade-distorting practice have dramatically displaced U.S.-\nprocessed soybean sales in world markets.\n  I understand that efforts may be underway in some of these countries \nto end these tax schemes. I believe, however, unless we see some \ndemonstrable progress by these countries in the coming months, the \nSenate Finance Committee should undertake a close review of this issue \nas part of its trade agenda in the next Congress.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, more than 6 months ago, President Clinton \ncame before the Congress and called for a modest increase in America's \nminimum wage--from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour.\n  And for the past nearly 6 months, 12 million Americans woke up every \nmorning, went to work each day and continued to earn a meager $34 a \nday--waiting for this Congress to uphold its responsibility to working \nAmericans and raise the minimum wage.\n  Today, their wait is finally over.\n  Today, working Americans are finally getting a break.\n  Americans who were being asked to live on $8,500 a year are receiving \na much-needed helping hand from the U.S. Congress.\n  Due to this legislation, minimum wage workers will see an additional \n$1,800 in their paychecks by the end of the year.\n  Raising the minimum wage will allow millions of America's working \nfamilies to pay for 7 months of groceries, 1 year of health care costs, \nor more than a year's tuition at a 2-year college.\n  And today, the nearly one in five minimum wage workers who currently \nlive in poverty will now have a genuine opportunity to make a better \nlife for their children.\n  My only regret is that it took so long to reach this moment. Over the \npast 6\\1/2\\ months, my colleagues across the aisle used every possible \ntool to block this legislation.\n  They claimed that raising the minimum wage would cost jobs--even \nthough study after study shows this to be a fallacious argument.\n  They raised erroneous economic arguments--even though 101 economists \nendorsed an increase in the minimum wage.\n  They proposed amendments that would have excluded 10 million minimum \nwage recipients from the bill's benefits.\n  But, in the end, the obstructionist efforts of my Republican \ncolleagues were overwhelmed by the voices of the American people, \ncalling for a minimum wage increase.\n  For the more than two-thirds of minimum wage workers above the age of \n21; for the 4 in 10 who are the sole wage earner for their families; \nand for all the Americans trying to make ends meet and put food on the \ntable, this vote represents a genuine victory and a first step to a \nbetter future.\n  Throughout America, millions of working families are struggling to \nget by and the votes today on the minimum wage and Kassebaum-Kennedy \nhealth insurance bill make that process just a little bit easier.\n  It is something we can all take great pride in and I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in voting on behalf of this bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the International Trade \nSubcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, I want to point out a \nprovision in the Small Business Job Protection Act relating to trade \nthat I strongly support. That is the extension of the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences [GSP]. This extension is long overdue.\n  The GSP is important for many reasons. From a foreign relations \nstandpoint, it allows the United States to assist the economy of \ndeveloping countries without the use of direct foreign aid. But it also \nis of great benefit to American businesses. That is why it is most \nappropriate that the extension of the GSP be included in the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act. Many American small businesses import raw \nmaterials or other products. The expiration of the GSP has forced these \ncompanies to pay a duty, or a tax, on some of these products. That's \nwhat a duty is: an additional tax.\n  By extending the GSP retroactively, these companies will not be \nrequired to pay this tax. This tax is significant and can cost U.S. \nbusinesses hundreds of millions of dollars. In fact in 1995, American \nbusinesses saved $650 million due to the GSP. I wonder how many good, \nhigh-paying jobs will be created by cutting taxes by $650 million? So, \nMr. President, it is very important that the GSP be extended and it is \nvery appropriate that the Senate consider it as part of this bill.\n  It is essential to remember, however, that since its inception in the \nTrade Act of 1974, the GSP program has provided for the exemption of \n``articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive.'' \nThis is a very important directive and critical to our most import-\nimpacted producing industries. A clear example of an import sensitive \narticle which should not be subject to GSP and, thus, not subject to \nthe annual petitions of foreign producers that can be filed under this \nprogram, is ceramic tile.\n\n  It is well documented that the U.S. ceramic tile market repeatedly \nhas been recognized as extremely import-sensitive. During the past 30 \nyears, this U.S. industry had to defend itself against a variety of \nunfair and illegal import practices carried out by some of our closest \ntrading partners. Imports already dominate the U.S. ceramic tile market \nand have done so for the last decade. They currently provide \napproximately 60 percent of the largest and most important glazed tile \nsector according to 1995 year-end Government figures.\n  Moreover, one of the guiding principles of the GSP program has been \nreciprocal market access. Currently, GSP eligible beneficiary countries \nsupply almost one-fourth of the U.S. ceramic tile imports, and they are \nrapidly increasing their sales and market shares. U.S. ceramic tile \nmanufacturers, however, are still denied access to many of these \nforeign markets.\n  Also, previous abuses of the GSP eligible status with regard to some \nceramic tile product lines have been well documented. In 1979, the USTR \nrejected various petitions for duty-free treatment of ceramic tile from \ncertain GSP beneficiary countries. With the acquiescence of the U.S. \nindustry, however, the USTR at that time created a duty-free exception \nfor the then minuscule category of irregular edged specialty mosaic \ntile. Immediately thereafter, I am told that foreign manufacturers from \nmajor GSP beneficiary countries either shifted their production to \nspecialty mosaic tile or simply identified their existing products as \nspecialty mosaic tile on custom invoices and stopped paying duties on \nthese products. These actions flooded the U.S.\n\n[[Page S9541]]\n\nmarket with duty-free ceramic tiles that apparently had been \nsuperficially restyled or mislabeled.\n  In light of these factors, the U.S. industry has been recognized by \nsuccessive Congresses and administrations as import-sensitive dating \nback to the Dillon and Kennedy Rounds of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet during this same period, the American \nceramic tile industry has been forced to defend itself from over a \ndozen petitions filed by various designated GSP-eligible countries \nseeking duty-free treatment for their ceramic tile sent into this \nmarket.\n  The domestic ceramic tile industry has been fortunate, to date, \nbecause both the USTR and the International Trade Commission have \nrecognized the import-sensitivity of the U.S. market and have denied \nthese repeated petitions. If, however, just one petitioning nation ever \nsucceeds in gaining GSP benefits for ceramic tile, then all GSP \nbeneficiary countries will be entitled to similar treatment. This could \neliminate many American tile jobs and devastate the domestic industry. \nTherefore, it is my strong belief that a proven import sensitive and \nalready import-dominated product, such as ceramic tile, should not \ncontinually be subjected to defending against repeated duty-free \npetitions, but should be exempted from the GSP program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address one final trade issue. It is \nnot a part of this bill but it does relate to GSP, because the problem \nI will discuss is a result of an inequitable tax policy put in place by \nsome countries that are major beneficiaries of the GSP program. This \ntax policy, known as a differential export tax scheme or DET, is used \nto confer an unfair competitive advantage for these countries' exports \nof agricultural products, particularly soybean meal and oil, to the \ndetriment of U.S. producers, processors, and exporters.\n  Mr. President, I'll briefly describe how this differential export tax \nscheme operates. Under a DET system, exports of a raw commodity, in \nthis case soybeans, are taxed at a higher rate than exports of the \nprocessed derivatives of that commodity, soybean meal and oil. Since \nthis increased tax discourages the export of soybeans, the oilseed \ncrushers in those countries are able to purchase soybeans from their \ndomestic growers at prices well below the world market prices paid by \nU.S. oilseed crushers. Because they pay a lower cost for their raw \nmaterials, these foreign crushers are then able to undercut U.S. \nprocessors in the world market for processed soybean products.\n\n  For example, the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil recently \nchanged its tax structure so that a tax of 13 percent is levied on all \nexports of raw soybeans, while the export tax on soybean meal and oil \nis only 5 percent. At current market values, this gives the Brazilian \ncrushers an additional crushing margin of about $22 per ton. This is \nessentially an indirect subsidy for these crushers and significantly \ndistorts free trade. I assume this practice would be subject to World \nTrade Organization rules if the subsidy were provided as a direct \nexport subsidy.\n  The consequence of this type of practice is a drastic loss in the \nU.S. share of world export markets for processed soybean products, and \nartificial downward pressure on world price levels for these same \nproducts. This is not acceptable. As you know Mr. President, Iowa is, \nin any given year, either the first or second leading soybean producing \nstate in the nation. This is a distinction we share with our neighbors \nin Illinois. So this unfair trade practice is of great concern to Iowa \nfarmers and processors, and those in other states as well.\n  I understand that progress is being made on resolving this issue, but \nmore work must be done. In the case of Brazil, it is my understanding \nthat the Brazilian federal government strongly supports reform of this \nDET system, and in fact is considering the complete elimination of all \ntaxes levied upon exports of agricultural products, both raw and \nprocessed. In the coming weeks and months, I will be closely watching \nhow Brazil, Argentina, and other countries reform these practices. \nHowever, I am serving notice today that if these practices are allowed \nto continue, I will consider pursuing appropriate legislative or \nadministrative measures to counter them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9535-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9541-S9548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A VICTORY FOR WORKING AMERICANS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today--finally--we are raising the minimum \nwage and putting families first. We have won a major victory for every \nAmerican who values work and believes in fairness. It is a victory for \ncommon sense over ideology, for bipartisanship over saber rattling.\n  It is a victory for 290,000 hard-working families in Massachusetts \nwho are playing by the rules and struggling to make ends meet--who have \nfallen behind in the last 20 years and now have a chance to do better, \nto keep up, and give their children a chance at a decent life. It is a \nvictory for the millions of Americans who were trying to make a living \nand raise a family on $4.25 an hour and now will get $1800 more a \nyear--enough to buy groceries for 7 months.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a work force enhancement program and a \nfamily protection program for an investment of 90 cents an hour--a move \nwhich will strengthen the fabric of the American community and narrow \nthe widening gap in the workforce.\n  For the first time in years, we are giving workers a raise. This is a \ndown payment on our commitment to make sure that everyone in this \neconomy can participate--that everyone can earn more, learn more, \nprovide more for their families, and be part of an economy that works \nfor families--that values the dignity of work for those at the bottom \nas well as the top.\n  Mr. President, raising the minimum wage is, in fact, the most basic \nwelfare reform measure we could enact. It helps make work pay for those \nwho will be returning to the workforce. It will allow working mothers \nwho come off welfare to have a fighting chance to put food on the table \nfor their children and still find enough to pay the rent.\n  In the last few months we have heard a lot of talk from many of my \nRepublican colleagues that welfare recipients need to learn the dignity \nof work, and we would agree with them and we have passed a welfare \nreform package incorporating that concept. But I also believe that the \ndignity of a liveable minimum wage is that, as a society, we believe \nthat if you are willing to work hard, you deserve the dignity of \nearning enough to at least pull yourself out of poverty and put food on \nthe table and a roof over your children's heads.\n  Mr. President, this is the beginning of a new era of worker fairness, \nof giving a raise to those who need it most, and taking one more step \ntoward relieving the insecurities of the American worker. There is no \ngreater gift to a young mother who is trying to make ends meet, trying \nto pay the rent, buy food, pay child care, pay for health care, and \nsave for the future than to say to her that we know how difficult the \nstruggle is and we, as a nation, as a Congress, as a people are willing \nto do what we can to help.\n  Today, Mr. President, with this vote to increase the minimum wage and \ngive workers a raise, we have sent a message to America that we have \nrejected the extreme, hard line policies of the ideological warriors \nwho believe that the bottom line is the only line, and that if those at \nthe top earn more then those at the bottom will be better off. We have \nsent a message, instead, that we are, indeed, a common sense, pro-\nfamily community that believes in fairness and in a fair wage for a \nday's work. And we have sent a message that we believe that if you \nincrease the intrinsic value of work you decrease the emotional cost of \nwelfare, and the emotional toll that hopelessness and fear take on hard \nworking mothers and families.\n  Mr. President, we have done the right thing. Some have fought it. \nSome have argued vehemently against it. Some have found arguments to \ntry to stop it. But in the end, we have struck an important blow for \nfairness, for work, for families; and in so doing we have brought two \nwords back into the lexicon of the 104th Congress and they are \n``compassion'' and ``community''. Increasing the minimum wage means \nthat we understand that we are all in this together and that we care. \nThat, Mr. President, is a victory for the principles for which I have \nfought during my tenure here, and for which I will continue to fight in \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, 5 years is a long time to go without a raise. Senators \nand Representatives do not go that long. Nor do corporate executives, \nor even most average working people.\n  And neither should those who earn the minimum wage.\n  Mr. President, the increase in the minimum wage that we will pass \ntoday will be the first raise in 5 years for close to 12 million \nAmerican workers. It's about time.\n  Mr. President, there's a lot of mythology about just who these \nminimum wage workers are.\n  Contrary to those prevailing myths, Mr. President, most minimum wage \nworkers are not rich suburban teenagers who take a job for extra \nspending money.\n  The fact is--two-thirds of minimum wage workers are adults; 58 \npercent are women; 40 percent are the sole breadwinners for their \nfamilies; and of the 25 percent that are teenagers, over half come from \nfamilies with below-average income.\n  Mr. President, fundamental fairness dictates that a person who gets \nup every day, goes to work, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should \nearn a living wage.\n  And yet, a minimum wage worker who works 40-hours per week, every \nsingle week of the year, doesn't even earn enough to reach the poverty \nline. That's wrong. And we have an obligation to do something about it.\n  Mr. President, the minimum wage increase in this bill will lift \n300,000 American families out of poverty. And that includes 100,000 \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 per hour \nmeans an increase in income of $1,800 per year for about 10 million \nworkers.\n  That's enough to pay for 7 months of groceries, or 4 months of rent, \nor even 1 year of tuition at a 2-year college.\n  It's tremendously important for millions of American families.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, the minimum wage is currently $5.05 \nan hour, above the national minimum, and only 10 cents below this new \nminimum of $5.15.\n  In my State, this wage increase will amount to $4 per week for a \nminimum wage worker. You might think that a 10-cent-an-hour raise \nwouldn't be a big deal. Well, you would be wrong.\n  In communities and families all over New Jersey, and around this \ncountry, even such a small increase in income could mean the difference \nbetween caring for children, and having them go hungry.\n  Four dollars buys 2 more gallons of milk, or 2 more loaves of bread, \nor 8 more boxes of spaghetti.\n  To millions of American families, even just a few dollars more per \nweek is a lot of money.\n  Mr. President, people who work hard and play by the rules should be \nable to provide for themselves, and their families.\n  The best way to encourage and honor the work ethic so important to \nour economic future is to ensure that even those at the bottom earn a \nliving wage.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support working Americans \nand to support this bill. It's the right thing to do. And it's long \noverdue.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I supported the health insurance \nconference agreement. I want to speak a few minutes about some of the \nvery good and some very problematic provisions in this agreement. I \nwant to congratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Kassebaum and others \nfor their hard work and perseverance.\n  A number of the provisions of this bill follow the framework of a \nproposal I put forth in the last Congress. In 1994, I offered what I \ncalled a downpayment plan that would have made health insurance \naffordable for every child in America, provided for increased \nportability and other insurance reforms, full tax deductibility of \nhealth insurance costs for the self-employed and a clampdown on health \ncare fraud, waste, and abuse. I am pleased that provisions similar to \nseveral of these items are included in this conference report.\n  I am very pleased that this legislation prohibits group and \nindividual health plans from establishing eligibility, continuation, or \nenrollment requirements based on genetic information. I offered an \namendment on this issue during committee consideration of S. 1028 and \nam pleased that it is included in the conference bill.\n  I believe this is a very important provision that will become even \nmore important as the availability and use of genetic tests grows in \nthe coming years. Genetic information should be used to help people \nstay healthy and should not be used to put a person at a disadvantage \nwhen it comes to health insurance.\n  While this legislation still leaves serious flaws in our health care \nsystem, it represents an important step toward reforming health care \nand injecting some fairness and common sense into the system.\n  The portability provision in the bill would provide some much-needed \nrelief for many Americans. Provisions to gradually raise the percentage \nof health insurance costs that farmers and other self-employed can \ndeduct from their taxes from 30 to 80 percent over the next 10 years, \nwould provide greater relief, if not equity, with larger businesses.\n  Mr. President, the portability provisions in the bill are \nparticularly important. Americans should not have to worry about facing \npreexisting condition exclusions if they get sick, change jobs, or lose \ntheir job.\n  This health insurance bill will provide many American families with \nadded security and choices.\n  The provisions in the legislation related to preexisting conditions \nare important and add some common sense to the current health insurance \nmarket. The bill limits the ability of insurers to impose exclusions \nfor preexisting conditions. Under the legislation, no such exclusion \ncan last for more than 12 months. Once someone has been covered for 12 \nmonths, no new exclusions can be imposed as long as there is no gap in \ncoverage--even if someone changes jobs, loses their job, or changes \ninsurance companies.\n  The preexisting condition provisions will help real people who have \nalready experienced an illness and want to switch insurers or change \njobs\n  For example, a father from Iowa City called my office about his \ndaughter who has a chronic health condition and will graduate from \ncollege this spring. He was worried that when she graduates and is no \nlonger covered under his health insurance policy she will not be able \nto find insurance coverage for her chronic health condition.\n  Because the Health Insurance Reform Act would require insurers to \ncredit prior insurance coverage, his daughter can move to another \nhealth insurance plan without being denied coverage for her preexisting \ncondition.\n  The portability provision in the bill will help with so-called job \nlock. Workers who want to change jobs for higher wages or advance their \ncareers often have to pass up opportunities because it might mean \nlosing health coverage. These provisions will provide greater security \nfor Americans currently covered under group health plans.\n  I've heard form Iowans who have had to pass up new job offers or \nforgo starting their own small business because they or someone in \ntheir family has a preexisting condition. Workers with a sick child are \nforced to pass up career opportunities because their new insurance may \nnot cover a preexisting condition for 6 months or more.\n  These families have played by the rules and have been continuously \ninsured--they deserve to know that if they pay their insurance premiums \nfor years, they cannot be denied coverage or be subjected to a new \nexclusion for a preexisting condition because they change jobs.\n  But, I do want to express my concern about some of the comments that \nare being made on both sides of the aisle about this bill.\n  In today's edition of the Washington Post, House Speaker Newt \nGingrich is quoted as saying ``it means guaranteed health insurance for \neveryone who's in the system.''\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important step forward, but it in no \nway means guaranteed health insurance for people now in the system. We \nshould not overpromise or oversell this bill. American workers still \nface the possibility that their employer will reduce their health \ninsurance or drop coverage altogether.\n  Workers still face the possibility that coverage for their children \nwill be dropped. In fact, the number of children covered by employment-\nbased\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\nhealth insurance has been decreasing and over 9 million children have \nno health insurance.\n  If you lose your job you still face the high costs of health \ninsurance--certainly many people who have just lost their job can't \nafford health insurance premiums. If you get sick, lose your job, and \ncan't afford health insurance premiums you are still out of luck under \nthis bill.\n  And, Mr. President, today if a worker switches jobs their next \nemployer may or may not offer health care coverage. The bill before us \ntoday does not change this situation. Companies can also continue to \neliminate health care coverage for retirees.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill does not guarantee health insurance. It \nis an important step forward and it should be passed.\n  We should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, but we also \nshouldn't lead Americans to believe it does more than it really does.\n  While there are many positive things in this bill that merit its \nenactment, Mr. President, there are several provisions that I believe \nwould substantially undermine our efforts to combat fraud, waste, and \nabuse in Medicare and other health programs. Our two lead agencies in \ncombating health care fraud and abuse, the Department of Justice and \nthe office of inspector general of the Department of Health and Human \nservices, have also raised serious concerns with different provisions \nin this conference report.\n  First, the conference agreement includes language from the House bill \nthat significantly raises the burden of proof on the Government to \nprove fraud and impose civil monetary penalties. Let me read from a \nletter that June Gibbs Brown, HHS inspector general wrote to me \nrecently about this provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the relevant portion of the letter be \nincluded at this point.\n\n            Letter from June Gibbs Brown, Inspector General\n\n                                               September 29, 1995.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re H.R. 2389: ``Safeguarding Medicare Integrity Act of 1995''\n       Dear Senator Harkin: You requested our views regarding the \n     newly introduced H.R. 2389, which we understand may be \n     considered in the deliberations concerning the ``Medicare \n     Preservation Act.'' We strongly support the expressed \n     objective of H.R. 2389 of reducing the fraud and abuse which \n     plagues the Medicare program. The proposed legislation \n     contains some meritorious provisions. However, if enacted, \n     certain major provisions of H.R. 2389 would cripple the \n     efforts of law enforcement agencies to control health care \n     fraud and abuse in the Medicare program and to bring \n     wrongdoers to justice.\n       The General Accounting Office estimates the loss to \n     Medicare from fraud and abuse at 10 percent of total Medicare \n     expenditures, or about $18 billion. We recommend two steps to \n     decrease this problem: strengthen the relevant legal \n     authorities, and increase the funding for law enforcement \n     efforts. Some worthy concepts have been included in H.R. \n     2389, and we support them. For example, we support:\n       ``a voluntary disclosure program, which allows corporations \n     to blow the whistle on themselves if upper management finds \n     wrongdoing has occurred, with carefully defined relief for \n     the corporation from qui tam suits under the False Claims Act \n     (but not waiver by the Secretary of sanctions);\n       ``minimum periods of exclusion (mostly parallel with \n     periods of exclusion currently in regulations) with respect \n     to existing exclusion authorities from Medicare and Medicaid; \n     and\n       ``increases in the maximum penalty amounts which may be \n     imposed under the civil monetary penalty laws regarding \n     health care fraud.''\n       As stated above, however, H.R. 2389 contains several \n     provisions which would seriously erode our ability to control \n     Medicare fraud and abuse, including most notably: making the \n     civil monetary penalty and anti-kickback laws considerably \n     more lenient, the unprecedented creation of an advisory \n     opinion mechanism on intent-based status, and a trust fund \n     concept which would fund only private contractors (not law \n     enforcement). Our specific comments on these matters follow.\n\n\n making civil monetary penalties for fraudulent claims more lenient by \n relieving providers of the duty to use reasonable diligence to ensure \n                   their claims are true and accurate\n\n       Background: The existing civil monetary penalty (CMP) \n     provisions regarding false claims were enacted by Congress in \n     the 1980's as an administrative remedy, with cases tried by \n     administrative law judges with appeals to Federal court. In \n     choosing the ``knows or should know'' standard for the mental \n     element of the offense, Congress chose a standard which is \n     well defined in the Restatement of Torts, Second, Section \n     12. The term ``should know'' places a duty on health care \n     providers to use ``reasonable diligence'' to ensure that \n     claims submitted to Medicare are true and accurate. The \n     reason this standard was chosen was that the Medicare \n     system is heavily reliant on the honesty and good faith of \n     providers in submitting their claims. The overwhelming \n     majority of claims are never audited or investigated.\n       Note that the ``should know'' standard does not impose \n     liability for honest mistakes. If the provider exercises \n     reasonable diligence and still makes a mistake, the provider \n     is not liable. No administrative complaint or decision issued \n     by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has \n     found an honest mistake to be the basis for CMP sanction.\n       H.R. 2389 Proposal: Section 201 would redefine the term \n     ``should know'' in a manner which does away with the duty on \n     providers to exercise reasonable diligence to submit true and \n     accurate claims. Under this definition, providers would only \n     be liable if they act with ``deliberate ignorance'' of false \n     claims or if they act with ``reckless disregard'' of false \n     claims. In an era when there is great concern about fraud and \n     abuse of the Medicare program, it would not be appropriate to \n     relieve providers of the duty to use ``reasonable diligence'' \n     to ensure that their claims are true and accurate.\n       In addition, the bill treats the CMP authority currently \n     provided to the Secretary in an inconsistent manner. On one \n     hand, it proposes an increase in the amounts of most CMPs \n     which may be imposed under the Social Security Act. Yet, it \n     would significantly curtail enforcement of these sanction \n     authorities by raising the level of culpability which must be \n     proven by the Government in order to impose CMPs. It would be \n     far preferable not to make any changes to the CMP statutes at \n     this time.\n\n\n    MAKING THE ANTI-KICKBACK STATUTE MORE LENIENT BY REQUIRING THE \n GOVERNMENT TO PROVE THAT ``THE SIGNIFICANT'' INTENT OF THE DEFENDANT \n                              WAS UNLAWFUL\n\n       Background: The anti-kickback statute makes it a criminal \n     offense knowingly and willfully (intentionally) to offer or \n     receive anything of value in exchange for the referral of \n     Medicare or Medicaid business. The statute is designed to \n     ensure that medical decisions are not influenced by financial \n     rewards from third parties. Kickbacks result in more Medicare \n     services being ordered than otherwise, and law enforcement \n     experts agree that unlawful kickbacks are very common and \n     constitute a serious problem in the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs.\n       The two biggest health care fraud cases in history were \n     largely based on unlawful kickbacks. In 1994, National \n     Medical Enterprises, a chain of psychiatric hospitals, paid \n     $379 million for giving kickbacks for patient referrals, and \n     other improprieties. In 1995, Caremark, Inc. paid $161 \n     million for giving kickbacks to physicians who ordered very \n     expensive Caremark home infusion products.\n       Most kickbacks have sophisticated disguises, like \n     consultation arrangements, returns on investments, etc. These \n     disguises are hard for the Government to penetrate. Proving a \n     kickback case is difficult. There is no record of trivial \n     cases being prosecuted under this statute.\n\n  Let me repeat, the IG says this provision will ``significantly \ncurtail enforcement of these sanctions.'' Mr. President, this provision \nhas no business in this conference report and flies in the face of the \nbill's section title ``Preventing Health Care Fraud and Abuse.''\n  Along with other exemptions provided in the bill, this change will \ncost taxpayers $200 million, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice [CBO].\n  The conference agreement also includes a provision from the House \nbill requiring the IG to provide advisory opinions to the public on the \nMedicare anti-kickback statute. The Attorney General and the HHS \nstrongly oppose this provision. In fact, the Attorney General in a June \n6, 1996 to then Majority Leader Dole and Speaker Gingrich said:\n\n       This is an unprecedented and unwise requirement that would \n     severely undermine our law enforcement efforts relating to \n     health care fraud. The HHS IG said in her letter to me that \n     similar provisions would ``severely hamper the Government's \n     ability to prosecute health care fraud.''\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       Even with appropriate written caveats, defense counsel will \n     hold up a stack of advisory opinions before the jury and \n     claim that the defendant read them and honestly believed \n     (however irrationally) that he or she was not violating the \n     law. The prosecution would have to disprove this defense \n     beyond a reasonable doubt. This will seriously affect the \n     likelihood of conviction of those offering kickbacks.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly support the concept of providing the public \nand health care providers guidance on complying with Medicare law. The \ngovernment does issue advisory opinions and other guidance and it \nshould be provided the resources to do more. But law enforcement should \nnot be forced to\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\nissue information that it feels will undermine compliance with anti-\nkickback laws.\n  The Attorney General and IG have said that these requirements are so \ndamaging to their ability to prosecute fraud because they would require \nlaw enforcement to issue opinions on intent based statutes. Because of \nthe inherently subjective nature of intent, they believe it would be \nimpossible for them to determine intent based solely upon a written \nsubmission from the requestor. They point out that it does not make \nsense for a requestor to ask the Government to determine the \nrequestor's own intent.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has scored this advisory opinion \nprovision as costing taxpayers $280 million over the next 7 years. They \nrecognize the obvious, that this provision will result in fewer \nsuccessful prosecutions of health care fraud.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of provisions in the conference \nagreement that would, taken alone, improve our fight against Medicare \nfraud, waste, and abuse--provisions I have long advocated. The bill \ncreates a mandatory source of funding for the IG, the FBI, and other \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  Their efforts return many times their costs in savings. In order to \nmake this change significant, though, we can't simply eliminate \nexisting discretionary funding for these activities in the \nappropriations bill.\n  The bill also requires some steps to be taken to encourage and assist \nMedicare beneficiaries in identifying and reporting fraud and abuse. \nSignificant additional steps are needed to assure that seniors really \nhave the tools they need to fully participate in this important effort.\n  So, Mr. President, this bill is a mixed bag. I will support it \nbecause it provides important new protections to working Americans and \ntax relief for farmers and the self-employed. However, I will actively \nwork to have the provisions which hamper our efforts to combat health \ncare fraud and abuse removed from the books.\n\n\n                        AID TO SMALL BUSINESSES\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a good day for hard-working \nAmericans and small business owners across the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts. The final passage of the Small Business Job Protection \nAct will stoke the engine of job growth in this country and will help \nfurther the current economic expansion.\n  Just 2 days ago, we learned that, in the second quarter of 1996, our \nnational economy posted a robust 4.2 percent growth rate. This buoyant \ngrowth figure is just the latest indication that the Clinton economic \nplan which the Congress passed in 1993 without one single Republican \nvote is benefiting hard-working Americans. We have unprecedented low \ninterest rates and subdued inflation and unemployment levels. In fact, \nthe Clinton plan has created more than 10 million jobs since its \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton plan reduced the deficit from a record-\nhigh $290 billion in 1992 to a projected $117 billion this year. That \nis a 60-percent reduction of the deficit in 4 years, Mr. President. But \nsome Members on the other side of the aisle seem to forget that deficit \nreduction is, in and of itself, not an economic policy. Cutting \nwasteful spending in order to keep interest rates low whole protecting \nprograms and services which stimulate growth and create jobs is an \neconomic policy. It is an economic plan. It is, in fact, the core of \nthe Clinton plan, and I am pleased to have helped shape this plan.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan \ntold me that our economy has not looked this sanguine in 3 years. But I \nreminded him during our Banking Committee hearing that all Americans \nhave not yet felt the benefits of the Clinton plan. Accordingly, I \nintroduced the American Family Income and Economic Security Act this \nyear. Several provisions of my 20-point plan will become law when the \nPresident signs the conference report before us.\n  One of these provisions is raising the minimum wage to $5.15 per \nhour, which I will address in a separate statement later this \nafternoon.\n  Two other provisions of my bill which are echoed in the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act are the extension of the credit for \nresearch and experimentation and the deduction for employer-provided \neducational assistance.\n  This bill will extend the R Tax Credit, sometimes called the \nResearch and Development Tax Credit, until May 1997. Mr. President, for \nyears, I have fought to make this credit permanent; it is one of the \nmost important tax provisions for our high-technology, high-wage, job-\ncrating industries, many of which are found in my home State. I am \ndisappointed this bill does not make the credit permanent or \nretroactive; however, I am pleased the Congress is once again \nacknowledging the significance of the credit.\n  The bill will also extend the exclusion, up to $5,250, for employer-\nprovided educational assistance through May 1997. This provision gives \nmany Americans an opportunity to further their education while working. \nIt allows them to upgrade their skills in order to survive and compete \nin the changing global economy.\n  These provisions are the logical complements to the Clinton economic \nplan. They will help more working Americans to enjoy the benefits of \nthe current robust economic growth. I will continue to fight for other \nprovisions of my American Family Income and Economic Security, like \nallowing more Americans to save for their retirement through IRA's, \nsafeguarding pension plans from corporate raiders, reducing capital \ngains tax rates for investors in targeted, high-technology industries, \nfurthering training programs and expanding stock option programs.\n  Mr. President, there is one last provision of the small business job \nprotection bill of which I am extremely proud. For almost 8 years, \nhard-working owners of fishing vessels in New Bedford, MA, have been \nsubject to an Internal Revenue Service ruling that would have resulted \nin approximately $11 million in penalties. This situation arose from an \nIRS misinterpretation of the Tax Code as applied to crewmembers on \nsmall fishing vessels. The IRS' interpretation and assessment nearly \ndevastated the fishing families in southeastern Massachusetts--a region \nstruggling with the departure of the textile industry and the demise of \nthe fishery. I am pleased that this bill includes a correction to this \nwrong-headed interpretation. This action is providing relief for four \nfishing vessels in New Bedford--F/V Edgartown, F/V Nordic Pride, F/V \nLady J, F/V Steel--by rendering moot a court action against them.\n  Life on the seas requires fishermen to be ruggedly independent \nindividuals. Fishing boat operations reflect this independence in that \nthey are fundamentally small business operations with crews that \ntypically vary from trip to trip, with each crewmember acting as a free \nagent. Recognizing that there was a unique worker arrangement on \nfishing vessels, Congress amended the Tax Code in 1976 to clarify the \nemployment status of crewmembers as self-employed and required the \nself-employed crewmembers to be compensated solely with a share of the \ncatch.\n  It is common practice on fishing boats around the country to provide \na small cash payment called a pers to the cook, first mate and engineer \nin recognition of additional duties they perform at sea. These pers \nrepresent only 1 to 5 percent of the total compensation which amounts \nto approximately $500 annually on a $30,000 income.\n  This bill will allow the pers payments--which are essentially \ncalculated as a share of the catch--without jeopardizing the self-\nemployment status of crewmembers. Let me emphasize, Mr. President, that \nthe boat owners believed they complied with the new tax laws and \nregulations, and in fact they did comply with the law as Congress \nintended it to be applied to small fishing vessels.\n  With my colleagues from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy and \nCongressman Frank, I tried to remedy this situation for 7 years. We \nappealed to the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service, \nand introduced legislation that was vetoed twice by President Bush. \nToday, I am pleased that this issue will be resolved as soon as \nPresident Clinton signs this bill.\n  Mr. President, this has been a long and difficult struggle to provide \nrelief for the fishing families of New Bedford. Like the hard-working \npeople of southeastern Massachusetts, small business owners and \nAmerican workers will enjoy the benefits of this bill. I am\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\npleased that the Senate will speak with a strong bipartisan voice to \nraise the minimum wage, to provide tax incentives for small businesses \nand, especially, to assist the families of New Bedford, MA.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   employer securities in erisa plans\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to address the full Senate \nand the distinguished chairman of our Finance Committee, Senator Roth. \nOn June 5, I suggested to the Finance Committee that it adopt a \nprovision that would permit subchapter S corporations to sponsor \nESOP's, or employee stock ownership plans.\n  When the precise language of my proposal was published as section \n1316 of H.R. 3448, I was disappointed to read that some of the special \ntax benefits that currently are available with respect to ESOP's would \nnot be available in the case of an ESOP that acquires and holds \nsubchapter S corporation stock.\n  I would like to note that the provision in the bill before us related \nto employer securities and sub S ERISA plans is not to take effect \nuntil January 1, 1998. Between now and then, I will review how we can \nmake it possible for subchapter S corporations to avail themselves of \nthe special ESOP tax benefits, which will encourage greater use of this \nprovision.\n  After this review, I hope to be able to offer reasonable alterations \nto H.R. 3448 that will expand our policy of promoting employee \nownership through ESOPs.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom Louisiana and look forward to reviewing any thinking he may have \nfor future legislation on this matter.\n\n\n                discrimination under new irs section 936\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am very concerned about regulations that \nwere just issued by the IRS in May regarding the section 936 possession \ntax credit. These new regulations cast aside regulatory rules upon \nwhich companies have relied for many years permitting arm's length \npricing in the purchase of components. The new regulations produce the \ndiscriminatory result that an arm's length third-party price can be \nused to value outbound sales of components but not inbound purchases of \ncomponents by the possession company for purposes of the section 936 \ncalculation. I believe that a fair and workable solution can be \ndeveloped to address these concerns and would ask the Senator to join \nme in encouraging the Treasury Department to seek such a solution.\n  Mr. ROTH. I believe this is an area that Treasury and the IRS need to \nrevisit. I join the Senator from Minnesota in encouraging them to do \nso.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to describe why the repeal of \nInternal Revenue Code section 956A, which is included in the Small \nBusiness Tax Relief bill, is important to both U.S. businesses and \nAmerican workers.\n  In his remarks 2 days ago, the distinguished senator from North \nDakota insisted on referring to the repeal of 956A as opening a tax \nloophole. This is simply not true. Rather, what the repeal does is \nloosen a noose that has been strangling the competitiveness of many of \nour U.S. businesses.\n  How many of my colleagues would stand up and say, ``Yes, I would like \nto hamper the competitiveness of U.S. businesses abroad by imposing tax \nrestrictions on them unequal to any restriction imposed on their \ncompetitors.'' Or, how many of my colleagues would say that they are in \nfavor of discouraging U.S. firms from increasing employment at home by \ntaking advantage of business opportunities abroad. Yet, in essence, \nthis is the effect of not repealing section 956A.\n  I don't believe there is even one Senator in this Chamber who wants \nto go home in August and brag about putting U.S. companies at a \ncompetitive disadvantage. I don't believe there is even one Senator who \nwants to go home and brag about eliminating jobs for U.S. workers. Yet, \nthis is exactly what section 956A does.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly discuss the history of section 956A. \nUntil 1993, when President Clinton signed the largest tax increase in \nthe history of this Nation, the U.S. generally did not tax the active \nincome earned by a U.S. corporation's foreign subsidiaries until that \nincome was actually repatriated to the U.S. parent. This tax deferral \nenabled U.S. companies with foreign affiliates to compete on a \nreasonably level playing field with foreign competitors. This is \nbecause no other industrial nation's tax law forces a parent \ncorporation to pay taxes on income earned by a subsidiary until that \nmoney is sent home to the parent.\n  However, in 1993, the Clinton administration proposed and Congress \nenacted a limitation on this tax deferral. The provision, now known as \nsection 956A, forces the parent corporation to pay tax on a portion of \nits foreign subsidiary corporation's active income to the extent it has \nan excessive accumulation of passive assets.\n  Mr. President, this new restriction did not close a tax loophole. \nInstead, 956A closed doors of opportunity for U.S. business and \nhindered employment and investment growth. As I mentioned, section 956A \nhas no counterpart in the tax laws of our foreign competitors. Hence, \nit effectively places an undue burden on U.S.-owned companies abroad--a \nburden that our competitors do not have.\n  There are some who want us to believe that the enactment of section \n956A would discourage U.S. companies from moving jobs overseas. Mr. \nPresident, this is just not true. In fact, the provision has resulted \nin just the opposite effect--it encourages U.S. companies to employ \nmore overseas workers.\n  Let me explain. As I stated before, section 956A subjects excessive \npassive assets to U.S. tax before profits are repatriated to the United \nStates. This provision has actually created an unintended incentive for \ncompanies to invest in hard assets, such as manufacturing facilities, \noutside the United States. Doing so enables the subsidiary to increase \nits hard assets and thus lower the ratio of it passive assets to total \nassets, which effectively lowers the tax. Manufacturing facilities, \nunlike passive assets, require workers, almost always hired from the \nhost nation. Thus, the perverse effect of section 956A is to provide an \nincentive for U.S. multinational companies to invest in jobs overseas \nfor non-U.S. workers.\n  Contrary to what some contend, U.S. companies generally do not invest \nabroad simply to take advantage of lower labor costs. In fact, most \nforeign investments by U.S. companies are in countries where labor \ncosts are often higher than in the United States. In 1993, two-thirds \nof the assets and sales of U.S.-controlled foreign corporations were in \nseven primary locations: Germany, France, Japan, United Kingdom, \nNetherlands, Canada, and Switzerland. The average annual compensation \npaid to foreign workers in these countries was 15 percent higher than \nthe average paid to workers in the United States by the parent \ncorporations.\n  U.S. foreign businesses are almost always established in order to \nbetter service foreign customers, to have a local presence, to avoid \nexcessive transportation costs, or to develop natural resources in the \ngeographic locations where they are found. In other words, decisions of \nwhere to invest are made for solid business reasons--not for tax \navoidance. Many foreign countries insist that contracts be made only \nwith local entities.\n  It is also important to note that these U.S. subsidiary corporations \nseldom take jobs away from the United States, but actually supplement \ndomestic production and increase U.S. jobs. U.S.-owned foreign \ncorporations are large purchasers of exports from their affiliated \ncompanies in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of \nCommerce, 40 percent of U.S. multinational corporations' exports are \nsold to U.S. affiliates overseas.\n  For every one billion U.S. dollars in manufactured exports, over \n14,000 manufacturing jobs are created in the United States. Employment \ngrowth between 1987 and 1992 at U.S. plants that started or continued \nexporting during that time was 17 to 18 percent greater than at \ncomparable plants that did not export.\n  These statistics clearly indicate that expanding U.S. business \noverseas increases growth back home, including employment growth. We \ncannot ignore the global economy we are living in by discouraging U.S. \ncompanies from expanding to other countries.\n  Repeal of section 956A doesn't benefit just a handful of large \ncorporations, as has been suggested. Small businesses must invest \noverseas also. In today's\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\nworld, any business that doesn't recognize the necessity to go global \nis in jeopardy of losing out to foreign competition. In fact, many \nsmall Utah businesses are having great success in exporting and are \nfinding a need to invest outside the U.S. to establish a global \npresence. Does this mean we are losing jobs in Utah? Hardly. Rather, \nsuch international growth has further fueled my State's employment \nboom.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me emphasize that repealing 956A will \ngive no special treatment to U.S. businesses with foreign affiliates. \nIn fact, the tax treatment of U.S. businesses after the repeal of 956A \nwill be the same as the tax treatment received by a U.S. individual who \nholds shares in a company and defers U.S. tax on the earnings of the \ncompany until the company actually pays the dividend to the \nshareholder.\n  Until 1993, our tax law has always taxed the active profits of \nAmerican-owned companies abroad when those earnings were sent to the \nU.S. company through dividend, transfer payment, or other means. Let me \nreiterate that repeal of section 956A does not change this basic \nconcept of the Internal Revenue Code. Rather, it restores the \ntraditional treatment that was changed by the misguided 1993 provision.\n  I am proud to say that I stand for creating employment for American \nworkers. I stand for increasing our exports and developing foreign \nmarkets, and I stand for repealing section 956A to remove the \nstrangling provisions it places on U.S. businesses trying to compete on \na level playing ground with foreign competitors.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Small \nBusiness Job Protection Act, particularly its minimum wage provisions. \nI would like to commend Chairman Roth and members of the Finance \nCommittee who worked in a bipartisan fashion to put together a very \ncomprehensive bill that helps small businesses invest, grow and create \nnew jobs.\n  I am particularly proud to have succeeded in including a large number \nof provisions in the Small Business Job Protection Act that I, along \nwith my colleagues, worked very hard to place in the bill and retain in \nconference. These provisions will help to change peoples lives by \ncreating pension equity, providing educational assistance, preventing \njob loss, moving people from welfare to work, encouraging research and \ndevelopment and giving assistance to first-time farmers.\n  One of my primary focuses during this Congress has been to identify \nand resolve the current pension laws that are and have been inequitable \ntoward women throughout history. As a result of this effort, earlier \nthis year, I introduced the ``Women's Pension Equity Act of 1996.'' \nThis bill begins to assist millions of women retain pension benefits \nearned during many years of marriage. Today, I want to thank Chairman \nRoth for including in this small business tax legislation two of the \nmost important provisions from my women's pension bill, provisions \nwhich received broad bipartisan support. One requires the Department of \nTreasury to create model language for spousal consent with respect to \nsurvivor annuities for widows. The second requires the Department of \nTreasury to create model language for Qualified Domestic Relations \nOrder forms used to divide pensions during divorce.\n  Pension retention--issues associated with holding onto earned pension \nrights--are important safeguards against ``retirement surprise.'' \nPensions are often the most valuable financial asset a couple owns--\nearned together during their many years of marriage. Unfortunately, it \nis now all too easy for a woman to unknowingly compromise her right to \na share of her spouse's pension benefits in case of widowhood or \ndivorce. If she reads ``lifetime annuity'' to mean her lifetime and \nsigns the forms waiving survivor benefits, she loses her pension if her \nspouse dies. In case of divorce, if both spouses do not sign a complete \nQDRO form, she loses her right to any pension benefits, even if the \nmarriage lasted fifty years. The provisions adopted in this bill will \nmake it more likely that women will be able to protect their rights and \nretain their pensions.\n  Additionally, I am an original cosponsor of the Spousal IRA Equity \nlegislation. This provision will allow a deductible IRA contribution of \nup to $2,000 per year to be made by each spouse including homemakers. \nCurrently, a spouse who works outside the home is allowed to make tax-\nfree contributions to an Individual Retirement Account up to $2,000 \nannually. However, the spouse that works in the home is only allowed to \ncontribute $250 annually. This Congress has agreed for the first time \nto right this wrong and provide fairness for women who work both \noutside of and in the home.\n  I regret the deletion by the conference committee of safeguards \nagainst the taxation of non-physical compensatory damages. That \nprovision is inequitable because it makes a distinction between \nphysical and non-physical compensatory damages. Under this bill, \nvictims of sex discrimination, race discrimination, and emotional \ndistress would be required to pay taxes on any damages they receive \nwhile, on the other hand, victims of battery will not be taxed. Not \nonly is this provision bad tax policy but it is discriminatory, and \nwill make it more difficult for victims of these crimes to achieve \njustice. I hope the Congress will revisit this issue and correct this \ninjustice.\n  Despite my displeasure with this particular provision, this is a good \nbill. The bill increases investment by small businesses and creates \nincentives for businesses to move people from welfare to work. It \ncreates a new tax credit, called the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which \nreplaces the old targeted jobs tax credit program. The Work Opportunity \nTax Credit encourages employers to hire people from populations \nsuffering from high unemployment, who are on government assistance or \nwho have limited education. I am just delighted that the conference \nbill includes a provision I authored, along with my Colleagues Senators \nBaucus and Hatch, that will help expand the pool of eligible employees \nby adding a category for indigent 18- 24-year-olds. Adding this \ncategory encourages employers to hire young people who are all too \noften overlooked, promotes self-sufficiency and prevents our young \npeople from returning to the welfare system. The Work Opportunity Tax \nCredit will enable employers to access the credit after an employee has \nworked 400 hours, thereby providing additional incentives for job \ntraining.\n  Job training and educational assistance by employers is essential to \ncreate a strong work force. That is why I am so pleased that I was able \nto work with Senators Roth and Moynihan to enable employers to provide \neducational assistance to their employees without including the costs \nassociated with such assistance in their gross income. This exclusion \nended December 31, 1994 and is retroactively reinstated in this bill. \nHowever, the program only applies to undergraduate study until January \n1, 1998 and it troubles me that the House would not agree to extend the \nbenefit to employees who are in graduate school past June 1996. \nEmployer-provided educational assistance on a graduate level helps our \nnational competitiveness, and I hope that we will revisit the \nlimitations of this bill.\n  The investments we make today in education and research will \ndetermine our global competitiveness in the future. That is why I am \nhappy that this bill extends the Research and Experiment Tax Credit \nthrough May 31, 1997 however, I believe it should have been \nretroactively reinstated in this bill and hope that it will be made \npermanent in the future. If government does not encourage research and \ndevelopment, it will have a negative impact on our international \ncompetitiveness and our national security. The R & E tax credit has \ndemonstrated its efficacy, and it should be continued with sufficient \ncertainty to encourage long term planning and investment in this area.\n  A tax credit for nonconventional fuels is yet another investment that \nwill help develop new sources of coal and methods to recycle biomass \nthat will increase our technological advancement. The section 29 tax \ncredit is important for recovering and managing landfill gas such as \nmethane. In so doing, it helps to improve the quality of life around \nlandfills, reduce smog, and alleviate global warming. With this tax \ncredit, landfill gas has become a practical fuel for use in \nconventional electrical generating equipment. However, the extension of \nthe credit will be less effective as it relates to coal because an \nadditional year is needed to\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\nget plants up and running given the complexity in converting coal into \nsynthetic fuels. I hope we will revisit the effective date of the \n``placed in service'' deadline.\n\n  The effective date was changed in the conference agreement for the \nrepeal of the fifty percent interest income exclusion for financial \ninstitution loans to Employee Stock Ownership Plans [ESOPs]. In the \noriginal legislation, the House wanted to retroactively repeal the \nfifty percent interest income exclusion for ESOPs using October 13, \n1995 as the effective date. As you may assume, that early effective \ndate would have a devastating impact on companies that had reasonably \nrelied upon the current laws and acted to establish an employee stock \nownership plan. I am quite pleased that the conference agreement \nincluded today as an effective date. Although I am pleased that today \nwill be the effective date for repealing this provision, I wish that we \ndid not have to repeal the fifty percent interest income exclusion for \nEmployee Stock Ownership Plans at all because they are good for \nbusiness and good for employees. When an employee owns part of the \ncompany, their investment is greater, their work product is better and \ntheir loyalty will last longer, this bill only makes it harder for this \nto occur.\n  Not only does this bill help small businesses but it also helps \nfirst- time farm buyers. As a cosponsor of the Aggie Bond bill, I am \nthrilled that it is included in this conference agreement. Provisions \nof the aggie bond legislation helps to insure Illinois farmers and \nfarmers all over the nation are given assistance in maximizing their \nparticipation in the first-time farm buyer program. This provision \nallows the purchase of farms from related parties and increases the \nmaximum-size requirements for first-time farmer industrial development \nbonds.\n  Not only does this bill help farmers and small businesses but it also \nhelps low wage workers with an increase in the minimum wage. Raising \nthe minimum wage is about allowing people to realize the American \nDream. It is about valuing hard work and providing people with the \nopportunity to provide for their families.\n  For the millions of American's who support themselves and their \nfamilies on $4.25 an hour, the current minimum wage is not enough to \nraise them out of poverty. The ninety cent increase we are voting for \ntoday will make a difference to the ten million Americans that earn the \nminimum wage.\n  In Illinois, over 10 percent of the workforce, or 545,647 people, \nearns the minimum wage. The majority of the people earning the minimum \nwage--two-thirds--are adults, many are parents. Working 40 hours a \nweek, 52 weeks a year, a person earning the minimum wage currently \nearns only $8,840. The poverty rate for a family of four is $15,600.\n  In light of our recent vote on ending the welfare safety net for \nchildren, I would like to point out that close to 60 percent of those \nearning minimum wage are women. These are women who are taking \nresponsibility for themselves and their children. They go to work every \nsingle day, and still the minimum wage does not provide them with a \nliving wage on which to raise their families. This increase in the \nminimum wage will make a difference to these women.\n  Increasing the minimum wage by 90 cents over the next year is the \nright thing to do. It has been almost five years since the minimum wage \nwas last increased. As I'm sure anybody who has gone to the grocery \nstore or the doctor's office lately can tell you, in the last five \nyears prices have increased, but wages have stayed the same. The report \non our economy issued yesterday confirms this fact: wage growth was at \n0.08 percent, while our economy grew at an annual rate of 4.2 percent.\n  Increasing the minimum wage will raise wages, not lose jobs. Last \nyear a group of respected economists, including three Nobel prize \nwinners, concluded that an increase in the minimum wage to $5.15 an \nhour will have positive effects on the labor market, workers, and the \neconomy. Paying a living wage does not mean that jobs will be lost.\n  Workers are our greatest resource. We should recognize the \ncontributions of our workers. Our country is founded on the belief that \nhard work is the foundation of success--this is the American Dream. \nCongress should encourage, not discourage, effort and perseverance. A \nminimum wage should provide a living wage for those who are working day \nin and day out to provide for themselves and their families. Family \nvalues and the American Dream are ideas we like to talk about, but \ntoday we can actually make them more real for millions of Americans.\n  Although it is not perfect, this is a good bill. Women, children, and \nworking people will all benefit, and it will help promote job-creation, \nand economic growth. I want to commend my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee, particularly Chairman Roth and the ranking Democratic \nmember, Senator Moynihan, who have worked hard to produce a bipartisan \nbill that promotes growth and stability among small businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting the final passage \nof what is generally a common sense, people oriented, bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport on H.R. 3448.\n  This title of this bill is supposed to be the ``Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996''.\n  Title I, the tax title, is consistent with that spirit. It would make \nthe Tax Code a little fairer, improve economic and employment \nopportunities, and provide some necessary tax relief.\n  But the problem remains that, in passing this bill as a whole, we \nwould be driving the economy with one foot on the gas and the other on \nthe brake.\n  The Senate had the chance to tip this bill in favor of creating more \nand better jobs and providing necessary relief for small businesses. \nUnfortunately, on a close vote, this body defeated the amendment \noffered by the Chairman of the Small Business Committee, the Senator \nfrom Missouri [Mr. Bond]. That amendment would have protected small, \nvulnerable employers from a one-size-fits-all mandate increasing the \nfederal minimum wage.\n  The Democrat Party had two years, during which it controlled the \nWhite House and the Congress, to increase the minimum wage. They never \nmoved a bill out of committee. They never offered an amendment on the \nfloor. They waited until this year to strike. I just have to suspect \nthere were some political motivations involved, and some crocodile \ntears shed over the workers they say they want to help.\n  I commend those who have labored long and hard to take a legislative \nlemon and turn it into lemonade. I am sorry I cannot, in good \nconscience, vote for the resulting bill.\n  All too often, Congresses and Presidents have taken a perceived \nproblem, put it under a microscope, and tried to address it with a one-\nsize-fits-all federal mandate. The result often has been government by \nanecdote. Unintended consequences and innocent bystanders have not \nalways been taken into account in the rush to adopt a ``feel-good'' \nsolution.\n  That risk of unintended consequences is definitely present in the \nbill before us today.\n  We feel for those Americans who are working hard at making ends meet. \nIt is easy and it is tempting to look at a $4.25 an hour minimum wage \nand say, let's just mandate an increase in that wage. But that is the \nwrong answer. That approach will hurt the very persons it is meant to \nhelp--the working poor and entry-level employees.\n  Common sense, the laws of economics, and experience all tell us this. \nWe've all heard the numbers. The commonly accepted figure is that a \nstand-alone increase in the minimum wage from $4.25 an hour to $5.15--a \n21 percent increase--would result in the loss of at least 621,000 jobs. \nIn Idaho, it would destroy 3,200 jobs.\n  I don't know how many of those jobs might be saved with the tax \nprovisions in this bill, but it's obvious that many small employers \nwill fall through the cracks. These are the businesses who will have \nlittle or no opportunity to use the tax relief provisions elsewhere in \nthis bill.\n  These are employers who have taken pride in creating jobs and \nopportunities for those who need them, and who take pride in serving \ntheir customers at affordable prices.\n  I've heard from many small businesses in Idaho who are concerned \nabout this bill. They are already calculating whether they will have to \nlay\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\noff employees because of this bill. Restaurants are already having new \nmenus printed up with higher prices. Jobs will not be available for \nyoung and entry-level workers, because some employers simply will no \nlonger be able to afford them when the government arbitrarily raises \nthe price of their labor.\n  Some have suggested that the economic impact of such an increase is \n``negligible.'' But it's not negligible for each American who loses his \nor her job as a result. In many cases, the job lost would be the most \nimportant one that person will ever have--his or her first job.\n  In recent years, small businesses have created every net new job in \nthis country. They take the risks of hiring and training new workers. \nThey do not have the economies of scale of large businesses and suffer \na disproportionate impact from government regulation. They tend to be \nlabor-intensive. If you drive up the costs of their labor, they will be \nforced to create fewer jobs.\n  In fact, 77 percent of the economists who responded to a survey of \nthe American Economics Association agreed that, by itself, a higher \nmandated minimum wage would have a negative impact on employment.\n  Obviously, that negative impact is going to fall on workers at or \nnear the minimum wage, and especially those who are the least-skilled \nand need an entry-level job the most.\n  Realistically, the federal minimum wage today already is a training \nwage. The average minimum wage worker is earning $6.06 an hour after \none year.\n  In most work places, at every level of compensation, it is common for \na new employee to be paid more after a few months. That is because \nthere is almost always a learning curve, during which the employer is \ninvesting time, energy, and money in training and acclimating the new \nemployee. The opportunity wage in this amendment simply reflects that \nreality of labor economics.\n  Mr. President, I do want to emphasize that I support the tax title of \nthis bill. I particularly want to express my support and appreciation \nfor several of these provisions, including:\n  The Shelby-Craig adoption tax credit; enactment of this credit is \ncompassionate, pro-family, pro-children, and long overdue; increasing \nthe availability of Individual Retirement Accounts for spouses working \nin the home as homemakers; revising and extending the Work Opportunity \nTax Credit, which will help employers hire and retain disadvantaged \nemployees; restoring and extending the tax exclusion for employer-\nprovided educational assistance; making S corporation rules more \nflexible; providing fairer treatment for dues paid to agricultural or \nhorticultural organizations; improving depreciation and expensing rules \nfor small businesses.\n  I also commend the conferees for accepting the House's provision \nrestoring and making permanent the exclusion from FUTA--the Federal \nUnemployment Tax--for labor performed by a temporary, legal, immigrant \nagricultural worker. Such employees are ineligible for FUTA benefits \nthat are financed by this tax. Therefore, this tax is imposed on \nemployers for no reason, except that the previous exclusion simply \nexpired.\n  I have supported these provisions consistently in the past and \ncommend the Finance Committee for including them in this bill.\n  I do want to express one note of concern. This bill would extend the \nResearch and Experimentation Tax Credit, but with an early sunset--May \n31, 1997--and without making it available for investments made after it \nlast expired and before July 1, 1996.\n  The R and E Credit is one of those ``extenders'' that keep expiring \nand keep getting renewed. As a matter of fairness, most, if not all, of \nthese extenders simply should be made permanent, or at least extended \nfor a longer period of time. Several times in the past, these \nprovisions have been renewed retroactively, but that is not the case of \nthe R and E Credit this year.\n  This stop-and-start approach to tax law undoes much of the good \nintended by these tax incentive provisions. We need to provide \ntaxpayers with greater predictability in the Tax Code if we want to be \neffective in helping them invest and create jobs.\n  Overall, the tax title provisions in this bill are valuable and \nbeneficial. I commend the Chairman and Members of the Finance Committee \nfor their work.\n  We should be passing laws that boost the economy, increase \nopportunity and create jobs. We can and should do better than passing a \nbill that gives with one hand and takes away with the other. Therefore, \nalthough there are good provisions in this bill, I must cast a nay vote \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9541-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9548-S9549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   THE PRESIDENT'S ``TRAVELGATE'' 180\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday's display by the President of \nthe United States, snapping at reporters' questions about the Billy \nDale bill, says a lot to me.\n  First, it tells me the President has once again gone back on his \nword. This is not a surprise. It has happened so often with this \nPresident. And to be fair to him, he is certainly not the first \npolitician that has gone back on his word, from either party.\n  Yet, this President has championed the little guy. He came to town \ndeclaring war against all the wrongs resulting from the Washington \npolitical culture. Then, his own White House committed such a wrong.\n  Initially, the President did the right thing. He said his staff had \nmade a mistake. They had handled the matter wrong. Their display of \ncronyism and favoritism was at the expense of the careers and \nreputations of seven dedicated public servants and their families.\n  All the while, the President's staff was waging war against the \ncharacter of these seven. It's also known as character assassination. \nAfter that, the White House launched the IRS and the FBI to harass \nthem, as if to justify the staff's wrongdoing.\n  Then, they sent the Justice Department out to prosecute them. They \nhad the full force of the Federal Government out after these seven \npublic servants and their families.\n  The case went to trial. And it took no time at all for a jury to \nacquit Billy Dale. That is how trumped up the charges were. A jury had \nno problem seeing that.\n  Clearly, the White House drove Mr. Dale and the others right out of \ntown with no justification. It was pure, naked politics, cronyism and \nfavoritism. And when a White House uses the powers and resources of the \nNation's No. 1 law enforcement agency, the Nation's tax collecting \nagency--which also happens to be the No. 1 harassment agency--and the \nNation's No. 1 prosecution department, against innocent workers and \ntheir families, try telling the public that's not grotesquely wrong.\n  And that is why Congress moved to reimburse Mr. Dale and the others \nfor their legal expenses.\n  Even the President, after the acquittal, said he regretted what Mr. \nDale had to go through. But the President has now decided that the \nright move is to reverse himself and defend what his staff did to these \nseven families. He defends zealous White House staffers using the full \npowers and resources of the Federal Government to harass innocent \npeople. He lines up on the side of politics, cronyism and favoritism. \nHe fails to right a wrong that was perpetrated by the Washington \nculture of politics.\n  The President did another reversal as well. After the acquittal, the \nPresident's personal attorney, Robert Bennett, issued an inappropriate \nand sour-grapes response. Mr. Bennett improperly discussed in public a \nconfidential matter involving a plea agreement he alleged Billy Dale's \nattorney offered. Billy Dale denies the allegation.\n  Upon Mr. Bennett discussing confidential information, the White House \nrightly said Mr. Bennett had stepped over the line. His comments were \nobjectionable and improper. The reason is, plea negotiations are \nconfidential. Rules exist to protect that confidentiality. Mr. Bennett \nmay have violated the intent of those rules. And so the White House \nadmonished him.\n  It turns out, Mr. President, that the plea agreement issue came up \nagain yesterday. In public. Notwithstanding the rules of \nconfidentiality.\n  But this time, the White House didn't issue a statement of \nadmonishment.\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nThat's because it was discussed by none other than the President \nhimself. The President of the United States is discussing confidential \ninformation in the public arena. And in the process, he's doing exactly \nthe same thing that his office had admonished the President's attorney \nfor doing earlier this year.\n  So here is what we have learned from the President's skirmish \nyesterday with reporters. First, he has now done a U-turn and allowed \nhimself to get caught up in the mean-spirited attitude of his zealous \npolitical staff. Second, he has allowed himself to stoop to the level \nof the leakers and character assassins by discussing confidential \ninformation. Is this behavior befitting of what is expected of the \nPresident of the United States?\n  At the same time, the President has not kept his eye on the central \nissue--the clear need to right the wrong perpetrated by zealous White \nHouse agents.\n  Mr. President, this Travelgate issue is marked by a curious but \ntelling phenomenon. At the beginning, the President was saying one \nthing, but the government he runs was doing the opposite. Obviously, we \ndon't want or expect this in a Presidency. You want the President to \nsay one thing, and have those in his control do that one thing, too. \nYou want uniformity. You want the ``saying'' and the ``doing'' to be \none and the same.\n  But there is another variable in the equation. In the Travelgate \nmatter, the President's words reflected the right thing, and his \nstaff's deeds reflected the wrong thing. So the President, in seeking \nuniformity, made the wrong choice. Instead of making his administration \nconform to his admirable utterances, he went native with the wrong \nside. That is why he is now attacking Billy Dale like his attorney did; \nand that is why he has suddenly decided he will not sign the bill.\n  Mr. President, this episode shows that the President has failed to \nuphold the principle of justice, fairness, and right vs. wrong in this \nmatter. The test of any leader is to view his actions on matters that \nhappen in his own back yard, or which affect him personally. [This is \none such matter.] And to me, the President has failed that test of \nleadership.\n  By not doing the right thing--and in fact, by now joining the wrong \nside in the campaign to assassinate one's character--he has undercut \nhis own moral authority as a leader. He has abdicated his \nresponsibility to see that justice was done for seven of his own former \nemployees and their families. He has abandoned his commitment to stand \nup for the little guy. In a sense--it is okay to stand up for all these \nhigh and mighty principles--jut not in my back yard.\n  And that is why, Mr. President, the President's about face in the \nBilly Dale matter is disappointing to me. And it tells me much about \nhis leadership capacity.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9548-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO REAR ADM. ROBERT J. NATTER, U.S. NAVY CHIEF OF LEGISLATIVE \n                                AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Naval officer and dear friend, Rear Adm. \nRobert J. Natter, who has served with distinction for the past 33 \nmonths as the Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs. It is a privilege \nfor me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and commend him \nfor the superb service he has provided this legislative body, the Navy \nand our great Nation.\n  A native of Trussville, AL, Admiral Natter comes from a patriotic \nfamily of seven boys and two girls that has contributed immeasurably to \nour Nation's defense. All seven boys have served as commissioned \nofficers in our Armed Forces--six in the Navy and one in the Air Force. \nFour graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, one was commissioned \nthrough Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps, and one attended Officer \nCandidate School. Two are currently Navy admirals. I salute this family \nwho has served our Nation so well.\n  Admiral Natter enlisted in the Naval Reserve at the age of 17 as a \nseaman recruit. Following 1 year of enlisted service and 4 years at the \nNaval Academy, he was graduated and commissioned an Ensign in June \n1967.\n  Admiral Natter's service at sea includes department head tours in a \nCoastal Minesweeper and Frigate, and Executive Officer tours in two \nAmphibious Tank Landing Ships and a Spruance Destroyer. He \ndistinguished himself in combat as Officer-in-Charge of a Naval Special \nWarfare detachment in Vietnam. He later commanded the guided missile \ndestroyer U.S.S. Chandler and guided missile cruiser U.S.S. Antietam. \nHe has been the recipient of many awards and commendations including \nthe Silver Star and Purple Heart.\n  As the Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs, Admiral Natter has \nprovided timely support and accurate information on Navy plans and \nprograms. Working closely with the United States Congress, he helped \nmaintain the best-trained, best-equipped, and best prepared Navy in the \nworld. His strong leadership provided a legacy of innovative, \naffordable and technologically superior naval systems and platforms for \nthose who will serve in the Navy decades after he steps down as the \nChief of Legislative Affairs. His consummate leadership, integrity, and \ntireless energy serve as an example for us all.\n  Mr. President, Bob Natter, his wife Claudia, and daughters Kelly, \nKendall, and Courtney have made many sacrifices during his 30-year \nnaval career. They have made significant contributions to the \noutstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. \nAdmiral Natter is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so \nproudly serves. As this highly decorated combat veteran now departs to \ntake command of the United States Seventh Fleet, I call upon my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to wish him fair winds and \nfollowing seas. He is a sailor's sailor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9549-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9549-S9550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN WAYNE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, John Wayne, ``The Duke''. The mere name \nevokes in people around the world powerful images and fond \nrecollections of the late actor and great American. Though he has been \ngone for 17 years, his spirit clearly lives on through his many movies \nand in the minds of his millions of fans. On August 17th, hundreds of \npeople who admire this great man will gather in Los Angeles, CA to pay \ntribute to an individual who is a legend and an institution.\n  Americans are a tough lot. We are a nation that was founded by men \nand women of great courage, strength, and morals. It took tough and \ndetermined people to win our independence from the British; to fight \nfor the cause of the Confederacy or the Union; to tame the wild west; \nto twice lead the world to victory in two vicious global wars; and, to \nhave led the fight against forces bent on subjugating the freedom \nloving people of the world under the corrupt doctrine of godless \nCommunists. Americans are individuals who admire self-reliance, \nhonesty, and fairness, and without question, John Wayne was someone who \npersonified these traits as a man, and who brought these qualities to \nthe silver screen through his prolific career as an actor, director, \nand producer.\n  In countless movies, John Wayne portrayed mythic figures of American \nlore. Characters that included cowboys, lawmen, soldiers, sailors, and \nmarines in films such as ``Stagecoach,'' ``The Sands of Iwo Jima,'' \n``The Fighting Seabees,'' ``The Shootist,'' ``The Green Berets,'' \n``True Grit,'' and dozens of other titles that soon became classics. It \nwas impossible not to admire John Wayne and the roles he played for \nthey all embodied the ideals that Americans hold dear. Moviegoers knew \nthat if ``The Duke'' took a swing at someone, they deserved it, or if \nJohn Wayne fired a weapon, it was only to protect the life of an \ninnocent person, to uphold the law, or to help defend the Nation. The \ncharacters John Wayne played were decent men committed to doing what is \nhonorable and just, and for those reasons, he will be remembered as a \nAmerican icon for many generations to come.\n  Mr. President, the United States is a nation that is made up of men \nand women who labor tirelessly to make our county a better place. Few \npeople think about the police officers and firefighters who put their \nlives on the line, or the tens of thousands of service members spread \naround the world protecting American security, or the\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\nnurses who tend to our sick. Day in and day out, these people carry out \nheroic acts with little or no recognition. John Wayne portrayed these \npeople in his films, and they saw their efforts chronicled and, in The \nDuke, these Americans saw a little bit of themselves. There will \nprobably never again be another actor who so embodies all the best \nqualities of our Nation. There will certainly never be another John \nWayne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9549-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GARRETT D. BOURNE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Colonel \nGarrett ``Gary'' D. Bourne, as he prepares to retire from his career as \nan officer and a soldier in the United States Army.\n  Gary Bourne began his career more than 28 years ago when he was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery, and spending \nhis first tour of duty with the 82d Airborne Division. Throughout his \ncareer, Gary Bourne has expertly met the many challenges of military \nservice as an Army officer, and he has faithfully served his Nation in \na variety of command and staff assignments throughout the world \nincluding the continental United States, Vietnam, Europe, Southwest \nAsia, and Panama.\n  If there is one thing an officer in the Army wants to do, it is to \ncommand troops, and Gary Bourne has done so at the battery and \nbattalion levels. He ultimately held the much coveted position of \nBrigade Commander when he was tapped to lead the 210th Field Artillery \nBrigade. During his time with the 210th, the United States faced down \nSaddam Hussien, and Colonel Bourne was responsible for leading his \nbrigade from Germany to Southwest Asia where his unit served as the \ncovering force artillery commander for the VII Corps during Operation \nDesert Storm.\n  From 1987-1990, Colonel Bourne traded in his Battle Dress Uniform for \na suit and tie and joined the Army Legislative Liaison Office to the \nU.S. Senate. During those three years many of us came to know this \ndedicated officer who tirelessly worked to represent the interests of \nthe Army to members of this Chamber, as well as to assist us with \nmatters related to the Army.\n  After an almost three decade career in the Army, Colonel Bourne will \nsoon leave his present post as Chief of Staff of the Fifth United \nStates Army and bring his service to the Nation to an end. The \nColonel's career has been distinguished, and it has been marked by his \ncommitment to duty and selflessness. I commend Colonel Bourne on his \ncareer of accomplishment and wish him and his wife good health and \ngreat happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9550-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FDA PERFORMANCE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have accomplished many things this \nCongress. Just this week we passed a comprehensive welfare reform \nproposal which will end welfare as we know it. We passed a meaningful \nsmall business tax relief bill. And, we will pass a momentous health \ninsurance reform bill that will improve the availability and \nportability of health insurance coverage.\n  I would like to point out another opportunity Congress has to pass a \nsignificant reform proposal and that is the Food and Drug \nAdministration Performance and Accountability Act. I hope we can \nconsider this bill when we return in September.\n  The Senate Labor Committee has spent a considerable amount of time on \nthis comprehensive piece of legislation. And, let me point out, this \nreform proposal passed out of committee on an 11 to 4 vote.\n  The commonsense proposals in this bill are designed to strengthen the \nagency's ability to ensure that safe and effective new medicines are \nmade available to patients without delay by eliminating redtape and \nstreamlining operations.\n  The FDA is designed to achieve the goal of ensuring a safe and \nefficient approval process. And, the FDA has been concerned to protect \nthe public from unsafe drugs.\n  But, it is time to ensure that the agency becomes equally concerned \nabout promoting public health by making safe and effective new \ntherapies available to patients as soon as possible. Patients can be \nharmed by delay in approving safe and effective new medicines just as \nthey can by the approval of unsafe new medicines.\n  I urge the majority leader to consider this legislation in a timely \nenough matter so that we can send it to the President and I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial by \nSenators Kassebaum and Mikulski in support of this piece of \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 1996]\n\n                        The FDA Can Work Better\n\n                (ByBarbara Mikulski and Nancy Kassebaum)\n\n       The Post's July 17 editorial ``Reform Isn't Risk-Free'' \n     continues the drumbeat of negative commentary on our efforts \n     and the efforts of a bipartisan group of our colleagues on \n     the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee to achieve \n     meaningful reform of the Food and Drug Administration.\n       At the outset, we would make the point that a failure to \n     make needed reforms is by no means a risk-free proposition. \n     Inaction and delay victimize just as surely as the wrong \n     action. We hear constantly about the deformities prevented in \n     the early 1960s by the agency's not approving thalidomide. \n     Rarely, however, is a word spoken about the cases of spina \n     bifida that could have been averted had the FDA not delayed \n     for years in permitting health claims to be made about the \n     benefits of folic acid in preventing such neural tube \n     disorders.\n       As the 1989 ``Edwards Commission'' report put it: ``The \n     agency should be guided by the principle that expeditious \n     approval of useful and safe new products enhances the health \n     of the American people. Approving such products can be as \n     important as preventing the marketing of harmful or \n     ineffective products.'' The Edwards Commission was but one of \n     a series of distinguished panels convened during the past two \n     decades that have urged FDA reform.\n       During the year-long process in which our legislation was \n     developed, we drew heavily from the work on these expert \n     panels. Contrary to The Post's suggestion that we are rushing \n     a poorly though-out piece of legislation to the Senate floor, \n     we believe that this bill embodies the best thinking on this \n     topic produced over years and years of study.\n       Moreover, we have drawn as well from the successful \n     experience of the FDA in expediting approval of AIDS drugs \n     without jeopardizing safety and effectiveness. In response to \n     sustained pressure from the AIDS community, the agency \n     demonstrated that it could, in fact, change its culture and \n     its procedures to implement reforms it had resisted for \n     years.\n       Unfortunately, this experience has not been regarded as a \n     foundation upon which to build further improvements but, \n     rather, has been seized upon as ``proof'' that further \n     changes are unnecessary. Scientific methods and technology \n     have changed dramatically since the thalidomide incident, \n     while regulatory structures have barely bulged. Applications \n     for the approval of new drugs typically run to hundreds of \n     thousands of pages.\n       An incentive is growing for U.S. companies to move \n     research, development and production abroad, threatening our \n     nation's continued world leadership in new product \n     development, costing American jobs and further delaying \n     the public's access to important new products.\n       It is disconcerting to us that our efforts are being \n     regarded as a ``hostile takeover'' of the agency, as opposed \n     to the sincere effort it is to enhance the professionalism, \n     stature and effectiveness of the agency. The bill maintains \n     the FDA firmly in the driver's seat; it does not turn over \n     all the regulatory power to the private sector, as critics \n     have charged inaccurately. It encourages cooperation from the \n     very beginning of the process so that costly delays can be \n     avoided at the end of the road.\n       It is perhaps even more disconcerting to hear critics of \n     our efforts suggest that we are willing to put people's lives \n     at risk in order to collect large campaign contributions from \n     the drug industry.\n       The strong bipartisan vote in the Senate Labor and Human \n     Resources Committee reflects the desire of Republicans and \n     Democrats alike to make the FDA work better for all \n     Americans. We have reached out to the administration, and we \n     are more than willing to make constructive changes in the \n     legislation as reported by the committee. We are not, \n     however, willing to tolerate endless rationalizations as to \n     why the status quo should be maintained. Our goal is to \n     maintain these core principles: streamline and clarify the \n     regulatory process while maintaining safety and efficacy.\n       Our determination to move forward is fueled by the plight \n     of countless individuals who have contacted us over the years \n     to request assistance in speeding the FDA's evaluation of new \n     therapies that hold promise for treating serious illnesses, \n     such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple \n     sclerosis and cancer. For these individuals, the real risk is \n     not that we will act in haste, but rather that we will fail \n     to act at all.\n       Barbara Mikulski is a Democratic senator from Maryland. \n     Nancy Kassebaum is a Republican senator from Kansas.\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9550-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\n\n\n               RETIREMENT OF COL. JOHN R. BOURGEOIS, USMC\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nacknowledge the ``passing of a baton'' both in the literal and \nfigurative sense.\n  On July 11, 1996, Col. John R. Bourgeois, the 25th director of the \nU.S. Marine Band and Music Advisor to the White House, retired. He had \nled the band, known as the President's Own, for 17 years.\n  A native of Louisiana, Colonel Bourgeois joined the Marine Corps in \n1956 and joined the band just 2 years later as a French horn player. \nWhen he was appointed to his present grade, he became the first \nmusician in the Marine Corps to serve in every rank from private to \ncolonel.\n  As director of the Marine Band and Music Advisor to the White House, \nColonel Bourgeois has selected the music for each Presidential \ninauguration since 1981 and has appeared at the White House more \nfrequently than any other musician.\n  I am sure that those of my colleagues who have enjoyed the band's \nincredible performances at the evening parades or in other venues are \nnot surprised that Colonel Bourgeois and the Marine Band remain the \nfavorite of Presidents year after year.\n  When he retired, Colonel Bourgeois literally passed the baton--a \nbaton that had been given to another director of the Marine Band, John \nPhilip Sousa, over a century ago--to Maj. Timothy W. Foley, who has \nbeen nominated to become the next director.\n  The particular connection between the military profession and its \nrousing music has transcended the years and national borders. It is as \nmuch a part of history as military service itself.\n  As Colonel Bourgeois retires from active duty after a distinguished \ncareer of service to the Marine Corps and his country, I know all of my \ncolleagues join me in expressing our deepest appreciation for the \npassion and professionalism he has brought to his duties, and the joy \nand pride he has brought to so many Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9551-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAIWAN STUDENTS AND FREE EXPRESSION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in our Nation we take for granted the \nability to speak freely and express what we please with no governmental \ninterference. There are a number of celebrated legal cases that \ndelineate the standard of time and manner regulation of speech in \nAmerica and other select limitations. Moreover, here in America we \ndon't believe that expression is allowed for one group and not for \ncomparable organizations. Such designated permission is paramount to \ncensorship of the party denied their speech.\n  In this regard, I voice my concern today about an incident that has \nbeen reported about an incident that occurred at the Olympic Games in \nAtlanta during a table tennis championship between Taiwan and the \nPeople's Republic of China. During the game, two Taiwanese students \nwaving the national flags of Taiwan were arrested under the premise \nthat they could not wave large flags, yet all around them large flags \nfrom other countries were in fact being waved by a multitude of those \npresent at the event.\n  Mr. President, to understand the deep significance of this event is \nto know that the contentions over flags and other items of national \nemblems and insignia is one of the issues that has long obstructed an \namiable relationship between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. \nThis history is extensive and, frankly, humiliating to Taiwan, which \nhas not always been afforded the full privileges of national pride at \nevents where both the Peoples' Republic of China and Taiwan have been \nrepresented.\n  Again, at these Olympic Games in Atlanta, Taiwan was subject to not \ndisplaying their recognized flag and subjecting their representatives \nto wearing other colors and design. While the Taiwan Government \nrecognized the need for its official representatives to abide by an \narrangement with the Olympic Committee, Taiwanese fans were not subject \nto such agreements. Nor should they have been. I believe the United \nStates would have been furious if its citizens were asked to not \ndisplay the Stars and Stripes or substitute the flag for another emblem \nunder which to cheer their teams. Yet, in Atlanta, the Taiwanese \ncitizens were arrested for ``disruption of public order by waving the \nflag of the National Republic of China (Taiwan).'' Mr. Hsu, a citizen \nof the Peoples' Republic of China and chairman of the International \nTable Tennis Association, admits to calling on the police to arrest the \nstudents.\n  I am concerned that the Atlanta Police Department was answering to a \ncitizen of the Peoples' Republic of China in conducting arrests of \nindividuals in America. Additionally, the question of subjecting \ncitizens from countries to all of the agreements that the formal \nrepresentatives may agree to is also a disturbing precedent. I believe \nthe International Olympic Committee should carefully examine these \ncircumstances, particularly since we in the United States fundamentally \nbelieve in more expression rather than less. Oliver Wendell Holmes once \npronounced a need for great protection of the ``marketplace of ideas.'' \nWe should do no less for the expression of national pride. We should \nnot be party to restricting some individuals for waving flags when the \npremise of the Olympic Games is the competition of athletes \nrepresenting their nations. I urge an examination of the facts of this \nsituation by the proper authorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9551-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on Monday, August 5, a distinguished \nAmerican named Susan Cohen will be present in the White House when \nPresident Clinton signs H.R. 3107, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of \n1996. Susan Cohen imminently deserves this honor. She was a dedicated \nand tireless leader in the effort to enact this legislation.\n  Susan Cohen, of Cape May Court House, NJ, is the mother of Theodora \nCohen--a victim of Pan Am Flight 103. Since the bombing of that flight \nover Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, Susan and her husband, Dan, \nhave dedicated their lives to bringing to justice those responsible for \ntheir daughter's death. In recent months, Susan has been extremely \neffective in her efforts to educate Members of Congress about the \nimportance of applying this legislation to Libya, which continues to \nharbor the two suspects indicted in the bombing.\n  All of us who know Susan Cohen admire her inspiring devotion to \njustice. Her efforts have brought us closer to the goal. I commend her \nfor her leadership, and I ask unanimous consent that a recent New York \nTimes article may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 24, 1996]\n\n                 Time Passes, But the Pain Never Fades\n\n                           (By Evelyn Nieves)\n\n       Susan Cohen watched the mourners toss single roses into the \n     sea, heard a reporter talk about ``a sense of closure,'' and \n     turned off her television, shuddering with sadness and \n     disgust.\n       Of all the hard times in the week since T.W.A. Flight 800 \n     blew up, seeing Monday's seaside memorial to the 230 victims \n     had to be one of the worst. ``I couldn't stand to watch those \n     people,'' she said. ``It was just too much. And to hear the \n     talk about closure just made me want to throw up.''\n       The next day, her emotions were still raw. ``All these \n     homilies about loved ones going to a better place. I just \n     hate that,'' she said. ``The politician said eight million \n     meaningless things. As if that could help. As if any of that \n     could help.''\n       It is going on eight years since Mrs. Cohen and her \n     husband, Daniel, lost their only child, Theodora, 20, to the \n     terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, \n     Scotland, which killed 270 people. ``The pain will not go \n     away,'' Mrs. Cohen said. ``It will never go away.''\n       Theodora--Theo to all she knew--was a singer and aspiring \n     actress. ``She had a beautiful soprano voice,'' Mrs. Cohen \n     said. ``She was vibrant and artistic.''\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\n       She was on her way home from London, where she had spent a \n     semester studying drama. A plastic explosive, hidden in a \n     portable radio in the cargo hold ripped the jet apart and all \n     259 people aboard, and 11 people on the ground, were killed.\n       ``I feel such a rage of anger that you cannot imagine,'' \n     Mrs. Cohen said, ``Because Theo's murderers are out there. No \n     one has been punished. I looked at Fred Goldman in that \n     ghastly O.J. trial and knew what he was going through for his \n     son.''\n       When she talks, the words spill out in coherent sentences, \n     as if she has thought them a million times.\n       The Cohens have spent countless hours since the death of \n     their daughter in pursuit of answers, and justice. Two Libyan \n     Government agents indicted for the bombing remains in Libya, \n     free. Over the last several months, Mrs. Cohen has spent six \n     or seven hours a day on the phone, lobbying Congress to pass \n     sanctions against foreign oil companies doing business in \n     Iran and Libya. Yesterday, it passed the House. ``Because a \n     plane blew up, not because of anything that I've done,'' she \n     said, ``Is that what has to happen for justice? A bombing?''\n       Even the prospect of tough sanctions does not make her \n     happy. Getting the bill passed was just the first step, she \n     said. Now, ``the fight is to see it's enforced.''\n       She has worked on fighting Congress with a few other people \n     who lost relatives to the Pan Am 103 bombing, but not many. \n     Over the years, Pan Am 103 families, who won a civil suit \n     against Pan Am, have argued bitterly over how best to pursue \n     justice. ``There are now four groups of Pan Am families,'' \n     Ms. Cohen said.\n       ``We've all fought horribly. I look at the pictures today \n     of families locked shoulder to shoulder on the beach. We \n     started together, too. But the idea that everybody gets \n     together as one big unhappy family is one of the myths of \n     these tragedies.''\n       Another great myth: ``The Getting On with Your Life \n     story,'' Mrs. Cohen said. ``The idea that you can move beyond \n     the tragedy makes me want to vomit. The year is circular. \n     Theo's birthday is coming up Sept. 10.''\n       When her daughter died, Mrs. Cohen, a writer like her \n     husband, stopped writing. For months, years it seemed, she \n     stopped doing much of anything. Days passed in bed, months in \n     a blur. Four years ago, the Cohens moved from Port Jervis, \n     N.Y., where they raised their daughter, to Cape May County in \n     New Jersey. ``I couldn't stand that house any more.'' Mrs. \n     Cohen said. ``I couldn't take the memories any more.\n       Though it doesn't really help, she knows she is not alone. \n     One women she knows who lost her 20-year-old son to Pan Am \n     103 visits his grave every day, sometimes twice a day. \n     Another who lost her husband ``has been just as devastated by \n     his loss as I am by my daughter's,'' Ms. Cohen said. ``It \n     takes a great poet to describe this. It takes genius to be \n     able to describe the depths of pain, and I'm not a great poet \n     or a genius.''\n       The Cohens live with a dog and three cats in a ranch house \n     with bird feeders hanging in the backyard. Mrs. Cohen belongs \n     to a P.G. Wodehouse society, a Sherlock Holmes reading group \n     and goes birding near home. They happen to live in one of the \n     world's best venues for bird-watching.\n       ``It's not like I'm living here and can't get out of bed,'' \n     Ms.Cohen said. ``I'm living. But there's an enormous hole, a \n     hole so huge it's the size of the Grand Canyon. It's never \n     the same. It can never be the same.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9551-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL RHODE, JR.\n\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to note the passing of and to \npay tribute to Michael Rhode, Jr., of South Carolina.\n  Mike Rhode died after a brave bout with cancer in May, only too \nbriefly after he retired from his position as Secretary of the Panama \nCanal Commission. I only recently learned of Mike's death.\n  I first met Mike when he served as Chief of the Army's Senate \nLegislative Liaison Office in the early 1970's when I was a newly \nelected Member of the U.S. Senate. Mike, who had combat experience in \nKorea and Vietnam, literally took me under his wing and played a major \nrole in my education about the capabilities of the U.S. Army and the \nother services. He accompanied me on my official travels, particularly \nto the territory of our NATO allies. Mike was extremely knowledgeable \nabout NATO and my first-ever report to the Armed Services Committee on \nNATO specifically cited Mike's invaluable assistance and expertise on \nNATO matters.\n  I continued my association with Mike when, upon his retirement from \nthe Army after 26 years of dedicated service to our Nation, he became \nthe Secretary of the Panama Canal Commission in 1980. Mike was \nextraordinarily helpful to me and the other members of the Armed \nServices Committee as Secretary of the Commission. He had that unique \nability to explain proposed legislation and to suggest ways in which \nthe laws governing the operation and maintenance of the Panama Canal \ncould be modified over the years to ease the transition to Panamanian \ncontrol by the year 2000.\n  In looking back over my association--and my friendship--with Mike \nover the years, I am most struck by his dedication to duty and his warm \nand gregarious personality. He always had a warm smile and time to \nspare to answer any question. Shortly before he retired from the Panama \nCanal Commission, Mike came by my office for a purely social call. We \nreminisced about old times and talked about the future that awaited \nboth of us in private life. Mike had been in poor health but was \nconfident that he would lick this health problem as he had all other \nchallenges in the past. My most vivid memory of our last meeting was \nhis broad smile and his plans for retirement with his wife Lin and \nspending time with his daughter, Pamela Lister, and two sons, Michael \nand Randy.\n  Mr. President, Mike Rhode was a valued friend and a dedicated and \ntalented public servant. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9552-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FDA REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to once again commend the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, on her remarkable \nleadership on the health insurance reform bill. In addition to \ncompleting action of this important legislation, it is my hope and \nintention to complete action in the fall on another piece of \nlegislation that Senator Kassebaum has worked on for some time--S. \n1477, the Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability \nAct.\n  Negotiations to bring all sides together on FDA reform have been \nongoing throughout the 104th Congress and the Labor and Human Resources \ncommittee has reported out S. 1477 with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport. Since that action, it is my understanding that some very \nserious discussions have been underway to resolve outstanding issues \nand that we are very close to reaching final agreement on compromise \nlegislation. I am encouraged by these continued discussions so that \nthis bill can be passed in a bipartisan manner when the Congress \nreturns.\n  Mr. President, it is also my understanding that the leadership in the \nHouse of Representatives is also close to reaching agreement on its FDA \nlegislation. Working together, I am confident the House and the Senate \ncan agree on bipartisan legislation that the President can be \nenthusiastic about signing.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with Senator Kassebaum to complete this \nimportant legislation to modernize the FDA, to streamline the approval \nprocess, and to bring breakthrough medications to patients, all while \nmaintaining the highest levels of safety for consumers.\n  Mr. President, a remarkable amount of business has been accomplished \nin the past few weeks in the Senate on a bipartisan manner. It is my \nhope we can add FDA reform to the list.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9552-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \ntreaties and sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9552-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9552-S9553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 782) to amend \ntitle 18 of the United States Code to allow members of employee \nassociations to represent their views before the U.S. Government.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the report of the \ncommittee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \nthe amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R.\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\n3103) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve portability \nand continuity of health insurance coverage in the group and individual \nmarkets, to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in health insurance and \nhealth care delivery, to promote the use of medical savings accounts, \nto improve access to long-term care services and coverage to simplify \nthe administration of health insurance, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agrees to the report of \nthe committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \non the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3230) to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 1997 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \npurposes.\n  The message also announced that the House agrees to the report of the \ncommittee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on \nthe amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3517) making \nappropriations for military construction, family housing, and based \nrealignment and closure for the Department of Defense for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1997, and for other purposes.\n  The message further announced that the House agrees to the report of \nthe committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses \non the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3845) making \nappropriations for the government of the District of Columbia and other \nactivities chargeable in whole or in part against the revenues of said \nDistrict for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for other \npurposes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  At noon, a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 123.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to exchange \ncertain lands in the Wenatchee National Forest, Washington, for certain \nlands owned by Public District No. 1 of Chelan County, Washington, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       Land Exchange Legislation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to authorize \na land exchange between the Chelan County PUD, in Washington State and \nthe U.S. Forest Service. The land exchange legislation will consolidate \nland for a wastewater treatment facility onto Chelan County PUD land. \nChelan PUD would in turn own and operate the wastewater treatment \nfacility, which serves both the Forest Service and some of the local \ncommunity.\n  The legislation was carefully negotiated between the Forest Service \nand the Chelan County PUD. The Forest Service supports the legislation, \nand I hope that the legislation can be enacted this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 2018. A bill to approve a settlement agreement between the Bureau \nof Reclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                         settlement legislation\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will \nauthorize settlement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the \nOroville-Tonasket Irrigation District in Washington state. Congressman \nDoc Hastings has introduced identical legislation on this subject in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  This legislation will authorize a carefully negotiated settlement \nbetween the BOR and the Oroville-Tonasketi Irrigation District. If \nenacted, this legislation will save the BOR, and therefore the Nation's \ntaxpayers, money that would otherwise be spent fighting with the \nirrigation district in court. Briefly, the legislation directs the \nirrigation district to release and discharge all past and future claims \nagainst the United States associated with the project--such claims are \nestimated at $4.5 million. The irrigation district will assume full \nresponsibility to indemnify and defend the United States against any \nthird-party claims associated with the project. The irrigation district \nwill make a cash payment of $350,000 to the United States--a condition \nthat has already been met. The irrigation district will release the \nUnited States from its obligation to remove existing dilapidated \nfacilities--cost estimated at $150,000 in 1978. The district will also \nbe solely responsible for the operations and maintenance of the \nproject, and will agree to continue to deliver water to and provide for \nO of the wildlife Mitigation facilities at its own expense.\n  The legislation directs the BOR to release and discharge the \nirrigation district's construction charge obligation under the 1979 \nrepayment contract--present value estimated at $4.2 million. Within 180 \ndays of the date of enactment, the BOR will transfer the title of the \nirrigation works to district at no additional cost to the district. The \nBOR will continue to provide power and energy for water pumping for the \nproject for a period of 50 years--starting October 1990--as provided \nfor in the irrigation discount provision in the Northwest Power Act. At \nthe end of that 50 year period, the irrigation district will have to \npurchase its power at nonirrigation discount rates.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will resolve a long standing dispute \nbetween the irrigation district and the Bureau of Reclamation that will \nsave the taxpayers the expense of financing a long, drawn out court \nfight. I will work with my colleagues on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to see that this legislation is enacted this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Simon, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Cohen):\n  S. 2019. A bill to provide for referenda to resolve the political \nstatus of Puerto Rico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                        puerto rico legislation\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould establish a congressionally recognized self-determination process \nto resolve the political status of Puerto Rico. This proposal is made \nin light of the formal request of the Legislature of Puerto Rico, \nexpressly directed to the 104th Congress, for a response to the 1993 \nplebiscite on Puerto Rico's future political status conducted under \nlocal law.\n  Puerto Rico Legislature Resolution 62, adopted by the elected \nrepresentatives of the residents of Puerto Rico on November 14, 1994, \nspecifically calls upon this Congress to state the ``specific \nalternatives that it is willing to consider, and the measures it \nrecommends the people of Puerto Rico should take as part of the process \nto solve the problem of their political status.'' Even though time is \nrunning out on the 104th Congress, this Senator believes it would be \nwrong to adjourn\n\n[[Page S9556]]\n\nlater this year without introducing in the Senate a proposal which \naddresses the manner in which Puerto Rico's status can be resolved \nconsistent with both self-determination and the national interest.\n  The solution to Puerto Rico's status cannot be one which imposes a \nresult on the residents of Puerto Rico or on the United States. The \nprocess we are proposing recognizes the right of self-determination on \nboth sides of the relationship. Let me explain why my colleagues should \nsupport the bill I am offering.\n  Puerto Rico has been an unincorporated territory of the United States \nfor almost 100 years, subject to the plenary powers of Congress under \nthe territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution, article IV, section 3, \nclause 2. Congressional authorization for the adoption of a local \nconstitution and delegation of authority for internal self-government \nin 1952 represented progress in the evolution of the territory's \nstatus, but the 3.8 million U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico do \nnot yet have equal legal and political rights with their fellow \ncitizens living in the States, or a guaranteed permanent status \nprotected by the U.S. Constitution.\n  Puerto Ricans have a statutory citizenship status prescribed by \nCongress in 1917, with less than equal legal standing and political \nrights while residing in Puerto Rico because it is not a State. In 1980 \nthe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Harris v. Rosario (446 U.S. 651) that \nas long as Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory subject to the \nterritorial clause it does not violate the fundamental rights which all \nU.S. citizens have under the Constitution for Congress to treat the \nU.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico differently than their fellow \ncitizens in the 50 States as long as there is a rational basis for such \nunequal treatment.\n  While any self-determination process we establish should allow the \npeople in Puerto Rico to express approval of this present status, the \nidea that perpetual territorial status for such a large and populous \narea is desirable for either Puerto Rico or the nation as a whole needs \nto be examined closely. To begin with we need to recognize that \nAmericans from Puerto Rico have served with valor along side their \nfellow citizens in every war this century, but Congress never has \nafforded the people an opportunity to express their wishes as to the \noptions for full self-government and a permanent status outside the \nterritorial clause--either as a state or through separate nationhood.\n\n  In 1953 the U.N. recognized the Resolution 748 (VIII) that \nestablishment of internal constitutional self-government with the \nconsent of the residents was consistent with self-determination \nprinciples of the U.N. Charter, and on that basis the United States \nstopped reporting to the United Nations on the status of Puerto Rico. \nWhile Puerto Rico is no longer a non-self-governing for purposes of \nArticle 73(e) of the U.N. Charter, Puerto Rico remains an \nunincorporated territory under the U.S. constitutional process. In \n1956, 4 years after the commonwealth structure for local self-\ngovernment was established, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in Reid \nv. Covert (354 U.S. 1), that the status of all such unincorporated \nterritories, results from the exercise of the territorial clause \nauthority and ``. . . the power of Congress to provide rules and \nregulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar \ntraditions and institutions . . . '' (emphasis added).\n  The traditions and institutions in Puerto Rico most relevant to the \npolitical status of the people there are no longer wholly dissimilar to \nthose of the United States. Puerto Ricans have been U.S. nationals \nsince 1899, with U.S. citizenship for 80 years. Puerto Rico has been \nwithin the U.S. legal and political system and customs territory for \nnearly a century. A republican form of constitutional internal self-\ngovernment was instituted through a democratic process 45 years ago.\n  Clearly, the time has come to establish a process through which the \ncurrent territorial status can be ended in favor of a constitutionally \nguaranteed permanent status consistent with full self-government, full \npolitical participation and equal citizenship rights. That means full \nintegration into the United States on the basis of equality, or full \ncitizenship and a constitutionally protected political status through \nseparate nationhood.\n  Again, if the residents of Puerto Rico prefer to remain in an \nunincorporated status and continue the present commonwealth structure \nfor local government, any congressionally recognized self-determination \nprocess should enable them freely to express their wishes in this \nregard. But they will not be able to make a free and informed choice \nunless the legal and political nature of the current status is defined \nin a constitutionally valid and intellectually honest manner.\n  Therein lies the problem with the 1993 plebiscite, in which the \nstatus options were formulated by the local political parties. The \ncommonwealth option on the 1993 ballot included elements which were \nsimply unconstitutional, and policy proposals that were so implausible \nand misleading as to make the voting results highly ambiguous. For \nexample, commonwealth received the lowest voter approval ever at 48 \npercent, while statehood received the highest vote ever at 46 percent. \nBut the commonwealth ballot definition include permanent union, the \nsame citizenship rights as persons born in the States, increased \nFederal programs, and parity with the States in Federal budget outlay--\nfeatures which are constitutional guaranteed and/or politically \npossible only with statehood.\n  At the same time, the commonwealth option also called for Federal tax \nexemptions, fiscal autonomy, a local veto over Federal laws passed by \nCongress under a so-called bilateral pact, and other features more \nconsistent with independence than territorial status. Independence \nreceived 4 percent voter approval. The combined vote for the have it \nboth ways definition of commonwealth and independence was 52 percent, \nbut the combined vote for statehood and commonwealth as options which \ninvolved guaranteed permanent union and U.S. citizenship was over 95 \npercent.\n  I doubt that the 103d Congress would have adjourned more than a year \nafter the 1993 vote without breaking a deafening silence regarding the \nresults of the plebiscite if the ballot definitions had not rendered \nthose results both ambiguous and confusing.\n  Apparently due in large part to Resolution 62, in this Congress the \nHouse committees with primary jurisdiction with respect to Puerto \nRico's status conducted hearings on the 1993 voting results on October \n17, 1995. Each of Puerto Rico's political parties were given a full and \nfair hearing regarding their views on the 1993 vote.\n  Based on the record of that hearing, the leadership of the concerned \nHouse committees transmitted a comprehensive statement to the leaders \nof the Puerto Rico Legislature on February 29, 1996, setting forth \nauthoritative policy statements and points of law regarding the 1993 \nvoting results. On March 6, 1996, legislation consistent with the \nprinciples set forth in the February 29 policy statement was introduced \nin the House. After hearings in San Juan Puerto Rico in which all \nparties were heard once again regarding H.R. 3024--United States-Puerto \nRico Political Status Act--the bill was amended to meet certain \nconcerns that had been raised and unanimously approved by the Committee \non Resources on June 26, 1996.\n\n  On June 28, 1996, senior minority members on the two House committees \nwhich had conducted the hearings on the 1993 vote also transmitted \nviews to leaders in the Puerto Rico Legislature regarding the results \nthereof. In addition, on July 18, 1996, 11 members of the minority in \nthe House, including some of the most knowledgeable and experienced \nMembers of Congress where the issue of Puerto Rico's status is \nconcerned, wrote to that body's minority leader expressing their \nsupport for the Puerto Rico status bill reported unanimously by the \nResources Committee on June 26, 1996.\n  What the measures taken by House committees and members to date \ndemonstrate is that there is some important new thinking in Congress \nabout the Puerto Rico status issue. There is an emerging bipartisan \nconsensus that the time has come for Congress to recognize that a \nprocess which makes definitive self-determination and permanent full \nself-government available to Puerto Rico is in the U.S. national \ninterest, as well as that of the residents of Puerto Rico.\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\n  In particular, I want to point out that the July 18, 1996 letter from \nconcerned members of the minority to House Minority Leader Gephardt \ndefends the specific approach to legitimate self-determination for \nPuerto Rico set forth in H.R. 3024 against criticism generated by \nsupporters of the fatally-flawed and discredited definition of \ncommonwealth presented on the 1993 plebiscite ballot. Specifically, the \nJuly 18 letter notes that:\n\n       Some have tried to revive discussion over the language and \n     citizenship provisions of the bill, even though these issues \n     were dealt with in the reported text of H.R. 3024. Others \n     claim that the ballot process is unfairly skewed toward one \n     option or another, hoping to revert back to the three-way \n     ballot in 1993 which yielded no clear majority. More than \n     just attempts to amend the legislation, these efforts are \n     aimed at delaying its consideration or tainting its language \n     so that it will never see the light of day.\n\n  I have described the response in the House to Resolution 62 of the \nPuerto Rico Legislature in some detail so that my Senate colleagues can \nbetter appreciate the need for some demonstration that Members of this \nbody have an interest in the issues raised by the formal request \ndirected by the local constitutional authorities to the 104th Congress. \nThe bill we are introducing today is not a definitive or final formal \nresponse to that request, but it sends an important message to the \nHouse and to Puerto Rico that the Senate also will address this matter \nconsistent with the principles of self-determination and the national \ninterest.\n  Accordingly, the legislation we are proposing, like the House \nversion, recognizes that the commonwealth option can and should be \npresented accurately and fairly on a status referendum ballot. The \nvoters must be able to evaluate the current status and the commonwealth \nstructure for local government on the merits. But those who think that \nCongress is required to adopt the same 3-option ballot format employed \nin the 1993 local plebiscite format need to think again. While we need \nto respect, study, and consider the 1993 vote despite obvious flaws in \nthe ballot, Congress cannot restrict itself to considering only past \npractices in Puerto Rico or the approach previously considered by \nCongress.\n  We need to keep an open mind, and this bill proposes a new approach \nconsistent with that being developed in the House. It recognizes that \nCongress may determine that it could be misleading to present the \nstatus quo option without distinguishing it in any way from the options \nfor ending territorial status and instituting fundamental changes that \nwould be required to establish permanent full self-government and a \nconstitutionally guaranteed status.\n  Only when the people who live in Puerto Rico are allowed to vote in a \nreferendum process which defines the choices in a way that is valid and \naccurate will Congress be able to understand the meaning of the \nresults. Then Congress can respond to those results by proposing the \nterms under which the preferred option would be possible, after which \nan additional informed stage of self-determination can take place. If \nthe terms for change are not approved by the people, or the people vote \nfor the option of continued commonwealth, then Congress will have to \nconsider its response to that result as well.\n  Before my colleagues, or those responsible for these issues in the \nadministration, attempt to defend the approach of the 1993 plebiscite \nballot, I suggest they review all of the congressional documents \nresponding to Puerto Rico Legislature Resolution 62 referred to above. \nTo facilitate an openminded consideration of what we are proposing, \nthose documents are included here in the order mentioned above.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                       Committee on Resources,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 29, 1996.\n     Hon. Roberto Rexach-Benitez,\n     President of the Senate.\n     Hon. Zaida Hernandez-Torres,\n     Speaker of the House, of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, San \n         Juan, PR.\n       Dear Mr. Rexach-Benitez and Ms. Hernandez-Torres: The \n     Committee on Resources and the Committee on International \n     Relations are working cooperatively to establish an official \n     record which we believe will enable the House to address the \n     subject-matter of Concurrent Resolution 62, adopted by the \n     Legislature of Puerto Rico on December 14, 1994. While the \n     specific measures addressing Puerto Rico's status which the \n     104th Congress will consider are still being developed, we \n     believe the history of the self-determination process in \n     Puerto Rico, as well as the record of the Joint Hearing \n     conducted on October 17, 1995 by the Subcommittee on Native \n     American and Insular Affairs and the Subcommittee on Western \n     Hemisphere, lead to the following conclusions with respect to \n     the plebiscite conducted in Puerto Rico on November 14, 1993:\n       1. The plebiscite was conducted under local law by local \n     authorities, and the voting process appears to have been \n     orderly and consistent with recognized standards for lawful \n     and democratic elections. This locally organized self-\n     determination process was undertaken within the authority of \n     the constitutional government of Puerto Rico, and is \n     consistent with the right of the people of Puerto Rico freely \n     to express their wishes regarding their political status and \n     the form of government under which they live. The United \n     States recognizes the right of the people of Puerto Rico to \n     self-determination, including the right to approve any \n     permanent political status which will be established upon \n     termination of the current unincorporated territory status. \n     Congress will take cognizance of the 1993 plebiscite results \n     in determining future Federal policy toward Puerto Rico.\n       2. The content of each of the three status options on the \n     ballot was determined by the three major political parties in \n     Puerto Rico identified with those options, respectively. The \n     U.S. Congress did not adopt a formal position as to the \n     feasibility of any of the options prior to presentation to \n     the voters. Consequently, the results of the vote necessarily \n     must be viewed as an expression of the preferences of those \n     who voted as between the proposals and advocacy of the three \n     major political parties for the status option espoused by \n     each such party.\n       3. None of the status options presented on the ballot \n     received a majority of the votes cast. While the commonwealth \n     option on the ballot received a plurality of votes, this \n     result is difficult to interpret because that option \n     contained proposals to profoundly change rather than continue \n     the current Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government structure. \n     Certain elements of the commonwealth option, including \n     permanent union with the United States and guaranteed U.S. \n     citizenship, can only be achieved through full integration \n     into the U.S. leading to statehood. Other elements of the \n     commonwealth option on the ballot, including a government-to-\n     government bilateral pact which cannot be altered, either are \n     not possible or could only be partially accomplished through \n     treaty arrangements based on separate sovereignty. While the \n     statehood and independence options are more clearly defined, \n     neither of these options can be fully understood on the \n     merits, unless viewed in the context of clear Congressional \n     policy regarding the terms under which either option could be \n     implemented if approved in a future plebiscite recognized by \n     the federal government. Thus, there is a need for Congress to \n     define the real options for change and the true legal and \n     political nature of the status quo, so that the people can \n     know what the actual choices will be in the future.\n       4. Although there is a history of confusion and ambiguity \n     on the part of some in the U.S. and Puerto Rico regarding the \n     legal and political nature of the current ``commonwealth'' \n     local government structure and territorial status, it is \n     incontrovertible that Puerto Rico's present status is that of \n     an unincorporated territory subject in all respects to the \n     authority of the United States Congress under the Territorial \n     Clause of the U.S. Constitution. As such, the current status \n     does not provide guaranteed permanent union or guaranteed \n     citizenship to the inhabitants of the territory of Puerto \n     Rico, nor does the current status provide the basis for \n     recognition of a separate Puerto Rican sovereignty or a \n     binding government-to-government status pact.\n       5. In light of the foregoing, the results the November 14, \n     1993 vote indicates that it is the preference of those who \n     cast ballots to change the present impermanent status in \n     favor of a permanent political status based on full self-\n     government. The only options for a permanent and fully self-\n     governing status are: 1) separate sovereignty and full \n     national independence, 2) separate sovereignty in free \n     association with the United States; 3) full integration into \n     the United States political system ending unincorporated \n     territory status and leading to statehood.\n       6. Because each ballot option in the 1993 plebiscite \n     addressed citizenship, we want to clarify this issue. First, \n     under separate sovereignty Puerto Ricans will have their own \n     nationality and citizenship. The U.S. political status, \n     nationality, and citizenship provided by Congress under \n     statues implementing the Treaty of Paris during the \n     unincorporated territory period will be replaced by the new \n     Puerto Rican nationhood and citizenship status that comes \n     with separate sovereignty. To prevent hardship or unfairness \n     in individual cases, the U.S. Congress may determine the \n     requirements for eligible persons to continue U.S. \n     nationality and citizenship, or be naturalized, and this will \n     be governed by U.S. law, not Puerto Rican law. If the voters \n     freely choose separate sovereignty, only those born in Puerto \n     Rico who have acquired U.S. citizenship on some other\n\n[[Page S9558]]\n\n     legal basis outside the scope of the Treaty of Paris \n     citizenship statutes enacted by Congress during the \n     territorial period will not be affected. Thus, the automatic \n     combined Puerto Rican and U.S. citizenship described under \n     the definition of independence on the 1993 plebiscite ballot \n     was a proposal which is misleading and inconsistent with the \n     fundamental principles of separate nationality and non-\n     interference by two sovereign countries in each other's \n     internal affairs, which includes regulation of citizenship. \n     Under statehood, guaranteed equal U.S. citizenship status \n     will become a permanent right. Under the present Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico government structure, the current limited U.S. \n     citizenship status and rights will be continued under Federal \n     law enacted under the Territorial Clause and the Treaty of \n     Paris, protected to the extent of partial application of the \n     U.S. Constitution during the period in which Puerto Rico \n     remains an unincorporated territory.\n       7. The alternative to full integration into the United \n     States or a status based on separate sovereignty is \n     continuation of the current unincorporated territory status. \n     In that event, the present status quo, including the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico structure for local self-\n     government, presumably could continue for some period of \n     time, until Congress in its discretion otherwise determines \n     the permanent disposition of the territory of Puerto Rico and \n     the status of its inhabitants through the exercise of its \n     authority under the Territorial Clause and the provisions of \n     the Treaty of Paris. Congress may consider proposals \n     regarding changes in the current local government structure, \n     including those set forth in the ``Definition of \n     Commonwealth'' on the 1993 plebiscite ballot. However, in our \n     view serious consideration of proposals for equal treatment \n     for residents of Puerto Rico under Federal programs will not \n     be provided unless there is an end to certain exemptions from \n     federal tax laws and other non-taxation in Puerto Rico, so \n     that individuals and corporations in Puerto Rico have the \n     same responsibilities and obligations in this regard as the \n     states. Since the ``commonwealth'' option on the 1993 \n     plebiscite ballot called for ``fiscal autonomy,'' which is \n     understood to mean, among other things, continuation of the \n     current exemptions from federal taxation for the territory, \n     this constitutes another major political, legal and economic \n     obstacle to implementing the changes in Federal law and \n     policy required to fulfill the terms of the ``Definition of \n     Commonwealth.''\n       8. In addition, it is important to recognize that the \n     existing Commonwealth of Puerto Rico structure for local \n     self-government, and any other measures which Congress may \n     approve while Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated \n     territory, are not unalterable in a sense that is \n     constitutionally binding upon a future Congress. Any \n     provision, agreement or pact to the contrary is legally \n     unenforceable. Thus, the current Federal laws and policies \n     applicable to Puerto Rico are not unalterable, nor can they \n     be made unalterable, and the current status of the \n     inhabitants is not irrevocable, as proposed under the \n     ``commonwealth'' option on the 1993 plebiscite ballot. \n     Congress will continue to respect the principle of self-\n     determination in its exercise of Territorial Clause powers, \n     but that authority must be exercised within the framework of \n     the U.S. Constitution and in a manner deemed by Congress to \n     best serve the U.S. national interest. In our view, promoting \n     the goal of full self-government for the people of Puerto \n     Rico, rather than remaining in a separate and unequal status, \n     is in the best interests of the United States. This is \n     particularly true due to the large population of Puerto Rico, \n     the approach of a new century in which a protracted status \n     debate will interfere with Puerto Rico's economic and social \n     development, and the domestic and international interest in \n     determining a path to full self-government for all \n     territories with a colonial history before the end of this \n     century.\n       9. The record of the October 17, 1995 hearing referred to \n     above makes it clear that the realities regarding \n     constitutional, legal and political obstacles to implementing \n     the changes required to fulfill the core elements of the \n     ``commonwealth'' option on the ballot were not made clear and \n     understandable in the public discussion and political debate \n     leading up to the vote. Consequently, Congress must determine \n     what steps the Federal government should take in order to \n     help move the self-determination process to the next stage, \n     so that the political status aspirations of the people can be \n     ascertained through a truly informed vote in which the wishes \n     of the people are freely expressed within a framework \n     approved by Congress. Only through such a process will \n     Congress then have a clear basis for determining and \n     resolving the question of Puerto Rico's future political \n     status in a manner consistent with the national interest.\n       Ultimately, Congress alone can determine Federal policy \n     with respect to self-government and self-determination for \n     the residents of Puerto Rico. It will not be possible for the \n     local government or the people to advance further in the \n     self-determination process until the U.S. Congress meets its \n     moral and governmental responsibility to clarify Federal \n     requirements regarding termination of the present \n     unincorporated territory status of Puerto Rico in favor of \n     one of the options for full self-government.\n       The results of the locally administered 1993 vote are \n     useful in this regard, but in our view are not definitive \n     beyond what has been stated above. The question of Puerto \n     Rico's political status remains open and unresolved.\n           Sincerely,\n     Don Young,\n       Chairman, Committee on Resources.\n     Elton Gallegly,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Native American and Insular \n     Affairs.\n     Ben Gilman,\n       Chairman, Committee on International Relations.\n     Dan Burton,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1996.\n     Senator Charlie Rodriguez,\n     Majority Leader, Puerto Rico Senate, the Capitol, San Juan, \n         PR.\n       Dear Senator Rodriguez: As the senior democrats on the \n     House Resources and International Relations Committees we \n     have always been concerned about the economic and political \n     future of Puerto Rico. As the 104th Congress considers \n     proposed legislation regarding the process of self-\n     determination for Puerto Rico, we believe that it is time to \n     reexamine the status issue in light of the 1993 plebiscite.\n       On December 14, 1994 the Legislature of Puerto Rico adopted \n     Concurrent Resolution 62 which sought congressional guidance \n     regarding the results of the 1993 status plebiscite. \n     Recently, the Chairman of the relevant committees and \n     subcommittees that deal with Puerto Rico's political status \n     responded to this important resolution. Although we agree \n     with many portions of the letter, we would like to outline \n     some of our views on the issue as well.\n       We believe that the definition of Commonwealth on the 1993 \n     plebiscite ballot was difficult given Constitutional, and \n     current fiscal and political limitations. Through numerous \n     Supreme Court and other Federal Court decisions, it is clear \n     that Puerto Rico remains an unincorporated territory and is \n     subject to the authority of Congress under the territorial \n     clause. Another aspect of this definition called for the \n     granting of additional tax breaks to Section 936 companies \n     and an increase in federal benefits in order to achieve \n     parity with all the states without having to pay federal \n     taxes. It is important that any judgment on the future of \n     Puerto Rico be based on sound options that reflect the \n     current budgetary context in the United States. This context \n     should also reflect the bi-partisan agreement being worked on \n     by Congress which reduces Section 936 benefits.\n       Since Congress has neither approved nor resolved the 1993 \n     plebiscite results, we are in favor of legislation that will \n     establish a future process of self-determination for the \n     people of Puerto Rico. This legislation should include a \n     requirement for status plebiscites to take place within a \n     certain number of years and define various status options in \n     a realistic manner.\n       In two years, Puerto Rico will celebrate its 100th year as \n     part of the United States. Congress has both a political and \n     moral responsibility to ensure that the 3.5 million Americans \n     living in Puerto Rico have a right to express their views on \n     the important issue of political status on a regular basis.\n       We hope this additional response to Concurrent Resolution \n     62 is helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Torricelli,\n     Bill Richardson,\n     Lee Hamilton,\n     Dale Kildee,\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1996.\n     Hon. Richard Gephardt,\n     Minority Leader, the Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Minority Leader Gephardt: Given the short time before \n     the adjournment of the 104th Congress, we are eagerly trying \n     to secure floor time for a bill that is of great importance \n     to us, H.R. 3024, the United States-Puerto Rico Political \n     Status Act. Unfortunately, we understand that certain \n     Representatives have approached you in recent days in hopes \n     of derailing this legislative effort.\n       After nearly 100 years as a territory of the United States, \n     Puerto Rico must be provided with the opportunity to \n     determine its future. While some would have you believe that \n     there is no need for a self-determination process, it must be \n     clear that the existing ``Commonwealth'' structure was never \n     meant to be a permanent solution for Puerto Rico, \n     particularly since the 3.8 million U.S. citizens in Puerto \n     Rico are disenfranchised under the current arrangement. Just \n     as the United Nations has called for an end to colonialism by \n     the year 2000, the United States must lead by example by \n     putting an end to the disenfranchisement of its own citizens \n     and allowing Puerto Rico to resolve, once and for all, its \n     status dilemma.\n       As you know, H.R. 3024 establishes a process whereby the \n     U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico would be allowed to vote on \n     self-determination by the end of 1998. On the first ballot, \n     the voters would choose to either change their status or \n     maintain the status quo. Then, assuming the majority votes to \n     change their status, they would then again vote to choose \n     between a path toward separation (independence or free \n     association) or a path\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\n     toward integration (statehood). In each instance, the results \n     would be definitive and would produce a majority.\n       With over sixty cosponsors in the House, H.R. 3024 has \n     strong bipartisan support. During the full Resources \n     Committee markup last month, the bill was reported \n     unanimously after adopting only minor perfecting amendments. \n     It is now before the Rules Committee and we are hopeful that \n     it will soon proceed to the House floor. Opponents of H.R. \n     3024, however, are using a number of tactics to try to delay \n     this process and confuse the issue.\n       Some have tried to revive discussions over the language and \n     citizenship provisions of the bill, even though these issues \n     were dealt with in the reported text of H.R. 3024. Others \n     claim that the ballot process is unfairly skewed toward one \n     option or another, hoping to revert back to the three-way \n     ballot in 1993 which yielded no clear majority. More than \n     just attempts to amend the legislation, these efforts are \n     aimed at delaying its consideration or tainting its language \n     so that it will never see the light of day this year on the \n     House floor.\n       All told, these efforts should not obscure the original \n     intent of the legislation: to provide Puerto Rico with a fair \n     process of self-determination for the first time in the \n     Island's history. Your support for this effort is needed and \n     would help Congress give the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico the \n     voice and participation in the democratic process which they \n     are entitled to and deserve.\n       Thank you for your interest in the affairs of Puerto Rico. \n     If you would like to discuss this matter further, please do \n     not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n         Carlos A. Romero-Barcelo, Robert A. Underwood, Nick \n           Rahall, Sam Farr, Esteban E. Torres, Bill Richardson, \n           Patrick J. Kennedy, Jose E. Serrano, Dale E. Kildee, \n           Pat Williams, Neil Abercrombie.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe legislation introduced by my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, \nwith whom I have worked closely on many issues over the years.\n  This important bill establishes a process whereby the people of \nPuerto Rico can vote for a retention or a change of their current \nCommonwealth status, a status preserved as a result of the November 14, \n1993 plebiscite. If Puerto Ricans choose change, they can select a path \ntoward separation--independence or free association--or a path toward \nincorporation--statehood. In short, the bill establishes an orderly \npath toward true self-determination in the true democratic spirit of \nour Nation.\n  One might ask why such legislation is necessary given that less than \n3 years ago, a plurality of U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico chose the \nCommonwealth option on the November 14 ballot. This option--drafted by \nthe Commonwealth party itself, under the agreed-upon terms of the \nplebiscite--presented the people of Puerto Rico with utterly inflated \nand unrealistic expectations regarding the island's future relationship \nwith the United States. In effect, the Commonwealth option guaranteed \nUnited States citizens of Puerto Rico many of the benefits of statehood \nand many of the benefits of separation without any of the accompanying \nresponsibilities of either. Given these pie-in-the-sky promises, it is \nno wonder that a plurality of Puerto Ricans--though, important, not a \nmajority--chose the Commonwealth option. However, the future of Puerto \nRico's relationship with the United States remains unclear, and \ncongressional action providing Puerto Ricans with the power to \ndetermine their fate through a fair and orderly process is long \noverdue.\n  It is time that Congress' silence on the results of the November 14, \n1993 Puerto Rican plebiscite end, and that we afford United States \ncitizens in Puerto Rico realistic and just options for determining \nPuerto Rico's future relationship with the United States of America. \nThe Puerto Rican Government has asked that we do as much. On December \n14, 1994, the legislature of Puerto Rico adopted Concurrent Resolution \n62 which formally requested congressional guidance regarding the \nresults of the 1993 status plebiscite. This legislation provides this \nguidance.\n  The process established by this legislation would be unprecedented \nand long overdue, affording Puerto Ricans for the first time a fair \nprocess of self-determination that is consistent with everything \nAmerica stands for. We owe Puerto Rico--which in 2 years will have been \npart of the United States for 100 years--at least this much.\n  For decades, we have treated the right to self-determination as a \ncornerstone of our foreign policy. It is time that we practice what we \npreach.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 2020. A bill to establish America's Agricultural Heritage \nPartnership in Iowa, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the agricultural heritage partnership act of 1996\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the America's \nAgricultural Heritage Partnership Act of 1996. This legislation would \nauthorize the designation of several counties in northeast Iowa as \nAmerica's Agricultural Heritage Partnership. This project is more \ncommonly known as Silos and Smokestacks.\n  The story of agriculture in the United States is not only one of \nnational progress and bounty, but is also a story of world progress and \nbounty. American agriculture is a national and a world treasure. It is \na story that needs to be told. That is the silos part of Silos and \nSmokestacks. The smokestacks are the industrial base that supports our \ncountry's agriculture. The mission of America's Agricultural Heritage \nPartnership--Silos and Smokestacks--is to tell their combined story, \nthrough traditional exhibits and by designed routes through the \ncountryside highlighting areas of importance and interest.\n  Community leaders in Waterloo, IA, the surrounding communities, and \nthe rural area began meeting several years ago to determine how best to \ntell the agricultural story, especially how it relates to our country's \ngreat industrial history. Because of their interest, the National Park \nService was then requested to conduct a study to develop \nrecommendations as to the location of a heritage area and how to \npresent the history.\n  That study recommended that northeast Iowa be the location for an \nagricultural heritage partnership area. Since that time, the \ncommunities have continued their work to lay a proper foundation for \nthe project pending congressional authorization for Silos and \nSmokestacks.\n  Waterloo is located in the center of some of the richest, most \nproductive agricultural land in the world. It is also home to John \nDeere and other farm equipment manufacturers and other related \nagricultural industries. Waterloo is an ideal location to tell the \ncombined story of American agriculture and the industry associated with \nit.\n  This legislation would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to make \ngrants or enter into cooperative agreements to further this project. He \nmay also provide necessary technical assistance.\n  This is a worthwhile endeavor to tell an important American story to \nour citizens and the World. I strongly encourage enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise as cosponsor of America's \nAgricultural Heritage Partnership Act of 1996. This bill would \nestablish America's Agricultural Heritage Partnership in northeast Iowa \nin order to promote the story of agriculture in our Nation's rich \nhistory.\n  A few years ago, leaders from Waterloo and other communities in \nnortheast Iowa developed an initiative called Silos and Smokestacks. \nSilos and Smokestacks is a private organization that has worked to \nremodel and renovate old, and often abandoned, buildings in Waterloo. \nThis effort is a wonderful example of communities and concerned \ncitizens working together to preserve a unique part of American \nhistory.\n  The hard work by Silos and Smokestacks has provided the foundation \nfor a unique heritage park that would combine the stories of our \nNation's agricultural and industrial development. In the past, the \nfocus of the National Park Service has been to create and administer \nthe so-called natural areas, commonly known as our National Park \nSystem. A heritage park involves local, State, Federal, and private \ninterests in recognizing and preserving sites of cultural and \nhistorical significance. Heritage areas are something like a large \ninteractive museum in which people have the opportunity to gain \nfirsthand knowledge of an important facet of our Nation's history.\n  The National Park Service has determined that northeast Iowa is an \nideal\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\nlocation for a heritage park. This park would tell the nationally \nsignificant, but often overlooked, story of American agriculture. \nNortheast Iowa combines the rich histories of our Nation's farming and \nindustrial sectors. In the area surrounding Waterloo one will find some \nof the most productive and fertile land in the Nation. Boasting the \nproduction lines of John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers \nand some of the largest meatpacking operations in the Midwest, the city \nof Waterloo represents our Nation's industrial strength. Taken \ntogether, this area represents nearly every aspect of agricultural and \nfood production.\n  The National Park Service has suggested that four principal topics of \nthe heritage area could include: the amazing science of agriculture, \nagriculture as a way of life, organizing for survival, and crops from \nthe field to the table.\n  The legislation introduced today would authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to make grants and provide technical and management \nassistance to those entities developing the introductory heritage park. \nThis assistance would be the critical impetus to see this unique \nproject through to completion. A heritage project in northeast Iowa \nwould provide countless Americans with a valuable insight into one of \nthe most fascinating, and important, aspects of American society.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2021. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain chemicals \nused in the formulation of an HIV protease inhibitor; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n               drug development acceleration legislation\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a nation, we must do everything we \ncan to find a cure for HIV/AIDS. However, until we have a cure for this \nurgent health priority, we need to find effective treatments and put \nthem in the hands of people with needs.\n  I rise today to introduce legislation, joined by my colleague Senator \nBoxer, to eliminate the tariff for several chemical compounds. These \ncompounds are required for the manufacture of an AIDS drug, nelfinavir \nmesylate, which has produced promising test results.\n\n\n                          protease inhibitors\n\n  Nelfinavir is one of a new class of AIDS drugs called protease \ninhibitors. The drugs are designed to block an enzyme, called protease, \nthat appears to play a crucial role in the replication of HIV.\n  As the Wall Street Journal reported in its coverage of the recently \nconcluded 11th International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, BC, \nresearchers have evidence that protease inhibitor drugs, when taken in \ncombination with existing therapies, can reduce levels of the AIDS-\ncausing virus in blood to levels so low that the virus is undetectable \nby even the most sensitive tests. AIDS researchers at the conference \ndescribe this new drug therapy as a major and unprecedented step in \ncombating AIDS, one that may represent a treatment approach that may \ndelay the onset of AIDS, extend patients' lives, and transform AIDS \ninto a long-term, manageable disease.\n  Mr. President, HIV/A is a critical public health issue, requiring the \nNation's full attention. In America today, AIDS is the leading cause of \ndeath for young Americans between the ages of 25 and 44.\n  More than 220,700 American men, women and children have died of AIDS \nby the end of 1993. While the number of deaths trails other urgent \nhealth priorities such as cancer or heart disease, AIDS is nearly \nequally debilitating to the Nation when measured by the years of \npotential and productive life lost due to the disease.\n  In my State of California, 1 of every 200 Californians is HIV \npositive, while 1 of every 25 is HIV positive in my home of San \nFrancisco.\n  AIDS is a paramount public health concern and every effort should be \nmade to ensure that drugs are made available as swiftly and at as low a \ncost as possible. We simply cannot delay or waste time in providing \ndrugs, treatments or materials. This tariff legislation represents a \nmodest, but important step.\n\n\n                    zero tariff for pharmaceuticals\n\n  Under the 1994 GATT agreement, most pharmaceutical products are \nentitled to enter the country without a tariff. However, the zero \ntariff does not apply to many new pharmaceutical products or their \nchemical ingredients. As a result, the chemicals needed to make \nnelfinavir mesylate, an AIDS protease inhibitor currently undergoing \nresearch testing, but not yet a recognized pharmaceutical product under \nGATT, would be ineligible for the pharmaceutical zero tariff.\n  During negotiations with World Trade Organization nations to \nimplement the pharmaceutical zero tariff, the administration \nsuccessfully added the chemical compounds needed to manufacture the \nAIDS drug. As a result, the tariff will drop to zero on April 1, 1997.\n  Nelfinavir is on the Food and Drug Administration's fast-track \napproval process for AIDS drugs. Commercial production of the drug will \nbegin well before April 1, in order that the drug can be immediately \navailable to AIDS patients upon FDA approval. Although currently \nimported duty-free for use in clinical research trials, the imported \nchemicals will soon be used for commercial production. During the \nperiod of commercial production prior to April 1, the chemical \ncompounds will face a 12 percent tariff, which will only add to the \ncost and delay the drug's production and distribution to individuals in \nneed.\n  This proposed legislation would eliminate the tariff for two of the \nessential and unique chemical inputs, as well as for the active \ningredient nelfinavir (Acid Chloride, Chloroalcohol and AG 1346), from \nAugust 1 when the drug production increases, until April 1, 1997 when \nthe tariff drops to zero under the WTO pharmaceutical agreement. \nWithout this legislation, the manufacturer would face a 12 percent \ntariff for its chemicals, which are not available in the United States, \nas the drug proceeds into production. This tariff reduction will allow \nfor the acceleration of drug production, providing more timely relief \nfor the public.\n  The Federal Government needs to do everything it can to expedite the \ndevelopment and distribution of AIDS drugs. Without this legislation to \nremove the tariff, we will be tolerating needless hurdles and delay, \nrather than needed relief.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office is reviewing the cost of the proposed \nlegislation. However, because the WTO negotiations will already provide \na zero tariff for the chemical compounds on April 1, the legislation \nmay have a de minimis impact on tariff revenue. For AIDS patients, \ntheir families and those at risk, it's a step Congress should take.\n  I have also requested various Federal agencies and other \norganizations to review the legislation and ensure that other important \nFederal policies, like narcotics enforcement or maintaining a strong, \ndomestic chemical industry, are not undermined. The Drug Enforcement \nAgency and U.S. Customs Service indicate the chemicals present no risk \nfor law enforcement or anti-narcotics enforcement priorities. \nSimilarly, the U.S. Trade Representative's Industry Sector Advisory \nCommittee for chemicals and the International Trade Commission also \nreviewed and approved the administration's efforts to include the \nchemicals in the pharmaceutical appendix negotiations. PhRMA, the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, also has reviewed \nthe proposal and does not oppose the legislation.\n  The administration deserves tremendous credit for extending a zero \ntariff for these chemical components. It is my hope that miscellaneous \ntariff legislation, which is currently pending before the Finance \nCommittee, could accommodate this noncontroversial tariff issue, which \ncan accelerate the development and production of an AIDS drug, with the \npotential to provide meaningful relief.\n  As a matter of public policy, we should do everything we can to \ndevelop AIDS drugs and treatments. Patients and their families cannot \nwait for the next round of drugs to be approved and added to the zero-\ntariff list, scheduled for review in 1999. By importing the chemical \ncompounds without a tariff, we can accelerate the drug development \nprocess.\n  I am pleased to introduce this tariff legislation, along with my \ncolleague Senator Boxer, and will work with the chairman and ranking \nmembers of the Finance Committee to pursue the legislation.\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to modify the \nminimum allocation formula under the Federal-aid highway program, to \nprovide reimbursement to each State with respect to which the highway \nusers in the State paid into the highway trust fund an amount in excess \nof the amount received by the State from the highway trust fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 The Surface Transportation Equity Act\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \non behalf of myself and Senators Faircloth, Hollings, Coats, and Helms, \nto correct one of the most inequitable and unfair policies of our \nGovernment--the Federal aid to highways distribution formulas. \nCurrently, our Federal Aid to Highways Program collects 18.3 cents tax \non each gallon of gasoline. That money is then sent to the Federal \nTreasury where deductions are made for deficit reduction and other \nDepartment of Transportation programs. The remainder is then \napportioned among the States by statutory formulas which is used for \ninfrastructure projects. In 1995, South Carolina received 52 cents for \neach dollar its citizens contributed to the fund. Other States were \nallocated $2 or more for each dollar contributed. This disparity is \ninexcusable.\n  This donor State system was originally devised to build the \nInterstate Highway System. In order to build highways across the vast \nexpanses of the less populated Western States, it was necessary to \nincorporate a system in which some States contribute more than they \nreceive. Next year, the last segment of the Interstate System will be \ncompleted. Subsequently, all our surface transportation priorities will \nthen be local, but the donor/donee system with its unfair formulas will \nstill be in place.\n\n  The statutory formulas are largely based on 1950's population data. \nNeedless to say, there have been great population shifts in this \ncountry since that time. As a result, high-growth States have become \ndesperate to find money to cope with the growing demand for highway \nconstruction and maintenance. Other States, however, are allocated such \nan excess amount that some of their funds go unused. In some cases they \nseek legislation to use the money for more exotic transportation \npurposes. We should not be building roads where people have been--we \nshoud build them where they are or where they are going. The present \nsituation is equivalent to laying railroad tracks behind the train. It \nis inefficient, wasteful, and does not address the transportation needs \nof our Nation.\n  Unlike other programs, our Federal aid highway system was intended to \nbe a user fee system where the gas taxes motorists pay go to maintain \nand improve the roads on which they drive. Unfortunately, the current \nsystem does not work in that manner. For example, when a school teacher \nin Mt. Pleasant, SC, buys gas to commute to her job in Charleston, she \nshould expect that the tax she has paid is going to pay part of the \ncost of replacing the Cooper River Bridge which is in danger of \ncollapse. Instead, 48 cents of each dollar she pays in gas tax goes to \nfinance projects in other States. On the other hand, when a school \nteacher in one of the donee States does the same thing, she receives \nmore than double her money back in road improvements. This is simply \nunfair.\n  The donor States have made tremendous sacrifices to build the \nInterstate System from which we all benefit. They have for years \npostponed addressing critical highway needs at home. The time has come \nfor our national policy to recognize this contribution and address this \nissue fairly.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing is simple. It stipulates \nthat the portion of the Federal highway distribution to a State in each \nyear shall be equal to its percentage of all contributions to the fund. \nIn other words, if South Carolina contributes 1.8 percent of the trust \nfund in a year, it would get back 1.8 percent of whatever amount is \nappropriated out of the fund that year. Further, my bill would \nestablish a 5-year program to bring the historic donor States into \nparity with the rest of the country. After implementation of this bill \nthen we will have a Federal Highway Program that is fair to all.\n  Mr. President, if we are to reauthorize a Federal Highway Program, it \nmust be a fair one. My bill presents a fair and equitable formula for \ndoing this. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, 5 years ago I opposed legislation \nextending our Nation's Highway Program. I did that, not because we do \nnot need highways--they have been a fine investment--but because the \nfunding distribution to States had become so egregiously unfair that it \nthreatened support for any highway program at all. It is interesting to \nnote that today we have proposals in the Congress essentially to follow \nthat logic by repealing most of the program to the States on the basis \nthat the Federal funding pattern is so incredibly wrong. As such, I \nmake the case again today for a fair and rational distribution of \nhighway funds and put the Senate on notice that the distribution must \nchange when the Congress considers highway program revisions next year. \nThe U.S. General Accounting Office has studied highway spending again \nsince the 1991 ISTEA legislation, and reported in November 1995 what \nSenators have long known--a formula that provided South Carolina 52 \ncents this year for a dollar of taxes contributed is unfair and \nuntenable.\n  This is not just a matter of my State receiving less. It is a matter \nof how best to distribute funds for our Nation's highway needs. \nObjective studies have found that our current funding pattern is wrong, \noutdated, and unconnected to highway needs. As the GAO put it, ``the \nStates' funding shares for the four major programs are divorced from \ncurrent conditions,'' and the underlying factors for the two largest \nprograms are ``irrelevant to the highway system's needs.''\n  Particularly, the current distribution to States includes \nsignificant, indirect influences from earlier, unfair funding patterns. \nIt includes postal road factors from the 1921 formula, population data \nfrom the 1980 census, and bridge costs reported from States nearly a \ndecade ago which were wildly disparate. Why should South Carolina have \ngotten $38 per square foot to replace bridges while the District of \nColumbia received $223 per square foot? Why should these amounts be \ngrandfathered into today's allocations?\n  Not only did the GAO declare last year that these formula factors are \n``irrelevant,'' it suggested better factors more than 10 years ago. At \nthat time, the GAO recommended making a transition to a more fair \nformula in a way that did not hurt states that had been receiving a \ngreater than equitable share of highway formulas. But as the GAO \nreported last year, ``However, the Congress elected not to change the \nbasic formula structure.''\n  Mr. President, I voted against ISTEA because of the objective, well-\ndocumented unfairness of the highway formula, and will vigorously \noppose any highway bill next year that does not provide fairness. The \nlegislation we are introducing here today is a good starting point to \nbetter address our Nation's highway needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2023. A bill to provide for travelers' rights in air commerce, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   The Travelers' Rights Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as our open society has evolved, the \nGovernment has consistently, though in varying degrees, had to define \nthe rights of consumers and citizens. In this regard, I introduce today \nthe Travelers' Rights Act. This bill is to expedite access to \ninformation to airline customers and broaden the choices that air \ntravelers have through greater information. Additionally, through the \nVictims Rights Program we call for greater coordination of governmental \nagencies and American Red Cross in providing facts to victims and \nsurvivors of victims.\n  Mr. President, air travel in America is a fundamental of American \ntransportation. I cannot imagine spanning the distances of Nevada, much \nless the Western United States to come back here and represent my State \nwithout the convenience of air travel. Perhaps we take many things \nabout travel for granted; for instance, I do not know nor can I fathom \nthe many details involved in getting a 747, the size of 12 city busses, \ninto the sky. But, Mr. President, I believe that there are some basic \nrights of the half-billion passengers of airlines that need to be \nprotected. I have searched the current statutes and regulations and am \nconfident that the Federal Aviation Administration has many of the \ntools necessary to continue to make our skies safe. I am not convinced, \nhowever, that passengers, are receiving sufficient information about \nthe aircraft and the many involved personnel and accessibility to the \naircraft. Daily, pilots, mechanics, air tower controllers, and others \ndedicate themselves to meeting the needs of air travelers, but still \nthe trust relationship requires some understanding that the FAA \ncertificate requirements are being met by the personnel who serve the \nairline customers.\n  While some may argue that requires a lot of information. I consider \nit to be the nature of the information not the quantity to be \nsignificant, because the traveler on the airlines are putting their \nlives in the airlines' hands and should be allowed the knowledge that \nbestows security, understanding and choice. There is information that \nought to be available and if the customer seeks the information the \nairlines should expeditiously provide it. This bill is not to scare \ntravelers about the safety and security of air travel, rather on the \ncontrary, I believe this bill will inspire confidence through openness \nand knowledge. Additionally, if customers of air travel exercise their \nright to know about certain elements about the airlines, aircraft and \ncrew then that too will enhance the trust between customers and the \nairlines.\n  The second principle element of the bill is the Victims Rights \nProgram, which is essential in alleviating some of the criticism of the \nairlines and restoring the confidence of airline customers. Increased \ncoordination of the agencies and the American Red Cross in opening up \ncommunication between the investigating parties and the victims, \nappears to me, to be the least that we can do and an essential right of \nthose who place their trust in air travel.\n  This legislation is vital in making sure that these fundamental \nrights of information and knowledge are preserved. As airplane \naccidents occur and the airplanes are sabotaged, the sense of security \nthat airplane passengers have paid for is undermined. This bill does \nnot try to second guess the Federal Aviation Administration and the \ninspector general in safety investigations and security methods, \nbecause they have been given both the mission and the means of working \nwith the airlines.\n\n  Mr. President, last May a ValuJet DC-9 crashed into a Florida swamp, \nand before that in December an American Airlines aircraft flew into a \nSouth American mountainside. Then over 200 individuals died off the \ncoast of New York and the Federal authorities have still not identified \nall the victims. Indeed, I have heard repeatedly that the survivors of \nvictims cannot get information from the airlines and the National \nTransportation Safety Board and FBI. I believe that in the past couple \nof years, air travel have suffered terrible accidents and the American \npublic who travel by air do not seem to get any more consideration, as \nfar as information and education are concerned.\n  We do hear, Mr. President, that security might be enhanced at the \nairports,\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nand that more screening of passengers might take place at airplane \nboarding and other draconian measures are being considered. Those \nissues need tremendous study and intensive deliberation of classified \ninformation among those who have the expertise. This bill focuses on \nthe prerogatives of the traveler and through access of information the \nchoices of the traveler expand and trust is preserved.\n  I urge my colleagues to act quickly on this legislation so that this \nfundamental way of travel is not undermined by the airline industry's \nown protective silence and guarded communication. When unfortunate \naccidents or harm occurs, trust is best established by allowing the \nvictims open access. Through this legislation the rights of travelers \nwill be firmly preserved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2024. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide a \none-stop shopping information service for individuals with serious or \nlife-threatening diseases; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n         The one-stop shopping information service act of 1996\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce a vital piece of \nlegislation which will help people with serious or life-threatening \ndiseases obtain the information they desperately need about clinical \ntrials. Easy access to this information is critical, because clinical \ntrials provide cancer patients with potentially promising treatments \nwhich are otherwise unavailable and which may be on the cutting edge of \nmedical research.\n  In June of this year, I convened an important hearing with my \ncolleagues, Senators Connie Mack and Dianne Feinstein, Cochairs of the \nSenate Cancer Coalition, to address recent developments in breast \ncancer treatments and research. We convened our hearing on the eve of \nthe Seventh Annual National Race for the Cure, a race that raises \nmillions of dollars each year for breast cancer research and education \nefforts.\n  During the hearing, we heard testimony from breast cancer advocates \non the difficulty patients and physicians face in learning about \nongoing clinical trials. One witness, representing Breast Cancer Action \nin California, testified about the need for ``One Stop Shopping'' to \nfind out what is available in terms of clinical trials for cancer \ntreatments. She testified that the existing Cancer Information Service \nat the National Cancer Institute is helpful but underfunded, and \nprovides only partial information because it lists only publicly funded \ntrials. It does not list, however, the 300-plus clinical trials of \nprivate pharmaceutical companies, producing a major knowledge gap.\n  This witness contrasted this difficulty faced by cancer patients with \nthe ease with which AIDS patients obtain information about clinical \ntrials. As the result of a 1988 amendment to the Public Health Service \nAct, AIDS patients need only dial a 1-800 number in order to obtain \ninformation about all clinical trials--both Government financed and \nprivate pharmaceutical trials. If you have cancer or some other life-\nthreatening illness, however, you must rely upon your doctor's \nknowledge about clinical trials, which is likely to be limited. \nMoreover, information contained on commercial databases are costly to \naccess, difficult to use or understand, and often incomplete.\n  Since this hearing, I have heard similar complaints not only from \ncancer patients, but from patients suffering from a wide range of \nsevere or life-threatening illnesses. Today, I rise to introduce \nlegislation to rectify this knowledge gap.\n  My bill is based closely on the existing language in the Public \nHealth Service Act which created the AIDS database and which has been \nso successful in making information about AIDS clinical trials \navailable to those who need it. Modeled on that language, my bill \nestablishes a data bank of information on clinical trials and \nexperimental treatments for all serious or life-threatening illnesses. \nThe one stop shopping information service will include a registry of \nall private and public clinical trials, and will contain information \ndescribing the purpose of the trial, eligibility criteria for \nparticipating in the trial, as well as the location of the trial. The \nbill also requires HHS to set up information systems, including a toll-\nfree number, for patients, doctors, and others to access this critical \ninformation. The database will also include information on the results \nof experimental trials, enabling patients to make fully informed \ndecisions about medical treatment.\n\n  Imagine facing a deadly disease and not having access to information \nabout the latest treatment options. Imagine enduring great pain and not \nhaving access to a centralized source of information about existing \nclinical trials which may relieve your suffering or extend your life. \nImagine the arduous effort needed to gather information about these \nclinical trials in order to potentially benefit from cutting-edge \ntreatments.\n  Then consider what this legislation will do for Americans. People \nwith cancer, Alzheimers' disease, Parkinsons, cystic fibrosis, advanced \nheart disease, multiple sclerosis, or any other serious disease will be \nable to dial a 1-800 number from their home phone and access the \ninformation they need about clinical trials underway across the Nation. \nThey will also be able to obtain information about the results of \nexperimental trials, helping them to make treatment decisions.\n  All parties will benefit from this legislation. First and foremost, \nit encourages patient choice and informed decisions. But pharmaceutical \ncompanies will also benefit, because this legislation will allow for \neasier and quicker recruitment of individuals willing to participate in \nexperimental trials, expediting the approval process for \ninvestigational new drugs. And the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Food and Drug Administration will be better able to serve the \npublic.\n  This one-stop shopping service will provide hope to countless \nAmericans. But most importantly, it will help to save lives and reduce \nthe suffering of Americans who are stricken by serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses. We know from experience that this language \nworks. I call for the speedy enactment of this legislation which will \nbe of enormous benefit to countless Americans in times of extraordinary \nneed, and I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, with Senator Snowe, I am \nintroducing a bill to set up a toll-free service so that people with \nlife-threatening diseases can find out about research projects that \nmight help them.\n  Today there are thousands of serious and life-threatening diseases, \ndiseases for which we have no cure. For genetic diseases alone, there \nare 3,000 to 4,000. Some of these are familiar, like cancer, \nParkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Others are not so common, \nlike cystinosis, Tay-Sachs disease, Wilson's disease, and Sjogren's \nsyndrome. Indeed, there are over 5,000 rare diseases, diseases most of \nus have never heard of, affecting between 10 and 20 million Americans.\n  Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. Diabetes afflicts 15 \nmillion Americans per year, half of whom do not know they have it. \nArthritis affects 40 million Americans every year. 15,000 American \nchildren die every year. Among children, the rates of chronic \nrespiratory diseases--asthma, bronchitis, and sinusitis--heart murmurs, \nmigraine headaches, anemia, epilepsy, and diabetes are increasing. Few \nfamilies escape illness today.\n\n\n                                The Bill\n\n  The bill we introduce requires the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to establish a ``one-stop shopping'' database, including a \ntoll-free telephone number, so that patients and physicians can find \nout what clinical research trials are underway on experimental \ntreatments for various diseases. Callers would be able to learn the \npurpose of the study, eligibility requirements, research sites, and a \ncontact person for the research project. Information would have to be \npresented in plain English, not medicalese, so that the average person \ncould understand it.\n\n\n                        A Constituent Suggestion\n\n  The suggestion for this information center came from Nancy Evans, of \nSan Francisco's Breast Cancer Action, in a June 13 hearing of the \nSenate Cancer Coalition, which I cochair with Senator Mack. She \ndescribed the difficulty that patients have in trying to find out\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\nwhat experimental treatments might be available, research trials \nsponsored by the Federal Government, and by private companies. Most of \nthem are desperate; most have tried everything. She testified that the \nNational Cancer Institute has established 1-800-4-CANCER, but their \ninformation is incomplete. It does not include all trials and the \ninformation is often difficult for the lay person to understand.\n  In addition, the National Kidney Cancer Association has called for a \ncentral database.\n\n\n                         People in Serious Need\n\n  To understand the importance of this bill, we have to stop and think \nabout the plight of the individuals it is intended to help. These are \npeople who have a terminal illness, whose physicians have tried every \ntreatment they can find. Cancer patients, for example, have probably \nhad several rounds of chemotherapy, which has left them debilitated, \nvirtually lifeless. These patients cling to slim hopes. They are \ndesperate to try anything. But step one is finding out what is \navailable.\n  One survey found that a majority of patients and families are willing \nto use investigational drugs--drugs being researched but not approved--\nbut find it difficult to locate information on research projects. A \nsimilar survey of physicians found that 42 percent of physicians are \nunable to find printed information about rare illnesses.\n\n\n                          Help for Physicians\n\n  Physicians, no matter how competent and well trained, also do not \nnecessarily know about experimental treatments currently being \nresearched. And most Americans do not have sophisticated computer \nhookups that provide them instant access to the latest information \nthrough commercial, government, or medical databases. Our witness, \nNancy Evans, testified that she can find out more about a company's \nclinical trials by calling her stockbroker than by calling existing \nservices.\n  I have had many desperate families call me, their U.S. Senator, \nseeking help. Others have lodged their pleas at the White House. Others \ncall lawyers, 911, the local medical society, the local chamber of \ncommerce, anything they can think of. Getting information on health \nresearch projects should not require a fishing expedition of futile \ncalls, good connections, or the involvement of elected officials.\n  In 1988, Congress directed HHS to establish an AIDS Clinical Trials \nInformation Service. It is now operational, 1-800-TRIALS-A, so that \npatients, providers, and their families can find out more about AIDS \nclinical trials. All calls are confidential and experienced \nprofessionals at the service can tell people about research trials \nunderway which are evaluating experimental drugs and other therapies at \nall stages of HIV infection.\n\n\n                       Improving Health, Research\n\n  Facilitating access to information can also strengthen our health \nresearch effort. With a national database enabling people to find \nresearch trials, more people could be available to participate in \nresearch. This can help researchers broaden their pool of research \nparticipants.\n\n\n                        Modest Help for the Ill\n\n  The bill we introduce does not guarantee that anyone can participate \nin a clinical research trial. Researchers would still control who \nparticipates and set the requirements for the research. But for people \nwho cling to hopes for a cure, for people who want to live longer, for \npeople who want to feel better, this database can offer a little help.\n  It should not take political or other connections, computer \nsophistication or access to top-flight university medical schools to \nfind out about research on treatments of disease when you have a life-\nthreatening illness.\n  Mr. President, I hope this bill will offer some hope to the millions \nwho are suffering today and I hope Congress will act on the bill \npromptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2025. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to authorize \nthe States to regulate interference with radio frequencies; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              cb radio frequency interference legislation\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich creates a commonsense solution to a growing problem in U.S. \ncities and towns--the Federal preemption of State and municipal \nregulation of citizens band [CB] radio frequency interference with \nresidential home electronic or telephone equipment. This problem can be \nextremely distressing for residents who cannot have a telephone \nconversation or watch television without being interrupted by a \nneighbor's citizen band radio [CB] conversation. Under the current law, \nthose residents have little recourse.\n  Interference of CB radio signals with household electronic equipment \nsuch as telephones, radios, and televisions has been regulated by the \nFederal Communications Commission [FCC] for nearly 30 years. Up until \nrecently, the FCC has enforced rules outlining what equipment may or \nmay not be used for CB radio transmissions, what content may or may not \nbe transmitted, how long transmissions may be broadcast, what channels \nmay be used, as well as many other technical details. FCC also \ninvestigated complaints that a personal radio enthusiast's \ntransmissions interfered with a neighbor's use of home electronic and \ntelephone equipment. FCC receives nearly 45,000 such complaints \nannually.\n  Mr. President, for the past 3 years I have worked with constituents \nwho have been bothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio \ntransmissions. In each case, the constituents have sought my help in \nsecuring an FCC investigation of the complaint. In each case, Mr. \nPresident, the FCC indicated that due to a lack of resources, the \nCommission no longer investigates radio frequency interference \ncomplaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the FCC is able \nto provide only a packet of self-help information for the consumer to \nlimit the interference on their own.\n  Municipal residents, after being denied investigative or enforcement \nassistance from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town \ngovernment and ask them to police the interference. However, the \nCommunications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal \nGovernment for the regulation of radio, preempting municipal ordinances \nor State laws regulating radio frequency interference. This has created \nan interesting dilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass \ntheir own ordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they \nrely on the agency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to \nenforce the very Federal law which preempts them.\n  In Beloit, WI, as in many Wisconsin communities, this dilemma has \nbeen extremely frustrating for local residents who have been powerless \nto prevent the transmissions of a neighboring CB enthusiast from \ninterfering with their home electronic equipment. One Beloit resident, \nafter having adopted every form of filtering technology for her \ntelephone and other electronic equipment, still experienced persistent \ninterference. Her answering machine picks up calls for which there is \nno audible ring, and at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot \nget a dial tone when she or her family members wish to place an \noutgoing call. During telephone conversations, the content of the \nnearby CB transmission can frequently be heard and on occasion, her \nphone conversations are inexplicably cur off. Her neighbors have \nexperienced similar problems and have complained to the Beloit City \nCouncil.\n  Last month, the Beloit City Council, exasperated by FCC inaction on \nthis matter, passed an ordinance allowing the city to enforce FCC \nregulations on this type of inference. While the council knew that, if \nchallenged under current law, their ordinance would likely not be \nupheld by the courts, they felt they had little choice if they wished \nto address their constituents concerns.\n  Mr. President, it is not fair that municipalities and their residents \nshould be hamstrung by an outdated Federal preemption of laws the \nFederal Government no longer has the resources to enforce.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help the city of Beloit, \nand many other municipalities like it, to regulate CB radio \ntransmissions and to enforce those regulations. My bill provides a \nlimited exception to the Federal preemption of State or local laws on \nradio frequency interference. It simply allows State and local \ngovernments\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\nto regulate CB radio interference when that interference results from a \nviolation of FCC rules. Thus, States and municipalities can use their \nenforcement resources to investigate and enforce Federal law thereby \nprotecting the rights of their residents. Even the FCC recognizes that \nStates and localities need to be able to protect their citizens.\n  Mr. President, this bill simply allows common sense to prevail. If \nFederal regulators cannot enforce the rules over which they have \nexclusive jurisdiction, States and localities should be given the \nauthority to investigate and enforce those regulations for them. I hope \nmy colleagues will support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2025\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY OF STATES TO REGULATE RADIO FREQUENCY \n                   INTERFERENCE.\n\n       Section 302 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     302) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       (e) Where radio frequency interference to home electronic \n     equipment is caused by a CB Radio Station through the use of \n     a transmitter or amplifier that is not authorized for use by \n     a CB Radio Station pursuant to Commission rules, the state, \n     county, municipal, or other local government shall not be \n     preempted from exercising its police powers to resolve the \n     interference by prohibiting the use of such unauthorized \n     equipment or by imposing fines or other monetary sanctions. \n     For purposes of this subsection, home electronic equipment \n     includes, but is not limited to, television receivers, radio \n     receivers, stereo components or systems, video cassette \n     recorders, audio recorders, loud speakers, telephone \n     equipment, and other electronic devices normally used in the \n     home. Any action taken by the state, county, municipal, or \n     local government shall not preclude concurrent action by the \n     Commission. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to \n     diminish the Commission's exclusive jurisdiction over radio \n     frequency interference in any matter outside the scope of \n     this subsection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH (for himself, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n        Ashcroft, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Frist, and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 2026. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to make \nuniform the application of the overtime exemption for inside sales \npersonnel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                     overtime exemption legislation\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in 1961, Congress amended the Fair \nLabor Standards Act to provide a narrow overtime exemption for \ncommissioned employees in retail and service establishments. Under \nsection 207(i) of the FLSA, outside commissioned sales employees are \ntreated as professional employees and are thus exempt from the act. In \ncontrast, most commissioned inside sales employees are not treated as \nprofessionals regardless of the similarly of their duties with regard \nto outside sales employees.\n  Despite dramatic changes in the workplace since 1961, the FLSA \ncontinues to subject professional commissioned sales employees to an \noutdated, static view of the economy. Therefore, today I am introducing \nlegislation to extend the limited FLSA exemption to all commissioned \ninside sales personnel. This bill is identical to H.R. 1226 which was \nintroduced by Representative Harris Fawell.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 2027. A bill to provide for a 5-year extension of Hazardous \nSubstance Superfund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               the superfund taxes extension act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto extend the Superfund taxes, which have been in place since 1980.\n  Mr. President, the Superfund program provides for cleaning-up those \ntoxic waste sites that pose the most serious threats to our environment \nand to our health. The program is largely funded by a chemical and oil \nfeedstock tax and by taxes on corporate environmental entities, such as \npetrochemical companies.\n  Mr. President, few of us may be aware of the fact that these taxes \nexpired in December of 1995. Since that time, not one single penny has \nbeen assessed to replenish the Superfund, and so protect our ability to \ncleanup toxic sites in the future.\n  The failure to extend the Superfund tax is causing us to lose $4 \nmillion dollars a day. That is $4 million a day which could be used to \nexpedite the cleanup at existing Superfund sites, or fund the \nrevitalization of additional sites.\n  It has been argued that we have sufficient monies in the Superfund \ntrust fund to carry us for the next few years, although there is \ndisagreement concerning how long the money will last. However, \nSuperfund monies are used for long-term construction projects. By \nutilizing these funds for other purposes, we squander our ability to do \nlong range planning and to continue cleanups without interruption.\n  Mr. President, as someone who spent most of my life as a businessman, \nI recognize the importance of long term planning. And I understand the \nreal costs associated with stopping and restarting a project; it is \nnever efficient or cost effective.\n  Mr. President, I and the citizens of New Jersey, lived through the \nfunding crisis of 1984-1985. The subsequent disruption of cleanups \ncaused unnecessary hardships for the citizens of my state. I don't want \nto go through that again.\n  We need to ensure that we have sufficient financial resources to plan \nfor, contract and continue Superfund cleanups without interruption. \nAfter all, we owe it to our children to do whatever is possible to \npreserve the environment, to protect the public health and to provide \nfor the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE SUPERFUND.\n\n       (a) Extension of Taxes.--\n       (1) The following provisions of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 are each amended by striking ``January 1, 1996'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``January 1, 2001'':\n       (A) Section 59A(e)(1) (relating to application of \n     environmental tax).\n       (B) Paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 4611(e) (relating to \n     application of Hazardous Substance Superfund financing rate).\n       (2) Paragraph (2) of section 4611(e) of such Code is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``1993'' and inserting ``1998'',\n       (B) by striking ``1994'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``1999'', and\n       (C) by striking ``1995'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``2000''.\n       (b) Increase in Aggregate Tax Which May Be Collected.--\n     Paragraph (3) of section 4611(e) of such Code is amended by \n     striking ``$11,970,000,000'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``$22,000,000,000'' and by striking ``December 31, \n     1995'' and inserting ``December 31, 2000''.\n       (c) Extension of Repayment Deadline for Superfund \n     Borrowing.--Subparagraph (B) of section 9507(d)(3) of such \n     Code is amended by striking ``December 31, 1995'' and \n     inserting ``December 31, 2000''.\n       (d) Extension of Trust Fund Purposes.--Subparagraph (A) of \n     section 9507(c)(1) of such Code is amended--\n       (1) by striking clause (i) and inserting the following:\n       ``(i) paragraphs (1), (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and \n     (10) of section 111(a) of CERCLA as in effect on the date of \n     the enactment of the Superfund Reform Act of 1995,'', and\n       (2) by striking clause (iii) and inserting the following:\n       ``(iii) subsections (m), (n), (q), (r), (s), and (t) of \n     section 111 of CERCLA (as so in effect), or''.\n       (e) Extension of Authorization of Appropriations to Trust \n     Fund.--Subsection (b) of section 517 of the Superfund Revenue \n     Act of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 9507 note) is amended by striking \n     ``and'' at the end of paragraph (8), by striking the period \n     at the end of paragraph (9) and inserting a comma, and by \n     adding at the end the following new paragraphs:\n       ``(10) 1996, $250,000,000,\n       ``(11) 1997, $250,000,000,\n       ``(12) 1998, $250,000,000, and\n       ``(13) 1999, $250,000,000,''.\n       (f) Coordination With Other Provisions.--Paragraph (2) of \n     section 9507(e) of the Internal Revenue\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n        Moynihan, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2028. A bill to assist the States and local governments in \nassessing and remediating brownfields and encouraging environmental \ncleanup programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\n         the brownfields and environmental cleanup act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Baucus and \nReid, I am introducing the Brownfields and Environmental Cleanup Act of \n1996. This legislation is designed to foster the cleanup and reuse of \nthousands of lightly contaminated and abandoned properties across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I have long been interested in the issue of abandoned, \nunderutilized and contaminated industrial properties, commonly known as \nbrownfields.\n  For years, decaying industrial plants have defined the skyline and \ncontaminated the land in many of our urban, suburban, and rural areas.\n  Their rusting frames, like aging skyscrapers, are a silent reminder \nof the manufacturers that left, taking jobs--and often hope--with them.\n  Yet, in these fallow fields may lie the seeds of economic \nrevitalization. I continue to feel, as I did when I introduced similar \nlegislation in 1993, that a brownfields' cleanup program can spur \nsignificant economic development and create jobs. Such a cleanup \ninitiative makes good environmental sense, and good business sense.\n  In fact, if one picture is worth a thousand words, then we need only \nlook at a few of the brownfields' success stories in my State of New \nJersey.\n  In Hackensack, the city's department of public works yard, and an \nadjacent oil tank farm, have been redeveloped as a Price Club discount \nstore, complete with riverwalk and park area. The site is now estimated \nto be worth about $15 million dollars, and the project has created 350 \njobs.\n  Near Elizabeth, NJ, a withering brownfield has been converted into a \nthriving IKEA furniture store.\n  The story is the same across the country, where unused, unattractive \nland is being transformed into valuable community assets.\n  A pilot project in Cleveland resulted in $3.2 million in private \ninvestment, a $1 million increase in the local tax base, and more than \n170 new jobs. And in Buffalo, NY, a hydroponic tomato farm was built on \na former Republic Steel site, bringing 300 new jobs to the area.\n  In fact, the potential for job creation is enormous. And every \nrevitalized brownfield may represent a field of dreams to an unemployed \nworker.\n  Mr. President, while fostering jobs, brownfields' cleanup also means \nthat dangerous contaminants are removed from our environment. The \nsubsequent benefit to our--and our children's--health could be \nenormous. Furthermore, the scars of decades of neglected industrial \nwaste, which disfigure our cities and suburbs, may finally be allowed \nto heal.\n  Brownfield initiatives are important, because the Superfund Program \nonly provides for cleaning-up those abandoned waste sites that pose the \nmost serious threats. However, there are over 100,000 brownfields that \ndon't fall under Superfund, because of lower levels of contamination.\n  The risks posed by many of these sites may be relatively low. But \ntheir full economic use is being stymied, because there's no ready \nmechanism for fostering and financing cleanups--even when the property \nowner is ready, willing and eager to do so. In addition, prospective \npurchasers, developers and bankers are reluctant to invest in \nbrownfields because they could be held liable for cleaning up the \ncontamination.\n  This is unfortunate because, as I noted these abandoned or \nunderutilized sites have enormous potential for economic development.\n  To unleash this potential, several States--including New Jersey--have \ndeveloped expedited procedures to clean-up sites that do not pose a \nsignificant threat to public health or the environment.\n  Under these cleanup programs, owners can volunteer to pay for the \ncosts of remediation and State oversight. In return, they get a letter \nfrom the State which assures prospective buyers and lenders that the \nproperty has been cleaned up to the Government's satisfaction, and that \nother parties need not worry about potential liability. This so-called \nclean bill of health removes a major impediment to economic \ndevelopment, and it can help revitalize stagnant local economies.\n  In New Jersey, 550 parties signed up for the State's voluntary \ncleanup program in just the first 18 months of its existence. The \neconomic benefits, in terms of jobs and economic development, are \nundeniable.\n  But if we are to move forward, if we are to foster economic \nrevitalization and economic renewal, if we are to continue this public-\nprivate partnership for progress, then we must remove all major \nroadblocks to brownfields' cleanup and reuse.\n  My legislation addresses the major barriers preventing redevelopment \nof brownfields sites.\n  This bill would provide financial assistance, in the form of grants, \nto local and State governments to evaluate brownfields sites. \nConsequently, interested parties would know what is required to clean \nthe site, and what reuse would best suit the property.\n  My bill would also provide grants to State and local governments to \nestablish and capitalize low-interest loan programs for cleanups. These \nfunds could be lent to current owners, prospective purchasers, and \nmunicipalities.\n  The minimal seed money envisioned by this program would leverage \nsubstantial economic payoffs, and turn lands which may be of negative \nworth into assets for the future.\n  This legislation would also place limits on the potential liability \nof innocent property buyers. So long as purchasers or landowners made \nreasonable inquires, they would be exempt from Superfund liability.\n  The bill also limits the liability of banks and other lending \ninstitutions, which hold title merely as a result of their security \ninterest in the property. As long as they did not participate in the \nmanagement of the site, the institutions could not be held liable.\n  My bill would make similar reforms in the area of fiduciary \nliability, and would limit the liability for those who merely act as \ntrustees or executors.\n  Cleaning up brownfields means a safer environment in the future, and \nmore jobs for places that need them in the present.\n  Mr. President, the introduction of this bill is not a substitute for \na Superfund bill. Throughout this session of Congress, Senators Baucus, \nSmith, Chafee, and I have worked long and hard to try and craft a \nSuperfund bill which we could all agree on and the President could sign \ninto law.\n  However, I am forced to acknowledge that the calendar is against us \nat this point. Consequently, I think it is important to use the time \nremaining to focus on one of the areas where there is general \nconsensus--the desire to facilitate the cleanup and development of \nblighted areas, and to provide the legislative framework to make this \npossible.\n  Interest in fostering the cleanup of brownfields has been bipartisan, \nand it exists in both in our own body and among our colleagues on the \nother side of the Capitol. It also has the strong backing of the EPA, \nand I want to thank Director Carol Browner for her support.\n  Moreover, this bill is largely based on S. 773, which was unanimously \nreported by the Environment and Public Works Committee in the 103d \nCongress, and on the lender, prospective purchaser and innocent \nlandowner provisions in S. 1285 and S. 1834, that was reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee last Congress.\n  Mr. President, as ranking Democratic member of the Superfund \nSubcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am \ncommitted to continuing the quest to reform the Superfund program. But \nI believe that we should move ahead, now, to cleanup thousands of \npriority sites not governed by the Superfund.\n  This is an area where we can--and should--put aside our differences \nand work for a goal which we all embrace.\n  Mr. President, our citizens want progress on both the environmental \nand economic fronts. The Brownfields legislation that I introduce today \nsupports both goals. It creates a vehicle for cleanups which can help \nkeep us on-board for environmental improvement and on-track for \neconomic growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the bill in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\n                                S. 2028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Brownfields and \n     Environmental Cleanup Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) past uses of land in the United States for industrial \n     and commercial purposes have created many sites throughout \n     the United States that have environmental contamination;\n       (2) Congress and the governments of States and political \n     subdivisions of States have enacted laws to--\n       (A) prevent environmental contamination; and\n       (B) carry out response actions to correct past instances of \n     environmental contamination;\n       (3) many sites are minimally contaminated, do not pose \n     serious threats to human health or the environment, and can \n     be satisfactorily remediated expeditiously with little \n     government oversight;\n       (4) promoting the assessment, cleanup and redevelopment of \n     contaminated sites could lead to significant environmental \n     and economic benefits, particularly in any case in which a \n     cleanup can be completed quickly and during a period of time \n     that meets short-term business needs;\n       (5) the private market demand for sites affected by \n     environmental contamination frequently is reduced, often due \n     to uncertainties regarding liability or potential cleanup \n     costs of innocent landowners, lenders, fiduciaries, and \n     prospective purchasers under Federal law:\n       (6) the abandonment or underutilization of affected sites \n     impairs the ability of the Federal Government and the \n     governments of States and political subdivisions of States to \n     provide economic opportunities for the people of the United \n     States, particularly the unemployed and economically \n     disadvantaged;\n       (7) the abandonment or underuse of affected sites also \n     results in the inefficient use of public facilities and \n     services, as well as land and other natural resources, and \n     extends conditions of blight in local communities;\n       (8) cooperation among Federal agencies, departments and \n     agencies of State and political subdivisions of States, local \n     community development organizations, and current owners and \n     prospective purchasers of affected sites is required to \n     accomplish timely response actions and the redevelopment or \n     reuse of affected sites;\n       (9) there is a need for a program to--\n       (A) encourage cleanups of affected sites; and\n       (B) facilitate the establishment and enhancement of \n     programs by States and local governments to foster cleanups \n     of affected site though capitalization of loan programs; and\n       (10) there is a need to provide financial incentives and \n     assistance to characterize certain affected sites and \n     facilitate the cleanup of the sites so that the sites may be \n     redeveloped for beneficial uses.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to create new \n     business and employment opportunities through the economic \n     redevelopment of affected sites that generally do not pose a \n     serious threat to human health or the environment and to \n     stimulate the assessment and cleanup of affected sites by--\n       (1) encouraging States and local governments to provide for \n     characterization and cleanup of sites that may not be \n     remediated under other environmental laws (including \n     regulations) in effect on the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) encouraging local governments and private parties, \n     including local community development organizations, to \n     participate in programs, such as State cleanup programs, that \n     facilitate expedited response actions that are consistent \n     with business needs at affected sites;\n       (3) directing the Administrator to establish programs that \n     provide financial assistance to--\n       (A) facilitate site assessments of certain affected sites;\n       (B) encourage cleanup of appropriate sites through \n     capitalization of loan programs; and\n       (C) encouraging workforce development in areas adversely \n     affected by contaminated properties; and\n       (4) reducing transaction costs and paperwork, and \n     preventing needless duplication of effort and delay at all \n     levels of government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to make permanent certain authority relating to self-\nemployment assistance programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the self-employment reauthorization act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with\n\n[[Page S9573]]\n\nSenator D'Amato to reauthorize the Self-Employment Act. As waves of \neconomic change turn our economy into a high-wire act, the Self-\nEmployment Act has helped turn the unemployment safety net into a \ntrampoline of opportunity for the unemployed. The Self-Employment \nAssistance Program takes an innovative and cost-effective approach to \nhelping eligible dislocated workers become self-sufficient; it enables \nthem to use their weekly unemployment checks to start their own \nbusinesses.\n  Harvard Business School reported earlier this year that from 1978 to \nthe present, 22 percent of the work force, or 3 million workers, at the \ncountry's top 100 companies had been laid off, and that 77 percent of \nall the layoffs involved white-collar workers. Many of these highly \nskilled workers will never be able to return to their former positions, \nbut some are highly motivated to start their own firms. In 40 out of 50 \nStates, however, those who start their own businesses are forced to \ngive up their weekly unemployment compensation checks as soon as the \ncompany starts generating revenue--but before it provides enough income \nto support the worker. It is exactly this problem the Self-Employment \nAssistance Program is designed to correct.\n  In a few short years, the Self-Employment Act (Public Law 103-182; \ntitle V) has already enabled thousands of unemployed Americans to use \ntheir unemployment compensation to establish new businesses. Two \nexperimental programs, in Massachusetts and Washington, have already \nshown that self-employment programs can create jobs at no cost to the \ntaxpayer. Using existing funds, the Massachusetts program created \ndozens of new businesses but actually paid $1,400 less unemployment per \nworker than the State average. The Washington program created more than \n600 new jobs and the firms were paying an average of $10.50 an hour to \nworkers they had hired.\n  The legislation we introduce today reauthorize a program that \nallows--but does not require--State to establish self-employment \nassistance [SEA] programs as part of their unemployment insurance [UI] \nprograms. It permits States to provide income support payments to the \nunemployed in the same weekly amount as the worker's regular \nunemployment insurance [UI] benefits would otherwise be, so that they \nmay work full time on starting their own business instead of searching \nfor traditional wage and salary jobs. In effect, this legislation \nremoves a high hurdle facing those who have the ingenuity, motivation, \nand energy to start their own businesses. It eliminates a barrier in \nthe law that has forced workers interested in self-employment to \nchoose between receiving UI benefits and starting a new business.\n\n  Self-employment assistance has not only proved to be a viable \nreemployment option for unemployed workers; its benefits have exceeded \nits costs as well. While the law is not a panacea for all of our \nNation's unemployed, it's an opportunity for many skilled workers to \nget back to work faster and helps create new jobs as well.\n  In a recent tour around Oregon, my State SEA officials found \ntremendous enthusiasm for this program. They reported to me: ``* * * \nthe SEA Program in Oregon is meeting the goal of providing Oregon \ndislocated workers--as identified through worker profiling--with access \nto entrepreneurial training and financial assistance while pursuing \nself-employment and the establishment of a business.'' Among the \nexamples of businesses developed under the Oregon SEA Program this year \nare a marine maintenance and repair company, drop-in day care centers \nat shopping malls and a handmade hats, quilts, and bags business \nworking to develop a mail-order firm.\n  The 1993 SEA law is based upon self-employment programs that have \nworked well in 17 other industrialized nations. As the author of two \nlaws, in 1987 and 1993, that have promoted self-employment, I can \nattest to the dramatic success of the self-employment concept. \nAccording to a June 1995 Department of Labor [DOL] evaluation of the \nWashington State and Massachusetts pilot programs, the two projects \n``clearly demonstrate that self-employment is a viable reemployment \noption for some unemployed workers . . . about one-half of those \ninterested actually do start a business and an average of two-thirds \nwere still in business 3 years later.'' In addition, the DOL report \nfound that self-employment assistance programs increased business \nstarts among project participants, reduced the length of their \nunemployment periods and increased their total time in employment. Both \nthe Washington and Massachusetts models proved to be cost effective for \nthe participants as well as for taxpayers.\n  Over the past 2\\1/2\\ years, 10 States used the 1993 legislation to \ncreate self-employment programs: California, Connecticut, Delaware, \nMaine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode \nIsland. To date, DOL has approved six State plans--California, \nDelaware, Maine, New Jersey, New York, and Oregon--and four of these--\nDelaware, Maine, New York and Oregon--have actually implemented their \nSEA programs.\n  Let me briefly describe how the program works. The law directs the \nDOL to review and approve State SEA Program plans. In States that \noperate SEA programs, new UI claimants identified through worker \nprofiling--automated systems that use a set of criteria to identify \nthose claimants who are likely to exhaust their UI benefits and need \nreemployment assistance--will be eligible for self-employment \nassistance. State SEA programs provide participants with periodic--\nweekly or biweekly--self-employment allowances while they are getting \ntheir businesses off the ground. These support payments are the same \nweekly amount as the worker's regular UI benefits. The SEA participants \nare required to participate in technical assistance programs--\nentrepreneurial training--accounting, cash flow, finances, taxes, \netc.--business counseling--business plans, marketing, legal \nrequirements, insurance, etc.--and finance--to ensure they have the \nskills necessary to operate a business. Finally, SEA programs are \nrequired to operate at no additional cost to the unemployment trust \nfund: The law stipulates that the payment of SEA allowances may not \nresult in any additional benefits charges to the unemployment trust \nfund. Individuals may choose at any time to opt out of the SEA Program; \nthey may resume collection of regular unemployment compensation until \nthe total amount of regular unemployment compensation paid and the SEA \npaid equals the maximum benefit amount. States are responsible for the \ncosts of providing basic SEA Program services, like business counseling \nand technical assistance, but may allow participants to pay for more \nintensive counseling and technical assistance.\n\n  Mr. President, as we move into the global economy of the 21st \ncentury, it is imperative that the Government adopt fresh strategies so \nthat our many skilled buy unemployed workers can start anew in the \nprivate sector. Congress should extend the Self-Employment Assistance \nProgram so that States will have the continued flexibility to help \nunemployed workers create their own businesses. Our bipartisan bill \npromotes the spirit of entrepreneurship. It carries forward a \nreasonable, and sensible reform of the unemployment insurance system \nthat bears no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I would like to thank Senator D'Amato for joining me as an original \ncosponsor of this bill. New York has a very active and successful Self \nEmployment Assistance Program, and I look forward to working closely \nwith him to see this important program reauthorized.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish nationally uniform requirements \nregarding the titling and registration of salvage, nonrepairable, and \nrebuilt vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n    the national motor vehicle safety, antitheft, title reform, and \n                    consumer protection act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nestablish national requirements regarding the titling and registration \nof salvage, nonrepairable and rebuilt vehicles. I am proud to have \nSenator Exon as my principle cosponsor on this bipartisan bill. Senator \nExon has done yeoman's work in previous Congresses to address this \nissue.\n  Several years ago, Congress formed a group to study this issue. My \nbill responds to the recommendations made by that Federal task force \nregarding the disclosure of vehicle conditions. This consumer safety \nbill will protect used car consumers from unknowingly purchasing \nrebuilt automobiles that have not been restored to safe operating \nconditions. The legislation requires the vehicle title to be branded to \nshow that it has been totaled.\n  This legislation would create a uniform national policy concerning \nthe disclosure of vehicle conditions. Forty-eight States require some \nsort of disclosure on the vehicle title. Insistency among these States, \nhowever, permits those unscrupulous few to take advantage of \nunsuspecting consumers.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me as cosponsors of this \nlegislation, which addresses this consumer safety issue in a direct and \nstraightforward manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Motor Vehicle \n     Safety, Antitheft, Title Reform, and Consumer Protection Act \n     of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) many States do not have specific requirements regarding \n     the disclosure of the salvage history of a motor vehicle and \n     some States never require that the title to a motor vehicle \n     be stamped or branded to indicate that the motor vehicle is, \n     or has been, a salvage vehicle;\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, State \n     disclosure requirements regarding the salvage history of a \n     motor vehicle--\n       (A) are inconsistent in scope and content;\n       (B) require the use of different forms and administrative \n     procedures;\n       (C) will undercut the effectiveness of the National \n     Automobile Title Information System created by the Anti Car \n     Theft Act of 1992;\n       (D) are burdensome on interstate commerce; and\n       (E) do not provide a significant deterrent to unscrupulous \n     sellers of rebuilt vehicles who mislead potential wholesale \n     and retail buyers concerning the condition and value of such \n     vehicles;\n       (3) the fact that a motor vehicle is salvage, \n     nonrepairable, water damaged, or rebuilt after incurring \n     substantial damage is material in any subsequent purchase or \n     sale of that motor vehicle;\n       (4) some salvage and nonrepairable vehicles become involved \n     in illegal commerce in stolen vehicles and parts;\n       (5) in some jurisdictions, the lack of theft inspections \n     prior to allowing a rebuilt motor vehicle back on the road \n     provides an opportunity for an unscrupulous person to use \n     stolen parts in the rebuilding of motor vehicles;\n       (6) according to the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, rebuilt motor vehicles--\n       (A) may not have passed any safety inspection; and\n       (B) may pose a public safety risk and consumers who \n     unknowingly buy rebuilt motor vehicles face an increased risk \n     of death or serious injury;\n       (7) statistics prepared by the American Association of \n     Motor Vehicle Administrators indicate that 71 percent of the \n     States require some form of safety inspection before a \n     rebuilt salvage vehicle may be registered for use on the \n     road;\n       (8) the promulgation of a safety inspection program by the \n     Secretary of Transportation may assist the States in \n     expanding and standardizing their inspection programs for \n     rebuilt vehicles;\n       (9) duplicate or replacement titles play an important role \n     in many vehicle thefts and various types of vehicle fraud;\n       (10) State controls on the issuance of such titles must \n     therefore be strengthened and made uniform across the United \n     States;\n       (11) large quantities of motor vehicles are exported from \n     United States ports to foreign countries without proper \n     documentation of ownership in violation of applicable law; \n     and\n       (12) in view of the threats to public safety and consumer \n     interests described in paragraphs (1) through (10), the Motor \n     Vehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee, \n     which was convened by the Secretary of Transportation under \n     section 140(a) of the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (15 U.S.C. \n     2041 note), recommended that--\n       (A) Federal laws be enacted to require certain definitions \n     to be used nationwide to describe seriously damaged vehicles; \n     and\n       (B) all States be required to--\n       (i) use the definitions referred to in subparagraph (A) in \n     determining appropriate title designations;\n       (ii) use certain motor vehicle titling and control methods; \n     and\n       (iii) take certain other measures to protect the integrity \n     of the titling process.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate a portion of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \nConcord Rivers as a component of the National Wild And Scenic Rivers \nSystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n      THE SUDBURY, ASSABET, AND CONCORD WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, in introducing the Sudbury, Assabet, \nand Concord [SuAsCo] Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This is the companion \nbill to H.R. 3405, sponsored by Representatives Meehan, Markey, and \nTorkildsen.\n  The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord river area is rich in history and \nliterary significance. It has been the location of many historical \nevents, most notably the Battle of Concord in the Revolutionary War, \nthat gave our great Nation its independence. The Concord River flows \nunder the North Bridge in Concord, MA, where, on April 18, 1775, \ncolonial farmers fired the legendary ``shot heard around the world'' \nwhich signaled the start of the Revolutionary War.\n  In later years, this scenic area was also home to many of our \nliterary heroes including, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, \nand Louisa May Alcott. Their writing often focused on the bucolic \nrivers. Thoreau spent most of his life in Concord, MA, where he passed \nhis days immersed in his writing and enjoying the natural surroundings. \nHe spoke of the Concord River when he wrote ``the wild river valley and \nthe woods were bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked \nthe dead, if they had been slumbering in their graves, as some suppose. \nThere needs no strong proof of immortality.'' This area was held close \nto many an author's heart. It was a place of relaxation and inspiration \nfor many.\n  The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild Rivers Act would amend the \nWild and Scenic Rivers Act to include a 29 mile segment of the Assabet, \nConcord, and Sudbury Rivers. Based on a report authorized by Congress \nin 1990 and issued by the National Park Service in 1995, these river \nsegments were determined worthy of inclusion in the Wild and Scenic \nRivers Program. In its report, the SuAsCo Wild and Scenic Study \nCommittee showed that this area has not only the necessary scenic, \nrecreational, and ecological value, but also the historical and \nliterary value to merit the Wild and Scenic River designation. All \neight communities in the area traversed by these river segments are \nsupporting his important legislation.\n  Our legislation is of minimal cost to the Federal Government but by \nusing limited Federal resources we can leverage significant local and \nState effort. Provisions in the bill limit the Federal Government's \ncontribution to just $100,000 annually, with no more than a 50 percent \nshare of any given activity. This is a concept that merits the support \nof Congress. Should our bill become law, the SuAsCo River stewardship \ncouncil, in cooperation with Federal, State, and local governments \nwould manage the land.\n  We now have the opportunity to protect the precious 29-mile section \nof the Assabet, Sudbury, and Concord Rivers. This area is not only rich \nin ecological value but also in historical and literary value. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill and through it to preserve this wild \nriver valley for the enjoyment and instruction of all who live and work \nthere, for visitors from throughout the nation and, perhaps most \nimportantly, for generations yet to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2032\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sudbury, Assabet and Concord \n     Wild and Scenic Rivers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Title VII of Public Law 101-628--\n       (A) designated segments of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \n     Concord Rivers in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, totaling \n     29 river miles, for study of potential addition to the \n     National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and\n       (B) directed the Secretary of the Interior to establish the \n     Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord River Study Committee (in this \n     Act referred to as the ``Study Committee'') to advise the \n     Secretary of the Interior in conducting the study and \n     concerning management alternatives should the river be \n     included in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.\n       (2) The study determined that:\n       --the 16.6 mile segment of the Sudbury River beginning at \n     the Danforth Street Bridge in the Town of Framingham, to its \n     confluence with the Assabet River\n       --the 4.4 mile segment of the Assabet River from 1000 feet \n     downstream from the Damon Mill Dam in the Town of Concord to \n     the confluence with the Sudbury River at Egg Rock in Concord, \n     and\n       --the 8 mile segment of the Concord River from Egg Rock at \n     the confluence of the Sudbury and Assabet Rivers to the Route \n     3 Bridge in the Town of Billerica\n\n     are eligible for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \n     Rivers System based upon their free-flowing condition and \n     outstanding scenic, recreation, wildlife, literary, and \n     historic values.\n       (3) The towns that directly abut the segments, including \n     Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Lincoln, Concord, Bedford, \n     Carlisle, and Billerica, Massachusetts, have each\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\n     demonstrated their desire for National Wild and Scenic River \n     Designation through town meeting votes endorsing designation.\n       (4) During the study, the Study Committee and the National \n     Park Service prepared a comprehensive management plan for the \n     segments, entitled ``Sudbury, Assabet and Concord wild and \n     Scenic River Study, River Management Plan'', dated March 16, \n     1995, which establishes objectives, standards, and action \n     programs that will ensure long-term protection of the rivers' \n     outstanding values and compatible management of their land \n     and water resources.\n       (5) The river management plan does not call for federal \n     land acquisition for Wild and Scenic River purposes and \n     relies upon state, local and private entities to have the \n     primary responsibility for ownership and management of the \n     Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Wild and Scenic River resources.\n       (6) The Study Committee voted unanimously on February 23, \n     1995, to recommend that the Congress include these segments \n     in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System for management \n     in accordance with the River Conservation Plan.\n\n     SEC. 3. WILD, SCENIC, AND RECREATIONAL RIVER DESIGNATION.\n\n       Section 3(a) of the *Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1274(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(  ) Sudbury, Assabet and Concord Rivers, \n     Massachusetts.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The 29 miles of river segments in \n     Massachusetts consisting of the Sudbury River from the \n     Danforth Street Bridge in Framingham downstream to its \n     confluence with the Assabet River at Egg Rock; the Assabet \n     River from a point 1,000 feet downstream of the Damondale Dam \n     in Concord to its confluence with the Sudbury River at Egg \n     Rock; and the Concord River from its origin at Egg Rock in \n     Concord downstream to the route 3 bridge in Billerica (in \n     this paragraph referred to as `segments'), as scenic and \n     recreational river segments. The segments shall be \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior through \n     cooperative agreements between the Secretary of the Interior \n     and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its relevant \n     political subdivisions (including the Towns of Framingham, \n     Wayland, Sudbury, Lincoln, Concord Carlisle, Bedford, and \n     Billerica) pursuant to Section 10(e) of this Act.

FUNDING AUTHORIZATION.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     the Interior to carry out the purposes of this Act no more \n     than $100,000 for each fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Kerry \ntoday in sponsoring legislation to designate a 29-mile segment of the \nSudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts as a component of \nthe National Wild and Scenic Rivers system. Our proposal has the \nbipartisan support of Congressmen Martin T. Meehan, Peter G. \nTorkildsen, and Edward J. Markey, who introduced an identical bill in \nthe House of Representatives on May 7, 1996.\n  The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers have witnessed many \nimportant events in the Nation's history. Stone's Bridge and Four \nArched Bridge over the Sudbury River date from the pre-Revolutionary \nWar days. On Old North Bridge over the Concord River, the ``shot heard \n'round the world'' was fired on April 19, 1775, to begin the \nRevolutionary War. At Lexington and Concord, the Colonists began their \narmed resistance against British rule, and the first American \nRevolutionary War soldiers fell in battle.\n  In the 19 century, the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers earned \ntheir lasting fame in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel \nHawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau, all of whom lived in this area and \nspent a great deal of time on the rivers. Emerson cherished the Concord \nRiver as a place to leave ``the world of villages and personalities \nbehind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight.''\n  Hawthorne wrote ``The Scarlet Letter'' and ``Mosses from an Old \nManse'' in an upstairs study overlooking the Concord River. He also \nenjoyed boating on the Assabet River, of which he said that ``a more \nlovely stream than this, for a mile above its junction with the \nConcord, has never flowed on earth.''\n  Thoreau delighted in long, solitary walks along the banks of the \nrivers amidst the ``straggling pines, shrub oaks, grape vines, ivy, \nbats, fireflies, and alders,'' contemplating humanity's relationship to \nnature. His journals describing his detailed observations of the flora \nand fauna in the area have inspired poets and naturalists to the \npresent day, and helped to give birth to the modern environmental \nmovement. By protecting the rivers, a future Thoreau, Emerson, or \nHawthorne may one day walk along their shores and gain new inspiration \nfrom these priceless natural resources.\n  In 1990, Congress authorized the National Park Service to issue a \nreport to determine whether the three rivers are eligible for \ndesignation as Wild and Scenic Rivers. Under the National Park \nService's guidelines, a river is considered eligible for the \ndesignation if it possesses at least one ``outstandingly remarkable \nresource value.'' In fact, the three rivers were found to possess five \noutstanding resource values--scenic, recreational, ecological, \nhistorical, and literary. The report also concluded that the rivers are \nsuitable for designation based upon the existing local protection of \ntheir resources and the strong local support for their preservation.\n  Our bill will protect a 29-mile segment of the Sudbury, Assabet, and \nConcord Rivers that runs through or along the borders of eight \nMassachusetts towns--Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Concord, Lincoln, \nBedford, Carlisle, and Billerica. A River Stewardship Council will be \nestablished to coordinate the efforts of all levels of government to \nstrengthen protections for the river and address future threats to the \nenvironment. The legislation\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\nalso requires at least a one-to-one non-Federal match for any Federal \nexpenditures, and contains provisions which preclude federal takings of \nprivate lands.\n  Thoreau wrote in 1847 that rivers ``are the constant lure, when they \nflow by our doors, to distant enterprise and adventure. . . . They are \nthe natural highways of all nations, not only leveling the ground and \nremoving obstacles, from the path of the traveler, but conducting him \nthrough the most interesting scenery.'' Standing on the banks of the \nSudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, as Thoreau often did, citizens \ntoday gain a greater sense of the ebb and flow of the nation's history \nand enjoy the benefit of some of the most beautiful scenery in all of \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that \nthese three proud rivers will be protected for the enjoyment and \ncontemplation of future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Simpson, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Warner, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mrs. Kassebaum, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Burns, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 2031. A bill to provide health plan protections for individuals \nwith a mental illness; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  THE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I regret that it was not possible to \nretain this eminently fair and simple compromise in the conference \nagreement on health insurance reform.\n  Though this attempt to create fundamental fairness for the mentally \nill was not completed, this issue will not go away.\n  The Americans who would have been helped by our compromise will not \ngo away.\n  Nor will I.\n  As long as I am in this body, I will continue to fight to end \ndiscrimination against Americans with a mental illness.\n  I am therefore introducing the compromise I offered the conference \ncommittee as a free-standing bill.\n  The measure I am introducing today with the support and cosponsorship \nof Senators Wellstone, Warner, Specter, Reid, Simpson, and Conrad, is a \nvast departure from what the Senate originally passed during \nconsideration of health insurance reform legislation.\n  The Senate passed full parity for mental illness--full parity means \nthat mental illnesses are treated as equals to physical illnesses in \nall respects of health coverage--copays, deductibles, inpatient \nhospital days, outpatient visits, out-of-pocket protections, and \noverall lifetime and annual expenditure limits.\n  The measure I present today, however, covers parity only for lifetime \nand annual caps.\n  I would very much like to introduce the Senate-passed measure \nproviding full parity, or perhaps even something more than I am now.\n  But in the interests of time, simplicity, and underlying, basic \nfairness, I believe this measure is a necessary step toward making \nhealth coverage equitable for all Americans, regardless of the nature \nof their illness.\n  I believe this measure provides the fundamentals upon which better \nunderstanding and treatment can be built, and I believe the Senate \nshould not miss this opportunity to do the right thing and end \ndiscrimination against Americans suffering from a mental illness.\n\n\n                               What it is\n\n  Let me again tell you what this bill will and will not do.\n  This bill simply states that health plans wishing to offer a mental \nhealth benefit--this is their option, there is nothing in this \nprovisions saying that they must offer any mental health benefits at \nall--if they choose to offer a mental health benefit, they must provide \nthe same overall financial protection to people with a mental illness \nthat they provide to people with a physical illness.\n  If they have a $1 million lifetime limit for someone with cancer, or \ndiabetes, or heart disease, they cannot have a lifetime limit of \n$50,000 for someone with schizophrenia or manic depression--they must \nprovide $1 million for the person with a mental illness.\n  They do not have to create another, separate $1 million for mental \nillness--they can include these treatments in their overall cap if they \nlike.\n  But they cannot impost a separate, lower overall limit for mental \nillness.\n  This same arrangement applies to annual financial caps, as well.\n  Since this compromise provides equal catastrophic protections, it \nprotects Americans with the most severe and debilitating forms of \nmental illness.\n  It does not apply to the constellation of disorders and problems that \nconcern some of my colleagues such as marital problems, or behavioral \nproblems, or maladjustments.\n\n\n                             WHAT IT IS NOT\n\n  It should be made clear what this bill does not do.\n  This bill does not mandate mental health benefits;\n  It does not include substance abuse or chemical dependency;\n  It does not dictate what a plan can or must charge for services--\nwhether they be copays, deductibles, out-of-pocket limits, and so \nforth;\n  It does not set or dictate how many inpatient hospital days or \noutpatient visits must be provided or covered.\n  It does not, in any way, restrict a health plan's ability to manage \ncare, such as preadmission screening, preauthorization of services, \nlimiting coverage based on medical necessity, and so forth.\n  It does not apply to employers of 25 or less.\n\n\n                           WHAT IT WILL COST\n\n  According to the CBO, this bill will not cost much. Frankly, I \nbelieve that even their cost estimates, even though practically \ninconsequential, are too high.\n  CBO says this bill will cause a 0.4-percent increase in overall \npremiums, ultimately resulting in a 0.16-percent increase in employer \ncontributions to employee health plans.\n  Even though these costs are small--in a typical plan, a $0.60 to \n$0.67 increase per member per month--these projections are based on an \nassumption of increased utilization.\n  This estimate does not even factor in the effects of managed care.\n  We all know how managed care arrangements affect utilization and \noverall health care spending.\n  Of the 99 percent of ERISA plans offering mental health benefits, 75 \npercent already provide this care through a managed care arrangement--\nthis number is growing each day.\n  If managed care were included in these assumptions, this provision \nwould not likely cost anything at all.\n  And the percentage of Americans ever reaching these new limits will \nbe incredibly small--less than 5 percent of beneficiaries.\n  So you can see why I do not believe this bill will cost even the \nsmall amount predicted by CBO.\n\n\n       experiences of states that have already implemented parity\n\n  Some of my colleagues might be skeptical of these claims\n  Let me just outline the experiences of a few States that have already \nimplemented parity.\n  Texas--Full parity and chemical dependency benefits for State and \nlocal government employees, including all school districts and \nuniversity employees (over 230,000 lives)--a 47.9-percent reduction in \noverall yearly mental health expenditures.\n  Maryland--Full parity for all State-regulated plans--(over 400,000 \ncovered lives)--an increase in cost of 0.6 percent per member per month \n[PMPM].\n  Rhode Island--Full parity for severe illnesses and chemical \ndependency--an increase in cost of 0.33 percent PMPM.\n  Massachusetts--Full parity for severe illnesses--a 5-percent increase \nin utilization, but a 22-percent reduction in mental health \nexpenditures.\n  These numbers are for parity in the general sense, not the very \nlimited balance included in the measure I am introducing today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2031\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the DOE Reports \nElimination and Streamlining Act of 1996, to implement a number of \nrecommendations that have been received from the administration for the \nrepeal of requirements for unnecessary or obsolete reports to Congress \nfrom the Department of Energy. A number of my colleagues, particularly \nSenators Levin, McCain, and Cohen, have devoted considerable effort \nover the past few years to relieving executive branch agencies from the \nunnecessary burden of reporting requirements that have outlived their \nusefulness. It has been a difficult task, and these colleagues and \ntheir staff deserve our thanks for what they have been able to \naccomplish in terms of crafting a long-term solution to the problem. I \nbelieve that it remains incumbent, though, on authorizing committees to \nreview statutory reports required of agencies within their jurisdiction \nand to act to modify or repeal such requirements, where needed. That is \nwhat the present bill does. This bill also repeals legislative \nauthorization for two now-defunct offices in the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I would now like to briefly describe the rationale \nbehind the specific provisions of the bill. Section 1 is the short \ntitle. Section 2 is composed of 12 subsections relating to reports and \none subsection relating to two obsolete offices in the Department.\n  Subsection (a) eliminates the need for ongoing reports on the topics \nof process-oriented industrial energy efficiency and industrial \ninsulation and audit guidelines. The DOE Office of Industrial \nTechnology has worked with seven process-oriented industries to develop \nindustry visions, which include identification of technology needs for \nindustrial energy efficiency and technology barriers. The resulting \nindividual technology road maps, with their associated implementation \nplans, make these ongoing reports redundant.\n  Subsection (b) repeals a requirement for a study and report on \nvibration reduction technologies. Vibration reduction is only tenuously \nrelated to energy conservation. It is not a prime DOE mission, and work \nin this area has not been funded by any appropriations bill. Given the \nmany constraints on the DOE energy conservation budget, initiating work \nin this area is a low priority.\n  Subsection (c) repeals a requirement for a study to determine the \nmeans by which electric utilities may invest in, own, lease, service, \nor recharge batteries used to power electric vehicles. The electric \nutility companies have been working cooperatively with the automobile \nmanufacturers, component industry, and standards setting organizations \nfor several years to determine the infrastructure requirements \nnecessary for recharging and servicing electric vehicle batteries. \nAnother\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\nstudy would not add meaningful information to the body of knowledge \nthat already exists.\n  Subsection (d) eliminates biennial reports on the status of actions \nidentified under the initial one-time reporting requirements of section \n1301 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Development of these \ntechnologies is not fast paced. Significant reportable change is not \nlikely to occur in 2-year increments. In addition, the program has \nsustained a significant decrease in funding, and will likely receive \nless in the future. Under these circumstances it is appropriate to \nchange this requirement to a one-time report, to be submitted upon \ncompletion of the entire project.\n  Subsection (e) changes the frequency with which a comprehensive 5-\nyear program plan for electric motor vehicles must be updated. \nCurrently, this comprehensive plan must be updated annually for a \nperiod of not less than 10 years after the date of enactment of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. The first plan was prepared and submitted to \nthe Congress in March 1994. Because programs do not change \nsignificantly on an annual basis, and because the cost of preparing and \napproving new plans for congressional submittal is extensive, annual \nupdates are not justified. Changing the frequency of updates to every 2 \nyears is a cost-savings measure.\n  Subsection (f) strikes the requirement for biennial updates to a 5-\nyear program plan for a National Advanced Materials Initiative. This \nprogram plan was prepared and submitted to Congress as required, but \nthe program was never funded. With no funding, there are no Department-\nsupported programs or projects, and, thus, no need to update the \ninitial program plan.\n  Subsection (g) eliminates a biennial report on the implementation of \nthe Alaska SWAP Act. The purpose of the act was to take advantage of \noil conservation opportunities by expanding the use of coal-fired \nplants and realizing economies of scale in several remote communities. \nThese opportunities were not numerous and all have been taken advantage \nof for some time. No need exists for further reports.\n  Subsection (h) repeals a report that triggered a legislative veto \nprovision governing DOE shipments of special nuclear materials to \nforeign countries. This legislative veto was exercised by a concurrent \nresolution and thus would be unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's \nruling in INS v. Chadha, 1983, 103 S. Ct. 2764, 462 U.S. 919. The \nreport requirement and the related legislative veto should be repealed.\n  Subsection (i) converts an annual report requirement in the \nContinental Scientific Drilling and Exploration Act to a periodic \nreport. DOE's role in this multiagency program has become less \nprominent, and there is no longer a need for a separate DOE report.\n  Subsection (j) converts a free-standing report requirement on steel \nand aluminum research and development activities into a requirement \nthat such activities be described in the annual budget submission of \nthe Department.\n  Subsection (k) converts a free-standing report requirement on metal \ncasting research and development activities into a requirement that \nsuch activities be described in the annual budget submission of the \nDepartment.\n  Subsection (l) converts the National Energy Policy Plan from a \nbiennial report to a quadrennial report. The timing called for this \nreport in the DOE Act requires that a new Presidential Administration \nsubmit a National Energy Policy Plan less than 3 months after taking \noffice. This is unrealistic. In recent years, an Assistant Secretary of \nEnergy for Policy has often not even been confirmed by that point in \ntime. The biennial requirement also does not make sense from the point \nof view of requiring any given administration to generate such a report \ntwice during each term of office. It would be more sensible to make \nthis requirement a quadrennial one, in which case each new \nadministration would have two full years to conduct its analysis and \npolicy development process. The resulting energy policy plan would be \nreleased in April of the third year of its term.\n  Subsection (m) repeals the authorization for two offices that no \nlonger exist in the Department of Energy.\n  The Office of Subseabed Disposal Research was established in 1982 to \nconduct research on subseabed disposal of nuclear waste. Such disposal \nis not ever likely to occur, and no such research has ever been \nproposed by the Department or funded through appropriations acts.\n  The Office of Alcohol Fuels was established by subtitle A of title II \nof the Energy Security Act (P.L. 96-294), and during the early 1980's \nit played a vital role in support of the emerging alcohol fuels \nindustry. In 1985, the last of three loans made to subsidize the \nconstruction of grain-based ethanol plants was guaranteed by the \nDepartment of Energy, and on June 30, 1987, the Department's loan \nguarantee authority expired. Only one of the loan guarantee recipients, \nthe New Energy Co. of Indiana, continues to produce alcohol fuels. \nOther than this plant, all other commercial ethanol plants in operation \nwere built without government financial assistance. A statutory office \nwithin the DOE, headed by an Executive Level IV Presidential appointee, \nis no longer needed simply to manage one loan guarantee. Indeed, the \nfunctions of the Office of Alcohol Fuels have already been transferred \nwithin the Department to the Assistant Secretary for Energy Efficiency \nand Renewable Energy, and the Office itself has been closed. Under this \nproposed amendment to the Energy Security Act, which is essentially \ntechnical in nature, the DOE would continue to manage the New Energy \nCompany loan guarantee until the loan is repaid.\n  Mr. President, there is nothing controversial about this bill. It is \nsimply good government. I look forward to receiving comments on the \nbill from the Department of Energy and to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2033\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake certain changes to hospice care under the Medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            the medicare hospice benefit amendments of 1996\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake technical changes to the Medicare hospice benefit which will \nensure that high quality hospice services will be available to all \nterminally ill Medicare beneficiaries. Senators Mack, Graham, and Cohen \njoin me in sponsoring this legislation, which is identical to H.R. 3714 \nintroduced last month. This legislation is endorsed by both the \nNational Hospice Organization and the National Association for Home \nCare, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Hospices help care for and comfort terminally ill patients at home or \nin home-like settings. There are more than 2,450 operational or planned \nhospice programs in all 50 States. In 1994, approximately 1 out of \nevery 10 people in America who died were tended to by a hospice \nprogram, and 1 out of every 3 people who died from cancer or AIDS were \ncared for by hospice. Services provided under the Medicare hospice \nbenefit include physician services, nursing care, drugs for symptom \nmanagement and pain relief, short term inpatient and respite care, and \ncounseling both for the terminally ill and their families. Terminally \nill patients who elect hospice opt-out of most other Medicare services \nrelated to their terminal illness.\n  Hospice services permit terminally ill people to die with dignity, \nusually in the comforting surroundings of their own homes with their \nloved ones nearby. Hospice is also a cost-effective form of care. At a \ntime when Medicare is pushing to enroll more beneficiaries in managed \ncare plans, hospice is already managed care. Hospices provide patients \nwith whatever palliative services are needed to manage their terminal \nillness, and they are reimbursed a standard per diem rate, based on the \nintensity of care needed and whether the patient is an inpatient or at \nhome.\n  With 28 percent of all Medicare costs now going toward the care of \npeople in their last year of life, and almost 50 percent of those costs \nspent during the last 2 months of life, cost-effective alternatives are \nneeded. Studies show hospices do reduce Medicare spending. A study \nreleased last year by Lewin-VHI showed that for every dollar Medicare \nspent on hospice, it saved $1.52 in Medicare part A and part B \nexpenditures. Similarly, a 1989 study commissioned by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration showed savings of $1.26 for every Medicare \ndollar spent on hospice. I would ask unanimous consent that a summary \nof these studies be inserted in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  Since 1982, when the hospice benefit was added to the Medicare \nstatute, more and more Americans have chosen to spend their final \nmonths of life in this humane and cost-effective setting. Yet in recent \nyears it has become clear that certain technical changes are needed in \nthe Medicare hospice benefit both to protect beneficiaries and to \nensure that a full range of cost-effective hospice services continues \nto be available. The bill I am introducing today makes six necessary \ntechnical changes.\n  First, the Medicare Hospice Benefits Amendments of 1996 restructures \nthe hospice benefit periods. The basic eligibility criteria do not \nchange. Under this bill, as in current law, a person is eligible for \nthe Medicare hospice benefit only if two physicians have certified that \nhe is terminally ill with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. \nPatients who elect to receive hospice benefits give up most other \nMedicare benefits unless and until they withdraw from the hospice \nprogram.\n  While this bill does not change hospice eligibility criteria, it does \nchange how the benefit periods are structured. Currently, the Medicare \nbenefit consists of four benefit periods. At the end of each of the \nfirst three periods, the patient must be recertified as being \nterminally ill. The fourth benefit period is of unlimited duration. \nHowever, a patient who withdraws from hospice during the fourth hospice \nperiod forfeits his ability to elect hospice services in the future. \nThus, a patient who goes into remission, and is thus no longer eligible \nfor hospice because his life expectancy exceeds 6 months, is not be \nable to return to hospice when his condition worsens.\n  This bill restructures the hospice benefit periods to eliminate the \nexisting open-ended fourth benefit period and to provide that after the \nfirst two 90 day periods, patients are reevaluated every 60 days to \nensure that they still qualify for hospice services. This restructuring \nensures that those receiving Medicare benefits are able to receive \nhospice services at the time they need them and can be discharged from \nhospice care with no penalty if their prognosis changes.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that ambulance services, diagnostic tests, \nradiation, and chemotherapy are covered under the hospice benefit when \nthey are included in the patient s plan of care. No separate payment \nwill be made for these services, but hospices will have to provide them \nwhen they are found to be necessary as a palliative measure. This \nchange conforms the statute to current Medicare regulatory policy.\n  Third, the bill also permits hospices to have independent contractor \nrelationships with physicians. Under current law, hospices must \ndirectly employ their medical directors and other staff physicians. \nThis creates a legal problem in some States which prohibit the \ncorporate practice of medicine, and the requirement has made it \nincreasingly difficult to recruit part-time hospice physicians.\n  Fourth, the bill creates a mechanism to allow waiver of certain \nstaffing requirements for rural hospices, which often have difficulty \nbecoming Medicare-certified because of shortages of certain health \nprofessionals. Currently, about 80 percent of hospices are Medicare-\ncertified or pending certification.\n  Fifth, the bill reinstates an expired provision regarding liability \nfor certain denials. As made clear by an article published on July 18 \nof last month in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine, most \npatients are referred to hospice very late in the course of their \nterminal illnesses, but some live longer than 6 months. Predicting when \nan individual will die will never be an exact science, and we should \nnot expect it to be. Therefore, the bill reinstates the expired \nstatutory presumption that hospices with very low error rates on their \nMedicare claims did not know that denied benefits were not covered, and \nit expands the bases for waiver of liability to include cases where a \nprognosis of 6 months life expectancy is found to have been in error.\n  Finally, this bill provides some administrative flexibility regarding \ncertification of terminal illness. Currently, the statute requires that \npaperwork documenting physician certification of a patient s terminal \nillness be\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\ncompleted within a certain number of days of the patient s admission to \nhospice. This bill will eliminate the strict statutory requirements and \ngive the Health Care Financing Administration the discretion, as it \ncurrently has with home health certifications, to require hospice \ncertifications to be on file before a Medicare claim is submitted.\n  The Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1996 are noncontroversial \nand should not affect Medicare spending, but they will make important \nand necessary changes to the Medicare hospice benefit, to enable \nhospices to provide high quality, cost effective care to the terminally \nill, and to protect beneficiaries who depend on these services. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This group was \n     further divided into those who had one or more hospices claim \n     during the aforementioned period and those who had none. \n     (Additional analysis was done to ensure no selection bias.)\n       The Lewin-VHI report concluded:\n       (1) Medicare saved $1.52 for every $1.00 spent on hospice.\n       (2) While savings were highest for the last month of life, \n     there were also net savings over the last year of life for \n     those who enrolled in hospice.\n       (3) While the greatest savings were found in Part A \n     Medicare expenditures, savings were also found in Part B \n     expenditures.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to join in support of the \n``Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1996'' to be introduced by \nSenator Breaux.\n  The number of terminally ill patients choosing hospice care over \nconventional Medicare has increased from 11,000 Medicare admission in \n1985 to more than 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries last year.\n  During the current session of Congress, much has been made about the \nproblems with the Medicare Trust Fund. Congress should act as soon as \npossible to reduce Medicare costs and protect the Medicare Trust Fund. \nHowever, radical cuts to the program are not the solution.\n  Instead, we should emphasize prevention, fraud reduction, and \nsuccessful programs such as hospice care--all proven efforts at \nreducing spending while maintaining current Medicare quality and \nbeneficiary protections.\n  The goal of hospice is to provide comprehensive health care at home \nto terminally ill patients in a manner that improves the quality of \nlife for the patients and their families. This approach places a high \nvalue of personal choice, family support, and community involvement.\n  Patients covered by Medicare and Medicaid waiver their eligibility \nfor all other public program benefits when choosing hospice care. By \ndoing so, hospice patients are cared for at home with their families \nand avoid costly hospitalizations. Hospice makes sense from a health \ncare, quality of life, and economic perspective.\n  The number of terminally ill patients choosing hospice care over \nconventional Medicare has increased from 11,000 Medicare admission in \n1985 to more than 220,000 Medicare beneficiaries last year.\n  Clearly, hospice is an idea that is rapidly gaining acceptance and \nacclaim in modern times. Florida has been a pioneer in the modern \nhospice movement. In 1979, while I was the Governor in Florida, my \nState became the first to set standards for hospices and recognize \nhospice as an option for the terminally ill. The Florida law served as \na model for national legislation. As a result, inpatient and at-home \nhospice care has been covered by Medicare since 1982.\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\n  The goal of hospice is to make the last months of a person's life as \ncomfortable and meaningful as possible. Hospice does not use artificial \nlife-support systems or surgery when there is no reasonable hope of \nremission. Hospice offers dignity for the dying and avoids costly--\noften traumatic--acute-care hospitalization.\n  For example, according to Lewin-VHI in their 1994 study entitled \nHospice Care: An Introduction and Review of the Evidence, Medicare \nbeneficiaries in their last year of life constituted 5 percent of \nbeneficiaries in 1988 but more than 27 percent of Medicare payments. \nLewin-VHI adds that ``during the last month of life, hospice users \ncost, on average, $3,069, while those using conventional care cost \n$4,071.'' Overall, that study indicates the use of the hospice benefit \nsaved Medicare $1.26 for every $1.00 spent.\n  However, an updated 1995 Lewin-VHI study shows even better results \nthrough the use of hospice. The study, entitled An Analysis of the Cost \nSavings of the Medicare Hospice Benefit, found that Medicare saves \n$1.52 for every $1.00 spent on hospice.\n  According to Lewin-VHI, ``First, hospices effectively substitute \nrelatively inexpensive care at home for costly inpatient hospital days \nduring the period in which expenditures are typically the greatest and \nin which most hospice users enroll in the benefit, in the last month of \nlife. Second, the financial incentives of the current Medicare Hospice \nBenefit reinforce the organizational incentives of most hospice \nprograms to provide quality care at a lower cost.''\n  In another study entitled ``Survival of Medicare Patients After \nEnrollment in Hospice Programs'' in the New England Journal of Medicine \non July 18, 1996, authors Nicholas Christakis and Jose Escarce \nestablish that the benefits of hospice should be expanded. They write, \n``Enrolling patients [in hospice] earlier . . . might enhance the \nquality of end-of-life care and also prove cost effective.''\n  Again, hospice has been a Medicare benefit since passage of the 1982 \nlaw and its implementation in 1983. Hospice care has grown dramatically \nsince the benefit's inception, but few changes have been made to the \n1982 law. As the bill's House sponsors--Congressmen Ben Cardin and Rob \nPortman--have said, ``As more and more patients choose the hospice \nbenefit, it has become clear that certain provisions of the law need to \nbe clarified in order to protect Medicare beneficiaries and to ensure \nthat Medicare hospice patients can continue to receive excellent, cost-\neffective hospice care.''\n\n  We should do what we can to encourage hospice care in the Medicare \nprogram and through the health care system generally. This bill makes \ntechnical amendments to Medicare's hospice program. Specifically, the \nbill would:\n  Restructure the benefit periods to require more frequent \ncertifications after 180 days to facilitate appropriate discharge with \nno penalty to the patient; clarify that ambulances, diagnostic tests, \nradiation and chemotherapy are covered hospice services when included \nin the plan of care; amend the ``core services'' requirement to allow \nhospices to contract for physician services with independent contractor \nphysicians or physician groups; allow waiver of certain staffing \nrequirements of rural hospices; extend the expired favorable \npresumption of waiver of liability provisions and include waiver \nprotection where prognosis of terminal illness is found to have been in \nerror; and, allow the Health Care Financing Administration to set \ndocumentation requirements of physician certifications.\n  Finally, I would like to commend Congressman Cardin from Maryland for \nhis hard work on this legislation on the House side. The Congressman is \na great thinker on the topic of how to improve Medicare and his \nlegislation--H.R. 3714--once again serves that purpose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 2035. A bill to invest in the future American work force and to \nensure that all Americans have access to higher education by providing \ntax relief for investment in a college education and by encouraging \nsavings for college costs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                           the get ahead act\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have spoken in the Senate before about \nhow the rising cost of a college education is putting a higher \neducation--the American dream--out of reach for many middle-class \nAmerican families.\n  When I went to college, middle-class families could pay for the \npublic college tuition and fees of their children for less than 5 \npercent of their income. It stayed that way until 1980. Since then, \nhowever, college costs have skyrocketed and middle-class incomes have \nstagnated. The result is that today it takes almost 9 percent of the \naverage family's income to send one--just one--child to a public \ncollege. And, if you go to a private college or university, tuition and \nfees will eat up 35 percent of your income.\n  Who can afford that? Not many middle-class families that I know. Many \nyoung people today must choose between going heavily into debt or not \ngoing to college at all. And, as the debt burden gets heavier and \nheavier, more and more middle-class kids will not even have that \nchoice. They simply will not be able to go to college.\n  And, this is happening at a time when we as a Nation can least afford \nit.\n  Educating our work force is one of the best investments we as a \nsociety can make, and it is one of the best measurements of future \neconomic well-being. According to one study, a more educated population \nhas been responsible for nearly one-third of America's economic growth \nsince the Great Depression. As we prepare to enter the 21st century and \nas the world economy is increasingly internationally competitive, we \nmust ensure that no American is denied a higher education solely \nbecause of the cost.\n  In fact, this has been a goal of the Federal Government for over a \ncentury. From the establishment of the land-grant university system in \nthe late 1800's to the GI bill at the end of World War II to the \ncreation of the Pell Grant and Guaranteed Student Loan Programs in the \n1960's, the Federal Government has been committed to seeing a college \neducation within reach of every American. It is time to renew that \ncommitment.\n  So, today, Mr. President, I am introducing comprehensive legislation \nto make college more affordable for American families, so that middle-\nclass parents can afford to send their kids to college and middle-class \nkids can afford to go.\n  My bill, titled ``Growing the Economy for Tomorrow: Assuring Higher \nEducation is Affordable and Dependable''--Get Ahead, for short--\ncombines numerous proposals to give tax cuts for the cost of college, \nto encourage families to save for a college education, and to award \ncollege scholarships to high school students in the top of their class \nacademically.\n  For the sake of time, Mr. President, I will not go through all of \nspecific proposals now. Instead, I refer my colleagues to a summary of \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. President, a college education is the dream of every American \nfamily. When I travel around my State of Delaware, I meet with wealthy \nbusinessmen, poor welfare mothers, and hundreds of middle-class \nfamilies. And, they all want the same thing for their kids: a chance to \ngo to college.\n  They do not need us in Washington to tell them it is becoming harder \nand harder to get there. They know that. They need us to make it easier \nfor them. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation \nto make sure that the American dream of a college education remains \nwithin reach of every American.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The GET AHEAD Act--Summary\n\n\n              title i--tax incentives for higher education\n\n           Subtitle A--Tax Relief for Higher Education Costs\n\n     Section 101--Deduction for Higher Education Expenses\n       An above-the-line tax deduction (available even to those \n     who do not itemize deductions) would be allowed for the costs \n     of college tuition and fees as well as interest on college \n     loans.\n       In the case of tuition costs, beginning in tax year 1999, \n     the maximum annual deduction would be $10,000 per year; a \n     maximum deduction of $5,000 would be available in tax years \n     1996, 1997, and 1998. The full deduction\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\n     would be available to single taxpayers with incomes under \n     $70,000 and married couples with incomes under $100,000; a \n     reduced (phased-out) deduction would be available to those \n     with incomes up to $90,000 (singles) and $120,000 (couples). \n     The income thresholds would be indexed annually for \n     inflation.\n       Interest on student loans would be deductible beginning \n     with interest payments made in tax year 1996. Interest \n     payments could be deducted on top of the $10,000 deduction \n     for payment of college tuition and fees. There would be no \n     annual maximum and no income limits with regard to the \n     deductibility of interest on student loans.\n       Language is included to coordinate this tax deduction with \n     other education provisions of the tax code--to ensure that \n     individuals do not receive a double benefit for the same \n     payments. Specifically, qualified higher education expenses \n     that could be tax deductible would be reduced by any payments \n     made from Series EE savings bonds (and excluded from taxable \n     income), any veterans educational assistance provided by the \n     federal government, and any other payments from tax-exempt \n     sources (e.g. employer-provided educational assistance). \n     Also, tax-free scholarships and tax-excluded funds from \n     Education Savings Accounts (see section 112) would first be \n     attributed to room and board costs; the remainder, if any, \n     would count against tuition and fees and would reduce the \n     amount that would be tax deductible. However, if tuition and \n     fees still exceeded $10,000 even after the reductions, the \n     full tax deduction would be available.\n     Section 102--Exclusion for Scholarships and Fellowships\n       College scholarships and fellowship grants would not be \n     considered income for the purposes of federal income taxes. \n     This returns the tax treatment of scholarships and \n     fellowships to their treatment prior to the 1986 Tax Reform \n     Act (which limited the exclusion of scholarships and \n     fellowships to that used for tuition and fees).\n       Scholarships and fellowship grants would be fully \n     excludable for degree candidates. In the case of non-degree \n     candidates, individuals would be eligible for a lifetime \n     exclusion of $10,800--$300 per month for a maximum 36 months.\n       Language is included to clarify that federal grants for \n     higher education that are conditioned on future service (such \n     as National Health Service Corps grants for medical students) \n     would still be eligible for tax exclusion.\n       This section would be effective beginning with scholarships \n     and fellowship grants used in tax year 1996.\n     Section 103--Permanent Exclusion for Educational Assistance\n       The tax exclusion for employer-provided educational \n     assistance would be reinstated retroactively to January 1, \n     1995. And, the tax exclusion would be made a permanent part \n     of the tax code.\n\n       Subtitle B--Encouraging Savings for Higher Education Costs\n\n     Section 111--IRA Distributions Used Without Penalty for \n         Higher Education Expenses\n       Funds could be withdrawn from Individual Retirement \n     Accounts (IRAs) before age 59\\1/2\\ without being subject to \n     the 10 percent penalty tax if the funds were used for higher \n     education tuition and fees. (However, withdrawn funds, if \n     deductible when contributed to the IRA, would be considered \n     gross income for the purposes of federal income taxes.)\n       This section would be effective upon enactment.\n     Section 112--Education Savings Accounts\n       This section would create IRA-like accounts--known as \n     Education Savings Accounts (ESA's)--for the purpose of \n     encouraging savings for a college education.\n       Each year, a family could invest up to $2000 per child \n     under the age of 19 in an ESA. For single taxpayers with \n     incomes under $70,000 (phased out up to $90,000) and married \n     couples with incomes under $100,000 (phased out up to \n     $120,000), the contributions would be tax deductible. (These \n     income thresholds would be indexed annually for inflation.) \n     For all taxpayers, the interest in an ESA would accumulate \n     tax free; the contributions would not be subject to the \n     federal gift tax; and, the balance in an ESA would not be \n     treated as an asset or income for the purposes of determining \n     eligibility for federal means-tested programs.\n       ESA funds could be withdrawn to meet the higher education \n     expenses--tuition, fees, books, supplies, equipment, and room \n     and board--of the beneficiary. Funds withdrawn for other \n     purposes would be subject to a 10 percent penalty tax and \n     would be considered income for the purposes of federal income \n     taxes (to the extent that the funds were tax deductible when \n     contributed). The penalty tax would not apply in cases of \n     death or disability of the beneficiary of the ESA and in \n     cases of unemployment of the contributors.\n       In addition, when the beneficiary of the account turns age \n     30 and is not enrolled in college at least half time, any \n     funds remaining in the ESA would be (1) transferred to \n     another ESA; (2) donated to an educational institution; or \n     (3) refunded to the contributors. In the first two cases, \n     there would be no penalty tax and the money would not be \n     considered taxable income. In the third case, the penalty tax \n     would not apply, but the funds would be counted as income to \n     the extent that the funds were tax deductible when \n     contributed.\n       Finally, parents could roll over funds from one child's ESA \n     to another child's ESA without regard to any taxes, without \n     regard to the $2000 annual maximum contribution to an ESA, \n     and without regard to the age 30 requirement noted above. \n     Funds rolled over would also not be subject to the federal \n     gift tax.\n       Language is also included to allow individuals to designate \n     contributions to an ESA as nondeductible even if such \n     contributions could be tax deductible. This gives families \n     the option to build up the principal in an ESA while at a \n     lower tax rate, rather than having to pay taxes on unspent \n     ESA funds when the contributors are older and likely in a \n     higher tax bracket.\n       Tax deductible contributions to ESAs would be allowed \n     beginning in tax year 1996.\n     Section 113--Increase in Income Limits for Savings Bond \n         Exclusion\n       For taxpayers with incomes below certain thresholds, the \n     interest earned on Series EE U.S. Savings Bonds are not \n     considered taxable income if the withdrawn funds are used to \n     pay for higher education tuition and fees. This section \n     increases the income thresholds to allow more Americans to \n     use the Series EE Savings Bonds for education expenses.\n       Effective with tax year 1996, the income thresholds would \n     be the same as the income thresholds for the higher education \n     tax deduction (see section 101): $70,000 for single taxpayers \n     (phased out up to $90,000), and $100,000 for couples (phased \n     out up to $120,000). As with the higher education tax \n     deduction, these income thresholds would be indexed annually \n     for inflation.\n     Section 114--Tax Treatment of State Prepaid Tuition Plans\n       Several states have established prepaid tuition plans, \n     where individuals can make advance payments for college \n     tuition. However, because of the uncertainty of federal tax \n     law, some states have put their plans on hold and other \n     states have not gone forward at all. This section clarifies \n     federal tax law in two respects.\n       First, state-established trusts or corporations created \n     exclusively for managing tuition prepayment plans would be \n     exempt from federal taxes on investment earnings. Second, \n     the letter-ruling issued by the IRS to Michigan would be \n     codified: purchasers and beneficiaries of prepaid tuition \n     plans would be liable for federal income taxes on the \n     increased value of the investment only at the time the \n     funds were redeemed, not each year as the ``interest'' \n     accrued.\n       To be eligible for the tax clarification, a state prepaid \n     tuition plan must guarantee at the time of purchase that a \n     certain percentage of costs would be covered at a \n     participating educational institution, regardless of the \n     performance of the investment fund. And, it must guarantee \n     that funds would be refunded in the event of the death or \n     disability of the beneficiary or in the event the beneficiary \n     failed to enroll in a participating institution.\n\n\n            title ii--scholarships for academic achievement\n\n       Beginning with the high school graduating class of 1997, \n     the top 5 percent of graduating seniors at each high school \n     in the United States would be eligible for a $1000 merit \n     scholarship. If an individual receiving such a scholarship \n     achieved a 3.0 (``B'') average during his or her first year \n     of college, a second $1000 scholarship would be awarded.\n       However, the merit scholarships would be available only to \n     those students in families with income under $70,000 (single) \n     and $100,000 (couples). These income thresholds would be \n     increased annually for inflation.\n       Funds are authorized (and subject to annual appropriations) \n     for five years. The first year authorization (fiscal year \n     1997) is $130 million. In each of the next four years (FY \n     1998-FY 2001), because the scholarships could be renewed for \n     a second year, the authorization is $260 million per year. \n     Total five-year authorization: $1.17 billion.\n\n\n                     title iii--deficit neutrality\n\n       To ensure that the ``GET AHEAD'' Act does not increase the \n     deficit, this title declares it the sense of the Senate that \n     the costs of the bill should be paid by closing corporate tax \n     loopholes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Daschle):\n  S. 2036. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nprovide equitable treatment for barley producers so that 1996 contract \npayments to the producers are not reduced to a greater extent than the \naverage percentage reduction in contract payments for other \ncommodities, while maintaining the level of contract payments for other \ncommodities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       barley growers legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, last week, I was among a group of Senators \nwho tried to correct an inequitable payment reduction in farm program \ncontract payments faced by barley growers. After considerable time and \neffort we reluctantly came to an agreement on an amendment to address \nthis problem.\n  At the time, I said it was not the answer to the problem, but rather \na small\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\nstep in the journey. Unfortunately that journey ended up being a very \nshort one that quickly got sidetracked.\n  Despite the fact that the Senate agreed to the amendment to provide \nsome relief to barley growers, the conference report came back this \nweek with no additional funds to deal with this problem. The Senate \namendment was deleted.\n  Instead the conferees referred the issue back to the authorizing \ncommittee and then provided an unfunded directive to the Secretary of \nAgriculture to deal with the problem. At the time we agreed to the \nSenate amendment, I was concerned that this would be the outcome. \nAnother referral and no real action.\n  Barley growers deserve more than that. The freedom to farm fixed \ncontract payment system has been violated, and the Government is once \nagain being viewed as not keeping its word. While the freedom to farm \nbill was not my choice for farm legislation, I believe the promises it \nmade to producers constitutes a public commitment that should be kept.\n  It appears that the only way that commitment can be met is if \nlegislation is introduced to require that such action be taken. That is \nwhy I am introducing legislation today.\n  My bill will give the authorizing committee, the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, a clear opportunity to move forward to resolve this issue. \nIt will establish the goal that we had in mind when we sought to solve \nthis problem by amending the appropriations bill.\n  It would seem to me that the majority leadership of the authorizing \ncommittees would be the first ones in line to correct this problem. \nThey were the ones who developed the freedom to farm proposal, and they \nwere the ones who used their projected schedule of fixed payments to \nsell their farm policy approach to American farmers.\n  A news release issued November 21, 1995, by House Agriculture \nCommittee Chairman Pat Roberts clearly states that the expected market \ntransition payments under the Freedom to Farm Program would be 46 cents \nper bushel for barley, 27 cents per bushel for corn, and 92 cents per \nbushel for wheat.\n  This news release lists the source of these estimates as the \nRepublican staff of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry. These payment projections went unchanged throughout the farm \nbill debate right through the final farm bill conference committee.\n  How or why these miscalculations occurred is a moot point. My purpose \nis not to blame anybody. My purpose is to point out that the freedom to \nfarm bill sponsors developed these projections and used them to advance \ntheir farm program proposal. These estimates were the basis of the \ndecisions of many farmers and farm organizations in deciding what they \nwould support as the farm bill moved through Congress.\n  Throughout the farm bill debate, it was clear that these estimated \namounts might be a few cents off, but nobody expected any substantial \ndifference between these estimates and the contract payments.\n\n\n                miscalculation results in 30-percent cut\n\n  Unfortunately, there was a $39 million miscalculation in the payments \nprojected for barley producers. Rather than the original payment rate \nof 46 cents per bushel in 1996, barley producers found out later that \ntheir payments will be only 32 cents per bushel. That is a full 30 \npercent less than the original congressional estimates.\n  Our barley producers based their farm plans and cash flow for this \ncrop year on the projections that were made last fall. They went to \ntheir bankers and creditors who made loans based on these projections.\n  Frankly, I shouldn't be the one that is trying to correct this \nproblem. This problem should have been corrected by those that \ndeveloped the freedom to farm bill and its payment projections. \nHowever, since North Dakota is the largest barley producing State in \nthe Nation, this is of considerable concern to our barley producers.\n  My amendment would restore $35 of the $39 million to barley \nproducers. This would be about a 10-percent cut from what was \noriginally projected. A 10-percent cut is in line with the reductions \nthat are expected in other payments for the other commodities.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to provide equitable treatment to \nbarley producers so that contract payments are not reduced to any \ngreater degree than they are for other commodities. No other commodity \nhas been asked to take as deep a reduction as barley.\n  Wheat producers will be getting 87 cents, rather than 92 cents. That \nis a 5-percent reduction. Corn producers will be getting 24 cents, \nrather than 27 cents. That is an 11-percent reduction. Barley producers \nshould not be expected to take a 30-percent cut in their payments.\n  This is a matter of keeping faith with those family farmers that made \ntheir plans on the basis of a farm bill that was very late in getting \npassed. It is a matter of fairness to our Nation's barley producers.\n  I am pleased that Senators Baucus, Murray, Wellstone, Conrad, Wyden, \nand Daschle have joined me in this effort and will be original \ncosponsors of this legislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to correct the provisions of the Federal Agriculture \nImprovement and Reform Act of 1996 which unfairly penalizes barley \nproducers. In one of the most egregious examples of misinformation I've \never seen, actual payments to barley producers under the act are \ndramatically lower than the original promises made by proponents of the \nbill. The bill we are introducing today corrects that error and gives \nbarley producers the equal treatment they deserve.\n  On November 21, 1995, House Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat \nRoberts released a press statement announcing the estimated market \ntransition payments under freedom to farm. The announcement clearly \nstated that barley payments for 1996 would be 46 cents per bushel. \nWhile the press release does state the figures were estimates, it is \nundeniable that the figures became the basis on which farm group after \nfarm group made farm policy decisions. Producers were told they would \nreceive this level of payment, or something very close to it, and that \nthe payment would be guaranteed. I know this is true in North Dakota \nbecause in meeting after meeting I heard producers tell me it was their \nbelief they would receive 46 cents in 1996 if freedom to farm became \nlaw.\n  Later we find out this is not the case, that the payments to barley \nproducers would not be 46 cents, they would be only 32 cents. I \nunderstand other commodities received some reductions--approximately 5-\n10 percent--but none received the 30 percent reduction barley producers \nhave little choice but to accept. Opponents of this bill will argue all \nproducers were treated the same and that barley producers should have \nbeen aware the initial figures were subject to change. Well, barley \nproducers did know there might be some change, maybe 1 or 2 cents, but \ndid not know there might be a 30 percent change.\n  It's time we set the record straight and admit that barley producers \nwere not treated fairly by the 1996 farm bill. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in correcting this extremely unfair situation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 2037. A bill to provide for aviation security, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   The Aviation Security Act of 1996\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Aviation \nSecurity Act [ASA]. This legislation is designed to significantly \nenhance security measures at U.S. airports, to better protect those who \nfly.\n  Mr. President, I join with all Americans in expressing my sorrow at \nthe loss of 230 innocent lives in the crash of TWA flight 800. My \nsympathy and prayers are with the victims' families and friends as they \nstruggle to cope with this tragedy.\n  At this time, the sea has not yielded its secrets, and we do not have \nconclusive evidence of why the jet crashed. However, terrorism appears \nto be the likely cause of the disaster.\n  Whether or not the cause of the crash was a bomb, this disaster has \nfocused national attention on the fact that America's shores are not \nimmune from terrorism. And this is a threat which I fear will only \nincrease in scope and sophistication over the next few years.\n  Terrorism is an act of war, not against any specific individual, but \nagainst our entire nation. Consequently, protecting ourselves from\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\nthis scourge is a matter of national security, and we must act \naccordingly. We must treat this threat as seriously as any declared \nwar. And we need to adopt measures--and attitudes--to aggressively \ncombat this twentieth century plague.\n  Mr. President, living in a free society, there is only so much we can \ndo to protect every public building, park and gathering place. However, \nterrorists usually target a nation where it's most vulnerable. And \nperhaps nowhere are we more vulnerable than in our air security system.\n  Mr. President, after the past few agonizing days, it's all too \napparent that we must significantly upgrade security measures at U.S. \nairports. Although it may be impossible to stop every terrorist who is \ndetermined to bomb an airline, security can be significantly enhanced \nto better protect those who fly. And it must be continually improved as \nthreats and technology change.\n  The 1.5 million people who daily board flights at American airports \nundergo security measures which were designed decades ago to stop \nhighjackers with metal guns and knives. These measures are inadequate \nwhen dealing with terrorists with Semtex and other plastic explosives. \nSuch explosives are so dangerous that less than 2 pounds can shred a \njumbo jet into a pile of scrap metal.\n\n  The problem of inadequate protection stems from many causes. In most \nother countries, government is responsible for air security. In the \nUnited States, the Government, the airlines and the airports share \nresponsibility. The highly competitive airlines, many of which are \nexperiencing financial difficulties, face an inevitable and difficult \nconflict of interest. Although the Federal Aviation Administration \nissues minimum security standards, individual airlines and airports are \nresponsible for implementing them.\n  There are also multiple loopholes in the present security system. On \nU.S. domestic flights, bags and passengers are not even required to \ntravel together. And there are many other points of vulnerability, \nincluding cargo and mail.\n  It is true that our safety procedures were upgraded after the \nLockerbie disaster. As a member of the President's Commission on \nAviation Security and Terrorism, I helped draft the Aviation Security \nImprovement Act of 1990. Among its 38 provisions were requirements that \nthe FAA accelerate explosives detection research and heighten security \nchecks on airport personnel.\n  Additionally, on July 25, the President announced new air travel \nsecurity measures. These improvements, which include increased searches \nof carry-on luggage and required pre-flight cargo and cabin \ninspections, will certainly enhance security. However, they do not go \nfar enough.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have been briefed by some of our nation's \nbest experts in the field of aviation safety. They are concerned that \nterrorists are outstripping our current procedures, and are breaking \nthrough America's cordon of safety. We can do better; we must do \nbetter. It will require leadership and decisiveness.\n  This Senator believes that we must institute a truly comprehensive \nsecurity system. In order to achieve this, we must do at least three \nthings. We must adequately invest in security technology in proportion \nto the increasing threat of terrorism. We must ensure that the airlines \nenforce necessary security measures at the gate. And we must make sure \nthat our security personnel are adequately trained and perform well.\n  To begin the debate on these matters, I am introducing the Aviation \nSecurity Act (ASA). This legislation effectively addresses the problems \nwhich have become apparent recently, by charging the Department of \nTransportation with implementing a comprehensive aviation security \nsystem.\n  To enhance security before travelers reach the airport, and once they \nare at the gate, my bill mandates increased screening of passengers, \nluggage, and cargo. It also requires that the Department of \nTransportation review and upgrade the current procedures for examining \ncargo on passenger flight.\n\n  To identify passengers and cargo that pose a heightened risk--in \nother words, to stop the bad guys before they board or get a package on \nboard--this legislation requries the Department of Transportation to \ndevelop a methodology to profile passengers and cargo. It also requires \nthat air carriers implement this methodology and institute contingency \nplans for dealing with individuals identified as potential threats. For \nthose individuals and cargo that pose the greatest threat, airports and \nairlines would be required to develop and utilize additional measures, \nincluding bag-match, personal interview, and enhanced bag search.\n  To complement the additional profiling and security measures, my \nlegislation also mandates expedited installation of explosive detection \ndevices at those airports which the Department of Transportation \nidentifies as facing the greatest risk. These devices will include \ndensity evaluators, scanners, trace and vapor detectors.\n  Mr. President, the importance of installing these detection systems, \nas soon as possible, cannot be overemphasized. The latest luggage \nscanners, which can detect the most elusive plastic explosives, are now \nnot generally used in U.S. airports. The most advanced scanning \nmachine, the CTX-5000, works like a CAT Scan, providing a three \ndimensional image. There are 14 in use in Europe and Israel, and two \nare being installed in Manila. In our country, they are currently being \ntested in only Atlanta, which has two, and San Francisco. Another \ndevice, the EGIS machine, uses air samples from passengers' luggage to \ncheck for vapors emitted by explosives. Various overseas airports \nutilize the machine, but it's being used on only a limited basis in the \nUnited States. This, and other technologies, which can detect liquid \nexplosives and trace chemicals, need to be further developed and \ndeployed.\n  Just as important as any new machine or measure is hiring well \ntrained security people. Most airlines, to save money, contract with \nsecurity companies for low-wage workers with minimal education and \nlittle experience. Training is cursory and turnover is high. Yet, this \nperson may be the last line of defense between a plane full of innocent \npeople and a suicide bomber. By contrast, European security personnel \nare usually highly trained, educated, speak several languages and have \ntaken courses in psychology.\n  This legislation requires that airport personnel who have security \nduties or who have access to any secure area must meet stringent \nrequirements for training, job performance and security checks.\n  In conjunction with training, performance measures will be developed \nto assess how well security personnel are doing their jobs. Also, \ncomprehensive investigations, including criminal history checks, will \nbe required of all personnel in this category.\n  The importance of the human factor in improving security is probably \nbest evidenced by the case of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef. Yousef is currently \non trial in New York for his alleged role in the 1994 bombing of the \nWorld Trade Center. Less well known are the details of a plot to join \ntwo other men in blowing up a dozen U.S. jumbo jets in 1995.\n  In a 2-day reign of terror, Yousef and his compatriots planned to \nbomb 12 planes, with over 4,000 people on board. The motive was to \nprovoke an end to United States support of Israel.\n  The heart of each bomb was a timer built by rewiring a common Casio \ndigital watch. The timer would then be connected to a liquid \nnitroglycerin, disguised as contact lens solution. Even the newest \nscreening devices would have extreme difficulty detecting the \nsubstance. Only human vigilance may have been able to stop these \nmurderers if they had reached the airport gate. Luckily, the plot was \ndiscovered by police in the Philippines before the night's sky was set \nablaze.\n  In addition to security, what became painfully obvious this week is \nthat procedures to notify and counsel the families of airline disaster \nvictims are totally inadequate. Compassion dictates that we need to \nadopt more efficient and humane procedures.\n  This legislation establishes, perhaps within the National \nTransportation Safety Board, the Office of Family Advocate. In \nconsultation with the Department of State, the Department of \nTransportation, experts in psychology and representatives of victims' \nfamilies, this Office will develop standards for informing, counseling \nand supporting grieving families. Providing this assistance is not just \ncommon sense, it's common decency.\n\n[[Page S9588]]\n\n  Additionally, this legislation requires that information, such as \nfull name, phone numbers and contact person, be collected when a \npassenger purchases a ticket. This information would be provided to the \nOffice of Family Advocate within a specified time period after an air \ndisaster.\n  Mr. President, a comprehensive security system will be expensive. The \nFAA has estimated that it could cost up to $6 billion over the next 10 \nyears, to pay for security improvements. We need to decide how to pay \nthe bill--and we need to remember that this legislation is not about \nspending dollars, it is about saving lives.\n  ASA proposes that an aviation security fee, or small surcharge of no \nmore than $2 per one way ticket or $4 per round trip ticket, be \ninstituted to pay for needed improvements. I would note that recent \npolls suggest that Americans are willing to pay as much as an extra $50 \nper ticket to upgrade security.\n  An alternative financing mechanism would be to authorize the \nDepartment of Defense to transfer such funds as may be necessary to \nimplement the provisions of the Act. In drawing on defense funds, we \nwould recognize that terrorism is a threat to our national security.\n  Mr. President, a truly comprehensive system should be put in place as \nsoon as possible. Although not a panacea for every airport security \nproblem, it can provide significant protection for travelers.\n  Of course, to truly enhance security, there is another price we all \nmust pay. We must be willing to submit to some delay, inconvenience and \nintrusion when traveling by air. In London, travelers are patted down. \nAnd in many Arab airports, passengers must negotiate fourteen \ncheckpoints before boarding. Anyone who flies coach on El Al, the \nIsraeli national airline, is required to report to the airport 3 hours \nahead of a scheduled flight. The FAA is working on how to minimize \ndisruption while enhancing security. But we must be willing to make \nsome trade-offs, giving up easy and quick experiences on the ground, \nfor added security in the air.\n  Finally, it would be inappropriate for me to close without discussing \nthe issue of terrorism. As a Nation, we need to better address the \noverall problem. We need to clamp down on domestic fundraising for \nMiddle East Terrorist organizations. Press reports indicate that \napproximately $10 million is being sent annually by Americans to the \nterrorist group Hamas. We also need to encourage our allies in the \nMiddle East to fight terrorist organizations in the region. And we must \nwork with the international community to target the economies of \ncountries that sponsor terrorism. We also cannot rule out the use of \nforce, where necessary.\n  If the crash of TWA flight 800 was the work of terrorists, then they \nmay think that they have won the battle--but they certainly haven't won \nthe war. We can fight back.\n  But even if this tragedy was not the result of an evil act, but an \nunfortunate accident, we should not delay upgrading our security \nsystems. We need to change the way this country approaches security. We \nneed to be more proactive, anticipating and pre-empting changes in \nterrorist methods, rather than being reactive--always waiting for \nsomething to happen before we act.\n  To those who would try to deny the seriousness of the threat, and the \nintensity of anti-American feelings in many parts of the world, I want \nto again recall Ramzi Yousef's legacy of hatred. When questioned by a \nPakistani interrogator as to his real motive, Yousef remarked, ``This \nis * * * the best thing, I enjoy it.'' He went on to explain that the \nUnited States is the first country in the world making trouble for the \nMuslim people. Consequently, he was willing to send 4,000 innocent \npeople to their deaths.\n\n  Many of the scenes which have flickered across our T.V. screens over \nthe past 2 weeks can never be forgotten. But there is one moment, in \nparticular, which will always remain with me. A husband and father, who \nhad lost his wife and two daughters in the disaster, hired a helicopter \nto fly over the crash site, which I had visited last weekend. Once \nthere, he tossed two red roses on the water for his wife, and three \nwhite rosebuds for his little girls. And as I watched the news footage \nwhich showed the flowers slowly drifting in all directions, I thought \nof everything which the sea now held--the future lives of those taken \ntoo soon, and the past memories of those left behind.\n  I can think of no better memorial to those who died, and to those who \nwere left behind to carry on, than to work to ensure that such a \ntragedy does not happen again. For the living, and in memory of the \ndeceased, we must act now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the construction of the Perkins County \nRural Water System and authorize the appropriation of Federal dollars \nto assist the Perkins County Rural Water System, Inc., a nonprofit \ncorporation, in the planning and construction of the water supply \nsystem, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n           THE PERKINS COUNTY RURAL WATER SYSTEM ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the need for water development throughout \nSouth Dakota is great. As we prepare to enter the 21st century, all \nSouth Dakotans should be able to consider a high quality water supply \nto be a basic human right, and we should do whatever we can to meet \nthis goal.\n  While considerable progress has been made in providing clean and safe \ndrinking water to residents of my State, much work remains to be done. \nFall River County and Perkins County are examples of areas that \nurgently need to develop new sources of potable water. That is why I am \nintroducing bills today to authorize the construction of the Fall River \nWater Users District Rural Water System and the Perkins County Rural \nWater System.\n  The communities that would be served by both systems are comprised of \nfarmers and ranchers who for too long have had to endure substandard, \nand at times remote, sources of drinking water. The drinking water \navailable in Fall River County, SD, like the water in much of the rest \nof the State, is contaminated with high levels of nitrates, sulfates, \nand dissolved solids. Wells have been known to run dry, due to the high \nfrequency of droughts in the region. Many people currently must haul \nwater, sometimes as much as 60 miles round-trip. Similar problems exist \nin Perkins County, where much of the drinking water fails to meet \nminimum public health standards, thereby posing a long-term health risk \nto the citizens of that region.\n  Simply put, this situation is unacceptable and must be remedied.\n  In Fall River County, the Fall River Water Users District was formed \nto plan and develop a rural water system capable of supplying the water \nto sustain this community. I and my congressional colleagues have \nworked hard over the past year with the district to identify a solution \nthat was affordable and could provide adequate amounts of clean water \nto satisfy the needs of the community. It became apparent that the only \nfeasible option was the authorization of a rural water system\n\n[[Page S9591]]\n\nthat involved the financial and technical participation of the Federal, \nState, and local governments.\n  My first bill would authorize the construction of a system to bring \nclean water to the residents of Fall River County. I am absolutely \ncommitted to continuing to work with the Fall River County Water Users \nDistrict, the State and the Federal Government to bring a high quality \nwater supply to Fall River County.\n  Under the second bill I am introducing today, the Perkins County \nRural Water System will obtain Missouri River water through the \nSouthwest Pipeline, which is part of the Garrison Diversion Unit in \nNorth Dakota. This is an efficient and cost-effective approach that \ntakes advantage of existing water management infrastructure. Clean, \nsafe drinking water will be provided to about 2,500 people who reside \nin the towns of Lemmon and Bison, and the surrounding areas.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will join with me in supporting \nthese two pieces of legislation, which will provide safe, clean \ndrinking water to deserving South Dakota families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fall River Water Users \n     District Rural Water System Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are insufficient water supplies of reasonable \n     quality available to the members of the Fall River Water \n     Users District Rural Water System located in Fall River \n     County, South Dakota, and the water supplies that are \n     available are of poor quality and do not meet the minimum \n     health and safety standards, thereby posing a threat to \n     public health and safety;\n       (2) past cycles of severe drought in the southeastern area \n     of Fall River county have left local residents without a \n     satisfactory water supply and during 1990, many home owners \n     and ranchers were forced to haul water to sustain their water \n     needs;\n       (3) most members of the Fall River Water Users District are \n     forced to either haul bottled water for human consumption or \n     use distillers due to the poor quality of water supplies \n     available;\n       (4) the Fall River Water Users District Rural Water System \n     has been recognized by the State of South Dakota; and\n       (5) the best available, reliable, and safe rural and \n     municipal water supply to serve the needs of the Fall River \n     Water Users District Rural Water System members consists of a \n     Madison Aquifer well, 3 separate water storage reservoirs, 3 \n     pumping stations, and approximately 200 miles of pipeline.\n       (b) Purposes.--The Congress declares that the purposes of \n     sections 1 through 13 are to--\n       (1) ensure a safe and adequate municipal, rural, and \n     industrial water supply for the members of the Fall River \n     Water Users District Rural Water System in Fall River County, \n     South Dakota;\n       (2) assist the citizens of the Fall River Water Users \n     District to develop safe and adequate municipal, rural, and \n     industrial water supplies; and\n       (3) promote the implementation of water conservation \n     programs by the Fall River Water Users District Rural Water \n     System.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide a \npenalty for the use of a controlled substance with the intent to rape, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the drug-induced rape prevention act of 1996\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2040, a bill \nto prevent the use of controlled substances to facilitate rape. This \nbill is to strike back at those who would use controlled substances to \nengage in the most reprehensible of crimes. Joining me in cosponsorship \nof this legislation is Senator Hutchison.\n  Mr. President, earlier in the year as a member of the congressional \ntask force on national drug policy, I joined in issuing a report, \n``Setting the Course: A National Drug Strategy.'' This report noted \nthat every survey of teenage drug use in the past two years indicates \nnot only increasing use of dangerous drugs among teens, but a \ndisturbing change in the attitudes teens have about the dangers of drug \nuse.\n  Two very important surveys have confirmed that teenage drug abuse is \non the rise.\n  The first study is the national high school report, Monitoring the \nFuture, which surveys over 50,000 students in some 400 public and \nprivate secondary schools. The second study is the annual survey by the \nParents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, which surveys nearly \n200,000 ninth to twelfth graders.\n  While these studies focused on the use of marijuana, the use of \nhallucinogens, stimulants, and other drugs are also on the rise. \nAccording to reports by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, \nadolescents who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to move to other \ndangerous drugs, such as cocaine.\n  As a recent report that we issued from the Judiciary Committee, \nLosing Ground Against Drugs noted:\n\n       The implication for public policy is clear. If such \n     increases are allowed to continue for just two more years, \n     America will be at risk of returning to the epidemic drug use \n     of the 1970's.\n\n  While the overwhelming abuse of drugs by teenagers focuses on illicit \ndrugs, the illegal diversion and misuse of medicines is also a growing \nproblem in our country.\n  During the past few years, there has been increasing abuse of a drug \ncalled rohypnol. Rohypnol is not approved for marketing in the United \nStates but it is a legitimate therapeutic agent that is approved for \nuse in several countries to treat sleep disorders.\n  According to a report from the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic, several \nabuse patterns of rohypnol have evolved in the United States.\n  Rohypnol is being abused by heroin addicts as an enhancing agent for \nlow-quality heroin, as well as in combination with cocaine. In some \nareas it is referred to as a ``club drug''--where it is used by so \ncalled ``recreational'' users who intermittently abuse a variety of \nsubstances.\n  However, the most disturbing use of rohypnol is its use to facilitate \nthe rape of women. Reports continue to be made that rohypnol has been \nillicitly put into the drinks of unsuspecting victims before they are \nsexually assaulted.\n  I believe that the Federal Government must show that it will not \ntolerate the use of this drug--or any drug--to facilitate rape. I \nbelieve it is necessary and appropriate to establish a new provision \nthat establishes tough penalties for the use of any controlled \nsubstance to facilitate rape.\n  Rohypnol abuse was initially reported in Florida and Texas, but its \nuse has now become more widespread.\n  In an effort to stem the illegal flow of rohypnol into the United \nStates, the U.S. Customs Service developed and implemented a ban on the \nimportation of rohypnol into the United States.\n  Unfortunately, the problem continues to grow.\n  Rohypnol is a member of the widely-used class of prescription \nmedications known as benzodiazapines. This class of drugs is used to \ntreat sleep disorders, anxiety disorders and to control seizures, among \nother purposes. When used for legitimate medical purposes, this class \nof drugs is vital to the physical and mental health of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  The Controlled Substances Act establishes five schedules of \ncontrolled substances, based primarily upon a drug's relative potential \nfor abuse. Drugs listed in schedules I and II are those with the \nhighest potential for abuse, while drugs listed in schedule V are those \nwith the lowest potential for abuse.\n  Rohypnol is currently listed in Schedule IV of the Controlled \nSubstances Act. In addition to rohypnol, more than twenty other \nbenzodiazepine substances are listed as a Schedule IV substance.\n  Rohypnol is not marketed or manufactured in the United States. While \nnot legally available for legitimate medical uses in the United States, \nrohypnol is widely used for legitimate medical purposes in many \ncountries throughout the world.\n  In response to reports that the incidence of abuse of rohypnol was \nincreasing, the Drug Enforcement Administration instituted the formal \nrescheduling process for this substance by submitting a formal request \non April 11, 1996 to the Food and Drug Administration to conduct an \nevaluation of the scientific and medical evaluation of this substance. \nThat evaluation is ongoing.\n  In a letter from Health and Human Services Secretary Donna E. Shalala \nto me on July 24, 1996, Secretary Shalala informed me that the goal of \nthe rescheduling process was to make rohypnol subject to increased \npenalties for illicit use and trafficking.\n  Since this particular drug has become a leading agent of abuse and \nthe focus of this debate, I agree with Secretary Shalala that it is \nappropriate to increase the penalties for illegal trafficking in \nrohypnol. This bill does that.\n  However, I am concerned about the precedent that rescheduling would \nhave on this very useful class of medicines. I fee a more appropriate--\nand rapid--method to respond to this crisis is to implement the \nincreased penalties\n\n[[Page S9594]]\n\nfor illegal trafficking in rohypnol without having Congress circumvent \nthe well-established process for rescheduling a substance.\n  As I mentioned previously, the rescheduling process requires a \ncareful scientific and medical evaluation of the substance. This \nevaluation is completed by the FDA in consultation with HHS' National \nInstitute on Drug Abuse. Congress does not have the resources or \nexpertise to complete such an evaluation, and by considering \nrescheduling may establish an unintentional precedent with regard to \nscheduling of controlled substances which we may regret later on.\n  I believe that the Drug-Induced Rape Prevention Act of 1996 provides \nfor a rapid, measured response to the problem that the abuse of \nrohypnol has presented, without establishing an unintended role for \nCongress with regard to the scheduling of controlled substances. I urge \nthat this legislation be considered when we reconvene next month.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be place in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2040\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Marine Protection, Research, and \nSanctuaries Act of 1972 with respect to the dumping of dredged material \nin Long Island Sound, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n         THE LONG ISLAND SOUND PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with Senator Moynihan and Senator Faircloth that will help \nguarantee that one of our Nation's most important estuaries is no \nlonger used as a dumping ground for polluted dredged material. Long \nIsland Sound is a spectacular body of water located between Long \nIsland, NY and the State of Connecticut. Unfortunately, dumping of \ndredged material of questionable environmental impact has occurred in \nthe sound for a number of years. It is high time that Congress put an \nend to this practice of willful pollution of the Sound.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today will prevent any \nindividual or any Government agency from randomly dumping sediments \ninto the ecologically sensitive sound. Specifically, the legislation \nprevents all sediments that contain any constituents prohibited as \nother than trace contaminants, as defined by Federal regulations, from \nbeing dumped into either Long Island Sound or Block Island Sound. \nExceptions to the act can be made only in circumstances where the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shows that the \nmaterial will not cause undesirable effects to the environment or \nmarine life.\n  Last fall, the U.S. Navy dumped over 1 million cubic yards of dredged \nmaterial from the Thames River into the New London dump site located in \nthe sound. Independent tests of this sediment indicated that \ncontaminants were present in that dredged material that now lies at the \nbottom of the sound's New London dump site-contaminants such as dioxin, \ncadmium, pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, PCB's, and mercury. \nRight now, there is a question as to the long-term impact this material \nwill have on the aquatic life and the environment in this area. Such \nconcerns should not have to occur. It has taken years to come as far as \nwe have in cleaning up Long Island Sound--we should not jeopardize \nthose gains by routinely allowing the dumping of polluted sediments in \nthese waters.\n  Over $1.2 billion in Federal, State, and local funds have been spent \nin the State of New York in the last quarter century combating \npollution in the sound. However, over the last 25 years, we have \ncontinued to look the other way when it comes to dumping in the sound. \nSuch actions are counterproductive in our efforts to restore the Sound \nfor recreational activities such as swimming and boating as well as the \neconomic benefits of sport fishing and the shellfish industry all of \nwhich bring more than $5.5 billion to the region each year. We can and \nmust change our current direction. With the passage of this \nlegislation, I am confident that we will do so, and the Long Island \nSound will move forward on the road to recovery. I urge my colleagues \nto join us in cosponsoring this bill, and I encourage its swift passage \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2041\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the multifamily rental assisted housing \nprograms of the Federal Government, maintain the affordability and \navailability of low-income housing, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n the multifamily assisted housing reform and affordability act of 1996\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, on behalf of \nSenator D'Amato, Bond, and Bennett, the Multifamily Assisted Housing \nReform and Affordability Act of 1996. This bill is a serious effort to \nreform the Nation's assisted and insured multifamily housing portfolio \nin a responsible manner that balances both fiscal and public policy \ngoals. This legislation will save scarce Federal subsidy dollars while \nmaintaining the affordability and availability of decent and safe \nrental housing.\n  About 20 years ago, the Federal Government encouraged private \ndevelopers to construct affordable rental housing by providing mortgage \ninsurance through the Federal Housing Administration [FHA] and rental \nassistance through the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \n[HUD] project-based Section 8 programs. In addition, tax incentives for \nthe development of low-income housing were provided through the tax \ncode until 1986.\n  The combination of these financial incentives resulted in the \ncreation of thousands of decent, safe, and affordable housing \nproperties but, at a great cost to the American taxpayer. Flaws in the \nSection 8 rental assistance program allowed owners to receive more \nFederal dollars in rental subsidy than was necessary to maintain \nproperties as decent and affordable rental housing. A recent HUD study \nfound that almost two-thirds of assisted properties have contract rents \ngreater than comparable market rents. Like the severely distressed \npublic housing stock, some of these Section 8 projects have become \ntargets and havens for crime and drug activities. Thus, in some cases, \ntaxpayers are paying costly subsidies for inferior housing. We believe \nthat a policy that pays excessive rental subsidies for housing is not \nfair to the American taxpayer, and it cannot be sustained in the \ncurrent budget environment.\n  It is critical that this legislation be enacted this year because in \nthe next several years, a majority of the Section 8 contracts on the \n8,500 FHA-insured properties will expire. If contracts continue to be \nrenewed at existing levels, the cost of renewing these contracts will \ngrow from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to almost $4 billion in \nfiscal year 2000 and $8 billion 10 years from now. However, if these \nproject-based assistance contracts are not renewed most of the FHA-\ninsured mortgages--with an unpaid principal balance of $18 billion--\nwill default and result in claims on the FHA insurance funds. This \ncould lead to more severe actions such as foreclosure, which will \nadversely affect residents and communities.\n  Like public housing, federally assisted and insured housing provides \ncritical housing to almost 1.6 million American families. There are \nother similarities to public housing. For one, the average annual \nincome of residents that reside in project-based housing is less than \n$7,000. A significant percentage of residents are elderly or persons \nwith disabilities. Many of these developments are located in rural \nareas where no other rental housing exists. some of these properties \nserve as ``anchors'' of neighborhoods where the economic stability of \nthe neighborhoods is dependent upon the viability of these properties.\n  Unfortunately for residents and communities, HUD does not have the \nability to administer and oversee its portfolio of multifamily housing \nproperties. The General Accounting Office and the HUD Office of \nInspector General [IG] have found that even though HUD has various \nenforcement tools to ensure that properties are properly maintained, \npoor management information systems and ineffective oversight of \nproperties have impeded HUD's ability to identify problems and pursue \nenforcement actions in a timely fashion. HUD is further hampered by the \nlack of adequate staffing and inadequately trained staff. For example, \nthe IG found that the average workload for a HUD loan servicer ranged \nfrom 28 projects per servicer to 105 projects per servicer. In \ncomparison, State housing finance agencies averaged 12 to 16 projects \nper servicer.\n  The Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act \naddresses these issues through a new comprehensive structure that \nprovides a wide variety of tools to address the spiraling costs of \nSection 8 assistance without harming residents or communities. The bill \nwill reduce the long-term ongoing costs of Federal subsidies by \nrestructuring the underlying debt insured by FHA. This restructuring \nprocess will reduce the subsidy needs and costs of the properties and \nminimizes adverse tax consequences to good owners.\n  In recognition of HUD's inability to manage and service its housing \ninventory, this legislation would transfer the functions and \nresponsibilities to capable State and local housing agencies who would \nact as participating administrative entities in managing this program. \nIncentives would be provided to these entities to ensure that the \nAmerican taxpayer is paying the least amount of money to provide \ndecent, safe, and affordable housing. Any amount of incentives provided \nto State and local entities would only be used for low-income housing \npurposes.\n  Horror stories of owners that have clearly violated housing quality \nstandards would no longer be tolerated. Our bill screens out bad owners \nand managers and nonviable projects from the inventory and provides \ntougher and more effective enforcement tools that will minimize fraud \nand abuse of FHA insurance and assisted housing programs.\n\n  Lastly, our bill provides tools to recapitalize the assisted stock \nthat suffer from deferred maintenance and empowers residents by \nproviding for meaningful community and resident input into the process. \nResidents would also be empowered through opportunities to purchase \nproperties.\n  Mr. President, I would like to reemphasize that it is critical that \nwe address this issue this year. Delays will only harm the assisted \nhousing stock, its residents and communities, and the financial \nstability of the FHA insurance funds. Further, HUD only has limited \nstatutory authority to renew these contracts. In most cases, it cannot \nand does not have the capability to deal with this housing portfolio \nunder current law.\n  This legislation will protect the Federal Government's investment in \nassisted housing and ensure that participating administrative entities \nare held accountable for their activities. It is also our goal that \nthis process will ensure the long-term viability of these projects with \nminimal Federal involvement. It is a real effort to reduce the costs of \nthe Federal Government while recognizing the needs of low-income \nfamilies and communities throughout the Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2042\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\n       \n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) as of the date of enactment of this Act, it is \n     estimated that--\n       (A) the insured multifamily housing portfolio of the \n     Federal Housing Administration consists of 14,000 rental \n     properties, with an aggregate unpaid principal mortgage \n     balance of $38,000,000,000; and\n       (B) approximately 10,000 of these properties contain \n     housing units that are assisted with project-based rental \n     assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937;\n       (3) FHA-insured multifamily rental properties are a major \n     Federal investment, providing affordable rental housing to an \n     estimated 2,000,000 low- and very low-income families;\n       (4) approximately 1,600,000 of these families live in \n     dwelling units that are assisted with project-based rental \n     assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937;\n       (5) a substantial number of housing units receiving \n     project-based assistance have rents that are higher than the \n     rents of comparable, unassisted rental units in the same \n     housing rental market;\n       (6) many of the contracts for project-based assistance will \n     expire during the several years following the date of \n     enactment of this Act;\n       (7) it is estimated that--\n       (A) if no changes in the terms and conditions of the \n     contracts for project-based assistance are made before fiscal \n     year 2000, the cost of renewing all expiring rental \n     assistance contracts under section 8 of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 for both project-based and tenant-based \n     rental assistance will increase from approximately \n     $4,000,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to over $17,000,000,000 by \n     fiscal year 2000 and some $23,000,000,000 in fiscal year \n     2006;\n       (B) of those renewal amounts, the cost of renewing project-\n     based assistance will increase from $1,200,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 1997 to almost $8,000,000,000 by fiscal year 2006; and\n       (C) without changes in the manner in which project-based \n     rental assistance is provided, renewals of expiring contracts \n     for project-based rental assistance will require an \n     increasingly larger portion of the discretionary budget \n     authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     in each subsequent fiscal year for the foreseeable future;\n       (8) absent new budget authority for the renewal of expiring \n     rental contracts for project-based assistance, many of the \n     FHA-insured multifamily housing projects that are assisted \n     with project-based assistance will likely default on their \n     FHA-insured mortgage payments, resulting in substantial \n     claims to the FHA General Insurance Fund and Special Risk \n     Insurance Funds;\n       (9) more than 15 percent of federally assisted multifamily \n     housing projects are physically or financially distressed, \n     including a number which suffer from mismanagement;\n       (10) due to Federal budget constraints, the downsizing of \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and \n     diminished administrative capacity, the Department lacks the \n     ability to ensure the continued economic and physical well-\n     being of the stock of federally insured and assisted \n     multifamily housing projects; and\n       (11) the economic, physical, and management problems facing \n     the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily \n     housing projects will be best served by reforms that--\n       (A) reduce the cost of Federal rental assistance, including \n     project-based assistance, to these projects by reducing the \n     debt service and operating costs of these projects while \n     retaining the low-income affordability and availability of \n     this housing;\n       (B) address physical and economic distress of this housing \n     and the failure of some project managers and owners of \n     projects to comply with management and ownership rules and \n     requirements;

Projects with subsidy contract rents above the \n     fair market rent would be restructured in a manner that would \n     reduce the rents by restructuring the underlying debt. Rents \n     would be ``marked'' to comparable market rents where \n     comparable properties exist or at 90 percent of fair market \n     rents (FMR) if comparable properties do not exist.\n       In some cases (such as properties that provide special \n     services to elderly and disabled households or because of the \n     local market rent conditions), even if debt is restructured, \n     setting rents at comparable market rent levels of 90 percent \n     of FMR may be inadequate to cover the costs of operation. In \n     these cases, a budget-based process would be used to set \n     rents at the minimum level necessary to support proper \n     operations and maintenance costs.\n       Screens out troubled multifamily properties and \n     noncompliant owners. Nonviable housing projects and bad \n     owners would be screened out from the renewal and debt \n     restructuring process. Community and resident involvement \n     would be used in resolving these problems. Potential outcomes \n     could include demolition or change of ownership to other \n     entities including nonprofits. Alternative housing would be \n     provided to affected residents in cases of demolition. \n     Stronger FHA and Section 8 enforcement authorities would also \n     be provided to address troubled\n\n[[Page S9603]]\n\n     properties and bad owners. In addition, stronger enforcement \n     remedies would be an integral part of all restructuring \n     transactions, to ensure that restructured properties would \n     continue to provide high quality affordable housing.\n       Recapitalizes the assisted stock that suffer from deferred \n     maintenance. In some cases, recapitalization is needed to \n     address deferred maintenance for properties under portfolio \n     restructuring. Rehabilitation grants or deeper debt \n     writedowns would be used.\n       Utilizes capable public entities to restructure portfolio \n     and recognizes HUD's limited capacity. Portfolio \n     restructuring is being undertaken to reform and improve the \n     programs from a financial and operating perspective, but not \n     to abandon the long-term commitment to resident protection \n     and ongoing affordability. As a result, balancing the fiscal \n     goals of reducing costs with the public policy goals of \n     maintaining affordable housing requires an intermediary \n     accountable to the public interest. With HUD's acknowledged \n     lack of capacity to address these issues, public \n     intermediaries that have demonstrated expertise in affordable \n     housing and responsible management would be selected. State \n     housing finance agencies would be given a priority in acting \n     as Participating Administrative Entities (PAE). Incentives \n     would be negotiated with the PAEs to protect the financial \n     interests of the Federal Government.\n       Addresses the tax issues facing debt restructuring. Under \n     current tax law, debt restructuring could result in the \n     triggering of a large income tax liability on the owners/\n     investors without generating sufficient cash with which the \n     owners/investors could pay the tax. As a result, a tax \n     solution is needed to avoid resistance and delays from owners \n     and investors. Debt restructuring results in an event that \n     reduces the outstanding mortgage that is owed by the owners \n     and investors. This reduction in the mortgage amount will \n     result in a tax liability--referred to as ``cancellation \n     of indebtedness'' or COD. COD is generally treated as \n     ordinary taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The bill addresses this problem by bifurcating the existing \n     mortgage into two obligations. The first piece would be \n     determined on the amount the mortgage could be supported by \n     the rental income stream. Payment on the second piece would \n     be deferred until the first mortgage is paid off. According \n     to Treasury officials, this practice would not result in an \n     immediate tax liability to owners and investors.\n       Provides for resident and community input into the \n     restructuring process. To ensure that portfolio restructuring \n     does not adversely affect the residents or local communities \n     in which the properties are located, communities, residents, \n     and local government officials would be provided an \n     opportunity to comment on the process.\n       Strengthens HUD and FHA enforcement authority. This bill \n     contains important provisions that will minimize the \n     incidence of fraud and abuse of federally assisted programs. \n     Such key provisions include (1) expanding HUD's ability to \n     impose sanctions on lenders, (2) expanding equity skimming \n     prohibitions, and (3) broadening the use of civil money \n     penalties.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the Multifamily \nAssisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1996. This bill goes a \nlong way toward developing a constructive and comprehensive section 8 \nmark-to-market contract renewal program for reducing the costs of \nexpiring project-based section 8 contracts, limiting the financial \nexposure of the FHA multifamily housing insurance fund for FHA-insured \nsection 8 projects, and preserving, to the maximum extent possible, the \nsection 8 project-based housing stock for very-low- and low-income \nfamilies.\n  I congratulate Senators D'Amato, Mack, and Bennett for their \ncontribution and commitment to this comprehensive legislation, as well \nas their commitment to finding a bipartisan approach to the many \ndifficult issues associated with the renewal of over subsidized section \n8 project-based contracts. This legislation is a meaningful step in \ndeveloping a reasonable policy toward the concerns raised by these \nexpiring section 8 project-based contracts.\n  Over the last 25 years, a number of HUD programs were established for \nthe construction of affordable, low-income housing by providing FHA \nmortgage insurance while financing the cost of the housing through \nsection 8 project-based housing assistance. Currently, there are some \n8,500 projects with almost 1 million units that are both FHA-insured \nand whose debt service is almost totally dependent on rental assistance \npayments made under section 8 project-based contracts. Most of these \nprojects serve very-low-income families, with approximately 37 percent \nof the stock serving elderly families.\n  The crisis facing this housing stock is that the section 8 project-\nbased housing assistance was initially budgeted and appropriated \nthrough 15- and 20-year section 8 project-based contracts that are now \nexpiring and for which contract renewal is prohibitively expensive. For \nexample, at least 75 percent of this housing stock have rents that \nexceed the fair market rent of the local area.\n  Since current law prohibits HUD from renewing these section 8 \ncontracts at rents above 100 percent of the fair market rent, with some \nexceptions not to exceed 120 percent, in many cases, the failure to \nrenew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at existing rents will \nleave owners without the financial ability to pay the mortgage debt on \nthese projects. This means that owners likely will default on their \nFHA-insured mortgage liabilities, resulting in FHA mortgage insurance \nclaims and foreclosures. HUD would then own and be responsible for \nmanaging these low-income multifamily housing projects. This bill is \nintended to avoid this potential crisis through a fiscally responsible \nand housing sensitive strategy.\n\n  In addition, the cost of the section 8 contracts on these projects \nreemphasizes the difficult budget and appropriation issues facing the \nCongress. In particular, according to HUD estimates, the cost of all \nsection 8 contract renewals, both tenant-based and project-based, will \nrequire appropriations of about $4.3 billion in fiscal year 1997, $10 \nbillion in fiscal year 1998, and over $16 billion in fiscal year 2000. \nIn addition, the cost of renewing the section 8 project-based contracts \nwill grow from $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1997 to almost $4 billion in \nfiscal year 2000, and to some $8 billion in 10 years.\n  Since the HUD appropriations account cannot sustain these exploding \ncosts, this legislation is intended to be a comprehensive response \nwhich will reduce the financial cost and exposure to the Federal \nGovernment and preserve this valuable housing resource. The Senate bill \nwould generally preserve this low-income housing by using various tools \nto restructure these multifamily housing mortgages to the market value \nof the housing with resulting reductions in section 8 costs.\n  I also am troubled by some of the other section 8 mark-to-market \nproposals being promoted, including the position taken by HUD which, in \ngeneral, opposes preserving this housing as FHA-insured or as assisted \nthrough section 8 project-based assistance, including the elderly \nassisted housing, in favor of vouchers. This position is very \nquestionable, and I emphasize that it is widely opposed by the housing \nindustry and tenant groups and advocates.\n  I highlight the underlying principles of the bill which would \nauthorize the establishing of participating administrative entities \n[PAE's] which would generally be a public agency, with a first \npreference that a PAE be a State housing finance agency or, second, a \nlocal housing agency. These entities would be contracted by HUD to \ndevelop work-out plans in conjunction with owners of FHA-insured \nprojects with expiring, oversubsidized section 8 contracts. Each PAE \nwould develop mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency \nplans as workout instruments to reduce the section 8 subsidy needs of \nprojects through mortgage restructuring.\n  The basic tool provided in the draft bill, and the likely key to any \nsuccessful strategy to preserve this housing, is to authorize the \nrestructuring of the mortgage debt on these oversubsidized section 8 \nmultifamily housing projects. In particular, the bill would allow the \nrestructuring of these high cost mortgages with a new first mortgage \nreflecting, generally, the market value of a project, and a soft second \nmortgage held by HUD, with interest at the applicable Federal rate, \ncovering the remainder of the original mortgage debt and payable upon \ndisposition or upon full payment of the first mortgage. This provision \nwill reduce the cost of section 8 assistance and minimize any loss to \nthe FHA multifamily insurance fund. In addition, this approach ensures \nthat there is no taxable event by virtue of the mortgage restructuring.\n\n  I also think it would be beneficial to look at some kind of exit tax \nrelief to encourage owners, especially limited partners, to divest \ntheir interest in these properties, to encourage new investment in and \nrevitalization of these properties. Nevertheless, I am convinced that \nthe tax committees are unlikely to take up this issue during this\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\nCongress and that any discussion on tax relief will have to wait for \nanother time.\n  Finally, I emphasize that it is time to act now. I am currently \nsponsoring a section 8 mark-to-market demonstration to be included in \nthe VA-HUD fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill which is similar to the \nMultifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act and which \nrepresents an interim approach to the section 8 mark-to-market contract \nrenewal issue. This appropriation language indicates my strong belief \nthat we can no longer afford, as a matter of housing policy and fiscal \nresponsibility, to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at \nthe existing, over-market rents. Nevertheless, I strongly prefer that \nsection 8 reform legislation be acted on by the authorizing committees \nbefore the end of the fiscal year, with the full benefit of hearings \nand discussion on these very difficult policy issues.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the legislation and \nhope that the Housing Subcommittee and Banking Committee can act in an \nexpeditious manner on this measure. I emphasize the need to work \ntogether and I look forward to moving this legislation through Congress \nand onto the desk of the President.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to cosponsor the Multifamily \nAssisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1996. I wish to thank \nmy colleagues, Senators Connie Mack and Kit Bond, for their outstanding \nefforts in crafting and advancing this vitally important piece of \nlegislation to restructure the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's [HUD] Federal Housing Administration [FHA] insured and \nsection 8 assisted multifamily housing portfolio. Also,I would like to \nthank Senator Bennett for his diligence in confronting the complex \nissues surrounding our federal multifamily housing programs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a significant step forward \nin addressing the complicated and vexing problem of the rising costs of \nHUD's section 8 assisted housing program. Over the course of the next \nseveral years, the costs of renewing expiring section 8 contracts at \ntheir current rent levels will skyrocket from $4.3 billion in fiscal \nyear 1997 to $20 billion in fiscal year 2002--a figure which represents \nthe entire existing HUD budget. This is the result of the expiration of \nlong-term housing assistance contracts which were entered into 15 to 20 \nyears ago. In addition, many of these contracts support projects with \nrents that are far higher than local market rents. While these rising \ncosts are clearly significant and represent a formidable challenge, the \nexpiration of these long-term contracts also presents us with an \nopportunity to address the oversubsidized and often inflated costs of \nthe section 8 program.\n  During the course of the past year, the Banking Committee has held \nhearings and has conducted an ongoing dialogue with residents, lenders, \nservicers, public officials and leading professionals within the \nhousing community to find a consensus solution to the problems \nassociated with the section 8 program. This legislation represents the \nculmination of that important effort.\n  Mr. President, I would like to emphasize the guiding principles of \nthis legislation: To contain the growth of the expanding costs of the \nsection 8 program; to protect existing tenants; to maintain the \nexisting stock of decent, safe and affordable housing for future needs; \nto remove bad owners and managers; to protect the FHA insurance fund \nand minimize the liability of the Federal taxpayer; and to provide for \nlocal control and flexibility while reducing HUD's administrative \nburden.\n  This legislation seeks to: Reduce inflated contract rents to market-\nrate and budget-based rent levels; screen out bad owners, replace \ncorrupt managers and encourage transfers to resident-supported \nnonprofit corporations; and provide must needed capital and facilitate \nprivate financing to address backlogged maintenance needs. \nThis comprehensive approach will allow us to reduce the costs of the \nsection 8 program while protecting the FHA insurance fund and \nminimizing the liability of the federal taxpayer. The outstanding debt \non the oversubsidized portfolio would be restructured to reflect market \nrent levels. This debt restructuring would include the continuation of \nproject-based subsidies as well as FHA multifamily insurance. This bill \nalso addresses the significant tax dilemma which would be caused by \ndebt restructuring. In order to avoid adverse tax consequences, a \nbifurcation of the mortgage into two separate obligations is proposed.\n\n  The legislation recognizes the lack of capacity at HUD and seeks to \nmaximize local control and flexibility in carrying out debt \nrestructuring in order to reduce inflated rents. A preference would be \nprovided to State and local housing finance agencies to oversee \nmortgage workouts. These public entities are ideally suited for this \nrole and are already accountable to the public interest in their own \njurisdictions. Also, residents of affected properties would be provided \nwith input in a communitywide consultation process, and will be \nprovided adequate notice, access to information, and an adequate time \nperiod for analysis and comment.\n  In conclusion, let me reiterate my appreciation for my colleagues who \nmade tremendous contributions to the effort to stem this impending \ncrisis. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and \nCommunity Development, Senator Mack has charted a reasonable and \nrational course for us to follow. He has utilized a fair and bipartisan \napproach in the development of this legislation, and should be \ncommended for his efforts. Also, Senator Bond, chairman of the \nSubcommittee on VA-HUD Appropriations and my fellow colleague on the \nBanking Committee, has been very instrumental in moving the process \nforward. Throughout, he has insisted on our continued federal \ncommitment to providing affordable housing and the protection of the \ninterests of existing low and moderate income tenants.\n  I thank all members of the Banking Committee for their tireless \nefforts on behalf of affordable housing and look forward to pursuing \nour bipartisan commitment to resolving the HUD section 8 crisis as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2043. A bill to require the implementation of a corrective action \nplan in States in which child poverty has increased; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                       CHILD POVERTY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the welfare bill we passed this week would \nallow States to experiment with various welfare policies. Many States \nmay implement innovative welfare policies to move parents from welfare \nto work. But if we are sending Federal money to States, if we are going \nto take this risk and allow States to experiment, we must be sure that \nchild poverty does not increase.\n  There is nothing more important than constantly reminding ourselves \nthat our focus is--or ought to be--this Nation's children. That was the \nfocus when under Franklin Roosevelt's leadership title IV-A of the \nSocial Security Act was originally enacted. The objective here is to \nhelp impoverished children.\n  This bill I am introducing today says that if child poverty increases \nin a State after the date of enactment of the welfare bill, then that \nState would be required to submit a corrective action plan. Although a \nweaker version of my bill passed and was included in the welfare bill, \nI am introducing this as a separate bill in the hope that ultimately we \nwill be able to pass the strongest possible version.\n  What would this bill do? This bill says that if the most recent State \nchild poverty rate exceeds the level for the previous year by 5 percent \nor more then the State would have to submit to the HHS Secretary within \n90 days a corrective action plan describing the actions the state shall \ntake to reduce child poverty rates.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that this bill in no way intrudes \non a State's ability to design its own welfare program. State \nflexibility would not be decreased in any way. This bill simply says \nthat if a state's welfare system increases child poverty, that state \nmust take corrective action.\n  Mr. President, I believe all of us regardless of party can agree on \ntwo things at least: We can all agree that the child poverty rate in \nthis country is too high. The fact is that 15.3 million U.S. children \nlive in poverty. This\n\n[[Page S9605]]\n\nmeans that more than 1 in 5 children--21.8 percent--live in poverty. In \nMassachusetts, there are more than 176,000 children who live in \npoverty. And despite the stereotypes, Mr. President, the majority of \nAmerica's poor children are white (9.3 million) and live in rural or \nsuburban areas (8.4 million) rather than central cities (6.9 million).\n  The other thing on which we can all agree, because it is a fact \nrather than an opinion, is that the child poverty rate in this country \nis dramatically higher than the rate in other major industrialized \ncountries. According to an excellent, comprehensive recent report by an \ninternational research group called the Luxembourg Income Study, the \nchild poverty rate in the United Kingdom is less than half our rate \n(9.9 percent), the rate in France is less than one-third of our rate \n(6.5 percent), and the rate in Denmark (3.3 percent) is about one-sixth \nour rate.\n  Mr. President, we know that poverty is bad for children. This should \nbe obvious. Nobel prizewinning economist Robert Solow and the \nChildren's Defense Fund recently conducted the first-ever long-term \nimpact of child poverty. They found that their lowest estimate was that \nthe future cost to society of a single year of poverty for the 15 \nmillion poor children is $36 billion in lost output per worker. When \nthey included lost work hours, lower skills, and other labor market \ndisadvantages related to poverty, they found that the future cost to \nsociety was $177 billion.\n  With this bill, I want to make sure that, at the very least, if a \nState's welfare plan increases child poverty--instead of increasing the \nnumber of parents moving from welfare to work and self-sufficiency--\nthat State will take immediate steps to refocus its program.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill to \nensure that welfare reform results in more parents working, not more \nchild poverty.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2044. A bill to provide for modification of the State agreement \nunder title II of the Social Security Act with the State of \nPennsylvania with respect to certain students; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               legislation helping pennsylvania students\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes of Senate \nbusiness today to introduce legislation of importance to the \nPennsylvania state system of higher education and to the students \nenrolled and working at our state-related universities.\n  The bill is a companion measure to legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives. The House proposal was introduced by my friend and \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Representative Bill Clinger.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will affect students and graduate \nassistants employed by Pennsylvania's public universities and will \nallow them to keep more of their pay from campus employment. Currently, \nstudent employees of Pennsylvania's State system of higher education \nare covered under FICA and pay taxes unlike working students at schools \nin most other states. Only a change in the law would enable \nPennsylvania's colleges and universities to exempt their student \nemployees from FICA coverage.\n  This legislation would make Pennsylvania schools more attractive and \ncompetitive with the other states who have opted out of Social Security \ncoverage. Graduate students are often called upon to perform paid \nassistant teaching duties. The current system and application of FICA \ncoverage does not make Pennsylvania institutions as competitive with \nother out of state graduate programs.\n  If a student or graduate student compares their employment earning \npossibilities with other states, Pennsylvania students are at a \ndistinct disadvantage. At a time in young adults' lives when resources \nare usually limited, it makes practical sense to free up more funds for \nstudent employees who are working hard toward their educational goals.\n  Today, colleges and universities are being called upon to downsize \nand make better use of dollars. This legislation is an easy way to \nsupport individuals who are attaining goals while attending \nPennsylvania state-related universities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATFIELD:\n  S. 2045. A bill to provide regulatory relief for small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n           the national small business regulatory relief act\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, one of the most common small business \ncomplaints my constituents bring to my attention is the issue of \nburdensome government regulations. As we all recognize, small \nbusinesses rarely have the expertise or resources necessary to keep up \nto date with changing Federal requirements. Consequently, many small \nbusinesses are not in compliance with Federal regulations and face \npotential fines. Fines or costly compliance procedures can be \ndevastating to small businesses which characteristically operate at a \nvery narrow profit margin.\n  All across this Nation conscientious small business owners are \nfrustrated with Federal regulations simply because they cannot get \nconcise and specific answers to their compliance questions. How can we \nrealistically expect to increase environmental protection, work place \nsafety or tax compliance, if these respective agency's regulations are \nso complex that professionals in these fields cannot determine the \nmeanings and applications of these rules? While our regulatory reform \nefforts have done much to change the rulemaking process and the sheer \nvolume of regulations, very little has been done to translate rules \nwritten by bureaucrats into easy to understand language that the owner \nof any small firm can implement.\n  Mr. President, according to a 1995 study by the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy, 94 percent of small businesses \nwere unsure of what they needed to do to comply with Federal \nregulations. The same study revealed that it is difficult, if not \nimpossible, for small businesses to obtain concise answers to \ncompliance questions from a Federal agency. It is no wonder that so \nmany business owners, who have honestly believed they were in \ncompliance, have either lost or had their businesses crippled because \nthey were uninformed or misunderstood Federal regulations which applied \nto them.\n  Congress has considered several proposals which would scale back \nintrusive Federal regulations. However, we must realize that Federal \nregulations will continue in some capacity. Consequently, it is vital \nto establish a mechanism which assists small businesses in complying \nwith these regulations.\n  The Small Business Development Centers have established themselves as \na valuable resource for small businesses. They have an existing network \nof over 950 centers nationwide which have been providing education and \ntechnical assistance to small business owners for years.\n  The Oregon Small Business Development Center Network has \ndistinguished itself as a national model of how SBDC's can play an \nintegral role in ensuring the success of small businesses. In April \n1995 I conducted a field hearing in Portland, OR on a proposal to \nexpand the responsibilities of the SBDC's to include regulatory \ncompliance assistance. At that hearing, I heard from several Oregon \nsmall business owners who testified about their experience with the \nOregon Small Business Development Center Network and the positive \nbenefits these centers have had on small businesses in the State of \nOregon.\n  The proposal to accomplish a shift in Federal regulatory policy from \nenforcement to education was at a conceptual stage at the time of the \nOregon field hearing. However, this idea was extremely intriguing and \nthe small business owners who discussed this issue were impressive in \nconveying their vision for the future of this proposal. Since that \ntime, I have worked with the National Association of Small Business \nDevelopment Center and the Director of the Oregon SBDC Network to \ndevelop this concept into the legislation I am introducing today.\n  The National Small Business Regulatory Relief Act provides \ncomprehensive regulatory assistance to small firms by enlisting the \nnationwide network of over 950 Small Business Development Centers \n(SBDC's). Over 550,000 small businesses each year seek SBDC\n\n[[Page S9606]]\n\nhelp in drafting business plans and expansion strategies, developing \nfinancing and marketing tactics, improving management and personnel \nskills, and addressing many other business needs. The locally \ncontrolled and managed SBDC network's long-standing confidentiality \npolicy and its proven track record of success make it an ideal, cost-\neffective and user-friendly delivery system for meaningful compliance \nassistance. Even though SBDC's are funded by all 50 States and the \nFederal Government they do not have enough resources to provide the \nregulatory help small businesses so desperately need.\n  Mr. President this legislation provides the resources necessary to \nexpand SBDC assistance, creating a one-stop shop business resource that \ncan explain how a company's marketing, finance, personnel, \ninternational trade, procurement and technology strategies comport with \nthe regulatory requirements of EPA, OSHA, and IRS. The result will be a \nholistic delivery system of business assistance that will not only \nincrease compliance with today's regulations, but will help small \nbusinesses bring about a cleaner environment, safer work place and \nbetter tax compliance. Most importantly, by utilizing the vast SBDC \nnetwork, the cost of making comprehensive regulatory assistance \navailable to all of America's small businesses is minimized for a \nprogram of this magnitude.\n  This legislation authorizes appropriations to the Occupational Safety \nand Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nInternal Revenue Service to accomplish the goals I described earlier. \nHowever, I would like to point out that similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives which directs each of these \nthree Federal agencies to set-aside a percentage of their overall \nbudget for SBDC compliance assistance activities. While I sympathize \nwith the intentions of the House sponsors of this measure to use \nexisting funds for this program, as Chairman and a longtime member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee I feel the appropriations process \nis the proper way to distribute Federal discretionary dollars. I \nbelieve that the goals of this proposal can be accomplished using \nexisting Federal dollars.\n  Mr. President, America's small businesses are frustrated by the \ncurrent Federal regulatory situation and have been pleading for help. \nThe National Small Business Regulatory Relief Act is a creative \napproach towards balancing economic growth with regulatory compliance. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in this important effort to assist our \nNation's small businesses in complying with Federal regulations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Oregon Small Business \nDevelopment Center Network in support of this legislation be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             Oregon Small Business\n\n\n                                   Development Center Network,\n\n                                      Eugene, OR, January 8, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: Thank you for taking time from your \n     busy schedule to meet with me and John Eskildsen regarding \n     the Oregon Small Business Development Center Network and the \n     National Small Business Extension Network proposal. We \n     appreciate your strong support and advocacy for the OSBDCN \n     and the NSBEN proposal.\n       I believe that the NSBEN proposal represents a tremendous \n     opportunity to reduce the federal regulatory burden on small \n     business while simultaneously reducing the federal budget. \n     This legislation, if enacted, will enable small business \n     owners in Oregon and throughout the United States to meet \n     federal regulatory standards without fear of reprisal.\n       Thank you again for your leadership and support for small \n     business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Sandy Cutler,\n\n                             State Director, Oregon Small Business\n                                       Development Center Network.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 2046. A bill to amend section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to allow a credit for qualified fuels produced from wells drilled \nduring 1997, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the marginal well drilling incentive act of 1996\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I offer a bill that is very \nimportant to my State of West Virginia, and can benefit the entire \nNation. This very small bill will have a very big impact on the ability \nof small oil and gas producers in my State and across the Nation to \ncompete. The bill creates a new tax incentive, modeled on the old \nsection 29 tax credit, to help small marginal well drillers.\n  I offer this with a measure of frustration, based on the fact that \nwhile Congress managed to incorporate a great number of narrowly \ntargeted amendments into the small business tax bill passed today, the \nfinal bill did not include this provision that I propose today. I am \npleased that the tax package includes an extension of the part of \nsection 29 dealing with facilities that manufacture gas from biomass \nand coal. That is helpful to a variety of States, including West \nVirginia. But for less than one tenth the cost of that provision, we \ncould and should have done something to help drillers get gas from \ndevonian shale and other nonconventional sources.\n  The original section 29 credit for drilling expired in 1992 after \nsome of the larger gas companies in this country put emphasis on \ngetting relief from the alternative minimum tax instead of renewing \nsection 29. They got that, but it didn't help a lot of the smaller \ndrillers, which happen to include most of the gas producers in West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I'd like the record to show that since the credit \nexpired, drilling for margin gas wells in West Virginia has dropped off \nby more than 30 percent. In 1992, the last year of the credit, 760 \nwells were drilled in West Virginia. By 1995, that number had fallen to \n530 wells. In that same timeframe, the number of rigs actively drilling \nwells in the Appalachian basin declined from 73 to 45--a 48-percent \ndecline. That translates directly into jobs, as the average rig employs \nabout 25 people. When you add to that all the jobs associated with a \nwell (from transportation to bookkeeping), you have a job loss of more \nthan 1,500 in the Appalachian Basin, which stretches from New York to \nKentucky, and from Ohio to Virginia.\n  Mr. President, this is about more than jobs. I have spoken in the \npast of the great problem our Nation has with oil dependency. Following \nthe oil shocks of the 1970's, Congress made a concerted effort to help \nease our dependency on foreign energy sources. That effort showed much \nsuccess in the 1980's when imports fell by more than 40 percent from \n1970's highs. However, the 1990's have seen import totals steadily \nrise, to today when more than 50 percent of our oil is imported. In \nfact, Mr. President, the biggest 1-year rise in imports since 1986 came \nin the year following the expiration of section 29, in 1993.\n  The Senate knows well the problem raised by energy dependency. The \nGulf war was fought largely to protect our foreign oil sources in the \nMiddle East, and 19 brave American soldiers died in June for that very \nsame cause. Our energy dependency, in addition to years of cheap oil \nand an exceptionally harsh winter, also led to the outrage earlier this \nspring when gas prices at the pump rose steeply.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, it is important that we foster \nthe development of new sources of domestic energy. Gas in my State, and \nmany others, is hard to get at. It is locked in rock formations that \nyield their fuel much more slowly, and at lower profits, than wells in \nthe oil patch out West.\n  This bill is specifically designed to offer a very modest incentive \nto those producers, when the price of natural gas gets so low that they \ncan't make a profit from their wells. Unlike the original section 29, \nthe credit will be available only for the first 10 million cubic feet \nof gas produced each year by each well. Additionally, the credit will \nonly be available to wells that produce less than 100 million cubic \nfeet of gas per year.\n  Mr. President, I have intentionally limited the scope of this bill so \nthat it is only available to smaller wells, and only there, for a \nlimited amount of gas. The idea behind this bill is not to have a big \ngiveaway for big oil and gas producers. But instead, it is designed to \ngive a little bit of insurance to risk-taking drillers who make their \nliving tilling nonconventional sources for fuel.\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\n  This is a modest bill, but one that can make a big difference in \ncertain places that have the potential for more prosperity, more job \ngrowth, and more economic growth like West Virginia. Reviving and \nrevising section 29 will put an incentive in place to seize more of \nthis potential while reducing the entire country's dependence in \nforeign oil. I urge the Senate to find a way to make this bill a \nreality--the sooner, the better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Pressler, Mr. Pryor, \n        Mr. Nickles, and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 2047.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Conrad, Pressler, Pryor, Nickles, and Baucus that would make \npermanent the current moratorium on the application of the pension \nnondiscrimination rules to State and local government pension plans.\n  For nearly 20 years, State and local government pension plans have \nbeen deemed to satisfy the complex nondiscrimination rules of the \nInternal Revenue Code for qualified retirement plans until Treasury can \nfigure out how or if these rules are applicable to unique Government \npension plans. This bill simply puts an end to this stalled process and \ndispels over 20 years of uncertainty for administrators of State and \nlocal retirement plans. Let me summarize the evolution of this issue \nand why this bill is being introduced today.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has a long-established policy \nof encouraging tax deferred retirement savings. Most retirement plans \nthat benefit employees are employer sponsored tax deferred retirement \nplans. Over the years, Congress has required that these plans meet \nstrict nondiscrimination standards designed to ensure that they do not \nprovide disproportionate benefits to business owners, officers, or \nhighly compensated individuals.\n  In response to the growing popularity of employer sponsored tax \ndeferred pension plans, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act [ERISA] in 1974 to enhance the rules governing pension \nplans. However, during consideration of ERISA Congress recognized that \nnondiscrimination rules for private pension plans were not readily \napplicable to public pension plans because of the unique nature of \ngovernmental employers. Former Representative Ullman, during Ways and \nMeans Committee consideration of ERISA, stated, ``The committee \nexempted Government plans from the new higher requirements because \nadequate information is not now available to permit a full \nunderstanding of the impact these new requirements would have on \nGovernmental plans.'' Thus, Congress was not prepared to apply \nnondiscrimination rules to public plans. After studying the issue, the \nInternal Revenue Service on August 10, 1977, issued News Release IR-\n1869, which stated that issues concerning discrimination under State \nand local government retirement plans would not be raised until further \nnotice. Thus, an indefinite moratorium was placed on the application of \nthe new rules to government plans.\n  In 1986, Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which made \nfurther changes to pension laws and the general nondiscrimination \nrules. On May 18, 1989, the Department of the Treasury, in proposed \nregulations, lifted the 12-year public sector moratorium and required \nthat public sector plans comply with the new rules immediately. \nHowever, further examination revealed, and Treasury and the IRS \nrecognized, that a separate set of rules was required for State and \nlocal government plans because of their unique features. Consequently, \nthrough final rules issued in September 1991, the Treasury \nreestablished the moratorium on a temporary basis until January 1, \n1993, and solicited comments for consideration. In addition, government \npension plans were deemed to satisfy the statutory nondiscrimination \nrequirements for years prior to 1993. Since then, the moratorium has \nbeen extended three more times, the latest of which began this year and \nis in effect until 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, here we are, in August 1996, 22 years since the \npassage of ERISA and State and local government pension plans are still \nliving under the shadow of having to comply with the cumbersome, \ncostly, and complex nondiscrimination rules. Experience over the past \n20 years has shown that the existing nondiscrimination rules have \nlimited utility in the public sector. Furthermore, the long delay in \naction illustrates the seriousness of the problem and the doubtful \nissuance of nondiscrimination regulations by the Department of the \nTreasury.\n  Mr. President, last year during consideration of another extension of \nthe moratorium, a coalition of associations representative of State and \nlocal governmental plans summarized their current position in a letter \nto IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson dated October 13, 1995.\n\n       In our discussions with Treasury over the past two years, \n     there have been no abuses or even significant concerns \n     identified that would warrant the imposition of such a \n     cumbersome thicket of federal rules on public plans that \n     already are the subject of State and local government \n     regulation.\n       Accordingly, while we always remain open to further \n     discussion, as our Ways and Means statement indicates the \n     experience of the past two years in working with Treasury to \n     develop a sensible and workable set of nondiscrimination \n     rules for governmental plans has convinced us that the task \n     ultimately is a futile one--portending tremendous cost, \n     complexity, and disruption of sovereign State operations in \n     the absence of any identifiable problem.\n\n  Mr. President, the sensible conclusion of this 20 year exercise is to \nadmit that the Treasury is not likely to issue regulations for State \nand local pension plans and Congress should make the temporary \nmoratorium permanent.\n  Furthermore, there are examples to support this legislation. Relief \nfrom the pension nondiscrimination rules is not a new concept. \nMultiemployer plans are currently not covered by the nondiscrimination \nrules under the theory that labor-management collective bargaining will \nensure nondiscriminatory treatment to rank-and-file workers. In \nreality, Mr. President, State and local government pension plans face \nan even higher level of scrutiny. State law generally requires publicly \nelected legislators to amend the provisions of a public plan. Electoral \naccountability to the voters and media scrutiny serve as protections \nagainst abusive and discriminatory benefits.\n  Moreover, further precedent exists for Congress to grant relief from \nthe nondiscrimination rules. In 1986, the Congress established the \nThrift Savings Fund for Federal employees. As originally enacted, the \nFund was required to comply with the 401(k) nondiscrimination rules on \nemployee contributions and matching contributions to the fund. However, \nin 1987, as part of a Continuing Appropriations Act for 1988, the \nCongress passed a provision that made these nondiscrimination rules \ninapplicable to the Federal Thrift Savings Fund. Thus, Congress has \nreaffirmed the need to treat Governmental pension plans as unique.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not sweeping nor does it grant any \nnew treatment to these plans. Because of moratorium, governmental plans \nare currently treated as satisfying the nondiscrimination rules. \nLifting the moratorium would impose on governmental pension plans the \ncostly task of testing for discrimination when no significant abuses or \nconcerns exist. In fact, finally imposing these rules may require \nbenefits to be reduced for State and local government employees and \nforce costly modifications to these retirement plans. This legislation \ncoincides with the principle of allowing a State to enjoy the right to \ndetermine the compensation of its employees.\n  Mr. President, with another expiration of the moratorium looming in \nthe future, I believe it is time to address this issue. I am under no \ndelusion that it will be resolved quickly. The complexities of these \nrules and the uniqueness of governmental plans have brought us to where \nwe are today. I believe that as members better understand the history \nof this issue they will agree with us that the appropriate step is to \nend this uncertainty and make the temporary moratorium permanent.\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 552 of title 5, United States Code \n(commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), to provide \nfor disclosure of information relating to individuals who committed \nNazi war crimes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                       war crimes disclosure act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators D'Amato \nand Dodd in introducing the War Crime Disclosure Act. This legislation \nis a companion measure to a bill pending in the House, H.R. 1281, \nsponsored by Representative Maloney.\n  The measure is a simple one. It requires the disclosure of \ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act regarding individuals \nwho participated in Nazi war crimes.\n  Ideally, such documents would be made available to the public without \nfurther legislation and without having to go through the slow process \ninvolved in getting information through the Freedom of Information Act \n[FOIA]. Unfortunately this is not the case. Researchers seeking \ninformation on Nazi war criminals are denied access to relevant \nmaterials in the possession of the United States Government, even when \nthe disclosure of these documents no longer pose a threat to national \nsecurity--if indeed they ever did.\n  With the passing of time it becomes ever more important to document \nNazi war crimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. \nThe greater access which this legislation will provide will add clarity \nof this important effort. I applaud those researchers who continue to \npursue this important work.\n  I would also like to call to the attention of my colleagues the \nexcellent work of the Office of Special Investigations of the \nDepartment of Justice. This office has a monumental task and I would \nnot wish to add to that burden or divert its officials from their \nprimary goal of pursuing Nazi war criminals. To that end, I would note \nthat this legislation does not apply to the Office of Special \nInvestigations, as it is not identified in paragraph (1)(B) of the bill \nas a ``specified agency.'' I would also add that there is a provision \nin the bill which specifically prohibits the disclosure of information \nwhich would compromise the work of the Office of Special \nInvestigations.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Representative Maloney for her \noriginal work on this subject in the House of Representatives. I would \nalso thank Senators D'Amato and Dodd for joining me in this effort here \nin the Senate. Finally, I would be remiss if I did not pay special \ntribute to A.M. Rosenthal, whose indefatigable efforts on this subject \nare as admirable as they are effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2048\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution with my colleague Senator Feinstein and to give a few \nremarks on the Holocaust. Mr. President, many Americans probably have \nthe opinion that we have closed the door on the Holocaust. In fact, we \nhave a museum here in Washington that stands as a reminder of this \nblack mark in our history. Unfortunately, the very submission of this \nconcurrent resolution tells us that this chapter has not yet been \nclosed.\n  By way of background, my father- and mother-in-law, Dr. Ken and Betty \nLee Garver, have done extensive research on the medical history of Nazi \nwar time. In their continued work within the medical community, they \nhave come in contact with Dr. Michael Franzblau from California. It is \nDr. Franzblau who brought to our attention the background and history \nof a German doctor who was a member of the Nazi party and referred many \nof Germany's disabled and afflicted to ``healing centers'' or death \ncamps during the 1940's.\n  Of the millions of victims of World War II, it is the faces of the \nchildren we remember most, like the face of Babette Frowis. Babette \nFrowis was a 14-year-old child who suffered from epilepsy. She was sent \nto the Schoenbrunn Sanitarium in 1943 when Adolf Hitler began \n``cleansing'' the German race. The Medical Director of the Sanitarium, \nDr. Hans Joachim Sewering, then transferred her to the Healing Center \nat Eglfing-Haar on October 26, 1943. Twenty-one days later, on November \n16, 1943, she was pronounced dead.\n  Babette Frowis was not the only one. It is estimated that between \n1942 and 1945, 909 patients, the overwhelming majority of whom were \nchildren, were transferred to the ``Healing Center'' for extermination, \nunder Dr. Sewerings' command. At Eglfing-Haar, the children were \nsubjected to a mixture of starvation and an overdose of a sleeping \ndrug, Luminal. Authorities at the center saw this method as a low cost \nway of disposing of disabled children.\n  Dr. Sewering was a member of the Nazi party, as well as the Medical \nDirector of the Sanitarium. When the war ended, Dr. Sewering went on to \nenjoy a full and rewarding medical career in Bavaria. In 1993 he became \nthe president-elect of the World Medical Association, but after protest \nhe resigned. Shortly after this, the Department of Justice placed Dr. \nSewering on the ``watch list'' thereby preventing his entry into the \nUnited States. Dr. Sewering, at the age of 78, still practices medicine \nin Bavaria.\n  I have been in contact with the German Ambassador on this matter \nrequesting an explanation and information on behalf of the German \nGovernment as to why Dr. Sewering has not been investigated and why the \ndocuments regarding the transfer of patients have not been made public. \nThis concurrent resolution expresses the Sense of Congress that the \nGerman Government should investigate and prosecute Dr. Sewering for his \nwar crimes of active euthanasia and crimes against humanity committed \nduring World War II.\n  I appreciate the interest and joint sponsorship of Senator Feinstein, \nand look forward to working with her as we continue to draw the \nattention of Congress to this situation and ultimately action by the \nGerman Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9609-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 70--DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, today Senator Leahy and I announced \nthat we will propose legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act, \nwhich establishes the ground rules for commodity futures trading in the \nUnited States. Our decision to proceed with legislation follows a \npublic hearing on June 5 and extensive discussions with industry and \nfederal regulators.\n  I commend Senator Leahy for his bipartisan cooperation in this as in \nso many other matters. In order that our colleagues and the general \npublic may understand the legislation we plan to introduce, I ask that \na statement issued earlier today by the two of us be printed in the \nRecord. I further ask that a letter signed by the two of us and \naddressed to Acting CFTC Commissioner Tull also be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n Reforming and Updating the Commodity Exchange Act: Outline of Planned \n                              Legislation\n\n       The Commodity Exchange Act has benefited the American \n     economy. It has helped encourage a dynamic, world-class \n     futures trading industry that allows farmers, ranchers and \n     other business operators to manage risk, provides investment \n     opportunities and offers protection to consumers of its \n     services. From time to time, Congress has re-examined the Act \n     to bring it up to date with changing markets. Such an update \n     is now opportune.\n       On June 5, the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n     Forestry heard testimony on the need to update the Commodity \n     Exchange Act. Since then, committee staff have consulted \n     extensively with federal agencies and private industry, \n     seeking to explore the implications of legislative proposals \n     by various groups.\n       As a result of this thorough process, we have decided to \n     introduce legislation to amend the Commodity Exchange Act. \n     Because it is late in the legislative session, it is unlikely \n     the bill we introduce will become law this year. We intend it \n     to spark discussion, with the aim of completing work on \n     revisions to the Act in 1997.\n       In considering possible legislation, we have been ably \n     advised by CFTC staff. While the CFTC is unconvinced that new \n     legislation is needed, commission officials have cooperated \n     with our staff whenever they have been asked. We want to \n     thank them publicly for this assistance.\n       In addition, commission staff have been receptive to \n     addressing some issues through administrative action. \n     Although some reforms we propose are beyond the scope of the \n     commission's current statutory authorities, others could be \n     resolved without legislation. We encourage the CFTC to work \n     toward this end.\n       There is a public interest in a strong, competitive U.S. \n     futures industry because of its critical role in price \n     discovery and business risk management. This public interest \n     implies, and requires, a degree of regulation. In recent \n     years, U.S. futures exchanges have also faced increasing \n     competition from foreign exchanges and from over-the-counter \n     derivative products.\n       U.S. exchanges face some regulatory costs that are not \n     borne by their competitors. The Act, and the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission's actions to implement its \n     requirements, must strike an appropriate balance between \n     prudent regulation and the need for a cost-competitive \n     industry.\n       We will introduce legislation in September. The reason for \n     delaying introduction is a provision of the Act called the \n     ``Treasury amendment.'' The amendment excludes certain \n     transactions from the CFTC's jurisdiction and has been the \n     subject of varying interpretations since it was first \n     enacted. Many firms and associations have requested that \n     Congress clarify the Treasury amendment, and we agree that \n     clarification is in order.\n       The CFTC and the Treasury Department have been working to \n     arrive at a common interpretation of the Treasury amendment. \n     We believe it is wise to give them, and other relevant \n     agencies, a chance to complete these discussions before \n     making a legislative proposal. Therefore, we are writing to \n     Secretary Rubin and Acting Chairman Tull to encourage their \n     agencies to complete their discussions and advise us of their \n     progress. If these conclusions suggest a need to modify the \n     Treasury amendment, we will strongly consider incorporating \n     those modifications into the bill we introduce.\n       In order for our colleagues to have an opportunity to \n     examine the legislation before this session of Congress ends, \n     we will need to introduce the bill in the first week Congress \n     returns from the August recess, that is the week ending \n     September 6. Therefore, we would like to receive the \n     Administration's counsel before the Labor Day holiday.\n       It is premature to propose a specific change to the \n     Treasury amendment. However, we can say that we do not intend \n     for the CFTC to become involved in markets where it does not \n     now have any significant role. An example is the ``when-\n     issued'' market in Treasury securities.\n       We invite public comment during August on the legislative \n     proposals we will outline in this statement. The bill we \n     introduce in September will be a discussion document. It \n     might subsequently be scaled back, but it also might be \n     expanded to make additional changes to the Act. It will be \n     neither an opening gambit nor a least common denominator. It \n     will represent our best judgment of how the Act should \n     prudently be changed, but our minds remain open to other \n     approaches.\n       The committee's work on the Commodity Exchange Act has been \n     bipartisan and collegial. Like the 1996 farm bill, the \n     landmark food safety legislation now on the President's desk, \n     and other important laws originated by the committee, this \n     legislative effort is one on which we will work together.\n       A summary of planned legislative provisions follows.\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\n       Considerations required in regulatory actions.--For each \n     significant regulation it imposes (not including enforcement, \n     emergency and similar actions), the CFTC will be directed to \n     take into account both the anticipated costs and the \n     anticipated benefits of the action it contemplates, and to \n     explain publicly its evaluation of the various costs and \n     benefits. In weighing costs and benefits, CFTC will consider \n     whether the proposed action, taken as a whole, will promote \n     customer protection, market integrity and efficiency, fair \n     competition and sound risk management. The provision will \n     apply to actions commenced after the date of enactment, \n     and will require an evaluation, not a cost-benefit \n     analysis in the strict, quantitative sense.\n       Audit trail.--The bill will clarify the intent of Congress \n     that the audit trail statute does not mandate the development \n     or adoption of any particular technology, but establishes a \n     performance standard. This clarification will be consistent \n     with 1995 Senate testimony by then-Chairman Mary Schapiro.\n       Contract designation.--The legislation will end the \n     requirement that proposed futures contracts be pre-approved \n     by the CFTC before trading can commence. Instead, the bill \n     will provide that exchanges must submit information about \n     contracts they intend to trade to the CFTC, which will have a \n     reasonable but limited period to examine the proposed \n     contract terms. The CFTC will analyze the information with a \n     presumption in favor of allowing the contract to trade. \n     However, within the examination period, the CFTC may require \n     additional information, or delay the start of trading for a \n     limited time, if it finds reason to believe the contract is \n     susceptible to manipulation, violates the Act or is contrary \n     to the public interest. Ultimately, the CFTC would have the \n     ability to prevent a contract from trading, but only after \n     instituting proceedings to disallow the exchange from \n     commencing trading. Comments are invited on the appropriate \n     length for the periods specified above.\n  Similar procedures would apply to other proposed exchange rules. \nCommittee report language will direct the CFTC to report, on an ongoing \nbasis, its evaluation of how well exchange governing bodies meet the \nstatutory requirement for meaningful representation of a diversity of \ninterests.\n       Disciplinary actions and penalties.--The bill will state \n     the sense of Congress that, in deploying enforcement \n     resources, the CFTC should avoid unnecessary duplication of \n     effort in areas where self-regulatory organizations also have \n     enforcement duties, while ensuring a CFTC presence and role \n     sufficient to safeguard market integrity and customer \n     interests. The CFTC will be directed to report to Congress on \n     its enforcement program. The report is to include an analysis \n     of the CFTC's performance in preventing, deterring and \n     disciplining violations of the CEA that involve fraud against \n     individual investors through ``bucket shops'' and similar \n     abuses. The report will be due a year after enactment, and \n     may follow one or more commission round tables on the \n     subject.\n       Exemptive authority.--The bill will direct the CFTC to re-\n     evaluate its Part 36 Rules (which allow exchanges to set up \n     less-regulated professionals-only markets in certain limited \n     circumstances) in light of the need to provide equitable \n     competitive conditions among various participants in \n     derivative product markets. Any revisions to the rules would \n     remain within the CFTC's discretion. The bill will also state \n     the sense of Congress that any revisions should ensure the \n     financial integrity of markets and customer protection. The \n     CFTC will be encouraged to convene a round table meeting or \n     meetings to receive public input on possible improvements in \n     Part 36 Rules.\n       Swaps exemption.--The statute will be amended to enhance \n     the legal certainty of contracts involving swaps and similar \n     products. Products meeting the requirements of the CFTC's \n     1993 swaps exemption will be exempt from the Act's provisions \n     to the same extent as at present. The provision will not \n     diminish the CFTC's authority to grant additional \n     exemptions. In addition, the bill will end the current \n     prohibition on granting an exemption from CEA regulation \n     to any transactions subject to the Shad-Johnson accord \n     (which establishes CFTC and SEC jurisdiction on such \n     products as stock index futures). Instead, the bill will \n     allow the CFTC to exempt such products, but only with the \n     concurrence of the Securities and Exchange Commission. \n     Comments are invited on additional or alternative means of \n     enhancing the legal certainty of contracts while assuring \n     market integrity.\n       Definition of a hedge.--The statute will be amended to \n     clarify that a hedge may be established to reduce risks other \n     than price risks. The bill will make clear that the change \n     does not affect the ability of exchanges and the CFTC to \n     establish speculative limits, require reporting of large \n     trader positions and otherwise discharge their \n     responsibilities.\n       Delivery by Federally licensed warehouses.--The bill will \n     repeal an outdated provision that allows any federally \n     licensed warehouse to deliver grain against a futures \n     contract, even if it is not a designated delivery point. The \n     current statute could allow market manipulation in some \n     circumstances.\n       Delivery points for foreign futures contracts.--The CFTC \n     will be directed to commence negotiations with appropriate \n     foreign agencies which regulate exchanges that have \n     established delivery points in the U.S., with the goal of \n     securing adequate assurance (through improvements in the \n     foreign regulatory scheme or other means) that the presence \n     of U.S. delivery points for foreign exchange contracts does \n     not create the potential for market manipulation or other \n     disruptions of U.S. markets. The CFTC will also be granted \n     additional powers, if necessary, to obtain needed information \n     on such delivery points. Comments are invited on the \n     appropriate scope of additional authorities, if any, required \n     by the CFTC to ensure that U.S. markets are not subject to \n     manipulation.\n       Delegation of authority.--The bill will state the sense of \n     Congress that the CFTC should review its authorities with a \n     view to delegating additional duties to the National Futures \n     Association or other self-regulatory bodies, requiring a \n     report one year after enactment on the results of the review. \n     Report language will state that among the duties the CFTC may \n     consider delegating are the review of disclosure documents \n     and reparations procedures. The statute will further state \n     the sense of Congress that in making any additional \n     delegations, the CFTC should establish a procedure of spot \n     checks, random audits or other means of ensuring adequate \n     performance, and may also make the delegation on a pilot \n     basis.\n       Treasury amendment.--The bill's provisions to modify the \n     Treasury amendment (an exemption from CEA regulation for the \n     interbank currency markets and some other markets) will be \n     drafted following review of suggestions received by the \n     Administration.\n       Technical changes.--The bill may also include technical \n     changes to the Act such as those suggested by the National \n     Futures Association in its June 5 testimony.\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 1996.\n     Hon. John Tull,\n     Acting Chairman, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We were heartened to learn that the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Treasury \n     Department have been discussing the so-called ``Treasury \n     amendment'' to the Commodity Exchange Act, with a view toward \n     arriving at a common interpretation of the provision. At a \n     hearing our committee held June 5, the Treasury amendment was \n     cited by several witnesses as a provision of the Act that \n     needed review and clarification.\n       We intend to introduce legislation that will make a number \n     of changes to the Act, and believe it is appropriate to \n     address the Treasury amendment in that bill. It would be \n     highly desirable to have the benefit of the Treasury and the \n     CFTC's joint advice in this regard.\n       In order for our colleagues to have adequate opportunity to \n     review the bill this fall, we intend to introduce it in the \n     first week Congress returns from its August recess, that is \n     the week ending September 6, 1996. We would appreciate \n     hearing from relevant federal agencies their views on the \n     Treasury amendment before the Labor Day holiday, if possible. \n     However, we are confident you share our strong hope that \n     agencies will resolve any differences by that time and arrive \n     at a common understanding, so that the statute's provisions \n     and scope can be made clear.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter. A similar \n     letter has been sent to Secretary Rubin.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Patrick J. Leahy,\n       Ranking Democratic Member.\n     Richard G. Lugar,\n       Chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9620-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9621-S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONNECTICUT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE T. CLARK HULL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nConnecticut's most colorful and witty politicians, Connecticut State \nSupreme Court Justice T. Clark Hull. Known for his penetrating \nintelligence and passion for justice--and perhaps better known for his \nwarmth and good spirit--T. Clark Hull, had the rare distinction of \nserving at the top levels of all three branches of state government--\nexecutive, legislative and judicial.\n  Born in Danbury, CT in 1921, T. Clark Hull attended many prestigious \nacademic institutions including Philips Exeter Academy, Yale University \nand Harvard Law School, and yet he always retained the perspective of a \ncommon man.\n  His political career spanned some 33 years, beginning with his \nelection to the Connecticut State Senate in 1962. He was known as a \nliberal Republican who charmed many conservatives, and his Irish humor \nand zest for public service eventually earned him the\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\nnomination for Lieutenant Governor in 1970. He went on to win the \nelection as the running mate of Thomas J. Meskill and served until his \nappointment to the Connecticut Superior Court. After serving for 10 \nyears, he was nominated by Governor William A. O'Neill to the Appellate \nCourt and served for 4 years before becoming a justice on the highest \ncourt in Connecticut on September 25, 1987.\n  Justice Hull's political career earned him the reputation for being a \ngifted writer and captivating speaker and a colleague once said his \ndecisions would ``forever enrich the literature of the law.'' Justice \nHull had great aspirations for the people of Connecticut and was one of \nthe few politicians who managed to be well-liked on both sides of the \naisle. Throughout his illustrious career, he maintained an optimistic \nactivism that continually propelled the interests of Connecticut and \nits people forward. Justice Hull was a dedicated public servant who \n``had an enthusiasm for public office that was contagious.''\n  Justice Hull was a champion of the people and was one of the few to \ntruly believe that government and politics should be ``positive, \nenergizing celebrations of life.'' Although he was small in stature, T. \nClark Hull's charming personality and exuberance for serving the public \nmade him a giant in the eyes of others. Upon retiring from the State \nSupreme Court in 1991, when he reached the mandatory retirement age of \n70, Justice Hull continued to serve the public as a State referee and \nas co-chairman of a commission to study government efficiency. The \ncommission made many recommendations to streamline government, and \nunder the chairmanship of Justice Hull, Connecticut underwent the \nbiggest reorganization in state government in nearly two decades.\n  T. Clark Hull has doubtless had a distinguished career. While he \ngained prominence as a life-long Connecticut politician, Justice Hull \ngained the respect of his colleagues and the general public for his \ngood humor, exuberance for life, and his love of public service. The \npeople of Connecticut are truly blessed to be able to call T. Clark \nHull one of their own.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Betty Jane, and his three \nsons Steven, Josh, and Treat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9621-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S.S. ``LANDING CRAFT INFANTRY''(G) 450\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nmembers of the U.S.S. Landing Craft Infantry (G) 450. This ship was \ncommissioned August 26, 1943 and participated in three major campaigns \nin the South Pacific during World War II. The U.S.S. Landing Craft \nInfantry (G) 450 was originally designed to carry troops, run up the \nbeach, disembark the assault troops, and then release itself from the \nbeach. This troop carrier was later converted to a gunboat, indicated \nby the symbol (G) in its name. As a gunboat, its primary mission was to \napproach the beach and engage the enemy with rockets and deck guns in \nsupport of its landing forces. Of the three major campaigns that the \n450 was a part of, the ship was damaged only once. For their actions \nduring the Marshall and Marianas campaign, the crew was awarded the \nNavy Unit Citation. The crew also received the Presidential Unit \nCitation for their outstanding performance at Iwo Jima. Five \ncrewmembers received the Bronze Star, and its captain received the Navy \nCross. Mr. President, these men are brave soldiers, and true Americans, \nwho deserve to be remembered and honored for their actions in defense \nof this great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9622-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERMONT AIR NATIONAL GUARD\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on July 1, 1946, 27 World War II \nveterans formed the nucleus of a new military unit, and the Vermont Air \nNational Guard was born. Today, when the 158th Fighter Wing pilots \nstrap into the technological marvel that is the F-16, the Revolutionary \nWar soldier painted on the tail stands as a stark reminder to us all: \nThere is a direct lineage between the militia tradition that our Nation \nwas founded on and which is very much alive today here in Vermont.\n  The original Green Mountain Boys were mostly farmers who left their \nhomes in the 1700's to defend against encroaching New Yorkers and then \nfought enthusiastically against the British in the Revolutionary War. \nThe Vermonters wore homespun civilian clothes, often with only a sprig \nof evergreen in their caps to identify each other in the field.\n  But the Green Mountain Boys were citizen soldiers, and throughout \nmost of our history the American people have relied on the militia to \ndefend them. It has only been in the recent past that we have created a \nlarge peacetime standing army. Now with the former Soviet Union gone, \nwe are seeing a renewed emphasis on National Guard and Reserve forces \nas the Nation's premier insurance against worldwide aggression.\n  When I go to Vermont in the coming weeks, I will be giving the \nVermont Air National Guard a token of my appreciation for the \ntremendous service that they have shown over the last 50 years. The \nlist of aircraft that have been flown by the Vermont Air Guard reads \nlike a who's who of American air power--the P-47 Thunderbolt, the P-51 \nMustang, the F-94 Starfighter, F-89 Scorpion, the F-102 Delta Dagger, \nthe EB-57, the F-4 Phantom, and now the F-16 Falcon. Those who have \nserved in Vermont have different memories depending on the aircraft and \npeople of the time, but the sense of duty has remained constant over \nthe years.\n  Having said that, Randy Green, one of America's most renowned \naviation artists, has painted a very special picture that perfectly \ncaptures the spirit of the Vermont Air Guard. Entitled, ``Vermont \nThunder'' it is a depiction of a Vermont F-16 flying into a stormy \nsunset. To me it represents the great contrasts of flying military \naircraft; the beauty of flight is tempered by the responsibility and \ndanger of military service. It is my sincere hope that this painting \nwill serve as a small reminder to future Air Guard members of our \nState's proud past.\n  As the ultimate reminder of that past, it is fitting that we remember \nhere on the floor of the U.S. Senate the memories of those who paid the \nultimate sacrifice for their service. The following is a list of \nVermont Air National Guardsmen who have died in the line of duty since \n1946:\n  Lieutenant Thomas A. Mundy, Major Carroll A. Phylblo, Lieutenant John \nWilliamson, Lieutenant Francis W. Escott, Colonel Robert P. Goyette, \nLieutenant Jeffrey B. Pollock, Major John J. Ulrich, Captain John A. \nHarrell, Captain Bertrand R. White, Jr., Captain Charles W. Diggle III, \nCaptain Robert W. Noble, Lieutenant Stephen L.C.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe welfare reform bill that passed this body yesterday.\n  Much has been said on the House and Senate floor and in the media \nabout the impact of this bill on children and the working poor. Those \nwho have spoken out against the bill have called it, draconian, and \nlegislative child abuse. Well, I disagree.\n  For the past 61 years we have allowed a program originally designed \nto help families through a difficult time to become a welfare program \nthat discourages able-bodied citizens from working. The current welfare \nsystem takes away the dignity and self respect that comes from earning \nan honest living and has replaced it with generation after generation \nof families dependant on public assistance.\n  In the past 61 years instead of teaching our children about work \nethics, responsibility, hard work and determination, we have taught \nthem how easy it can be to live off public assistance. Now, ladies and \ngentlemen, that is abuse.\n  Everyday men and women get up in the morning, dress their children \nand get them ready for the day. After the morning routine, these same \nmen and women get into their cars and negotiate traffic on their way to \nwork. Everyday these people work long hours to provide for their \nfamilies, pay the bills and if they are lucky put a little money away \nin a college or retirement fund. All this bill asks is that those who \nare able to work try to perform a service for their benefits.\n  The working men and women of America have been doing their part for\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\n61 long years. Now we have the golden opportunity to respond to the \nworking men and women who believed us when we said we would reform the \nwelfare program and to the States that have proven that they can handle \nthe task of administering their own welfare programs. By returning some \nof the power to the States we make it possible to help people out of \npoverty.\n  Colorado is initiating a Personal Responsibility and Employment \nProgram. There are innovative and insightful people in my State as \nthere are in others. These State leaders have shown that there are \nalternatives to Federal control and that they can meet the needs of the \nresidents of the State. The States have the best chance of moving \npeople to work and restoring their self respect.\n  This bill included an amendment concerning the State Appropriation of \nBlock Grant Funds. It ensures States expend block grant funds in the \nsame way in which a State expends its own funds. Consequently, both the \nlegislative and executive branch in the State share control of block \ngrant funds through the appropriations process.\n  In addition, the bill included an amendment that places a 15 percent \ncap on administrative costs. Funds for welfare programs should go to \nindividuals who need help, not to bureaucratic administrators.\n  When the 104th Congress convened in January 1995, we made a promise \nto the American people. We promised to reform the welfare program and \nrein in runaway entitlement spending. I must commend the work of my \ncolleagues for enabling us to keep our word and follow through on our \ncommitment to reform welfare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9622-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CAPT. JOHN WILLIAM KENNEDY\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today, at Arlington National \nCemetery, the remains of Capt. John William Kennedy, U.S. Air Force, \nwill be laid to rest with full military honors. Captain Kennedy's \nmother, brother, relatives and friends will join a grateful Nation in \npaying final tribute to a courageous American who gave his life for his \ncountry.\n  This day and this ceremony are long overdue, Mr. President, because \nCaptain Kennedy lost his life over the Quangtin Province of the \nRepublic of Vietnam. Though his family was told he was missing in \naction on August l6, l97l, he was not confirmed killed in action until \nMay l996.\n  Mr. President, this brings back sad memories for me, because during \nmy own time in Vietnam, families of many of the young men who served \nunder my command received word that their loved ones would not be \ncoming home. But as difficult as this notification was, it was even \nmore difficult for the families who could not learn with certainty the \nfate of their loved ones. The most painful ordeal was ultimately the \nseemingly endless uncertainty of MIA families.\n  With mixed emotions, I note that the terrible ordeal of the Kennedy \nfamily of Arlington, VA, is at last resolved. A sorrowful peace has \nfinally been found.\n  So I rise today, Mr. President, to honor the service rendered to our \ncountry by Capt. John William Kennedy.\n  Captain Kennedy was serving as a forward air controller with the 20th \nTactical Air Support Squadron based in Chu Lai. On August 16, 1971, \nCaptain Kennedy failed to check in during normal radio checks while \nflying a visual reconnaissance mission over the Quangtin Province. He \nwas listed as missing in action until July 1978, when his status was \nchanged to presumed killed in action. Finally, in May of this year, \nafter using new DNA identification techniques, Captain Kennedy's family \nwas notified that his remains have been recovered for burial.\n  Captain Kennedy graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in \nl969 and then joined the U.S. Air Force. He graduated from pilot \ntraining in October 1970, where he was first in his class and was \nawarded the Undergraduate Pilot Training Office Training Award. He then \nreported to O-2A pilot training, and from there was assigned to the \n20th Tactical Air Support Squadron in South Vietnam. He was serving \nthere when his plane disappeared.\n  Captain Kennedy's awards include the Distinguished Flying Cross, the \nPurple Heart, the Air Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Republic of \nVietnam Campaign Medal.\n  Mr. President, Captain Kennedy's distinguished service to his country \nclearly represents the very best of America. I believe I can speak for \nmy colleagues in the U.S. Senate when I pay tribute to his service \ntoday--and when I convey our gratitude to his family for sharing their \nexceptional son with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9623-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9623]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE ARREST OF TWO TAIWAN STUDENTS IN ATLANTA\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I had the pleasure of meeting for \nthe first time yesterday with the new representative from the Taipei \nEconomic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States, Dr. \nJason Chih-chiang Hu. While it was a good opportunity to discuss areas \nof mutual interest, I was concerned to learn about an incident that \noccurred recently at the Olympic Games in Atlanta.\n  On July 31, two Taiwan students--one currently studying at Georgia \nTech, the other a recent graduate of a university in Dallas--were \narrested during the gold medal table tennis match between the People's \nRepublic of China and Taiwan. It is my understanding that the incident \nwas sparked when one of the students waived the national flag of the \nRepublic of China during the hotly contested championship match. The \nother individual was arrested when trying to assist his fellow student \nin resisting police arrest.\n  Mr. President, what began as an innocent, outward show of pride in \nhis country ended with what would appear to be an excessive response. \nIt is my hope that officials in Atlanta will carefully consider this \nsituation and work toward a fair and equitable remedy that will not \nunduly punish these students.\n  Nationalism and love of flag and country are something we as \nAmericans can appreciate. As we look around the various venues at the \nOlympics, I think we all feel a source of pride to see the stars and \nstripes waiving in the stands and being carried by our athletes. What \nwe may not understand is some of the history behind the conditions \nunder which the Republic of China on Taiwan is able to participate in \nthe Olympics.\n  Athletes from Taiwan were banned from participating in the \nInternational Olympic Games in the 1970's due to controversies over the \nname, flag, and national anthem of their team. Later in that decade the \nInternational Olympic Committee amended its charter by striking out all \nreferences to national flags and national anthems. Instead, committee \nflag and committee song of the National Olympic Committee of each \nindividual nation are used to describe the flag and anthem each \nnation's team uses. While almost all National Olympic committees use \ntheir national flag and anthem, the Republic of China, referred to in \nthe Olympics as ``Chinese Taipei,'' are not allowed to use their flag \nand song.\n  Mr. President, this prohibition applies to the Chinese Taipei Olympic \nteam--not its fans. It is my understanding that the charter does not \ncontain references to restrictions on individuals participating as \nspectators in the audience.\n  Mr. President, while I do not have all the final details of this \nsituation, I felt it was worthy of our notice. One purpose of the \nOlympic Games is for the world of nations to gather together in an \nevent that allows us to rise above our differences. While that purpose \nis not always achieved, it is certainly a worthy goal. Therefore, it is \nmy hope that we will see a swift and equitable resolution to this \nunfortunate situation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9623-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9623-S9624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UKRAINIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this year has been an historic one \nfor the nation of Ukraine. Ukraine has adopted a new constitution, has \ntaken part in its first Olympic games, and will celebrate the fifth \nanniversary of its independence from the former Soviet Union.\n  Ukrainian Independence Day, August 24, is a time to remember \nUkraine's past and to look to its future. Since Ukrainian independence \nin 1991, the country has made great strides in many important areas.\n  On June 28, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a new Ukrainian \nconstitution. The new Constitution establishes Ukraine as an \nindependent,\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\ndemocratic nation. The constitution also clearly divides power between \nthe executive and legislative branches.\n  Ukraine has exhibited much economic potential. Working with the \nInternational Monetary Fund, Ukraine is making significant gains in \nhalting hyperinflation and securing an efficient and cost-effective \nsource of energy for the country. A partnership has been established \nwith the European Union which will give Ukraine most-favored-nation \nstatus and other trade advantages, and opens the possibility of a free \ntrade agreement after 1998. Ukraine's natural resources, its heavy \nindustry, and its innovative and hard-working people promise to \ntransform the country into a successful economic partner in the world \nmarketplace.\n  Ukraine has now become a nuclear-free state. Ukraine has faithfully \nfollowed guidelines for the elimination of nuclear weapons under the \nSTART I Treaty and it has ratified the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And, \nin joining the Partnership for Peace Program for NATO membership, \nUkraine has positioned itself to become a member of the strongest \nmilitary alliance in the world.\n  Ukraine's transition to a democratically-governed, free-market \neconomy has not been without its problems. But these strains are \nnatural. The recent assassination attempt on Prime Minister Pavlo \nLazarenko is troubling. However, we expect that the government of \nUkraine will take the necessary steps to see that the rule of law is \nupheld. Ukraine has shown strong leadership in the face of such turmoil \nby pledging itself to adhere to the principles of the Helsinki Final \nAct. This should help ensure that whatever problems Ukraine may \nencounter in the future, it will continue to be an example of respect \nfor civil and human rights in the region.\n  This year, Ukraine joined the world athletic community by fielding \nits first Olympic team. It was heartening to see the joy on the faces \nof Ukraine's athletes as they represented their country in this year's \ncentennial Olympic games. Ukraine's fine athletes graciously \nrepresented the Ukrainian people.\n  The people of Ukraine deserve our admiration and support for the fine \nwork they have done during the past 5 years. I know that the Ukrainian-\nAmerican community in Michigan is in the front ranks of such support. \nUnited States-Ukraine relations are, and will continue to be, an \nimportant part of our national interests.\n  This is an historic time for Ukraine, one in which it is possible to \nwitness its citizens decide for themselves what kind of government and \nwhat kind of future they want for their country. I know my Senate \ncolleagues join me in honoring Ukraine on the fifth anniversary of its \nindependence.\n\n                          ROGER TORY PETERSON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlife of one of Connecticut's pioneers. Roger Tory Peterson devoted his \nlife to the study of birds. Peterson's ``A Field Guide to the Birds,'' \npublished in 1934, revolutionized the concept of field guides by \nintricately depicting distinguishable characteristics of thousands of \nbirds. Often referred to as the ``birder's bible,'' this handbook \nbrought the once eccentric hobby of bird watching to the mainstream.\n  Born 122 years after John James Audubon, Roger Tory Peterson was the \ndefinitive expert on birds in this century. Many people believe he \nbegan the environmental movement by bringing tens of millions of bird \nwatchers outdoors to study birds. Any avid bird watcher looking for the \nillusive bird would not dare go out without one of Peterson's guides in \ntheir pocket.\n  A master of detail, Roger photographed, painted, and identified \nthousands of birds throughout his 60-year career. His descriptions, \nboth in words and drawings, were done with such clarity and precision \nthat the birds came to life on paper. Even today, I continue to marvel \nat his prints, several of which hang in my home in Connecticut.\n  A world renown artist, naturalist, and environmentalist, Peterson \nbelieved that any serious study of natural history would lead people to \ncare about and protect the environment. This philosophy is the backbone \nof the legacy he leaves behind. The Roger Tory Peterson Institute of \nNatural History in Jamestown, NY, is dedicated to educating the public \nand teaching young and old alike about natural history. This center and \nthe guidebooks used by millions of hikers everyday will continue to \npromote environmental awareness for years to come.\n  The people of Connecticut were proud to have Dr. Peterson reside in \nOld Lyme for over 40 years. My parents were honored to know him as a \nneighbor and friend. We will all miss his work and remember him \nfondly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9623-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COACH DON CASEY\n\n   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today concerning one of the \nmost beloved sports figures in Boston, Mr. Don Casey, assistant coach \nof the Boston Celtics. Coach, as he is known to the thousands whose \nlives he has touched, is leaving the Celtics to take on new challenges \nwith the New Jersey Nets.\n  Since arriving in Boston, Coach has had an inspiring influence on the \nfans of the Boston Celtics. Through various charitable endeavors, Coach \nhas affected the lives of thousands of people across the Nation. Most \nrecently, Coach was selected to the Committee of Friends of the Secret \nService, an organization dedicated to raising funds for the surviving \nfamily members of those Federal agents killed in the tragic Oklahoma \nCity bombing. Even the White House has recognized Coach Casey's \ncontributions to the world of sports by selecting him to serve on the \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.\n  Coach Casey has a long and storied career shaping the minds of \nbasketball players of all ages and talent levels. At the age of 20, \nCoach landed his first coaching post at Bishop Eustace High in \nPennsauken, NJ. He led his team to two State championships and was \nselected South Jersey Coach of the Year at age 24. Many of the players \nhe coached at Bishop Eustace went on to successful college careers. \nSoon after achieving remarkable success at the high school level, Coach \nstarted his own impressive college career by being appointed to the \nhead coach slot at Temple University. He led the Owls to several \npostseason tournament berths, including an NIT Championship over Boston \nCollege in 1966. Coach participated in the first NCAA college \nbasketball game played outside of the United States when his Owls \ntraveled to Tokyo, Japan, to take on the UCLA Bruins.\n  Coach broke into the National Basketball Association in 1982 as an \nassistant coach with the Chicago Bulls. The next year, he move to the \nLos Angeles Clippers in the same post. In 1984, Coach became head coach \nfor an Italian league team. He returned to the NBA and the Los Angeles \nClippers as an assistant coach, and in 1989 he was promoted to the head \ncoach slot. He soon traveled to Boston where he has been the assistant \ncoach for six seasons.\n  As Coach prepares to leave the city of Boston, his friends prepare \nfor everyday life without him. Many joggers will be left to find new \nrunning mates, the Boston Celtics' employees will be listening for, but \nnot hearing, the familiar vibrant, bellowing voice that shakes the \nhallways every morning with warm greetings, and the wait staff at his \nfavorite restaurant, Ciao Bella on Newbury Street, will miss the \nenergetic presence that so often electrified the ambience there.\n  Coach Casey is leaving our beloved Boston Celtics to start a new \nchapter in his basketball story. The players, the fans, and the staff \nof the New Jersey Nets are lucky to get him. I wish him the best of \nluck and the greatest success with his new team, unless, of course, the \nNets ever meet the Celtics in the playoffs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9624-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9624-S9625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MOVEMENT TO BAN JUNK GUNS GAINS STRENGTH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, earlier this year I introduced \nlegislation with Senators John Chafee and Bill Bradley to prohibit the \nmanufacture and sale of junk guns--or as they have also been called, \nsaturday night specials. These cheap, poorly constructed, easily \nconcealable firearms pose such a great threat to public safety that \ntheir sale and manufacture should be prohibited.\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\n  Nearly 20 years ago, Congress prohibited the importation of junk \nguns, but allowed their domestic manufacture to soar virtually \nunchecked. Today, 8 of the 10 firearms most frequently traced at crime \nscenes are junk guns that cannot legally be imported. My view is that \nif a gun represents such a threat to public safety that it should not \nbe imported, its domestic manufacture should also be restricted. A \nfirearm's point of origin should be irrelevant.\n  Since the introduction of my legislation, a strong grassroots \nmovement has developed to help get these weapons off the streets. \nThousands of volunteers have worked to educate local, State, and \nFederal elected officials about the issues. The emerging coalition \nagainst junk guns includes law enforcement officials, physicians, \nchildren's advocates, and religious organizations. More than two dozen \nCalifornia police chiefs, including those from California's largest \ncities, have endorsed my legislation.\n  The movement to get these junk guns off the streets is clearly \ngaining steam. Many of California's largest cities, such as San \nFrancisco, Oakland, and San Jose, have enacted local ordinances \nprohibiting the sale of junk guns. Two weeks ago, the mayors of more \nthan a dozen cities from California's East Bay pledged to push for \nlocal junk gun prohibitions in each of their jurisdictions, creating \nthe one of the largest junk-gun-free zones in the country.\n  I am dedicated to working hard on this issue in the 104th Congress \nand beyond. We will get these killer guns off our streets. When \nSenators return to their States over the August recess, I encourage \nthem to discuss this issue with their constituents. I believe they will \nfind that citizens do not support the current junk gun double standard, \nallowing poor quality weapons to be produced domestically, but not \nimported.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9624-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9625-S9627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JAPAN CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an item \nthat is not in the news right now. But that could have significance for \nUnited States construction companies and for United States-Japan trade \nrelations. It has come to my attention that the Japanese Government is \nbuilding a new airport near Nagoya, Japan called the Chubu \nInternational Airport. This multibillion-dollar project will be that \ncountry's largest public works effort for the next decade. The first \nflights are planned for the year 2005.\n  As many of my colleagues are already aware, American construction \ncompanies must be included in any list of our most competitive \ninternational industries. These companies have particular expertise in \nbuilding large airports, having constructed the international airports \nin Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea, among others. Curiously, only in Japan \nhave they been unsuccessful.\n  This is not for lack of trying. American construction, architecture, \nand design engineering firms have been trying to participate in the \nJapanese market for over a decade, with limited success. I have taken \nto the Senate floor many times to complain about how United States \ncompanies were blocked from participating in any meaningful way in the \nconstruction of the Kansai International Airport, despite numerous \npromises from the Japanese Government to allow their participation.\n  But Mr. President, my purpose here is not to recount the sorry tale \nof closed construction markets in Japan. I will just note that we have \ngone through years of negotiations to try to open Japan's construction \nmarket and break their corrupt dango system. In 1994, in the face of \nUnited States sanctions under title VII, Japan agreed to adopt an \naction plan to eliminate the numerous barriers to foreign participation \nin their public works market.\n  And I must say, Mr. President, that the first two reviews of the \naction plan have been very disappointing. In fiscal year 1995, foreign \nfirms won only one construction project, out of a total of 613 let out \nfor bid, and one design project, out of 20. The dedicated commerce \nofficials monitoring Japan's performance indicate that United States \ncompanies still face unsatisfactory restrictions on the size and scope \nof joint-venture consortia that can bid on major procurement projects \nand still face discriminatory prequalification criteria.\n\n  But you don't get anywhere crying over lost opportunities, so today I \ninstead want to use my remarks to point out to the Japanese Government \nthat the Chubu project presents an opportunity for the Government to \ndemonstrate its openness to foreign participation. And, it gives Japan \nthe opportunity to enjoy a world class international airport.\n  In order to make this happen, the procurement agency for Chubu should \nimmediately move to adopt open and competitive bidding procedures as \ncalled for under the United States-Japan bilateral understandings.\n  Mr. President, I will be watching very closely and I fully expect \nUnited States firms to be given equal opportunity to participate, \ncommensurate with their ability.\n  I understand that our Commerce Department officials will travel to \nJapan again in September for further consultations, and I hope that \nthey will receive positive news on the Chubu project.\n\n\n                             Bosnia Policy\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the deployment to Bosnia of the \nInternational Force [IFOR] has passed its midway mark and I would like \nto review with my colleagues what I believe has been accomplished to \ndate, the many questions yet unanswered by the Administration, as well \nas the dangerous pitfalls I see on the road ahead.\n  Mr. President, I was one of those who voted against the deployment of \nU.S. troops to Bosnia, to take part in the NATO-led effort to enforce \nthe military provisions of the Dayton Accord. I was skeptical then, and \nremain so today, of Administration assertions that U.S. strategic \ninterests in Central Europe or in the ``future of NATO'' justified this \ncostly investment of troops and resources abroad. I took with a grain \nof salt Administration promises that U.S. troops would be out of Bosnia \nin a year's time and Administration assurances that it would work to \nlevel the military playing field between Serbs and Muslims.\n  I maintained then--I reiterate today--that it is the Congress--the \nCongress--which had to authorize the deployment, after thorough \nconsultation with the Administration. From all reports coming out of \nBosnia, we are now paying the piper for moving without the careful \ndeliberation and consideration of pros and cons that a real policy \ndebate would have engendered. If the Administration had truly consulted \nwith the Congress--and not simply presented us with a fait accompli--we \nmight have been able to anticipate many of the problems now facing IFOR \nand its parallel civilian institutions. I recognize that the issues and \nproblems are complex and I do not mean to suggest that I or the Senate \nwould have all or even some of the answers.\n  But I did pose a number of questions to the Administration during \nlast year's all-too-brief hearings on the deployment and in the \nsubsequent cursory debate on the Senate floor, in an attempt to focus \npriorities and anticipate problems. But as you know, the decision had \nalready been made to move forward and the Congress sidelined, a sad \nfact I blamed as much on our timidity as the Administration's \ncircumvention of constitutional process.\n  I recognize, Mr. President, that the Dayton Accord and the IFOR \ndeployment to enforce its provision has not been without some real \nbenefit. We can all be grateful that people are no longer dying en \nmasse in Bosnia; U.S. and other IFOR troops are to be applauded for \nhaving largely succeeded in enforcing the military aspects of the \nagreement.\n  The head of the Defense Intelligence Agency [DIA], Lt.Gen. Patrick \nHughes, testified earlier this year that he expected that the parties \nwould continue generally to comply with the military aspects of the \nDayton Accord and with IFOR directives. Hughes ``did not expect'' U.S. \nor allied forces to face organized military resistance; any ``modest'' \nthreat remained limited to mines and sporadic low-level violence, such \nas terrorism. NATO commander Joulwan recently confirmed that many of \nthe peacekeeping tasks delegated to IFOR have been completed, including \noverseeing the transfer of territory, the demobilization of troops and \nthe storage of heavy weapons.\n  But there are disturbing signs, Mr. President, that the progress is \ntransitory and perhaps even an illusion.\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nCompliance is begrudging; ``the spirit of Dayton'' encouraged at the \npoint of NATO arms.\n  In an October 19, 1995 letter to Secretary Perry, I asked just how \ndurable an IFOR-enforced peace would be. Specifically, I asked for some \nassurance that the Serbs had abandoned their quest for a ``Greater \nSerbia'' and that the territorial integrity of Bosnia would be \nprotected.\n  The facts on the ground provide the disturbing answer. General \nHughes, for one, was troubled by the ``fundamentally'' unchanged \nstrategic political goals of the former warring factions; that is, \neventual permanent partition. Upon IFOR's withdrawal, Hughes foresaw: \nBosnian Serbs seeking political confederation with Yugoslavia; Bosnian \nCroats with Zagreb; resistance by Serbs and Croats to efforts of the \nMuslim-led government to assert its authority; collapse of the \n``Federation'' of Croats and Muslims, intended as a counterweight to \nthe Serbian entity created by Dayton, under the mutual hostility of \nMuslim and Croat; and delay or stymie of civil affairs, such as \nelections.\n  In short, Mr. President, there is the real possibility that after a \nnearly $2.8 billion investment just for the deployment of our troops to \nBosnia, we will be back at square one: hostile, ethnically-divided \nfactions facing off at tenuous borders under unstable military, \neconomic and social conditions.\n  In my letter to Secretary Perry and during floor debate, I also \nraised the question of cost, especially in light of how this expensive \ndeployment would undermine efforts to balance the budget. In December, \nthe Congress was told the cost would be roughly $2.0 billion. I \npredicted then that the bill would be a lot more. Now, because of \nunexpected costs and delay associated with a winter deployment, \nintelligence gathering and engineering efforts, the most recent DoD \nestimate of which I am aware is for $2.8 billion. Just how reliable is \nthis estimate, or will there be more unexpected costs? I suspect it is \nhardly prophetic if I venture that the tab presented to the American \ntaxpayer--just for the military side of this adventure--will top $3 \nbillion, if not more.\n  I asked the Administration back in October if the U.S. would withdraw \nregardless of whether the mission was a success. I asked because I had \nmy doubts that the stated goal--ending the fighting and raising an \ninfrastructure capable of supporting a durable peace--was doable in \ntwelve months time. I foresaw a danger that conditions would remain so \nunsettled that it would then be argued that it would be folly--and \nwaste--to withdraw on schedule.\n  It should be no surprise then, Mr. President, that European diplomats \nare questioning whether IFOR should exit on schedule--claiming \nsuccess--if the ``fundamental'' nation-building task of elections has \nnot been completed. We know from press reports that the Europeans are \npressuring the U.S. to stay on as well, in an undefined role and for an \nuncertain period of time.\n  While I welcomed Vice President Gore's declaration that our troops \nwould be withdrawn on schedule, I also note that only yesterday \nSecretary of State Christopher testified before the SFRC that ``final \ndecisions'' on withdrawal would have to await the results of the \nSeptember elections and then qualified that by stating the military \nmission would be completed ``roughly'' by the 1-year deadline. In \nshort, the very spectre I envisioned 7 months ago may be coming to \nhaunt us.\n  Speculation that IFOR (and U.S. troops) will extend beyond one year \nis worrisome, given the assurances we heard last December that this \ndeployment was limited in time. Even the weak resolution passed by the \nSenate accepting the deployment did not envision an open-ended affair. \nI urge the Administration to heed the sage observation of Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Chairman General Shalikashvili, who has reiterated that U.S. \ntroops will be out of Bosnia by December. He said that if the factions \nwanted peace, then a one year IFOR deployment was enough; an extended \nmission would not alter the intentions of the parties.\n\n  In any event, the Pentagon has also apparently modified the \nPresident's promise that our troops would be home by December 20. Now, \nI understand, exit will begin on or around that date, ensuring that \nsome of our men and women will be in Bosnia well into 1997. Another \noption I have heard mentioned is having a reduced IFOR force--\nprincipally British and French troops--remain in Bosnia after December, \nunder U.S. air cover.\n  Let me say now, Mr. President, that I am opposed to the continued \ndeployment of U.S. ground forces in Bosnia after December 1996. I do \nnot think they should be there now and I expect the Pentagon to brief \nus on its plans for a timely exit.\n  That said, I am not necessarily opposed to a limited U.S. support \nrole. I remain deeply concerned that Dayton produced a Muslim \ngeographic entity essentially DOA. If ethnic partition is inevitable, \nthe Muslim rump state likely to emerge will have no coastline, be an \neconomic basketcase for the foreseeable future, and remain surrounded \nby hostile neighbors.\n  Our political, moral, financial and strategic investment in Dayton \nand in IFOR requires that we not allow the Muslim entity to wither on \nthe vine. The dividends--stability in Europe, enhanced credibility in \nthe Muslim world, undermining Iranian inroads, economic opportunities \nfor U.S. business--outweigh the costs.\n  Which brings me, Mr. President, to the next question I raised in \nOctober: what provision had the Administration made for the arming and \ntraining of Bosnia's Muslims? I have argued almost from the moment I \nfirst entered the Senate that we should arm and train the Muslims, \npermitting them to adequately defend themselves. If we had done so \nthree years ago, we would likely not have found ourselves in a position \nof enforcing a peace that the factions may not want.\n  I am pleased to note President Clinton's July announcement that the \nmilitary assistance program for the Bosnian-Muslim federation is \nfinally scheduled to begin. A contingent of Bosnian soldiers--all \nMuslims--reportedly arrived in Turkey in June for training and $98.4 \nmillion in U.S. arms are scheduled to be shipped to the Bosnian army, \nincluding M60 tanks, armored personnel carriers and antitank weapons in \nthe next several weeks. Turkey has reportedly matched the U.S. pledge \nand U.S private contractors will assist the Turks in improving command-\nand-control and other military procedures. I hope that this marks the \ngenesis of a Muslim force capable of defending itself against the \nbetter-armed Serbs, should the peace collapse, a not unforeseeable \npossibility.\n  But I wonder, Mr. President, where are our European allies? Even with \nthe U.S. and Turkish pledges, there remains a $600 million shortfall on \nthe amount needed to adequately equip and train the Muslims. The \nEuropeans--especially the French and British--have contributed nothing \nand their support for Dayton Accord provisions calling for adequate \narming and training of the Muslims, are lukewarm, at best. Yet while \nthey continue to view sending Western arms to Bosnia as destabilizing, \nthey do not seem to object to having Iran--an otherwise hostile state \nwith which they wish to trade--arm the Muslims.\n  I had thought that we had received assurances from the Europeans that \nthey would support the arm and train provisions of Dayton. Have we been \nbamboozled? What is the Administration doing to press the issue?\n  Yet another question I asked of Secretary Perry last year regarded \nU.S. treatment of indicted war criminals, such as General Mladic and \nMr. Karadzjic. The issue of dealing with persons today government \nofficials responsible for effecting Dayton's provisions, but who \nyesterday were mass murderers, is not an easy one. All the factions in \nBosnia harbor such men and each of the ethnic communities--especially \nthe Muslims--suffered grievously at their hands.\n  Some argue that the process of reconciliation would be better served \nby putting the past behind us. I disagree wholeheartedly. The \ninternational community has made a judgment that those involved in \ngenocide must be brought before a court of justice. Certainly in \ninvestigating these cases and prosecuting these men we risk \nexacerbating old wounds. But I believe the healing process is better \nserved by bringing these crimes out into the light of day and punishing \nthose responsible. Otherwise, the victims families will allow the \nresentments to fester and the cycle of violence inevitably erupt anew.\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\n  I understand the view of the IFOR military commanders, who are \nreluctant to involve themselves and their troops in this sort of \ndistasteful civilian task and in the dangers of ``mission creep.'' In a \ncauldron such as Bosnia, the last thing the peace enforcers want is to \nbe perceived as taking sides.\n  But I believe that the higher moral and practical obligation involved \nrequires that IFOR troops vigorously protect those seeking to uncover \nevidence of these crimes. The presence of a protective cordon of IFOR \ntroops at Srebrenica, where the first solid evidence of mass murder and \natrocities on an appaling scale is now being exhumed, is a welcome \ndevelopment. I note, however, that the two most prominent war \ncriminals, Karadzic and Mladic, continue to flout their disdain for \nsuch pronouncements. Karadzic, for example, dismissed the moderate \nSerbian prime minister, Rajko Kasagic, in mid-May.\n  That act seems to me to be an act of real political power and \ncertainly not in keeping with State Department assessments that the man \nis being ``sidelined.'' Karadzic's June 30 transfer of power to a \npolitical flunky was merely another transparent attempt to avoid \npunishing economic sanctions. And despite Ambassador Holbrooke's \nefforts last month to strip Karadzic of political influence, I think we \nall understand that Karadzic continues to call the shots, which are \naimed at the underpinnings of Dayton.\n  There are other problems, of course. Carl Bildt, the High \nRepresentative for implementation of Dayton has noted that while the \nformal structures of civilian implementation are in place, the \npolitical will to make Dayton work is clearly missing. Conditions are \nnowhere near settled enough to conduct ``free and fair'' elections; \nabsent are freedom of movement, freedom of association, a balanced \nmedia, and the right to vote in secret near one's home.\n  Ambassador Frowick, the Organization of Security and Cooperation in \nEurope (OSCE) mission head in Bosnia, even went so far as to admit July \n29 that, at best, the elections could be expected to be ``reasonably \ndemocratic,'' adding that ``free and fair is a stretch.'' Frankly, I'm \npuzzled as to how elections neither free nor fair can ever be \nreasonably democratic.\n  Yet, the OSCE certified June 25 that such elections can be held by \nSeptember 14. The chief of staff of the OSCE, William Steubner, \nresigned in June, reportedly over a disagreement as to whether Bosnia \nis anywhere near being ready for an election. The continued influence \nof thugs such as Karadzic, the reports that Serbian goons are \npreventing Serbs from voting in the their former home districts--one \nSerb official reportedly dismissed objections by stating: ``Who cares \nwhere they want to vote; they'll vote where we say.'' It was only in \nJune that another 100 Muslims were forced out of their homes in Bosnian \nSerb territory. In the suburbs of Sarajevo and in countless villages \nacross the former Yugoslavia the triumph of ethnic cleansing is \napparent. All prisoners of war have not been released, as required by \nDayton. Foreign forces remain in Bosnia long after the deadline for \ntheir departure; indeed, despite the Administration's certification \nthat these people have left, the Washington Post reported July 8 that \nsome Islamic fighters are burrowing in, creating mischief and posing a \npotential threat to IFOR troops. If true, how will this affect the \nAdministration's pledge that the arm and train program will not come up \nto speed until those forces are gone?\n  These political problems--which certainly threaten the long term \nhealth of Dayton--are compounded by economic difficulties. A question I \ndid not ask in October, but which looms now over the process, is that \nof paying for the reconstruction of Bosnia? How realistic is the \nexpectation that the international community will pony up the estimated \n$5.1 billion necessary over three years to put Bosnia back on the road \nto recovery? In April, in Brussels, World Bank and EU officials \nrequested $1.8 billion in reconstruction aid for 1996. Donors have \npledged barely one-third of that amount and the World Bank has received \nonly one-half (or $300 million) of that in actual commitments. Is it \nany wonder that the Sarejevo government may look again to Tehran, which \nrecently offered $50 million in assistance?\n  Which leads me Mr. President, in a roundabout way back to the first \nand most important question I put to Secretary Perry back in October, \nand which I discussed at length during the December floor debate: why \nwould the Administration not seek Congressional approval and support \nfor the deployment to Bosnia? As I said then, it is through the \nauthorization process--a procedure mandated by the Constitution--that a \ndeployment is explained and refined; that questions are answered; fears \nalleviated; and the American people given an opportunity to air their \nviews on what the mission is worth to them.\n  This first and last question, Mr. President, has never been answered. \nThe result has been uncertainty and more questions. To date, we have \nbeen fortunate that the results have not been more tragic, the sad \ncircumstances surrounding Secretary Brown's mission notwithstanding.\n  I remain unconvinced that the IFOR-imposed ceasefire masks anything \nmore than an inevitable slide towards permanent partition; if that is \nthe case--and I hope I am wrong--then I and the American people want to \nknow how this costly deployment furthered the national interest. Mr. \nPresident, I hope we will have public hearings soon on the status of \nthe deployment and that the Administration will answer the questions I \nput forward in October and repeated here today. I acknowledge again the \nCongress' own culpability in not forcing the issue and asserting its \nconstitutional authority and responsibility on the deployment. I hope \nthat the lessons learned here will lead to more backbone in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9625-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9627-S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION: 50th ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, this summer, the eyes of the \nworld are turned toward Atlanta, the host of the centennial Olympic \ngames. But a careful look reveals another anniversary taking place in \nAtlanta--an anniversary that we should herald as well. On July 1, 1996, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reached a \nmilestone: The agency turned 50 years old. What began during World War \nII as a program to stop the spread of malaria among U.S. military \npersonnel has become a world-renowned scientific agency the mission of \nwhich is to prevent and control disease, disability, and injury. With \ntime-tested expertise in communicable disease control, the agency has \nled efforts in developing a strategy to address the newly emerging \ninfectious diseases of today. The Senate Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, which I am honored to chair, has held hearings on this major \nglobal public health issue and the role which the United States plays \nin fighting the spread of communicable diseases, and I am personally \ncommitted to this battle. Recently, President Clinton, recognizing the \nthreat that infectious diseases present, issued a Presidential Decision \nDirective on Emerging Infectious Diseases. In recognition of CDC's \ngolden anniversary, I would like to summarize the problem, along with \nthe prevention strategy that CDC has developed.\n\n\n addressing emerging infectious disease threats: a prevention strategy \n                         for the united states\n\n  Two to three decades ago, many scientists believed that infectious \ndiseases could and would be eliminated as a public health problem in \ntheir lifetimes. Today, those very same diseases remain the leading \ncause of death worldwide, and a major cause of illness, death, and \nescalating medical costs in the United States.\n  More and more Americans recognize the threat that emerging and re-\nemerging infectious diseases pose to domestic and global health. \nAccordingly, they understand the need to improve surveillance and \nresponse capacity inside and outside our borders--infectious microbes \nknow no borders and disregard immigration laws.\n  Several dramatic changes in our behavior and environment have \ncontributed to the resurgence of infectious diseases. Across the globe, \nexplosive population growth has led to unprecedented migration of \npeople across borders. These population shifts are aggravated by \nrapidly changing technology and increasing international travel.\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\nThe widespread misuse of anti-microbial drugs has accelerated the \nemergence of new drug-resistant microorganisms. In addition, scientists \nare identifying, with remarkable frequency, a growing number of new \ninfectious diseases along with microorganisms that cause previously \nunexplained chronic diseases.\n  In response to the threat of emerging infectious diseases, CDC \ndeveloped a plan designed to safeguard our Nation's health. Entitled \n``Addressing Emerging Infectious Disease Threats: A Prevention Strategy \nfor the United States'', 1994, the plan was developed in cooperation \nwith local and State public health officials, various Federal agencies, \nmedical and public health professional associations, infectious disease \nexperts from academia and clinical practice, and international and \npublic service organization. The plan lays down CDC's domestic and \ninternational strategy for addressing emerging and reemerging \ninfectious disease threats. The plan has four goals:\n\n  First, surveillance and response. The first goal is to improve the \ndetection, investigation, and monitoring of emerging pathogens, the \ndiseases they cause, and the factors influencing their emergence. \nEssential to this goal is an adequate laboratory capacity that assures \naccurate diagnosis of infectious diseases.\n  Second, research. The second goal is to integrate laboratory science \nwith surveillance to optimize public health practice. CDC, in \npartnership with pubic agencies, universities, and private industry, \nwill support research programs to address a number of pressing issues. \nThey include: development and application of modern and rapid \nlaboratory techniques for identification of new pathogens and drug-\nresistant organisms; determination of how behavioral factors influence \nemerging infections; and evaluation of the economic benefit of \nprevention and control strategies.\n  Third, prevention and control. The third goal is to enhance \ncommunication of public health information about emerging diseases. \nThis would ensure prompt implementation of prevention strategies.\n  Fourth, infrastructure. The fourth goal is to strengthen \ninfrastructure at local, State, and Federal public health levels. This \nincludes plans for addressing the diminished capacity of health \nagencies to respond to infectious diseases. Critical losses in \npersonnel over the past years have resulted in dangerous limitations in \nlaboratory expertise. To respond to these losses, CDC has placed a top \npriority on building and maintaining expertise in rare or unusual \ndiseases through the establishment of appropriate training programs for \nyoung health professionals.\n  CDC's initial efforts have focused resources on improving the \ncapacity of the United States to address emerging infectious diseases \nthrough collaborations among State and local health departments and \nacademic institutions. Thus far, CDC has provided funds through \ncooperative agreements to 14 States and two large local health \ndepartments to enhance their ability to monitor and respond to \ninfectious diseases, including foodborne disease, drug-resistant \ninfections, and a variety of other infectious disease public health \nprograms. Health departments have used these funds to improve State \nhealth laboratories, build epidemiologic capacity to investigate out-\nbreaks, and develop electronic technology for disease reporting and \ntracking.\n  CDC has also begun developing a national network of emerging \ninfections programs. This network will conduct special surveillance \nprojects and develop and improve surveillance methods. Emerging \ninfections programs [EIP] address a variety of infectious disease \nproblems, including food- and water-borne disease caused by E. coli and \ncyptosporidium, tickborne diseases such as Lyme disease, and the newly \nrecognized ehrlichiosis, and antibiotic resistance.\n  Through cooperative agreements with State health departments and \ntheir collaborators in local health departments and academic \ninstitutions, CDC has provided funds to establish the first four such \nprograms in health departments in California, Connecticut, Minnesota, \nand Oregon; a fifth EIP will be initiated this year. As resources \npermit, CDC will institute three additional EIPs in fiscal year 1997 in \nother State health departments.\n  With new microbe threats confronting us daily, CDC had developed a \npublic health microbiology fellowship program in partnership with the \nAssociation of State and Territorial Pubic Health Laboratory Directors. \nCDC has also reinstituted an extramural research program that is \nfocusing initially on tickborne disease and antibiotic resistance.\n  Although extensive work to address emerging infections has begun, \nsubstantial further effort is needed to strengthen defenses against \npotential disasters caused by infectious microorganisms. Long-term \ncooperation and partnerships are needed with clinicians, \nmicrobiologists, public agencies, universities, private industry, and \ncommunities. It is indeed critical that we all work together to ensure \nrapid, comprehensive responses to the microbial risks challenging the \nhealth of the world's population. I commend CDC on their 50th \nanniversary and on their outstanding effort to control and eliminate \nemerging infectious diseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9627-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/GUNS BILL\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this morning we had a \ndiscussion on the floor about legislation I am sponsoring to prohibit \npeople convicted of domestic violence from owning guns.\n  My bill stands for the simple proposition that wife beaters and child \nabusers should not have guns. It says: Beat your wife, lose your gun. \nAbuse your child, lose your gun. It's that simple. And it's really \nlittle more than common sense.\n  Mr. President, for many months, I had tried to include my proposal as \npart of the stalking bill. And, finally, on July 25, after agreeing to \nseveral changes at the request of my Republican colleagues, my \nlegislation passed the Senate by voice vote.\n  Mr. President, the compromise we worked out was supported by the most \nardent progun Members of this body. And we had an understanding that \nthe leadership on both sides of the aisle would work to get the \nlegislation passed promptly in the House.\n  Now we have just learned that the stalking bill has been inserted \ninto the conference report on the DOD authorization bill--but without \nmy amendment to keep guns away from wife beaters.\n  Mr. President, given the understanding that we had with the \nleadership, this news came as something as a shock to me.\n  Earlier this morning, there was a suggestion that somehow I was not \nrespecting an agreement we had on this matter. And now this.\n  Mr. President, this is not how we should be doing business in this \nbody.\n  Mr. President, I continue to be amazed at just how far the NRA and \ntheir supporters are willing to go to let wife beaters and child \nabusers get guns.\n  And I think the American people would share my outrage at this. Every \nyear, thousands of women and children die at the hands of family \nmembers. And 65 percent of the time, these murderers use a gun.\n  There is no reason why wife beaters and child abusers should have \nguns. Only the most progun extremists could possible disagree with \nthat. Unfortunately, these same extremists have incredible power here \nin the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I want to make clear to my colleagues that I am not \ngoing to let this issue die. The lives of thousands of women and \nchildren are at stake. And I'm going to continue this battle for as \nlong as it takes.\n  Members of Congress on both sides of Capitol Hill need to be held \naccountable on this. The public has got to know what's going on here.\n  Mr. President, I'm convinced that the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans would agree.\n  Wife beaters should not have guns. Child abusers should not have \nguns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9628-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9628-S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALUTE TO THE WORLD'S GREATEST ATHLETE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute today to \nan Idahoan who has overcome adversity to become an Olympic champion.\n  Dan O'Brien of Moscow last night won the Olympic decathlon gold medal \nand set an Olympic record with a score of 8,824 points, the sixth best \nmark\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\never. Success is not new to Dan, but neither is bitter disappointment. \nHe has been very successful on the national and even the world level, \nbut his dream, an Olympic gold medal, has eluded him.\n  By now most sports fans around the world have heard the story of how, \n4 years ago, Dan was one of the favorites for the Barcelona games and \nhow he failed to qualify by not clearing any height in the pole vault \nat the Olympic trials in New Orleans.\n  Since that crushing result, Dan has shown the determination, hard \nwork and drive that embodies the American spirit. He trained like he \nhad never trained before. He won the world championships three times \nsince the 1992 trials and set the world decathlon record with a score \nof 8,891 points just weeks after the Barcelona games.\n  At the Olympics in Atlanta, Dan seized his opportunity. He started \nout well, and claimed the lead after the first day of the 10-event \ncompetition. The eighth event was his old nemesis, the pole vault. \nLearning the lessons of 4 years ago, Dan cleared a cautious 14 feet, 9 \ninches. Gaining in confidence, he vaulted past the height he missed at \nthe 1992 trials, and then wound up clearing 16 feet, 4\\3/4\\ inches to \nscore 910 points in the event.\n  The ninth event pretty much clinched the gold medal. In his final \njavelin throw, O'Brien recorded his only personal best of the \ncompetition, with a toss of 219 feet, 6 inches. That gave Dan a 209-\npoint lead heading into the final event, the 1,500 meters.\n  Dan has never liked this race, and although he didn't need to run a \nparticularly fast race, he did pick up around the final turn and sprint \nto the finish line. He could then claim redemption for 1992's \nperformance.\n  Immediately after finishing, Dan broke down in tears. I am sure they \nwere tears of joy and triumph. He had finally answered all his critics \nand those who doubted him. He had proven to himself and the world that \nhis determination and commitment to be the best would prevail.\n  Mr. President, to this fine young man, who I am proud to say \ngraduated from the University of Idaho and lives and trains in Moscow, \nI extend my heartfelt congratulations. I know the people of Idaho join \nme in saying ``Well done, Dan'' to the Olympic gold medal champion in \nthe decathlon, the world's greatest athlete, Dan O'Brien.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9628-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RETIREMENT OF MR.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity \nto salute Robert David Young on his retirement from the Great Lakes \nSugar Beet Growers Association.\n  I have appreciated Bob's long service as the Executive Vice-President \nfor the Great Lakes Sugar Beet Growers. He has been an excellent source \nof information regarding agriculture policy, and particularly the sugar \nprogram. In his capacity with the association, he has effectively \nrepresented not only growers but all the communities of the Thumb and \nBay areas of Michigan. And, in fact, he did that officially as a \nformidable State Senator of the 35th District for many years. Because \nof his skill and experience, Bob's counsel and expertise have helped me \nand the people he has served.\n  We have worked together for many years, through flood and drought, \nand through several Farm Bills and sometimes excessive USDA red tape. \nOur different party affiliations have not intruded on a joint desire to \nproduce good, pragmatic agriculture policy that would benefit Michigan.\n  I will be sad to see Bob retire.

Mr. President, earlier this week a Washington Post \neditorial entitled ``Wiring Congress'' implied that the Senate has not \nembraced the idea of providing legislative information in electronic \nformat. I am here today to set the record straight.\n  This past fall, in one of my first initiatives as chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Rules and Administration, Senator Ford and I \nannounced the availability of the Senate's World Wide Web site on the \nInternet.

Mr. President, I rise today as an original \ncosponsor of legislation to modify the application of pension \nnondiscrimination rules to governmental pension plans. This legislation \nwill provide relief to State and local governments from unnecessary and \noverly burdensome Federal regulations.\n  Pension nondiscrimination laws enacted by the Federal Government \nensure that workers at all levels of employment are given access to the \nbenefits of tax-exempt pension plans. As employers, State and local \ngovernments employ a wide range of workers, from judges to firefighters \nto teachers. Each occupation requires that its unique circumstances be \nconsidered when determining pension benefits. Laws that were created by \nthe Federal Government do not adequately address the needs of the \ndiverse work force of State and local governments.\n  Public pension plans are negotiated by popularly elected governments \nand subject to public scrutiny. They do not require a high degree of \nFederal review. The process of enacting these plans promotes fair \nbenefits for governmental employees. Public pension plans have been \ngiven temporary exemption from nondiscrimination laws for almost 20 \nyears, and the result is that full-time public employees enjoy almost \ntwice the pension coverage rate of their counterparts in the private \nsector. It is time to make this temporary exemption permanent.\n  This bill enjoys a wide range of support from State and local \ngovernments, as well as public employee representatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Hatch and myself, along with a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, to ease the burden of Federal regulation on State \nand local governments. I look forward to this bill's consideration in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9629-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9629-S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO CAMP NATARSWI, BAXTER STATE PARK, ME\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of Camp Natarswi in Baxter State Park, ME.\n  In August, Girl Scouts from Maine and across the United States will \nreunite to mark this occasion, exemplifying the strong bond of \nfriendship that young women gain through their Girl Scout experiences. \nSuch relationships are vital for young women and foster an appreciation \nfor helping others whether it be in the community, at school, or at \nhome. It is clear that these women have cherished the spirit of the \nGirl Scout tradition as they now gather 60 years later to renew their \nfriendships.\n  Before this land in Baxter State Park became Camp Natarswi in 1936, \nit was used to house Civilian Conservation Corps workers who were \nbuilding a road from Togue Pond to Roaring Brook. The property was \nleased from Great Northern Paper until 1975 when the paper company \ndesignated ownership to the Girl Scouts. Conducive to\n\n[[Page S9630]]\n\ncamping and scenic views, the young girl scouts found themselves \ninspired by this natural habitat while learning lessons on the \nenvironment and work ethics that would accompany them on their future \nendeavors.\n  For the alumnae from 12 States as far away as California, Camp \nNatarswi will forever be a place where friendships flourished and \nlessons were learned about life and the importance of our natural \nresources. Most of all, these women were instilled with the Girl Scout \ntradition, something they have passed down to their children and \ngrandchildren. I am pleased to recognize the 60th anniversary of this \nvery special place for so many of my fellow Mainers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9629-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PEACETREES VIETNAM\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to describe a project \nbeing undertaken by a remarkable organization in my home State of \nWashington. PeaceTrees Vietnam, the 20th international PeaceTrees \nProgram sponsored by the Earthstewards Network, represents the \ndedicated work of individuals working to promote peace on a local and \nglobal scale.\n  For over a decade, Earthstewards has worked around the world to \nfoster dialog between peoples of various countries, and to contribute \nto communities around the world. Earthstewards has organized PeaceTrees \nPrograms in many communities, including Capetown, South Africa; \nAuroville, South India; Bluefields, Nicaragua; and Tacoma, WA. Now, \nthis organization is embarking on a project in Vietnam.\n  Every week in Vietnam, a child is killed or maimed by the explosion \nof an antipersonnel landmine. At this time, there are over 58,000 \nleftover landmines and unexploded ordnance in the Quang Tri Province of \nVietnam, the DMZ during the Vietnam war. PeaceTrees Vietnam seeks to \neliminate the threat of these devices by removing landmines, planting \ntrees, raising community awareness, and reducing the dangers of \nlandmines in Vietnam and across the globe.\n  This important program has several phases. First, beginning this \nsummer, landmines will be removed near the old Khe May military base in \nthe town of Dong Ha in Quang Tri Province. American and Canadian \nretired military experts as well as Vietnamese local militia will \nextract these destructive weapons of war. Then, in November, a \nFriendship Forest will be planted in this area. Not only will this \nserve as a cooperative effort of the Westerners and Vietnamese who \nplant these trees, it will help set up a buffer to stop the dry, hot \nwinds from Laos and restore life to deforested terrain.\n  Next, construction of a Landmine Awareness Education Center will \nbegin. Educational displays will be created, so children and adults may \nunderstand how to identify potentially unsafe areas, and what to do if \na landmine is encountered. Mine clearance will continue through 1997 in \nthe thousands of hectares of the surrounding farm and forest land. This \nwill allow citizens to productively and effectively utilize the land \nagain, and will help re-forest the area.\n  As a member of the PeaceTrees Vietnam International Advisory Board, I \nam pleased to have the opportunity to assist efforts to make this \nlandmine-ridden area safe again, and to raise awareness of the global \nproblem of landmines. I applaud the work of all those who have helped \norganize and implement PeaceTrees Vietnam. Efforts such as theirs truly \nmake a difference in the lives of countless individuals around the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9630-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATE HOSIERY WEEK--AUGUST 5-11, 1996\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, next week, August 5-11, marks the \n23d annual observance of Celebrate Hosiery Week. It always gives me \ngreat pride to join in recognizing an industry which has contributed so \nmuch to the free enterprise system of our country and so much to the \neconomy of North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, National Hosiery Week is of special importance to me \nbecause North Carolina is the leading hosiery State in the Nation. \nNorth Carolina is proud of the leadership of the hosiery industry and \nthe fine quality of life that it has provided for so many people.\n  In fact, the hosiery industry plays a substantial role in the economy \nof more than half of the States of the Union. There are 343 companies \nin the hosiery business, operating 456 plants employing 62,300 people \nin 28 States. The statistics are staggering: these 62,300 people \nproduce and distribute 22 million dozens pairs of hosiery a year. They \ncontributed a record $7.2 billion to the U.S. economy in 1995.\n  The hosiery industry has made great strides in improving productivity \nand the quality of its product. These efforts to make the hosiery \nindustry more competitive have resulted in significant technological \nand design improvements in the manufacture of hosiery.\n  As a result, the hosiery industry has likewise made enormous gains in \nthe area of foreign trade. Exports in 1995 grew by 9 percent over 1994 \nlevels to 22 million dozen pairs--and that, Mr. President, is a lot of \nhosiery exports.\n  Mr. President, my hat's off to the hosiery industry because it is \nmaking a real difference in many small communities where the hosiery \nplant is often the main employer, providing good, stable jobs for its \nemployees.\n  I extend my sincere thanks and congratulations to the hosiery \nindustry and to its many thousands of employees for their outstanding \ncontribution to our State and Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9630-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9630-S9632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HIGH RUSSIAN HONOR TO IOWAN JOHN CHRYSTAL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, John Chrystal, an outstanding \nIowan, is one of only two Americans to be awarded the Order of \nFriendship, the highest honor that the Government of Russia can bestow \non a noncitizen. This award, which was given at the behest of Russian \nPresident Boris Yeltsin, was presented at a ceremony in Des Moines, IA, \nby the Russian Ambassador to the United States, Yuli M. Vorontsov. It \nhas been my privilege to have John as a close personal friend for many \nyears, and I am extremely proud of his achievement in receiving this \nhigh and well-deserved honor.\n  Under Russian law, the Order of Friendship, which was established in \n1994 by President Yeltsin, ``is awarded to persons for significant \ncontribution to strengthening friendship and cooperation between \nnations and nationalities, for helping the development of the Russian \neconomy, for especially fruitful activities in scientific development, \nfor bringing together and mutually enriching the cultures of nations \nand nationalities, and for strengthening peace and friendship between \nnations.'' John was honored for all of these reasons and in recognition \nof his 70th birthday, which was December 11 of last year.\n  John has had a long and distinguished career as a farmer and banker, \nand is recognized as a leading expert on agricultural, trade and \neconomic matters involving the former Soviet Union. He has long worked \nto improve trade relations between our nation and the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union and to help those countries modernize and \nrestructure their agriculture and food systems. As a farmer himself, \nJohn has real credibility when he talks with farmers in Russia, Ukraine \nor one of the other countries of the NIS.\n  John has traveled to Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, and other nations of \nthe former Soviet Union some 50 to 60 times since 1959, representing \nour State of Iowa and our Nation as a private-citizen ambassador of \ngood will and understanding. In addition, he has been remarkably \ngenerous in hosting many exchanges and delegations from those countries \nto our Nation and our State of Iowa. John has known personally all of \nthe recent leaders of the Soviet Union and Russia and is well known \namong farmers and policy makers in the countries of the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  We Iowans are tremendously proud of all the good work that John \nChrystal has done over the years to help improve food and agriculture \nsystems in the former Soviet Union and to foster stronger ties and a \ndeeper level of understanding among our peoples.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a number of articles pertaining to the \nawarding of the Order of Friendship to John Chrystal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S9631]]\n\n       [From the Carroll, IA, Daily Times Herald, June 24, 1996]\n\n                   Chrystal Earns High Russian Honor\n\n                            (By Butch Heman)\n\n       John Chrystal jokes that dozens of times he's gone to \n     Russia, ``one of the few major nations in the world that \n     we've never had a war with,'' and apparently hasn't angered \n     anybody there yet.\n       Russia honored the rural Coon Rapids man today with its \n     highest honor bestowed on a foreigner: the Order of \n     Friendship.\n       Russia's ambassador to the United States, Yuli Vorontsov, \n     presented the award during a ceremony at The Des Moines Club \n     in Des Moines.\n       President Boris Yelstin established the Order of Friendship \n     in 1994. It is warded to persons for significant \n     contributions toward ``strengthening friendship and \n     cooperation between nations and nationalities, for helping \n     the development of the Russian economy, for especially \n     fruitful activities in scientific development, for bringing \n     together and mutually enriching the cultures of nations and \n     nationalities, and for strengthening the peace and friendship \n     between nations.''\n       The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., said Chrystal was \n     being honored for activities in all those areas, according to \n     a press release.\n       The other American to receive it was astronaut Norman \n     Thagard, the first U.S. citizen to live aboard the Russian \n     space station Mir.\n       Chrystal, who has been visiting Russia, the Ukraine, \n     Georgia and other parts of the former Soviet Union for 36 \n     years, was chosen for the award at the urging of Yeltsin.\n       Since 1959 he has been helping those countries modernize \n     farming and agriculture infrastructure.\n       Chrystal has known all Russian leaders--from Nikita \n     Khrushchev through Yeltsin--and most of their agricultural \n     ministers.\n       ``I've traveled from the Baltic States to Vladivostok, from \n     the permafrost to palm trees. I'm more widely traveled in \n     Russia than I am in the U.S.,'' he said with a chuckle.\n       He observed the evolution from collective state-owned farms \n     to ``a modern attempt at democracy that has not yet been \n     achieved.''\n       Chrystal teasingly says he's done more criticizing of \n     Russian agriculture than assisting.\n       ``I've always been anxious to better our relations with \n     Russia because I think it can become an economic partner with \n     the U.S.,'' he said.\n       Russia is not a third world nation by any means. Chrystal \n     said, describing it as a place with vast natural resources \n     and a very well-educated populace that survived 1,000 years \n     of autocracy under the czars and communism.\n       The country has some grave faults, mainly no management of \n     culture by competitive ideas and no cash, he said.\n       ``And they are having a social, political and economic \n     revolution simultaneously and without blood, which is \n     certainly one of the first times in the history of the \n     world,'' Chrystal said.\n       A big problem for Russia is that change has to happen \n     quickly, he said.\n       ``When I was growing up on the farm we had a two-row \n     planter, and when the neighbor had a four-row planter, boy \n     that was a big deal and we had to have one too,'' Chrystal \n     said.\n       ``Imagine these 44-row planters we have today and a \n     satellite that tells you when to increase fertilizer. It's \n     the beginning of a new era, and the Russians are going to \n     have to run faster if they want to be in the same place. It's \n     a really difficult but exciting time for them.''\n       ``I suppose it will be another decade or generation before \n     they achieve the goals that I hold dear, but I have no doubt \n     they'll achieve them.''\n       Chrystal said that despite the fall of communism, less \n     stability exists in the region. Communism, although a \n     government by edict, maintained control, he said.\n       ``That's not to say this isn't a much better situation,'' \n     he said, noting that while the Soviet Union might be dead but \n     economic relationships among its former members exist.\n       America has an opportunity to form friendly relations with \n     the newly independent countries, and Iowa, because of its \n     agriculture, has a special chance, Chrystal said.\n       His goals are to have the federal government encourage \n     American business to form joint ventures with Russian firms. \n     Chrystal already services on the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corp., a government agency that helps developing nations.\n       ``I think our foreign aid ought to be practical rather than \n     theoretical,'' he said. ``Countries that are hard-up think \n     less about democracy than they do about tomorrow.''\n       Chrystal recently spoke about agribusiness at a seminar in \n     Moscow.\n       ``I detect already a substantial change in attitude,'' he \n     said. ``. . . The tone of the participants was something new. \n     They were talking about competition, efficiencies, cropping \n     and ventures that were either new or in cooperation with \n     various aspects of the economy.''\n       Even through he's visited exotic locales and rubbed elbows \n     with international dignitaries, Chrystal says he gets the \n     most happiness out of what he sees right here in Carroll \n     County.\n       ``I think the most successful thing I've done is seeing \n     farmers in Carroll County entertain Soviets, Russians and \n     Ukrainians. The hosts have fallen in love with these people \n     and even traveled to their homes. That's really thrilling to \n     see Americans develop great relationships with them,'' He \n     said.\n       The 70-year-old Chrystal is a native of Coon Rapids. \n     Chairman of Iowa Savings Bank of Coon Rapids and Carroll and \n     a director at several rural Iowa banks as well as Bankers \n     Trust Co. of Des Moines. Chrystal was president of Bankers \n     Trust from 1984-86.\n       For many years he was a grain and cattle farmer and is \n     still a partner in his family's farm operation.\n       Chrystal is a former state banking superintendent, former \n     member of the Iowa Board of Regents and former president of \n     the Iowa Bankers Association and the Iowa Civil Liberties \n     Union. He is also a trustee of Grinnel College and a director \n     of F.M. Hubbell and Sons Co.\n       ``I really don't know how I was chosen for this award, but \n     I'm very honored and I certainly haven't expected it,'' her \n     remarked.\n       ``I was always afraid I'd make the Russians mad, but \n     obviously I haven't,'' he added with a laugh. ``And who \n     would've though a fella from Coon Rapids would get to know \n     all these Russian leaders?''\n       Among the other recipients of the Russian Order of \n     Friendship is South Africa President Nelson Mandela.\n       Chrystal said some of the Russian officials attending \n     today's ceremony would be staying in Iowa for several days \n     and he hopes to bring some to a Carroll Chamber of Commerce \n     reception Friday night at Iowa Savings Bank in Carroll.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, June 25, 1996]\n\n                  Russian Friendship Honor to Chrystal\n\n                           (By Jerry Perkins)\n\n       John Chrystal, Iowa banker and longtime agricultural \n     adviser to the Soviet Union and Russia, received on Monday \n     the Order of Friendship, the highest honor Russia can bestow \n     on a foreigner.\n       Chrystal, 70, of Coon Rapids is one of two Americans to \n     receive the award, which also has been given to heads of \n     state such as South African president Nelson Mandela.\n       Yuli Vorontsov, Russian ambassador to the United States, \n     praised Chrystal for his many years of advising first the \n     Soviet Union and now Russia.\n       ``This is the highest Russian civilian award,'' Vorontsov \n     said, ``It is for leaders of nations and leading citizens. It \n     is highly regarded in Russia. We appreciate him very much in \n     Russia.''\n       Chrystal has made frequent visits to the former Soviet \n     Union and Russia for 36 years.\n       In an interview at The Des Moines Register, Vorontsov \n     predicted that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will win re-\n     election easily on July 3 when Russians vote in a runoff \n     election.\n       On June 16, Yeltsin narrowly defeated Communist Gennady \n     Zyuganov, 35 percent to 32 percent, in the first round of \n     voting but didn't garner enough votes to prevent a runoff.\n       Yeltsin has been endorsed by the third-place finisher, \n     Alexander Lebed, who has joined Yeltsin's government, and the \n     fourth-place finisher, Grigory Yavlinsky, an economic \n     reformer.\n       Those two endorsements should deliver enough votes to give \n     Yeltsin a comfortable 55 percent to 45 percent victory over \n     Zyuganov, Vorontsov said.\n       After the July 3 runoff, Yeltsin will reshuffle his \n     government, go to work on the social problems confronting \n     Russia and work to make it possible for Russian citizens to \n     own land, Vorontsov said.\n       A decree issued by Yeltsin to make it possible for Russians \n     to own land has been stopped in the Russian parliament, he \n     said.\n       Yeltsin hopes to be able to push the measure through the \n     parliament after his re-election.\n       If he wins, Yeltsin will serve his second four-year term. \n     Russian law prevents a president from serving more than two \n     terms.\n       ``Economic reform in Russia will continue, but we will not \n     be in a rush,'' Vorontsov said. ``We will analyze before \n     making changes and bad things should be thrown away.''\n       It is unrealistic to expect change to come swiftly, he \n     said.\n       Five to seven years will be needed to turn around the \n     industrial economy and 10 years will be needed before \n     agriculture is put on track.\n       Chrystal said Russian agriculture reforms have been hurt by \n     a lack of infrastructure, including credit, roads and \n     machinery.\n       Vorontsov agreed.\n       ``We've made very meager progress'' in agriculture, he \n     said. ``It's not as we should have done and that's where we \n     should concentrate now.''\n       Developing a market-oriented economy has been slower than \n     the Russian government has wanted, Vorontsov said, but \n     changes have been made.\n       ``Some seeds of a new market economy have been sown,'' he \n     said.\n       Vorontsov said corruption is not being punished in Russia \n     and it will be very hard to stamp out because of the well-\n     entrenched Russian bureaucracy.\n       ``Corruption is unpunishable now,'' he said. ``Corrupt \n     people should be sent to jail, but it will be very difficult. \n     The bureaucracy is still there.''\n       However, Vorontsov said foreign investment is needed in the \n     Russian economy.\n       ``Participate with us'' in the Russian economy, he said.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\n             [From the Des

Last month, Russia awarded him the \n     Order of Friendship, the highest honor it bestows on \n     foreigners.\n       Chrystal has become an expert on the affairs of the Soviet \n     Union. He said he's an accidental expert. He never had any \n     particular interest in the nation, never was especially \n     interested in foreign affairs.\n       And he certainly didn't expect the Russians to ask for his \n     help. Yet that's almost exactly what happened.\n       Chrystal folded his 6-foot-2-inch frame into a living room \n     chair last week and started talking about the history of his \n     unique friendship.\n       A Soviet delegation came to Iowa in 1956, looking for \n     trade. They found Chrystal's uncle, Roswell ``Bob'' Garst, \n     and a whole lot of seed corn. Garst visited the Soviet Union \n     a few times but didn't feel like going when he was invited in \n     1960.\n       So Garst sent Chrystal, who never had been east of South \n     Bend, Ind., in his place.\n       Chrystal thought that first visit would be his last, he \n     said. Communist officials took him on a tour of the country's \n     key agricultural areas and he was critical of their farming \n     methods.\n       Surely, Chrystal recalled, the Soviets wouldn't ask him to \n     return. But they did, again and again.\n       And after every trip, he wondered if there would be another \n     invitation, never really counting on it.\n       Chrystal didn't quit his many day jobs to become a \n     diplomat. When he wasn't visiting the Soviet Union--or later, \n     Russia and the other independent states--Chrystal worked as \n     partner on the family farm, a successful banker and a \n     Democratic party leader.\n       ``I've been very fortunate,'' Chrystal said. ``People that \n     I've been associated with let me do other things. Maybe they \n     wanted to get rid of me. That never occurred to me until this \n     second.''\n       Slim chance. His colleagues described Chrystal as a rare \n     patriot, a man who is at once intelligent and humble, able \n     and energetic. At 70, he is chairman of the Iowa Savings Bank \n     in Coon Rapids and serves on many boards.\n       Bill Hess, the bank's president, said Chrystal is ``Tops. \n     Mr. Integrity, spelled with capital T's.''\n       ``He's a wonderful human being,'' Valentina Slater Fominykh \n     said. ``Your country must be very proud.''\n       Ms. Fominykh, who now lives in Des Moines, first met \n     Chrystal in 1989. She was a Soviet foreign-language \n     professor, part of a delegation to Iowa.\n       She described Chrystal as a fair man who isn't afraid to \n     express his opinions.\n       People respect that, Dale Dooley said. Dooley of Johnston, \n     Iowa, worked with Chrystal to help form Iowa Transfers \n     System, now Shazam Inc.\n       The company almost failed, Dooley said, but Chrystal's \n     confidence, contacts and know-how saved it.\n       ``It amazed me,'' he said, ``the depth of that man's \n     knowledge and complexity.''\n       Chrystal has vision, Ms. Fominykh said, and that vision \n     helped him foresee major changes in the Soviet Union.\n       ``He was a loyal friend when friendships with the Soviet \n     Union were not in vogue yet,'' she said.\n       Chrystal downplays any risks he may have taken by \n     befriending the communist nation. When he talks about the \n     Cold War, it hardly seems like enough to send Americans \n     scrambling for their bomb shelters.\n       ``I don't think we were ever going to attack Russia,'' \n     Chrystal said. ``I don't think we're an attacking country, \n     and Russia is isolationist.''\n       He said he never hated communists, never thought they were \n     an evil people. He saw their empire as one on the cusp of \n     great change.\n       ``I never questioned what I was doing,'' Chrystal said. ``I \n     never questioned that they would have to change and would be \n     an enormous market for us.''\n       His willingness and frankness made him a valued adviser to \n     the rapidly changing Soviet government. Chrystal is widely \n     known and well-respected there, Ms. Fominykh said.\n       ``People listen to what Chrystal has to say,'' she said.\n       The Soviets respected his opinion because they knew he was \n     independent from the U.S. government, that he was speaking \n     only for himself, Chrystal said.\n       That respect brought him close to leaders such as former \n     Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and Gorbachev. He speaks \n     easily about the two and their roles in history. He speaks \n     with confidence and with the insight of an eyewitness.\n       Chrystal never counted his many visits. Some years, he \n     didn't visit at all. Other years, he made three or four \n     trips. He figures he has spent about a year and a half \n     there total.\n       Yet he never learned to speak Russian. He has picked up \n     some. If the conversation is about agriculture, he probably \n     can follow along.\n       ``I never thought that I would be going back so much,'' \n     Chrystal said, explaining why he never learned. ``I was a \n     farmer and a banker and I would have had to drive to Ames to \n     take lessons. Maybe I was lazy.''\n       Chrystal said he sees his role as agricultural adviser \n     coming to an end.\n       ``I don't think I have as much to offer anymore,'' he said.\n       Russia will get along fine without him, he said. The \n     country is becoming more and more stable. Those who predict a \n     return to communism, he said, should consider all the nation \n     has accomplished since the Soviet Union dissolved.\n       The still-struggling government needs independence, he \n     said.\n       ``I think they'll succeed, and I think they'll succeed on \n     their own. The faster the better for us.''\n       He already sees that independence growing, he said, giving \n     as an example an agribusiness seminar he attended in Moscow \n     in May.\n       ``For the first time, I met young people who were talking a \n     new kind of economic language,'' who were ambitious and \n     determined.\n       After an hour of talking and tracing the history of his \n     ties to Russia, Chrystal looked around his living room, at \n     the many gifts and souvenirs from his travels--at the \n     paintings, the carved clock and the colorful rug. He has many \n     Russian friendships that will outlife his official \n     relationship with the government.\n       ``My impression is that there will be a new critic,'' he \n     said, smiling, ``which is fine.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9630-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9632-S9633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALUTE TO NATIONAL REHABILITATION WEEK\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the founding \nand success of National Rehabilitation Week which celebrates the \naccomplishments of people with disabilities and focuses on continuing \nefforts to improve the lives of people with disabilities. This year \nmarks the 20th anniversary of National Rehabilitation Week, and as we \ncelebrate this week, it is important that we take time to applaud the \nindividuals who live, work, and succeed with these disabilities \neveryday. National Rehabilitation Week serves as a reminder that it is \nour responsibility, as legislators, to insure that those individuals \nwith disabilities are able to enjoy the same freedoms and privileges as \nall Americans.\n  While National Rehabilitation Week is normally held in September, it \nwas moved up this year to August 15-25 to coincide with the Paralympic \nGames being held in Atlanta. Both events bring together Americans who \nstrive to overcome barriers and herald the victories of Americans with \ndisabilities.\n  The Paralympic Games-which have coincided with the Olympic Games \nsince their inception in 1960-were started by Dr. Ludwig Guttmann, a \ndoctor in Post World War II London who dreamed that sports could be \nused to improve the quality of life for people with spinal cord \ninjuries. It took him 12 years to achieve his goal of creating a \nworldwide sports competition like the Olympics for disabled men and \nwomen.\n  Like the Paralympics in which more than 4,000 athletes from over 100 \ncountries will compete this year, National Rehabilitation Week will \ncelebrate the strength of human perseverance over\n\n[[Page S9633]]\n\nphysical disabilities. As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on \nDisability Policy, I have been fortunate to have witnessed that \nstrength firsthand.\n  The last 20 years have brought many milestones for Americans with \ndisabilities. We have learned the value of rehabilitation for the \ndisabled, and we have seen the glory of a dream coming true with the \nhelp of a rehab professional and sheer determination. We have also \nwatched as perceptions of people with disabilities have been shattered \nby the perseverance of those people with disabilities and \nrehabilitation professionals who never shied away from a challenge.\n  Mr. President, please join me in saluting the 49 million Americans \nwith disabilities and the countless rehabilitation professionals who \ntake the time and care to reach for these dreams and shatter the myths. \nNational Rehabilitation Week continues to gain momentum. This year, \nmore than 5,000 organizations are observing this event nationwide, \nincluding Health-South Hospitals in my home state of Tennessee. This is \na week to applaud the accomplishments of people with disabilities and \nto recognize what still must be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9632-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9633-S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CRIME PREVENTION\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the growing \nproblem of juvenile crime, and the failure of this Congress to \nadequately address it. As the former chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Juvenile Justice, I am particularly alarmed by the \ngrowth of juvenile violence today, and the fact that we are doing \nlittle to slow this trend with investments in our young people.\n  At a time when crime is generally falling, a growing number of young \npeople are becoming the perpetrators--and victims--of violence in \nAmerica. Juvenile offenders are now responsible for 14 percent of all \nviolent crime and 25 percent of all property crime. Criminologists \nreport that 14 to 24-year-old-black males, who represent just 1 percent \nof the population, comprise 17 percent of all homicide victims and 30 \npercent of all offenders. Arguments that used to be solved with fists \nin a school yard are now being settled with Uzi's and Tech 9 semi-\nautomatic weapons. Some schools are starting to resemble prisons, with \nmetal detectors, armed guards, and bars on the windows.\n  This is not the healthy environment that will nurture a new \ngeneration. Instead, this is a recipe for disaster--a formula for \ncreating an army of young criminals whose only future is to commit more \nheinous and vicious crimes with each passing year. And this army is \nlikely to expand: there are now more pre-teenagers in America--39 \nmillion under 10 years old--than at any other time in the past \ngeneration.\n  There are many ways that society can combat this juvenile crime \ntrend--and I support all of them. First, we can get tough on the most \nviolent juveniles--trying them as adults and locking them up--so that \nserious crimes receive serious punishment. Second, we can improve our \nability to catch all juvenile offenders through more vigilant law \nenforcement. Accomplishing these goals requires more prisons and more \npolice, and Congress is providing billions to build penitentiaries and \nfund 100,000 new police officers through the Crime Act of 1994.\n\n  However, a third part of the Crime Act calls for a different \napproach. Instead of spending all the money on prisons and police, \nCongress wanted some of it, about 20 percent, to be spent on preventing \ncrime before it happens.\n  Now, crime prevention used to be a dirty phrase in Washington, \nsomething that so-called liberals touted and conservatives criticized \nas a strategy for coddling criminals. I hope we have moved past those \nsimplistic arguments and are prepared to recognize the value of crime \nprevention programs. For years we have heard evidence about the value \nof investing some funds in crime prevention, and the fact that these \nprograms measurably reduce crime. More recently, numerous studies have \ndocumented how small investments in a troubled young person's life will \nnot only save that child from a life of crime and misery, but will also \nsave society thousands of dollars in court costs and prison fees. Most \nimportant, these investments protect the lives of citizens and prevent \ntragic crimes before they occur.\n  There are literally hundreds of examples--I'll note only two here. A \nfew years ago Fort Worth, TX, initiated a program called Code Blue. The \nprogram offered year round structured social, education and \nrecreational activities for young people. Kids not only engaged in \nsports, but received homework assistance and help with college and GED \npreparation. Five community centers were established to help young \npeople get on the right track and make a difference in the local \nneighborhoods.\n  According to the Fort Worth Police Department, crime dropped by 28 \npercent within a one mile radius of each center. Gang crimes declined \nby 30 percent city wide in the first 6 months of 1995. This was \nachieved at a cost of $10 a year per student--that compares with the \n$40,000 a year it costs to incarcerate a juvenile offender.\n\n  The results are the same across the country. A program called \nChildren-At-Risk [CAR] coordinates social service agencies, police, and \nschool officials to target intensive education, counseling, and family \nservices at 11-13 year olds. A National Institute of Justice quasi-\nexperimental study in five cities found that the CAR test group had \nalmost half the number of contacts with police as the non-participant \ncontrol group, and had less than half the number of contacts with the \njuvenile court as the control group.\n  We have seen these kinds of case studies proving the value of crime \nprevention programs for years. But, Mr. President, we are now seeing \ncomprehensive reports demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of crime \nprevention. Last month the Rand Corp. released a 2-year study comparing \nthe value of investing in crime prevention versus tougher penalties and \nincarceration. It compared prevention programs such as graduation \nincentives, delinquent supervision, and parent training to a ``three-\nstrikes-and-you're-out'' law. The study found that crime prevention was \nthree times more cost-effective than increased punishment.\n  The study concluded that a State government could prevent between 157 \nand 258 crimes a year by investing $1 million in crime prevention, \ncompared with preventing 60 crimes by investing the same amount in \nincarceration.\n  Law enforcement officers--the troops on the front lines in this \nbattle--are also calling on Congress to fund prevention programs. A \nrecent Northeastern University survey of more than 500 police chiefs \nand sheriffs found that three-quarters of them believe the best way to \nreduce crime and violence is to increase investment in prevention \nprograms. This is not surprising: it confirms what we found out last \nyear when we polled Wisconsin police chiefs and sheriffs: almost 90 \npercent supported the Crime Act's prevention programs. These front line \ncrime fighters know--better than anyone else--that crime prevention \nworks.\n\n  Mr. President, let me be clear on this point. I am not advocating \nthat we commit all our resources to crime prevention and no money to \npunishment and incarceration. Like the police chiefs and sheriffs, I \nsupport the Crime Act funding formula which allocates 80 percent for \npunishment, tougher penalties, and more police, as well as 20 percent \nfor crime prevention.\n  Unfortunately, in the last 2 years since that legislation was passed, \nCongress has not lived up to its promise to adequately fund crime \nprevention programs and is actually moving toward eliminating the few \nprograms that it has funded. Just this week, two bills were reported \nout of Committee which either defund or eliminate virtually all \neffective prevention programs. As a member of both relevant committees, \nI spoke out against these cuts in committee, and will work to reverse \nthem on the Senate floor.\n  First, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted out the Commerce, \nState, Justice appropriations funding measure for 1997. Despite \nmounting evidence of the cost effectiveness of crime prevention, this \nbill fails to fund more than $500 million in prevention programs \nauthorized under the Crime Act. While I commend the drafters for \nappropriating $20 million for Boys and Girls Clubs, this is a fraction \nof the prevention Congress authorized 2 years ago.\n  During the same week, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the new \n4-year authorization for the Juvenile\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The legislation eliminates all \ncrime prevention grants and uses that money for ``research and \nevaluation.'' Mr. President, I am a strong advocate of research and \nevaluation, and have introduced a bill with Senator Bill Cohen of Maine \nthat would require federally funded prevention programs to set aside \nmoney for rigorous, independent evaluation. But this proposed \nreauthorization funds research at the expense of all crime prevention \nprograms. That is unacceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, at a time when juvenile crime is on the rise, when law \nenforcement officials are asking for more prevention funds, and when \ncase studies and statistical evidence are proving that we can prevent \ncrimes, protect citizens, and save money in the long run--how can this \nCongress cut funding for crime prevention and eliminate these programs?\n  When I walk the streets with police officers in Wisconsin and I tell \nthem what Congress is considering, they are shocked. These people know \nwhat works and they want our help. We should not turn our backs on \nAmerica's police officers and future generations, and resign ourselves \nto even more prisons and police. We have other alternatives that we \nshould fund--cost effective measures which can prevent crime before it \nhappens.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion to correct the lack of juvenile crime prevention in \nthe proposed versions of the Justice Department's funding bill and the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. This is not a partisan \nissue--members from both parties recognize the common sense of spending \nat least a small portion of federal funds on prevention. As these bills \ncome to the floor, I hope more colleagues see the tremendous progress \nwe can make if we just move past the simplistic arguments and recognize \nthe value of a small investment in crime prevention programs. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9633-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SALUTE TO BRISTOL TREE CITY USA BOARD\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Bristol TN, \nTree City USA Board, which was founded 6 years ago to enhance the \nnatural beauty of the Bristol area.\n  Under the leadership of Dr. Donald Ellis, the tree board has embarked \non a massive reforestation project in their area. Since the effort \nbegan, Tennesseeans have volunteered one by one to plant trees around \nBristol with the goal of planting 1 million trees by the Tennessee \nbicentennial this year. Mr. President, I'm proud to say that these \nvolunteers have not only reached their goal, but they will gather \ntogether on September 6 to plant tree number 1 million and one.\n  This is truly an example of the spirit that has made the Volunteer \nState great for 200 years, and it's fitting that the 1 million and \nfirst tree will be planted this year by a volunteer.\n  In celebration of the bicentennial, my family and I also planted a \ntree--in Washington DC. Earlier this summer, Karyn, the boys and I \nplanted a tulip poplar--the Tennessee State tree --on the grounds of \nthe U.S. Capitol Building. This bicentennial tree will serve as the \nofficial Tennessee State tree on the Capitol grounds and as a testament \nto the contagious nature of beautification efforts like Tree City USA.\n  Mr. President, I commend Tree City USA for its dedication to the \ncommunity of Bristol. Projects like Tree City USA not only benefit the \npeople of Bristol, but all Americans. I would also like to commend the \npeople of Bristol, TN and thank them for their efforts. Tree City USA \ncould not reach its goal without the hard work of these community-\nminded citizens.\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President I would like to express my \nappreciation to the managers of the FY1997 Agriculture Appropriations \nbill, the Senior Senator from Mississippi Mr. Cochran and the Senior \nSenator from Arkansas Mr. Bumpers. Both Senators worked very hard to \nsee that a well balanced bill came out of Conference. I would also like \nto note my appreciation that the conferees made a very wise decision to \nfully fund the Food Safety Inspection Service. Full funding for FSIS \nallows our food safety inspectors to do their job of protecting the \nnation's meat and poultry. I also rise to engage Mr. Bumpers in a \ncolloquy regarding the importance of food safety research done by the \nAgricultural Research Service. Understanding the enormous role that \nresearch plays in agriculture, I believe it is important to note that \nby increasing funding for food safety research the conferees laid the \ngroundwork for a safe food supply well into the next century.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I also rise in support of the conferees \ndecision to increase spending on food safety research through the \nAgricultural Research Service. This research is a very important part \nof the Federal Government's effort to protect the nation's food supply. \nThe FY1997 Agriculture Appropriation's Conference Report sets spending \nfor ARS Food Safety Research at $5.5 million. By increasing funding for \nthis research the Conferees took an important step toward ensuring that \nour food supply meets our highest expectations.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Bumpers' support of \nthis important issue. I would like to talk about several particular \nfood safety research initiatives. I strongly support, along with the \nConferees, three important components of pre-harvest and post-harvest \nfood safety research proposed by the Agricultural Research Service. The \nConferees made the right decision to fund research of methodologies for \nHazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) validation, host-\npathogen relationships and rapid on-farm DNA-based diagnostic testing.\n  ARS should emphasize research on the genetic basis for host-pathogen \nrelationships. Scientists already know that exposure, infection, and \ncontamination of live animals by certain bacteria and parasites can \nresult in pathogens in our meat-based foods. Further research in this \narea will enable scientists to develop methods to identify and select \nanimals that are resistant to foodborne pathogens.\n  Along with studying the host-pathogen relationship, it is important \nthat researchers develop rapid, specific, and sensitive DNA-based \ndiagnostic tests that will allow identification of pathogens in live \nanimals and their production environment. By developing technologies \nand techniques that make this identification possible, we will be able \nto prevent meat and poultry contamination problems in the early stages \nof production.\n\n  It is also very important that ARS develop on-line methodologies for \nHACCP validation. HACCP involves the systematic identification and \nprevention of safety hazards in food production processes. I applaud \nthe administration's decision to implement this program and once again \nwould like to emphasize the importance of the Conferee's decision to \nfully fund the Food Safety Inspection Service so that the benefits of \nHACCP can be recognized. Does the Senator agree that the three research \nareas I just described are important to the agricultural community and \nas a result deserve the funding we allocated to that purpose?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his question. I \nsupport the Conferees decision to fund research of host-pathogen \nrelationships, rapid on- farm DNA-based diagnostic testing and improved \nmethodologies for HACCP validation. These three areas have been \ntargeted by the administration as priority research that should be \ncarried out by the Agricultural Research Service, and I support that \nprioritization.\n  By supporting research to elucidate the relationship between \nlivestock and pathogens, we will lay the foundation for breeding \nlivestock that are resistant to foodborne pathogens and developing \neffective on-farm diagnostic tests. In this manner, scientists can \nimprove our food production systems in the earliest stages before the \nmeat ever reaches the processor. Furthermore, effective methodologies \nfor HACCP validation will help federal food safety inspectors to ensure \nthat our meat and poultry is not contaminated. The Conferees sent a \nstrong message that they support food safety research at the \nAgricultural Research Service and I am pleased that the bill provides \nincreased funding for this purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9634-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9635]]\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO SERVICE CORPS OF RETIRED EXECUTIVES CHAPTER NO. 38 ON THEIR \n                            30TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nService Corps of Retired Executives Chapter No. 38. This year, Chapter \n38 celebrates 30 years of service to the Laconia area. As a former \nsmall business owner myself, I am proud to extend my warmest \ncongratulations to this outstanding business advocacy organization on \nthis momentous occasion.\n  SCORE is a volunteer program sponsored by the Small Business \nAdministration which helps New Hampshire's small businesses to \nestablish themselves, expand, and create jobs in our communities. It is \na nationwide service organization with 13,000 volunteers. There are 383 \nlocally organized and self-administered chapters, all of which work in \nor near their home communities and offer their services at no charge. \nSCORE has been helping American small businesses to prosper since 1964.\n  SCORE matches volunteers with small businesses that need expert \nadvice. They share management skills and technical advice with \nprospective and present small business owners. Their in-depth \ncounseling and training helps business owners identify management \nproblems and find solutions. Most of SCORE's volunteers are retired \nexecutives, but some are still employed full time. New Hampshire \nChapter 38's 24 active members have worked tirelessly, handling one of \nthe largest caseloads in the state. One member, Horace Walsh, for \nexample, has been with Chapter 38 for 25 years. This outstanding record \nof service is the epitome of the Granite State community spirit and \nentrepreneurship.\n  SCORE is an excellent example of community service at its finest. It \ngives people the opportunity to share their expertise with others, that \nthey may find the same measure of success. Such service allows \nexecutives to give back to the community that supported them. By \nhelping small businesses grow, they are contributing to the growth of \ntheir local economy and providing more opportunities for the community.\n  New Hampshire is fortunate to have an organization like SCORE helping \nsmall businesses. I commend SCORE and each one of their committed and \ndedicated volunteers for their tremendous community service as they \ncelebrate their 30th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9635-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO PATRICIA MACK\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to my \nconstituent, Patricia Mack, an outstanding Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] employee and housing activist. Over the years, she \nhas accomplished a great deal in her work in the area of public \nhousing.\n  In 1971, Patricia began her first job in the housing field in the \nChicago Regional Office of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD]. She worked as an Urban Renewal Representative, \nadvocating for and advancing the cause of civic renewal projects in the \nChicago area.\n  In October 1971, HUD established an office in Patricia's home State \nof Minnesota. Patricia moved back to the Twin Cities to serve as a \nMetropolitan Development Representative where she worked closely with \nmetro-area communities to use HUD grant funds for water and sewer \nprojects, neighborhood facilities, parks, and historical preservation \ninitiatives. She played crucial roles in both the Minnesota Valley \nRestoration Project and the Hennepin County Park Reserve District.\n  In July 1974, Patricia's career path took her to Alexandria, VA, to \nserve as assistant to the director of the Alexandria, VA, Planning \nDepartment. Working primarily on housing issues, she helped to lay the \ngroundwork for Alexandria's Housing Assistance Program.\n  In February 1976 she returned to Minnesota to the Minnesota HUD \nOffice as Housing Assistance Specialist. She worked with Minnesota \ncommunities on the implementation of the Housing Assistance Program \nmuch as she had in Virginia.\n  In 1985, Patricia was named Special Assistant to the Field Office \nManager, a position in which she handled responsibilities ranging from \npublic and congressional affairs to HUD special projects like the \naffirmative action plan. In this capacity, Patricia played a key role \nin assuring that adequate minority participation was utilized in the \nconstruction of the new Federal building that was being built in \ndowntown Minneapolis.\n  In the last decade, Patricia has continued to become actively and \ncentrally involved in many programs pertaining to housing and the \nhomeless. Patricia's dedication, leadership, and spirit have been \ninstrumental in countless successes as a volunteer with Habitat for \nHumanity and in working with the Metropolitan Interfaith Community for \nAffordable Housing,\n  In 1995, Patricia was the first Government official to receive a \nwell-deserved award from the Minnesota Coalition for the Homeless.\n  Today, Patricia continues her work helping to address such serious \nand complex issues as homelessness and the availability, quality, and \naffordability of public housing on behalf of Minnesotans and their \ncommunities.\n  It is a privilege for me to recognize and applaud Patricia Mack for \nher fine work and many contributions over the years. She is an \ninspiration, and I wish her continued future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9635-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECIPIENTS OF EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE'S 1996 COMMON GOALS AWARDS\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to announce that two \nlocal electric companies in Arizona recently were honored as recipients \nof the Edison Electric Institute's 1996 Common Goals Awards.\n  The Arizona Public Service Company received a Special Distinction \nAward for energy efficiency from Edison Electric Institute for their \nwork on electrical efficiency in architectural design. Specifically, \nArizona Public Service Co. was honored for its design of an \nEnvironmental Showcase Home that uses 60 percent less electricity and \nwater than standard energy efficient homes built in Arizona today. \nIncreased energy efficiency is of great importance to Arizona and the \nNation. I commend Arizona Public Service Co. for its efforts to achieve \ngreater energy efficiency in our homes and encourage other utilities \nacross the country to follow their lead in working toward more energy \nefficient architectural designs.\n  I also want to congratulate the Tucson Electric Power Co. for their \nwork on a project entitled ``Driving Drunk Will Put Your Lights Out.'' \nThe Tucson Electric Power Co. received a Community Responsibility-\nSpecial Needs Award from the Edison Electric Institute for this \nsuccessful project to combat drunk driving. Their efforts were \nrecognized for producing dramatic results, including a 60-percent \ndecline in alcohol-related traffic incidents in Pima County after ten \nmonths. The national conscience has been raised to the need for \ncommunity involvement in order to eliminate the preventable deaths \nassociated with drunk driving. Tucson Electric Power Co. is to be \ncommended for working to meet the special needs of their community and \ngetting involved in such a worthwhile cause.\n  Energy efficiency and meeting the special needs of our communities to \nprevent the harms caused by drunk driving are important public matters \nand I am very proud that Arizona companies have been recognized for \ntheir leadership in those areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9635-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9635-S9636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                U.S. INTELLIGENCE RESPONSE TO TERRORISM\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, when I took to the floor to discuss \nthe bombing at Khobar Towers several weeks ago I stated someone is \nmaking war on us. I would like to reiterate that point.\n  We are in active conflict, Mr. President, and this is not the time \nfor politicians safe behind secure barriers to publicly snipe at the \nway our Government is fighting this battle. Yet I note the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives is accusing the administration of having \nundermined and crippled one of our principal weapons against terrorism, \nthe human intelligence capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  This charge is baseless, Mr. President. In fact, the greatest build-\nup of our human intelligence capability occurred under the bipartisan \nleadership\n\n[[Page S9636]]\n\nof Senators Boren and Cohen several Congresses ago. They understood \nthat growing stronger in human intelligence is a long-term enterprise. \nIt involves the recruitment and development of people over many years, \nand it is one of the activities of government which are not much \naffected by sudden infusions of money.\n  The Speaker's inference that the Clinton administration has allowed \nthe nation's intelligence capabilities to deteriorate is not supported \nby the facts. He has clearance, as does every Member, to examine the \nbudget numbers and see that the Clinton administration has requested, \nand Congress has generally supported, a very robust intelligence \ncapability for the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Speaker's comments are an effort to draw short-\nterm political advantage out of some of the painful events in a long-\nterm conflict.\n  I would suggest another approach: To take a long view of why we \nAmericans are vulnerable to attack, why this war is being waged, and to \nexamine whether our adversaries are having much effect.\n  We are likely terrorist targets for at least four reasons.\n  First, more than any other country, we are uniquely present in the \nworld. We are the only superpower, our military is by far the most \ndeployed military on earth, and our businesses are also present \neverywhere. I trust the Speaker is pleased with America's forward \npresence; I certainly am. It is both a sign of, and an essential \ncomponent of, our power.\n  Second, we are a country that takes strong positions in foreign \npolicy matters. Strong positions buy you enemies, and some of those \nenemies are terrorists. We stand up for Israel, the only democracy in \nits area. That buys us enemies. We are publicly allied with Turkey, \nanother embattled democracy in a tough neighborhood. That, Mr. \nPresident, buys us more enemies. We are leading the global fight \nagainst international narcotics trafficking, and some violent people \ntake umbrage at that. We should be proud of these strong policy \npositions. I am.\n  Third, we are the most open society in the world, which is a main \nreason it is such a delight to live in this country. I do not advocate \nchanging our openness--but it does make us more vulnerable to \nterrorism.\n  Fourth, we are the world's greatest capitalist nation. We represent \nthe power to make life better by improving your material circumstances, \nand by enjoying the wealth you produce by your own labor. To many \nfundamentalists--not all of them Moslem--that makes us the ``great \nSatan.'' Still, I trust no politician would want to change this element \nof our character, even though it does buy us enemies.\n  Mr. President, despite this vulnerability, I submit we Americans are \nstill safer from terrorism than any other people on earth. When it \ncomes to terrorism and political violence, I challenge anyone to name a \nsafer country. As for Americans abroad, I do not constitute that our \npeople overseas are in any greater risk from terrorism than they have \never been in peacetime in our history. Why this anomaly, when we see \nhow uniquely vulnerable we are?\n  One reason is our superb intelligence. It is present everywhere in \nthe world, working closely with our allies to actively track terrorist \norganizations and individuals far from atrophying under the Clinton \nadministration, it is a potent instrument to keep Americans safe.\n  Rather than fear of failure, we should recognize we are living in a \nperiod of successful action against terrorism. We should praise the \nAmericans involved in this shadowy struggle and support them, and \ncontinue to give them what they need. Saying they are crippled is \nneither constructive nor accurate, although it may give false comfort \nto our enemies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9635-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9636-S9638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO MARGUERITE'S PLACE OF NASHUA, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMarguerite's Place, a support home for disadvantaged women and children \nin Nashua, NH. This outstanding service organization, sponsored by the \nSisters of Charity, provides a very welcome service in New Hampshire. \nThe Grey Nuns have worked hard to ensure the success of this very \nspecial place.\n  Marguerite's Place is designed to provide a fresh start for women in \nabusive or other disadvantaged situations. It is unique because it \nallows women to keep and continue to care for their children, promoting \nstrong family values. It is also a long-term support program that \nteaches women how to put their lives back together. Sisters Sharon \nWalsh and Elaine Fahey, who manage Marguerite's Place, previously ran a \nsimilar program in inner city Philadelphia that had a very high success \nrate. Between them they have 20 years experience helping poor women \nrestructure their lives.\n  Marguerite's Place can accommodate seven women and their children and \nprovides vital support services like day-care. Women may stay in \nMarguerite's Place for up to 2 years and have access to continuing day-\ncare for 5 years through the aftercare program. While Marguerite's \nPlace does provide some necessary services, the sisters are determined \nnot to do anything for the women that they are capable of doing for \nthemselves. During their stay, the women must pay rent and utilities, \nbuy and prepare their own food, and are responsible for the maintenance \nof their quarters. The Grey Nuns' philosophy for Marguerite's Place is \nto empower women to move forward into the future with hope.\n  The sisters are tough about the rules of Marguerite's Place, but they \nprovide a safe environment for women who need time to heal. For \nexample, no men are allowed in the building at any time and there is a \nsecurity system. They employ drug testing if necessary and allow the \nwomen only one slip or relapse before removing them from the program. A \nthorough screening finds women who can demonstrate a commitment to the \nprogram and improving their lives and the lives of their children.\n  Marguerite's Place enjoys a tremendous amount of state and community \nsupport from the citizens of Nashua. It received funds from the Office \nof Alcohol and Drug Prevention for the purchase and rehabilitation of \nthe building and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nas a continuum care program. They now receive operational funding from \nthe United Way for their program, and local religious groups have been \ninvaluable. Community youth help Marguerite's Place through events such \nas the United Way Youth Day of Caring and Rivier College, which sends \nstaff out to discuss health issues with the women.\n  Marguerite's Place is the type of program that this country needs \nbecause it not only provides people with an immediate opportunity but \nteaches them how to improve their lives. The women are given a chance \nand the responsibility to make something of it. By giving them this \nresponsibility, they empower these women. Their success rate shows that \nthis type of program, combining aid with responsibility, works. I \ncommend Marguerite's Place for an excellent job meeting community \nneeds. The caring of Sisters Sharon and Elaine has given hope to women \nin desperate situations and provided a way out of that situation. I am \nproud to thank them of behalf of the Granite State.\n\n\n   Need for Privacy protection in Connection with Computerization of \n                        Health Care Information\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the past several years, I have \nbeen engaged in efforts to make sure that Americans' expectations of \nprivacy for their medical records are fulfilled. I do not want \nadvancing technology to lead to a loss of personal privacy and do not \nwant the fear that confidentiality is being compromised to deter people \nfrom seeking medical treatment or stifle technological or scientific \ndevelopment.\n  The former Republican Majority Leader Bob Dole put his finger on this \nproblem when he remarked that a ``compromise of privacy'' that sends \ninformation about health and treatment to a national data bank without \na person's approval would be something that none of us would accept. \nUnfortunately, the former Republican majority leader's worst nightmare, \nand mine, is being facilitated by provisions inserted by the House into \nthis conference report that require the development of a national \nhealth information system.\n  The conference report includes provisions that require a system of \nhealth\n\n[[Page S9637]]\n\ncare information exchanges by computers and through computer \nclearinghouses and data networks. These are provisions that were not \nincluded in the Senate bill and have not been separately considered by \nthe Senate.\n  The Senate sponsors of a similar bill, which is pending without \naction before the Senate Finance Committee, acknowledged the need to \nestablish standards not just for accomplishing electronic transactions \nbut also for the privacy of medical information. Unfortunately such \nstandards are not included in this bill.\n  I worked during Senate consideration of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill in \nApril to include such protections. Indeed, along with Senators \nKassebaum, Kennedy, Bond and Bennett, we were able to reach agreement \non an amendment that would have combined administrative simplification \nprovisions with critical privacy protection provisions. Our proposal \nwas, unfortunately, not included in the Senate bill due to an objection \nfrom the staff of the Senate Finance Committee. This was especially \ntroubling since similar provisions had been included in the Finance \nCommittee bill reported in the last Congress and in Republican Leader \nDole's bill--as well as in the Labor Committee bill and Democratic \nLeader Mitchell's bill and in the bill produced by the mainstream \ngroup.\n  Now we are confronted with a conference report that calls for \nnationwide data networks to be established within 18 months but \ncontemplates delay of the promulgation of any privacy protection for 42 \nmonths. That is not the way to proceed. When the American people become \naware of what this law requires and allows by way of computer \ntransmission of individually identifiable health information without \neffective privacy protection, they should demand, as I do, prompt \nenactment of privacy protection.\n  I have long felt that health care computerization will only be \nsupported by the American people if they are assured that the personal \nprivacy of their health care information is protected. Indeed, without \nconfidence that one's personal privacy will be protected, many will be \ndiscouraged from seeking help from our health care system or taking \nadvantage of the accessibility that we are working so hard to protect. \nThese are among the serious problems being created by the conference \nreport provisions that do not enact or require promulgation of \neffective privacy protection.\n  The American public cares deeply about protecting their privacy. \nLouis Harris polling indicated that almost 80 percent of the American \npeople expressed particular concern about computerized medical records \nheld in databases used without the individual's consent. The American \npeople know that confidentiality of medical records is extremely \nimportant.\n  The Commerce Department released a report earlier this year on \nPrivacy and the NII. In addition to financial and other information \ndiscussed in that report, there is nothing more personal than our \nhealth care information. We must act to apply the principles of notice \nand consent to this sensitive, personal information. It is time to \naccept the challenge and legislate so that the American people can have \nsome assurance that their medical histories will not be the subject of \npublic curiosity, commercial advantage or harmful disclosure. There can \nbe no doubt that the increased computerization of medical information \nhas raised the stakes in privacy protection. The nationwide, \ncomprehensive computerization represented by the administrative \nsimplification provisions of this conference report makes the enactment \nhealth care privacy legislation essential.\n  Three years ago, I began a series of hearings before the Technology \nand the Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. We explored the \nemerging smart card technology and opportunities being presented to \ndeliver better and more efficient health care services, especially in \nrural areas. Technology can expedite care in medical emergencies and \neliminate paperwork burdens. But it will only be accepted if it is used \nin a secure system protecting confidentiality of sensitive medical \nconditions and personal privacy. Fortunately, improved technology and \nencryption offer the promise of security and confidentiality and can \nallow levels of access limited to information necessary to the function \nof the person in the health care treatment and payment system. \nUnfortunately, the conference report fails to include technological or \nlegal protections for patients' privacy.\n  In January 1994, we continued our hearings before that Judiciary \nSubcommittee and heard testimony from the Clinton Administration, \nhealth care providers and privacy advocates about the need to improve \nupon privacy protections for medical records and personal health care \ninformation.\n  As I focussed on privacy needs, I was shocked to learn how catch-as-\ncatch-can is the patchwork of State laws protecting privacy of \npersonally identifiable medical records. A few years ago we passed \nlegislation protecting records of our videotape rentals, but we have \nyet to provide even that level of privacy protection for our personal \nand sensitive health care data.\n  As policymakers, we must remember that the right to privacy is one of \nour most cherished freedoms--it is the right to be left alone and to \nchoose what we will reveal of ourselves and what we will keep from \nothers. Privacy is not a partisan issue and should not be made a \npolitical issue. It is too important.\n  I am encouraged by the fact that the Clinton administration has \nunderstood that ``health security'' must include assurances that \npersonal health information will be kept private, confidential and \nsecure from unauthorized disclosure. Early on the administration's \nhealth care reform proposals provided that privacy and security \nguidelines would be required for computerized medical records. The \nadministrations's Privacy Working Group of its NII Task Force has been \nconcerned with the formulation of principles to protect our privacy. In \nthese regards, the President is to be commended.\n  The difficulty I had with the initial provisions of the President's \nHealth Security Act I now have with this conference report. We cannot \ndelay enactment of laws to protect our health care privacy for several \nmore years. This bill will require that personal health care \ninformation be available for electronic transmission without proper \nprotection and without any effective way for a patient to object or \nwithhold consent from such insecure transmission. The two-track system \nfor establishing national computer networks of health care information \nwithin 18 months and getting to the fundamental issue of privacy \nprotection some 2 or 3 years later is unacceptable and wrongheaded.\n  Having introduced health care privacy legislation in the last \nCongress, I joined with Senator Bennett and others in introducing the \nMedical Records Confidentiality Act, S. 1360, in this Congress. Our \nbill establishes in law the principle that a person's health \ninformation is to be protected and to be kept confidential. It creates \nboth criminal and civil remedies for invasions of privacy for a \nperson's health care information and medical records and administrative \nremedies, such as debarment for health care providers who abuse others' \nprivacy.\n  This legislation would provide patients with a comprehensive set of \nrights of inspection and an opportunity to add corrections to their own \nrecords, as well as information accounting for disclosures of those \nrecords.\n  The bill creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of \npersonal health information and narrows the sharing of personal details \nwithin the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, \nallow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special \nattention is paid to emergency medical situations and public health \nrequirements.\n  We have sought to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that \nwe do not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud \ninvestigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our \nhealth care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. \nOtherwise, we risk establishing a publicly-sanctioned playground for \nthe unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to \nbe the subject of undetected fraud or abuse.\n  Those who have been working with us on the issue of health \ninformation privacy include the Vermont Health Information Consortium, \nthe Center for Democracy and Technology, the American Health \nInformation Management\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n\nAssociation, the American Association of Retired Persons, the AIDS \nAction Council, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Center \nfor Medical Consumers, the New York Public Interest Group, the National \nAssociation of Retail Druggists, the Legal Action Center, IBM Corp., \nand the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association. They have worked \ntirelessly to achieve a significant consensus on this important matter.\n  The Labor Committee conducted hearings last year on this legislation \nthat showed significant support for the measure. Senators Kassebaum and \nKennedy have worked hard on this matter and helped us to revise and \nimprove the provisions of the bill. The working version of the bill now \nincludes several important changes from the language originally \nintroduced. We have tried to make it more patient centered and \nsensitive. We have eliminated the section on and references to a health \ninformation service. We would require informed consent for use of \nindividually identifiable health information for research.\n  It is with this in mind that I am troubled by indications in the \nconference report discussion that research is viewed by some as an area \nwhere privacy rights should be sacrificed and consent not required for \nuse of individually identifiable health information. I feel strongly to \nthe contrary and believe that research should include consent \nconsistent with current, recognized professional standards and codes of \nconduct for clinical research. We need not and should not weaken those \nstandards and protections through poorly conceived Federal mandates.\n  It is unfortunately that criticism of S. 1360 from some quarters \ntended to obscure its purpose and impede its progress. Some critics \nwere unwilling to work with us to improve the bill. Their recalcitrance \nhelped create the threat we face in this conference report of federally \nmandated computer networks of sensitive health information without \nsimultaneous enactment of privacy protection.\n  I know that these are important matters about which many of us feel \nvery strongly. It is never easy to legislate about privacy. Those of us \nwho care about protecting privacy have no acceptable alternative and \nmust pull together to achieve that which has always been our goal--\nprompt enactment of effective privacy protection for health care \ninformation.\n  When I testified before the Labor Committee earlier this year I \nsuggested that our critics look at the bill against the backdrop of the \nlack of protection that now exists in so many places and in so many \nways and the computerization of medical information. Indeed, in 1995 \nthe House had buried within its budget reconciliation bill provisions \nthat would have required the development and use of protocols ``to make \nmedical information available to be exchanged electronically.'' I was \nthe only Member of Congress to protest the inclusion of those \nprovisions without any attention to privacy protection last year. \nFortunately, others are now beginning to recognize the need for action.\n  During the last few days we have been able to improve the conference \nreport, but only slightly to the point that it is now. Initially, it \nwould have expressly preempted all States' laws that provide privacy \nprotection for health information and records and made it virtually \nimpossible later to add privacy protection measures. Now, there is at \nleast an exception to the Federal preemption language for State laws \nrelating to the privacy of individually identifiable health \ninformation. This is only a start because, as I have noted, the State \nlaws are not sufficiently protective or comprehensive in the \nprotections they seek to provide.\n  Senator Bennett and I have been trying to respond to suggestions for \nimprovements to our bill as originally introduced. We have been working \nclosely with the Chair and Ranking Democrat of the Labor Committee, \nSenators Kassebaum and Kennedy, and with all interested parties.\n  I deeply regret that we have not been able to develop a complete \nconsensus to enable privacy provisions to be included in this measure \nat this time. When supporters of measures to standardize and require \nthe electronic exchange of health care information insisted that \nadministrative simplification mandates be included in this conference \nreport without any significant privacy protection, we could only obtain \na limited opportunity to include privacy protection somewhere down the \nroad. While the conference report provides express protection for \nbusiness trade secrets and confidentiality for commercial information, \nit all but ignores personal privacy and provides no current protection \nfor individually identifiable health information.\n  I will continue to work on this important issue. We are still engaged \nin discussions with some who have come forward with concerns very \nrecently and have yet to offer suggestions for improvements or \nalternative language. Our fervent desire to make the Medical Records \nConfidentiality Act the best bill it can be should not be doubted. I \ncome forward today to declare that further delay by critics cannot and \nwill not be tolerated. If they have suggestions for improvements to the \nbill, they need to make them without delay. Our window of opportunity \nis closing.\n  The conference report allows the Secretary 12 months to make \nrecommendations. She has been engaged in this process from the outset \nso we need and expect her recommendations immediately. Congress must \nget about the job of enacting tough, effective privacy protection \nbefore mandated computer transfers of medical information become \neffective. We cannot risk the loss of privacy in the interim. Moreover, \nit will be near impossible to include appropriate privacy protection in \nthe future. We must rededicate ourselves to act at the earliest moment. \nI hope we can do so before adjourning this year. Privacy was left off \nthe table at this House-Senate conference. It must be given a central \nplace and highest priority if this scheme for technological development \nis to proceed.\n  I would ask all to join with us in a constructive manner to create \nthe best set of protections possible at the earliest possible time. \nWith continuing help from the Administration, health care providers and \nprivacy advocates we can enact provisions to protect the privacy of the \nmedical records of the American people and make this part of health \ncare security a reality for all. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9636-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9638-S9639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA TROOP NO. 135 AS THEY \n                    CELEBRATE THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to New \nHampshire Boy Scouts of America Troop No. 135 as they celebrate their \n50th anniversary. I am proud to congratulate such an outstanding \norganization as they observe this impressive milestone. Troop 135 has a \nlong history of achievement and service to their community.\n  Boy Scout Troop 135 was founded in 1946 by seven men with Leo Leclerc \nas their Scoutmaster. Among the founding members was Albert Bellemore, \nwhose son Raymond is the current Scoutmaster for the troop. Raymond, \nwho has served for 34 years is the holder of the Catholic Diocese St. \nGeorge Award of Merit, the Boy Scout Silver Beaver Award from the \nNational Council of Boy Scouts of America, and was the first in the \nstate to receive the National Eagle Scout Association Scoutmaster's \nAward.\n  Troop 135's 50 year history is marked by distinction and achievement \nlike Raymond's. More than 968 Boy Scouts have been members of Troop 135 \nover the years and 81 of them have attained the rank of Eagle Scout. To \nbecome an Eagle Scout, a young man must earn badges for citizenship in \nthe community, citizenship in the nation, and citizenship in the world. \nThis is an important recognition for a young man.\n  Troop 135 has been involved in numerous Scout activities and won many \nprestigious awards over the years. They have participated in many High \nAdventure trips and every National Boy Scouts Jamboree since the troops \nfounding. Troop 135 has won the Klondike Derby district and statewide \ntrophy almost every year for the past 20 years. Many of Troop 135's 968 \nmembers have been very decorated Scouts. Many alumni of Troop 135 are \nreturning for the anniversary celebration festivities on the weekend of \nAugust 16-18. They will hold a reunion, an open house, and a formal \ncourt of honor for Scoutmasters and Eagle Scouts.\n  The Boy Scouts of America promotes good citizenship, character-\nbuilding,\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\nand community service among the boys of this country. Troop 135 of \nSacred Heart Parish has built a reputation for providing the youth of \nthe community with the leadership skills needed to be successful in \ntoday's society. Boy Scouts of America provides good, solid role models \nfor the youth of our Nation and teaches them to be community minded. In \nthis organization, they learn valuable skills that will serve them for \na lifetime. I am proud to have such an outstanding Boy Scout troop here \nin the Granite State. Congratulations on reaching this tremendous \nmilestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9638-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9639]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE QUALITY OF MERCY\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

One Man--Now a Successful Executive--Who's Lived on It Disagrees\n\n                          (By James McQueeny)\n\n       I'm not a member of any obvious minority group (being the \n     son of an Irish immigrant no longer counts), although these \n     days I might qualify as out of the mainstream because I am a \n     Democrat. My views on welfare seem to place me even more \n     squarely in the minority. And I am very concerned about what \n     we as a society are saying and doing about that issue.\n       We in New Jersey, the second richest state in the nation, \n     are in the best position possible to do something about \n     poverty and welfare reform, yet we're going about it with the \n     worst possible attitude. The very success of New Jersey's \n     post-war suburbanization has fueled what some pollsters call \n     the Drawbridge Mentality--the mindset of people who find \n     their castle and pull up the drawbridge on everybody and \n     everything else. And who in suburbia actually lives near \n     someone in poverty or on welfare? C'mon, I mean really knows \n     them. By face. By name.\n       I do. I was one of them. So I've always been aware of \n     poverty slights, and they're on the increase. I've cringed at \n     a ``progressive'' suggestion by a prominent New Jersey \n     business leader who told me he wants to help the poor ``get \n     off their asses.'' As if these people wake up every morning \n     looking for ways to make themselves poorer. Or the Democratic \n     politician who was trying to rationalize reforming welfare by \n     not extending benefits to additional children of welfare \n     mothers. As if the child had a choice of mother and \n     neighborhood.\n       As someone who has lived at the extreme ends of the \n     economic spectrum in New Jersey, I know firsthand the \n     frightening reality of life in poverty. I grew up on welfare, \n     in a well-off town in Bergen County, one of the wealthiest \n     counties in the state. I worked my way up through the ranks \n     of New Jersey's largest newspaper, covering every county and \n     the statehouse in Trenton, and eventually I became the \n     paper's Washington bureau chief. Later, I was a television \n     reporter for New Jersey Network, and I was the spokesman for \n     one of our United States senators. I am now the president and \n     an owner of a multimillion dollar company.\n       I point this out only to emphasize that I cobbled together \n     a professional life after starting out poor--and on welfare--\n     in New Jersey. And now, a day hardly goes by without a \n     personal incident or a public headline reminding me how we're \n     making it harder in New Jersey for the disadvantaged to \n     follow a similar path of opportunity. And that upsets me.\n       Several months ago, I was at Menlo Park Mall conducting \n     voter interviews with a camera team for a weekly political \n     commentary I do for NJN. Person after person in these opulent \n     surroundings railed against big government. The phrase \n     ``welfare cheats'' was usually the caboose on their long \n     trains of lament, mostly about the economy.\n       As I stood before them, I reverted to a habit I've had \n     since poverty. I looked at the shoes of the people I was \n     talking to. Why? Probably because my four brothers and I \n     thought good shoes were the province of ``rich people.'' Our \n     ``school shoes'' were worn only to school and Mass, and they \n     had to last until they literally disintegrated on our feet. I \n     can still recall going into town to a business that had an \n     industrial staple gun, so I could either secure the flapping \n     soles or repatch the holes with wads of oilcloth stapled from \n     the inside so no one would notice.\n       Instinctively, my gaze fell upon the shoes of the people \n     complaining about things being so bad economically in New \n     Jersey. Without exception, they were wearing designer shoes--\n     those kinds of sneakers that salespeople bring to you so \n     delicately you'd think they were explosives, or those spiffy \n     Rockport walking shoes. I was so amazed by those walking \n     shoes that I was compelled to go into a shoe store and price \n     them. One hundred and twenty dollars! On sale!\n       With those kinds of shoes on their feet, they're feeling \n     that much anger? I thought. And about the economy? They're \n     not complaining about what they don't have. They're \n     complaining that they don't have enough. Has poverty become \n     so trivialized that the New Downtrodden are those who can't \n     afford Rockports?\n       Unfortunately, it looks like it. I only wish that some of \n     these people could have learned the lessons of poverty the \n     way I did--through experience. Like the time I couldn't tell \n     my teacher I didn't have $1.50 for a science magazine \n     subscription because I'd be revealing that I was on welfare \n     in a rich town. Instead, I always said I forgot the money. He \n     marked me up as a wise-guy deportment case, which helped \n     drive my grades down.\n       Some teachers ridiculed my scraggly shoes in front of \n     classmates, unthinkingly viewing them as an issue of \n     cleanliness rather than pennilessness.\n       On one free field trip (I stayed behind in study hall for \n     the paid ones), I borrowed a camera from a classmate on the \n     bus to take a picture of some mundane highway bridge that \n     crossed the Passaic River, about ten miles from home. They \n     all had a riotous laugh when they found out I'd never been \n     this far from home because we never had a car.\n       And, yes, we were forced to ``cheat'' on welfare, too. The \n     ``welfare lady'' visited the house at pre-arranged times to \n     make sure we weren't buying things that would indicate \n     alternative incomes of some kind. That would be cheating the \n     taxpayer. I had to hide any evidence of the prosperity I was \n     enjoying form my paper route--even the household essentials \n     we bought with the money I earned. My brothers' bikes, bought \n     second-hand, had to be hidden before the visits.\n       What got us into this predicament? My father lost his job. \n     Does it become a more acceptable welfare story when I say it \n     was because he contracted terminal lung cancer and took six \n     years to die? As opposed to being a victim of economic \n     cancer?\n       I won't insult victims of poverty or families on welfare by \n     fully equating my time on welfare, or being poor and white in \n     suburbia in the sixties, with the problems they are facing \n     now. The problems now are worse, meaner. And bleaker.\n       From my experience, and in discussions with people who \n     lived or live in similar circumstances, there is one profound \n     misunderstanding that policymakers and the public have about \n     poverty: You do not choose it; by and large, it chooses you.\n       The Democratic party meant to do well when it stitched \n     together the welfare safety net during the Depression. And \n     welfare worked well enough for a while. But as time passed, \n     we didn't have the political common sense to stop sewing when \n     it wasn't working well enough. We do need to come up with \n     something else.\n       But the latest plan being bandied about, the Contract With \n     America welfare-reform proposal, really boils down to turning \n     the program back to the states with guidelines about cutting \n     off benefits to the needy tomorrow, while declaring victory \n     today. The reason that this reform plan won't work is that \n     you can cut spending all you want, but the same mothers and \n     children will have the same food and sheltering needs at \n     roughly the same cost come the end of the day--no matter how \n     you cook the books or serve the baloney. And, yes, there will \n     always be some lumpen layabouts or drug-fried fools who will \n     rip off the system for dollars at the margins, get all the \n     headlines, and jump-start another sorry cycle of retribution \n     against the truly poor and needy.\n       Part of the problem is that Congress, and state \n     legislatures, are overstocked with affluent lawyers, \n     professionals, and full-time politicians who are more than \n     able and willing to impart their professional experiences on \n     tort reform, health care, or the next day's news cycle. I \n     know it's not fair, but I've seen what these politicians \n     drive to work and leave in the parking lots outside the \n     Congress and the state capital. Nobody's holding the mufflers \n     of those cars together with hanger wire, I can assure you.\n       All of this seems so fresh, so important to me, because I \n     know that welfare made it possible for me to go as far as I \n     have. I still have my family's welfare application, signed by \n     both my parents, for my sons to see. I tell them to remember \n     it's nothing to be ashamed about. To the contrary, it was a \n     safety net that scooped up seven people from our family, and \n     the investment in us let us re-invest our lives--and our \n     taxes--in America.\n       The shame would come from not extending our hands to \n     someone else. But the real shame is that that could become a \n     minority view in a state like New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9639-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9639-S9640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SALUTE TO MARY MOORMAN RYAN CALDWELL AND ANN HARDIN GRIMES\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the last 2 weeks have been filled \nwith triumphs and struggles for United States athletes competing in the \nCentennial Olympics in Atlanta. We have all\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\nwatched and waited with baited breath for official scores and times to \nbe posted and medals to be awarded. The Olympic spirit--brought to the \nUnited States through our athletes and the host city of Atlanta--has \nspread throughout the Nation.\n  I rise today to recognize two great American swimmers from another \nOlympic time, whose Olympic ideals and spirit shone brightly even \nduring the darkest days of modern Olympic history. Mary Moorman Ryan \nCaldwell and Ann Hardin Grimes qualified for the American Women's Swim \nTeam to participate in the 1940 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. \nScheduled to be held from July 20 through August 4, the Games were \ncanceled because Nazi Germany occupied all of Western Europe and the \nSoviet Union invaded Finland.\n  Mary and Ann swam the three-mile, the one-mile and the 880-yard races \nto qualify for the team and would have represented the United States in \nthe 880-yard and 440-yard swimming freestyle races in Helsinki. They \nhad been swimming together in friendly competition at the same club \nsince 1933, and were coached by the same man, Bud Swain. The two 15 \nyear olds from Louisville, Kentucky never got the chance to go for the \nOlympic gold. But their spirit never faded.\n  Still good friends today, Ann and Mary attended the Centennial \nOlympic Games in Atlanta together to cheer the 1996 United States \nOlympic swim teams to victory. Mr. President, Mary Moorman Ryan \nCaldwell and Ann Hardin Grimes are true representatives of the Olympic \ncharacter in this country. Through the years as friends, swimmers, \ncompetitors, and Olympians, they have experienced it all--the hardship, \nthe pain, and the disappointment, but most of all the triumph and the \nglory. I thank them for their contributions to their sport and to the \nOlympic spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9639-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRUISE SHIP REVITALIZATION ACT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on this, the last day of Senate \naction before the long August break, I want to speak about a matter of \ngreat importance to a key sector of the California economy--the cruise \nship industry.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced legislation, S. \n138, to amend a law passed by the 102d Congress that allowed gambling \non U.S.-flag cruise ships and allowed States to permit or prohibit \ngambling on ships involved in intrastate cruises only. Representatives \nBilbray and Harmon introduced identical language in the House. Our \nbills, titled the California Cruise Ship Revitalization Act, would lift \nthe ban on gaming on cruise ships traveling between consecutive \nCalifornia ports.\n  The cruise ship bill is now part of the Coast Guard Authorization Act \nof 1995, S. 1004, which passed the Senate last November. The House has \npassed its version of the Coast Guard Act with an identical California \ncruise ship provision. However, controversy over other provisions \nattached to the Coast Guard bill in the House delayed the appointment \nof conferees and now threatens to sink the entire bill.\n  The Coast Guard Revitalization Act has strong bipartisan support and \nno opposition. Only the State of California would be affected, and the \nCalifornia State Legislature has approved a joint resolution in favor \nof this bill.\n  The bill corrects a problem that occurred when California took \nadvantage of a 1992 amendment to the Johnson Act that permitted States \nto prohibit gambling on intrastate cruises, the infamous ``cruises to \nnowhere.'' Unfortunately, California's law was drafted in such a way \nthat it also prohibited ships on international cruises from making \nmultiple ports of call within the state.\n  My bill simply amends the Johnson Act to exclude State regulation of \ngaming aboard vessels so long as the ship's itinerary is an \ninternational cruise.\n  This bill is essential to restoring California's cruise ship \nindustry, which has lost hundreds of jobs and more than $300 million in \ntourist revenue since the 1992 law was enacted. Many cruise ship \ncompanies have bypassed second and third ports of call within \nCalifornia. Ships that used to call at Catalina and San Diego after \ndeparting Los Angeles en route to Mexico no longer make those interim \nstops. According to the Port of San Diego, that port alone has lost $90 \nmillion in economic impact, hundreds of jobs, and over 400 cruise ship \ncalls--more than two-thirds of the port's cruise ship business.\n  Neighboring ports have experienced similar losses. In Los Angeles, \nthe estimated loss of port revenue through 1995 was $3 million. Beyond \nthe port, the economic impact to the city amounted to $14 million in \ntourism and $26 million in retail sales. The total impact estimated by \nthe Port of Los Angeles was an estimated $159 million and 2,400 direct \nand indirect jobs.\n  The State's share of the global cruise ship business has dropped from \n10 to 7 percent at the same time that growth in the cruise ship \nbusiness overall has climbed 10 percent a year. Our lost market share \nhas gone not to other States but to foreign countries along the Pacific \nCoast.\n  For a State still recovering from an economic recession, defense \ndownsizing, and back-to-back natural disasters, a blow to one of our \nleading industries--tourism--is unfathomable.\n  The cruise ship industry books its ports of calls well in advance of \nthe season. Therefore, action on this cruise ship provision this fall \nis crucial to our State if we are going to prevent another season of \nlost business--lost jobs--to my State.\n  Mr. President, I want to assure the supporters of the California \nCruise Ship Revitalization Act that I will continue to press for final \nenactment of this legislation. When the Congress returns next month I \nwill do everything in my power to ensure that we do not lose another \nyear without this correction in law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9640-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9640]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO THE BOSTON AIR ROUTE TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER IN NASHUA FOR \n        WINNING THE NATIONAL EN ROUTE FACILITY OF THE YEAR AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nBoston Air Route Traffic Control Center [ARTCC] in Nashua, NH. The \nBoston ARTCC won the National En Route Facility of the Year Award, for \nwhich I offer my warmest congratulations. This is certainly an \naccomplishment of which they should be very proud and I salute them for \ntheir achievement.\n  The National En Route Facility of the Year Award is presented \nannually to an Air Route Traffic Control Center which has made a \nsignificant contribution to the National Air Traffic Control System. \nThe Boston ARTCC provides air traffic control service to commercial, \nmilitary, and private aircraft in all of New England and most of New \nYork State. This facility is 1 of 20 ARTCC facilities throughout the \ncontinental U.S., along with 3 in Honolulu, Guam, and San Juan.\n  The Boston ARTCC is responsible for handling flights from all six New \nEngland States, eastern New York State, extreme northeastern \nPennsylvania, and coastal waters to 6700 west longitude. This is an \nenormous area, amounting to an area of 125,000 square miles. Within \nthis impressive area, there are 30 positions of operation and the \nBoston ARTCC coordinates with 7 other centers from Montreal to \nWashington. Each year, the Boston ARTCC performs 1,620,000 operations \nin this region. Their facility operates with 290 active controllers, 12 \ncontroller trainees, 62 support staff, and 95 technicians. With \nextensive radar systems, radio facilities, a high tech computer system \nand enough telephone equipment to serve a city of 10,000 people, the \nBoston ARTCC is a model of efficiency.\n  Centers like the Boston ARTCC are becoming vital to our country's \ninfrastructure with ever increasing air traffic. With a center like \nthis running so efficiently, we can rest easier and know that flights \nto and from the east coast are safe and on time. Excellence and \ndedication like theirs deserves to be recognized and applauded. I am \nproud to commend the Boston ARTCC, the many air travelers in New \nHampshire join me in wishing them congratulations and best \nwishes\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9640-2", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9640-S9641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECYCLING TRANSACTIONS UNDER SUPERFUND\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I want to express my support for S. \n607, a bill to clarify the liability of certain recycling transactions \nunder the Superfund\n\n[[Page S9641]]\n\nlaw. This legislation clarifies the Superfund Act to ensure that the \nproduct of scrap recycling is not subject to Superfund liability if \ncertain standards are met.\n  S. 607 does not exempt from Superfund liability recyclers who operate \ncontaminated facilities. Nor does it exempt from Superfund \ncontamination caused in whole or in part by waste generated during the \ncourse of processing recycled materials.\n  My support for this legislation is not unconditional, however. During \na review of this legislation I have identified a serious flaw in S. \n607, as introduced. The language that appears in section 127(b)(2)(E) \nis drafted in a way that would, I believe, achieve exactly the opposite \nresult that the bill's sponsor intends.\n  After discussing this issue with industry and environmental groups, I \nhave concluded that the best thing to do is support the bill and work \nto correct the error in the legislation. I have received assurances by \nthe industry supporters of this legislation that they will not allow \nthis error to stand, and will work to have the problem corrected. I \nwill join with them in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9640-3", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9641-S9644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          READY FOR THE WORLD\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, the Honorable Edward W. Brooke, \nour distinguished former colleague from Massachusetts, recently \ndelivered an outstanding speech entitled ``Ready for the World'' at the \nFirst Alpha Scholarship Forum in New Orleans. His remarks were \nbefitting of the inaugural Charles H. Wesley Memorial Lecture.\n  Mr. President, I trust that our colleagues will benefit from Senator \nBrooke's thoughtful remarks as I have, and I ask that the text of his \nspeech be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The speech follows:\n\n                          Ready for the World\n\n                     (By Brother Edward W. Brooke)\n\n\n                     1. wesley's example and legacy\n\n       Dear Brothers and guests, I cannot tell you how privileged, \n     honored and humbled I feel to have been chosen by our General \n     President, Brother Milton C. Davis, to deliver this First \n     Charles H. Wesley National Lecture. When I was initiated into \n     Alpha Phi Alpha nearly six decades ago, Dr. Wesley was our \n     General President. I came to love him and admire him. He was \n     my brother, my leader, my teacher and my friend. I have never \n     stopped trying to follow his example and, God willing, I \n     never shall.\n       Let me take a few minutes to remind all of you just who \n     Brother Dr. Charles H. Wesley was and why his is a name, and \n     why his was a life, that you should always remember.\n       Brother Dr. Wesley was born nearly 105 years ago and lived \n     some 95 years. He graduated from Fisk, where he had been a \n     star student, athlete and singer, and entered graduate school \n     at Yale at age 19. He was the fourth African American to earn \n     a Ph.D. at Harvard. He traveled and studied in Europe. He \n     taught history at Howard University and rose through the \n     ranks to become Dean of Liberal Arts and Dean of the Graduate \n     School. As a scholar, he published 12 books and 125 articles. \n     He served as president of Wilberforce College and of Central \n     State University in Ohio. He was an ordained minister in the \n     African Methodist Episcopal Church. He wrote the history of \n     our fraternity and served as its General President for nine \n     critical years between 1931 and 1940. He served as president \n     of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and \n     History for 15 years.\n       But, in his own words, he gave his best to Alpha. And we \n     should be thankful that he did.\n       There is more to know about Brother Wesley, however.\n       First, he was a loving and caring husband and father.\n       Second, despite his considerable talents and \n     accomplishments, there was no arrogance about him. If at \n     times he was first of all, he was, nevertheless, always a \n     servant of all. ``One's attainments,'' he said, ``can serve \n     as object lessons for others. There is no need to draw \n     attention to them.''\n       Third, he believed, correctly, that notions of racial \n     superiority and inferiority explain very little, if anything, \n     in human history.\n       Fourth, instead of talking about what America owed black \n     people, he talked about what America owes itself and all of \n     its people, and about what black people owe themselves.\n       Fifth, his interests and his horizons were never limited by \n     the waters which separate North America from the rest of the \n     world. His concern and his love were for all mankind.\n       Sixth, he made the nurturing of young people an integral \n     part of his life.\n       And, to his everlasting credit, he never turned a deaf ear \n     to any call to duty.\n       So perhaps you can understand why I feel compelled to say \n     today that Brother Dr. Charles H. Wesley--scholar, athlete, \n     teacher, musician, preacher; and Alpha man--was as American \n     as they come. He knew the truth of that, even if most \n     Americans didn't. And instead of giving up on, or giving in \n     to, Americans who would deny his American-ness, he stood up \n     for America and worked as hard as he could to make America \n     own up to what it says it stands for.\n       With the kindness and courtesy of Dr. Wesley's accomplished \n     daughter, Mrs. Charlotte Wesley Holloman, I have been \n     privileged to read some of Brother Wesley's papers and \n     original drafts of speeches. In the one which he delivered in \n     Charleston, South Carolina, in 1977--the 201st year of \n     American independence and the 71st year of alpha history--I \n     found a message which gives meaningful insight into Charles \n     H. Wesley, the man and philosopher. And I want you the hear \n     his thoughts and his words as he delivered them to Alpha men \n     there assembled. He said:\n       ``It has become very necessary that thinking should be used \n     in all our individual endeavors, for it is one of the \n     powerful forces operating in our lives. America was built by \n     its thinkers both in 1776 and subsequently as a great nation \n     in 1976, and the method of this achievement and our own have \n     been indicated very cogently in his familiar statement:\n\n     Back of the hammers beating,\n     By which the steel is wrought\n     Back of the workshop's clamor\n     The seeker may find the thought.\n\n     The thought that ever is master\n     Of iron, of steam and steel\n     That rises above disaster\n     And tramples it under its heel.\n\n     Back of the motor's humming\n     Back of the cranes that swing\n     Back of the hammers drumming\n     Back of the belts that sing.\n\n     There is an eye that scans them\n     Watching through stress and through strain\n     There is a mind that plans them\n     Back of the brawn the brain.\n\n       ``In the long run,'' Brother Wesley continued, ``whether it \n     is in 1776 of 1976, the world is in the keeping of its \n     idealists. . . . It is in the hands of men and women who with \n     revolutionary impatience walk the lanes of the villages, with \n     their feet on the ground opposing unjust laws with a song on \n     their lips and with their hearts in the stars. . . . Such a \n     one is never defeated until he gives up within. . . .''\n       This is Brother Wesley's legacy and our inheritance. Our \n     duty today is to pick up where he left off and to stay the \n     course in to the next century and the next millennium.\n\n\n                             2. the moment\n\n       There could hardly be a more appropriate moment than this \n     one--with the dusk of the twentieth century descending upon \n     the global village and the dawn of the Third Millennium \n     hovering somewhere just beyond the horizon--to pause and \n     consider the state of this world and our place and our \n     possibilities in it. Regrettably, both the world and our \n     place in it are in many respects in a perilous state.\n       Our is called a new age. The Cold War is over. The Soviet \n     Union no longer exists. Totalitarianism, Marxism and \n     socialism are in full retreat. Capitalism, democracy and \n     freedom are everywhere the rage.\n       Feedom is something about which we African Americans know a \n     great deal. We know what it's like to be deprived of it, to \n     hunger and thirst for it, to fight and die for it, even \n     though the Creator never intended for men and women to be \n     either slaves or masters. As the 18th century English poet \n     William Cowper wrote:\n\n     They found them slaves: But who that title gave?\n     The God of Nature never formed a slave!\n     Though pride or force may acquire a master's name\n     Nature and justice must remain the same;\n     Nature imparts upon whate'er we see\n     That has a heart and life in it--be free!\n\n       And so, here in the age of freedom and democracy, we \n     ought--all things being equal--to be dancing in the streets \n     and on the crumbling walls of political, economic and \n     cultural oppression.\n       But, for many, things seem to have gone terribly awry; \n     everything new seems old again. In so many places and \n     situations, we and many of our brothers and sisters in the \n     human race find ourselves in an all-too-familiar situation: \n     marginalized--excluded from the fun if not the games; \n     victimized by poverty, politics, disease, famine, war, \n     corruption, indifference, malign neglect and outright \n     bigotry.\n       Major challenges confront us. But, as we know, challenges \n     offer opportunities. And so there are, today, even in our \n     relatively small sector of this world, abundant opportunities \n     for us to demonstrate not just our loyalty and devotion to \n     our country but also, as all Alphas are sworn, our love for \n     all mankind.\n       So let us not fail to find inspiration in the many beacons \n     of hope in the world and in our country. In South Africa, \n     President Mandela and the African National Congress have not \n     only taken command of the ship of state; they have skillfully \n     guided it toward the open seas where the economic and social \n     possibilities seem limitless.\n       Even in poor Haiti hope is alive. And here in the United \n     States, a million black men, including many Alpha brothers, \n     marched in support of individual and parental responsibility.\n       Nor should we fail to recognize our dear sister, the highly \n     motivated Marian Wright\n\n[[Page S9642]]\n\n     Edelman, who only recently led her own march on Washington on \n     behalf of this nation's children, and who has made it clear \n     that she will never stop fighting for our young people--\n     black, brown, yellow, red or white--who, after all, our most \n     precious natural resource and the link between our past and \n     our future.\n\n\n                         3. america's missions\n\n       Of course, the United States has its troubles; but is still \n     a special and sometimes wondrous place. Over the centuries \n     many people have believed, and many still believe today, that \n     Almighty God provided for the establishment of the United \n     States--a new nation in a new world--to give man and woman an \n     opportunity nearly unique in history to experience, and on \n     the basis of that experience to cherish, peace, freedom, \n     justice and brotherhood on Earth.\n       So far, that vision--whether it is God's or man's, whether \n     it is legitimate or not--has not been fully realized. America \n     has not yet lived up to its promise. But if we take the long \n     view of history, we can see that the United States has served \n     for more than two centuries as a shining example to many \n     millions of people around the world, and has grappled \n     successfully with certain enormous challenges both at home \n     and abroad.\n       In the 19th century, for example, Americans had no choice \n     but to decide once and for all whether human slavery had a \n     legitimate place in the Republic. In 1858, Abraham Lincoln \n     said, ``A house divided against itself cannot endure \n     permanently, half slave and half free * * * I expect it will \n     cease to be divided. It will,'' he said, ``become all one \n     thing, or all the other.'' And after a terribly bloody and \n     destructive civil war, the United States emerged as a country \n     in which slavery had no place--even if, tragically, de jure \n     as well as de facto racism did.\n       Freed from the albatross of slavery, the United States \n     enjoyed in the last quarter of the 19th century rapid \n     economic growth and political as well as economic expansion \n     into the larger world. And before long it became impossible \n     for America's leaders to continue to heed George Washington's \n     advice to avoid foreign entanglements. Indeed, by 1916, the \n     midpoint of the First World War, it could no longer be argued \n     that American security and freedom were somehow separate from \n     western Europe's. As he dispatched American forces to the war \n     ``over there,'' President Woodrow Wilson spoke of the \n     imperative to make the world, not just the United States, \n     safe from would-be global emperors. At no time since then has \n     this country been able to remain aloof from international \n     politics without exposing itself, not to mention its \n     brothers, cousins and friends, to powerful and sometimes \n     ruthless antagonists who wish them, and us, ill.\n       This reality became indisputable when, during our \n     isolationist period, would-be emperors of the world came into \n     power in Germany, Italy and Japan and undertook to conquer, \n     subjugate or intimidate those who dared to resist them. Only \n     massive and sustained, if somewhat belated, intervention by \n     the United States prevented those tyrants from achieving most \n     if not all of their aims.\n       After the Second World War, yet another imperial threat \n     emerged in the form of our former ally against the Axis \n     powers, namely Josef Stalin's Soviet Union. I need not \n     recount here today the details of the half-century-long Cold \n     War fought by American presidents from Truman to Reagan. But \n     I must say that prevailing in that struggle, as well as the \n     Second and First World Wars, was indeed an essential \n     component of America's mission in the 20th century. And to \n     all those--and I am proud to be one of them--whose efforts \n     and sacrifices made it possible for us to live in a world \n     over which no would-be emperor's shadow falls, we should be \n     thankful.\n       As you recall, there was another tyrant who was overthrown \n     during this century. He went by the name of Jim Crow. And \n     under his authority millions of African Americans, and many \n     white Americans, were deprived of their most basic civil and \n     human rights. But since 1954 segregation has been illegal in \n     America. And to all those whose efforts and sacrifices made \n     it possible for us to live in a land in which no ``whites \n     only'' sign can legally be erected, we should be thankful.\n       Now, I do not want to give the impression that I believe \n     for a moment that all of the national and international \n     atrocities served up by the 19th and 20th centuries have been \n     completely or even satisfactorily eliminated. I do not, and \n     you should not.\n       However, some of the most horrendous of them have been, and \n     for that we should be thankful.\n       We know, of course that the 21st century will serve up \n     horrors of its own; and although we are confident that good \n     and capable men and women will rise up to grapple with them, \n     we can afford to be neither complacent nor mentally \n     unprepared. Quite the contrary; we should, and must, be \n     alert; we must be ready for the world. And that means having \n     principles, if not a plan, to guide us.\n       I believe we need look no further for ideals upon which to \n     base our actions than the precepts of our fraternity and the \n     examples set by Brother Wesley and so many other \n     distinguished Alpha men over these last ninety years. I \n     refer specifically to manly deeds, scholarship and, \n     especially, love for all mankind, with special emphasis on \n     ``all.'' It was Brother Martin Luther King, Jr.'s dream \n     that one day this nation would rise up and live out the \n     true meaning of its creed--``that all men are created \n     equal''. And, lest we be tempted to reserve our love only \n     for those who are easy to love, let us not forget that \n     Jesus Christ said, ``Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one \n     of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto \n     me.''\n\n\n               4. what you can do and where you can start\n\n       Just as we do not have to look any farther than to our \n     beloved and renowned Alpha to find precepts and principles on \n     which to base our actions, neither, unfortunately, do we have \n     to look any farther than down the street or across town to \n     find tragic conditions that cry out for human attention, \n     ingenuity and love. but on top of that, television and the \n     other mass media bring into our homes on a daily basis \n     stories of untold suffering and dehumanization--much of it \n     done to, and even by, people of color. These stories tug at \n     our heartstrings and, too, cry out for human attention, \n     ingenuity and love.\n       Caught between the local and the global, between what's \n     happening over there and what's happening over here, we may \n     be tempted to focus on one and ignore the other, or simply to \n     pretend to see neither. But I believe, and I pray that you \n     will come to share my belief--if you don't already--that \n     there is only one race, only one place, and only one God who \n     made them both. I pray, too, that if you do come to share my \n     belief, then you will accept, if you have not already \n     accepted, some measure of responsibility, no matter how \n     small, for bringing to bear, on the afflictions which burden \n     humankind and our planetary home, whatever attention, \n     ingenuity and love you can muster.\n       Now, some of you may be wondering what you can do and where \n     you can start. The best answer is that you should do what you \n     feel you reasonably can, given your talents and resources; \n     and you should start wherever your interests and your concern \n     lead you.\n       Allow me, if you will, to share with you some of my \n     thoughts about some of the issues that the American people \n     and our government, among others around the world, should be \n     thinking about and acting on.\n       It seems to me that we face three kinds of problems: Those \n     that are traceable to, and best addressed by, individuals in \n     their personal, family and community lives; Those that are \n     traceable to, and best addressed, by private industry; and \n     Those that are traceable to, and best addressed by, \n     governments.\n       Concerning problems which I think of as being attributable \n     and amenable mainly to the action or the inaction of \n     individuals in their personal, family and community lives, \n     Ten Deadly Sins, as I have labeled them, come to mine.\n       First, there is child abuse in all its forms, including \n     neglect and physical, psychological and sexual abuse;\n       Second, there is the abuse and misuse of alcohol and other \n     drugs, both legal and illegal;\n       Third, there is domestic violence, which takes place behind \n     the closed doors of too many homes;\n       Fourth, there is gang violence, often related to the \n     marketing of illegal drugs. Let me say that I include in my \n     definition of gang violence the illegal hazing of young men \n     who are pledges of our fraternity and quite a few others in \n     these United States.\n       Fifth, there is the epidemic of teen pregnancy or premature \n     parenthood, which obviously involves young men as well as \n     young girls and young women;\n       Sixth, there is prejudice and discrimination, often \n     accompanied by hate crimes, against our fellow men and women \n     because of their race, creed, color, national origin or \n     sexual orientation. In this regard, we must condemn \n     unequivocally the cowardly and dastardly burning of African \n     American and other churches. We must condemn hate crimes \n     against Jewish people, their places of worship and their \n     cemeteries. we must condemn hate crimes against homosexuals, \n     which include assault, battery and even murder. and we must \n     condemn the tendency of white America to blame either black \n     men or people of Middle Eastern heritage for nearly every \n     criminal or terrorist event in this country.\n       Seventh, and along the same line, there is the unforgivably \n     unfair and costly tradition of subordinating the welfare of \n     women and girls to that of men and boys. This is unacceptable \n     in all its aspects, though especially so when girls' minds \n     are neglected or their bodies mutilated, and when women are \n     prohibited by government from exercising their right to \n     terminate legally, safely and affordably an unwanted or \n     health- and life-threatening pregnancy;\n       Eighth, there are the many unhealthy behaviors in which so \n     many of us engage. I refer specifically to smoking, chewing \n     tobacco, the overconsumption of food--especially foods with \n     high fat, salt and calorie content. And perhaps most \n     important in this age of AIDS, the highly irresponsible \n     practice of unsafe sex by adults and teenagers who know, or \n     ought to know, better.\n       Ninth, there is the regrettable and ominous mixture of \n     apathy, cynicism and disrespect for law, government and \n     politics;\n       And tenth, there is the stifling isolationism which has \n     overtaken so many individuals, families and communities. I \n     refer to our growing lack of interest in people, places and \n     issues with whom and with which we may not have everyday \n     contact. It is right to be worried about average Americans' \n     lack of interest, and even hostility, toward foreign people \n     and places. But we should be downright alarmed about average \n     Americans' lack of interest in, and interaction with, their \n     neighbors and fellow citizens.\n\n[[Page S9643]]\n\n       Next, let us consider problems which are traceable mainly \n     to, and best addressed by, the private sector in this country \n     and in others. But before I focus on troubling aspects of \n     contemporary private enterprise, let me make at least two \n     things clear: First, the private sector is not an enemy of \n     whom we should wish to be rid; in fact, because the private \n     sector is the principal source of employment, innovation, \n     growth and progress, we should, and do, want it to grow and \n     prosper Second, many companies, large and small, are models \n     of corporate social responsibility. You don't have to be a \n     Republican or a conservative to acknowledge this fact and \n     give credit where it's due. The President did it a few weeks \n     ago when he invited some of the more praiseworthy companies \n     to send representatives to Washington and tell their stories \n     to the country and the world.\n       Now, concerning private sector problems to be addressed, I \n     have five in mind.\n       One--and for me the most important one today--is the \n     problem of the violent images and antisocial ideas \n     disseminated so broadly by the media and the entertainment \n     industry, especially through movies, television shows and \n     certain kinds of music. I don't necessarily advocate more \n     regulation at this time, but the entertainment industry has \n     to show allegiance to some moral principle other than ``give \n     them whatever they want, so long as it sells.''\n       A second problem, similar to the first, is the lack of \n     corporate social responsibility demonstrated by companies and \n     industries which target advertising for alcohol, tobacco and \n     games of chance at the most vulnerable segments of society, \n     namely children and poor people.\n       A third important problem is the widely varying performance \n     of companies and industries, especially in the United States, \n     with respect to equal employment and affirmative action for \n     women and underrepresented minorities. It is unacceptable \n     that a person is subject to harassment or denial of a job or \n     promotion because of physical traits or beliefs.\n       A fourth is the insensitivity of some large corporations to \n     the genuine human needs and just deserts of their employees \n     and communities. It doesn't seem unreasonable that a \n     corporation can be compassionate and commercially viable at \n     the same time. But it does seem unreasonable that \n     a corporation can be in a community but not of it.\n       And, fifth, is the problems of corporate respect for this \n     planet and for its wondrous ecological systems. One would \n     expect business-people to know that there is a relationship \n     between nature and the economy, even if, sadly, their \n     knowledge is based solely on pragmatism. The overfishing of \n     our oceans, for example, isn't just a crime against Mother \n     Earth; it puts thousands of people out of work.\n       I come now to my third set of concerns, namely problems \n     which are traceable to, or at least best addressed by, \n     governments around the world.\n       Our federal government, and other national governments, \n     face both inward and outward as they strive, we hope, to \n     promote the general welfare, insure domestic tranquility, \n     provide for the common defense and help secure, for any one \n     who hungers for them, the same blessings of liberty and \n     justice that we ourselves seek and sometimes enjoy.\n       Even if some Americans don't think so, there still are some \n     things that our federal government, and national governments \n     in developed and developing countries ought to be doing, or \n     doing better, to improve conditions in their own societies. \n     Several things come to mind.\n       First, government can do a much better job of educating \n     young people. No nation that fails to educate its children \n     will have much of a present or a future.\n       Second, government can do a much better job of insuring \n     that as many people as possible, especially children, have \n     the best health care that a society can reasonably provide.\n       Third, government can do a much better job of insuring \n     employment and decent and affordable housing for low and \n     moderate income people.\n       Fourth, government can do a much better job of making our \n     streets, neighborhoods and commercial districts safe for \n     everyone, not just the wealthy and the politically \n     influential.\n       Fifth, government can do a much better job of taking \n     responsibility for protecting our natural environment and \n     preserving it for future generations as a cultural and \n     economic resource. Let me elaborate just a bit. When I say \n     environment I don't mean just protecting the ecology from \n     destructive people; I also mean protecting people from \n     environments that are unhealthy because the air is dirty, \n     toxic wastes have been dumped there, or the water is unsafe \n     for human consumption.\n       Sixth, governments can do a much better job of governing. \n     Too often, governments and the people who run them conduct \n     themselves in ways that a are highly deficient when it comes \n     to honor, morality and integrity. They should be on notice \n     that their people's patience has its limits and that they \n     should either conform, reform or perform, or else expect to \n     be informed that their time in office has expired.\n       Now, as I said earlier, governments face not only inward \n     but outward, toward other government. And there are some \n     things that outward-looking and forward-looking governments \n     ought to be doing or doing better. I label these Ten \n     Expressions of Love for Humankind.\n       One is to take effective steps to head off interstate and \n     intrastate armed conflict.\n       A second is to take effective steps to stop any fighting or \n     killing if prevention should fail.\n       A third is to prohibit, in law and in fact, ethnic \n     cleansing, or anything that resembles it.\n       A fourth is to come to the aid of people displaced by \n     conflict or natural disasters.\n       A fifth is to find ways to make war--if it is \n     inevitable,and I pray that it isn't--less lethal, especially \n     for innocent civilians during and after violent episodes. One \n     of the great tragedies of our time is the killing and maiming \n     of unsuspecting children, mothers an fathers by landmines \n     encountered in their perfectly legitimate and innocent daily \n     life.\n       A sixth thing that government ought to be doing better is \n     coming to the aid of people and nations who have overthrown, \n     or want to overthrow, tyranny and are likely to choose the \n     path of democracy, freedom and tolerance.\n       A seventh is to treat the international AIDS epidemic more \n     seriously. No person of any ethnicity should be indifferent \n     to the fact that African American men have been harder hit by \n     the virus than other groups of Americans, or that HIV and \n     AIDS infection rates in Africa, where some 14 million men, \n     women and children have contracted the virus, are the highest \n     in the world and still rising. Nor should anyone fail to be \n     greatly concerned that the AIDS epidemic has become \n     established in the Caribbean and especially in Asia, where \n     its explosive infection rate will soon overtake Africa's.\n       An eighth is to work harder to insure that the world \n     economy operates fairly and justly for all nations, not just \n     a fortunate few. As we race ahead toward the high-tech \n     information economy of the twenty-first century, let us \n     consider how we might bring up to 20th century living \n     standards the three billion or so of the world's people left \n     behind in 18th and 19th century conditions.\n       A ninth is to build on the work begun four summers ago at \n     the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development \n     by following though on national and international commitments \n     and agreements to address critical environmental problems.\n       And the tenth is to work harder to make the United Nations \n     the place where all nations meet not just to talk--which is \n     valuable, of course--but also to resolve conflicts peacefully \n     and work together to elimiante the problems which threaten \n     all, many or some of our fellow human beings.\n\n\n                             5. Conclusion\n\n       Brothers, three years ago, when I spoke to many of you here \n     in New Orleans at the 87th Anniversary General Convention, I \n     said: ``We have, and will always have, a further contribution \n     to make, a place to fill, a work to perform.'' I suspect that \n     the litany of concerns which I have just sumamrized--most of \n     them not only serious but painfully complex as well--will \n     serve to confirm the continuing truth of that statement. And \n     although this reality is in many ways a said commentary on \n     the state of the nation and the world, it should also serve \n     as a reminder of why we as men of Alpha Phi Alpha are needed \n     more and more in the community, in the nation, and in the \n     world.\n       My Brothers, I call on each of you--as Americans, as \n     Americans of African Heritage, and as children of God, sent \n     by Him to dwell temporarily on this Earth--to do whatever you \n     can to improve the quality of life on this planet.\n       You don't have to be a politician; you don't have to be a \n     diplomat; you don't have to be a general or an admiral; nor a \n     scholar or a preacher. All you have to be is someone who \n     cares abut his family, his community, his environment and his \n     fellow human beings, wherever they may be, whatever their \n     language, whatever their religion, and whatever the color of \n     their skin.\n       I think the great 19th Century American philosopher and \n     poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, put it best:\n     So near is grandeur to our dust\n     So near is God to man\n     When duty whispers low ``thou must''\n     The Youth replies, ``I can!''\n       My dear Brothers in Alpha, that is the message I bring to \n     you today. That is the message I thank you for listening to. \n     And that is the message in the spirit of Charles Harris \n     Wesley that I ask you to accept an respond to as men worth of \n     being Alphas.\n       Good luck and godspeed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to support final passage of \nH.R. 3060 as amended by S. 1645, the Antarctic Science, Tourism, and \nConservation Act of 1996, which I introduced earlier this year. This \nlegislation will enable the United States to implement the Protocol on \nEnvironmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The Protocol was \nnegotiated by the parties of the Antarctic Treaty System and signed in \nOctober, 1991. The Senate gave its advice and consent to the Protocol \non October 7, 1992. In August 1993, I introduced the precursor to this \nbill and the Senate Commerce Committee reported it to the full Senate \nin early 1994. Unfortunately, continuing disagreements among \nscientists, conservation groups, and the Administration about the \nlegislative changes needed for the United States to carry\n\n[[Page S9644]]\n\nout its responsibilities under the Protocol prevented further action on \nthat bill. Passage of this bill today brings to a close a long, arduous \nprocess in which all of the parties mentioned above have finally \nreached agreement.\n  The bill Senator Hollings and I introduced is supported by all the \nparties engaged in this somewhat lengthy, but ultimately successful, \nconsensus-building process. The Commerce Committee held a hearing on S. \n1645 in June and ordered the bill to be favorably reported. During \ncommittee consideration of the bill, members agreed to work with \nSenator Stevens on a floor amendment addressing polar research and \npolicy. That amendment offered today to S. 1645 requires the National \nScience Foundation to report to Congress on the use and amounts of \nfunding provided for Federal polar research programs. There is no \nopposition to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, S. 1645 builds on the existing U.S. regulatory \nframework provided in the Antarctic Conservation Act to implement the \nProtocol and to balance two important goals. The first goal is to \nconserve and protect the Antarctic environment and resources. The \nsecond is to minimize interference with scientific research. S. 1645 \namends the Antarctic Conservation Act to make existing provisions \ngoverning U.S. research activities consistent with the requirements of \nthe Protocol. As under current law, the Director of the National \nScientific Foundation (NSF), would remain the lead agency in managing \nthe Antarctic science program and in issuing regulations and research \npermits. In addition, the bill calls for comprehensive assessment and \nmonitoring of the effects of both governmental and nongovernmental \nactivities on the fragile Antarctic ecosystem. It also would continue \nindefinitely a ban on Antarctic mineral resource activities. Finally, \nS. 1645 amends the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships to implement \nprovisions of the Protocol relating to protection of marine resources.\n  As one of the founders of the Antarctic Treaty System, the United \nStates has an obligation to enact strong implementing legislation, and \nis long overdue in completing ratification of the Protocol.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Hollings for \nall of his assistance in getting agreement on this legislation. The \nHouse passed similar legislation, H.R. 3060, by a vote of 352-4 in \nJune. I urge my colleagues' support for final passage of the Antarctic \nScience, Tourism, and Conservation Act of 1996.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9641-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9644-S9647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HENRY A. WALLACE\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to bring to the attention of the Senate a notable speech by \none of our colleagues, and one of my fellow Iowans, Senator John C. \nCulver. The subject of Senator Culver's speech is that of another \nprominent Iowan, Henry A. Wallace. Both these men embody the wisdom and \ninsight of the residents of the great State of Iowa.\n  Senator Culver's distinguished speech, given March 14 at the Carnegie \nInstitution of Washington, marked the inaugural of the Henry A. Wallace \nAnnual Lecture. Sponsored by a research center named after Henry A. \nWallace, the annual lecture will address agricultural science, \ntechnology, and public policy. Senator Culver's speech, entitled \n``Seeds and Science: Henry A. Wallace on Agriculture and Human \nProgress,'' held listeners spellbound as he described the life and \ntimes of a pragmatic farmer from Iowa.\n  As many of you know, Henry A. Wallace served our country in many \nways: as a farmer, editor, scientist, Secretary of Agriculture, \nSecretary of Commerce, and Vice-President. As a farmer, Wallace \nrealized the importance of environmental stewardship. As he once wrote, \n``The soil is the mother of man and if we forget her, life eventually \nweakens.'' While Henry A. Wallace made many contributions to this \nNation for which we thank him, it is perhaps Mother Nature who thanks \nhim the most.\n  I ask that the text of Senator Culver's speech appear in the Record.\n\nSeeds and Science: Henry A. Wallace on Agriculture and Human Progress--\n                 Guest Lecturer: Senator John C. Culver\n\n       Sometime in 1933, while he was battling to rescue American \n     agriculture from its greatest crisis, Secretary of \n     Agriculture Henry Agard Wallace was invited to be the \n     featured guest at a swanky party in New York City. It was not \n     the sort of thing Wallace enjoyed. A quiet, cerebral man, \n     Wallace often found such social functions uncomfortable. He \n     wasn't good at flattery or small talk, had no interest in \n     gossip and disdained off-color humor.\n       Gathered around him that evening was a group of writers, \n     planners, technicians and other members of the New York \n     intelligensia eager to take his measure. Wallace was still \n     something of a mystery to them, as he was to most of the \n     nation. At age 44, he was the youngest member of President \n     Roosevelt's Cabinet. The son and grandson of prominent Iowa \n     Republicans--his father had served in the Harding and \n     Coolidge cabinets--Wallace was still a registered Republican \n     himself. He was, by background, an editor and corn breeder; \n     he had never sought public office and had accepted his \n     current position with considerable reluctance.\n       Perhaps most intriguing to the people in the room was the \n     depth and breadth of Wallace's intellectual interests. \n     Wallace was not only a geneticist and journalist, he was one \n     of the nation's leading agriculture economists, an authority \n     on statistics and author of the leading text on corn growing. \n     His interests ranged from diet to religion, from weather to \n     monetary policy, from conservation to Native American \n     folklore. Somewhere along the line, he also found time to \n     start the world's first--and still the world's largest and \n     most successful--hybrid seed corn company.\n       So his small audience had much to ask Wallace about and \n     they peppered him with questions. Finally one of them \n     inquired: ``Mr. Wallace, if you had to pick the one quality \n     which you thought most important for a man to have in plant-\n     breeding work, what would it be?'' The man settled back to \n     enjoy a long scholarly reply but Wallace's response was brief \n     and startling. Without a moment's hesitation he said: \n     ``Sympathy for the plant.''\n       For Wallace, the failure to understand the nature of plants \n     and animals--their structure and purpose, their needs and \n     cycles--was symptomatic of modern man's inability to \n     understand life itself. ``When you sweat on the land with a \n     purpose in mind you build character,'' he wrote. ``Watching \n     things grow, whether plant or animal, is all important. One \n     of the wisest of the old Anglo-Saxon sayings is, `The eye of \n     the master fattens the ox.' How, he wondered, could man grasp \n     the essence of life without taking into account the totality \n     of living things: plants and animals and human beings and the \n     spirit that animates their existence? He later acknowledged \n     that he usually liked plants better than animals, but he \n     appreciated the latter because ``they gave [the] manure that \n     nourished the plants.''\n       Wallace had nothing sentimental in mind when he used the \n     expression ``sympathy for the plant.'' Rather, he viewed \n     ``sympathy'' as an outgrowth of rigorous observation and \n     exacting employment of scientific principles. Throughout his \n     life, beginning at an unusually early age, Wallace placed \n     great store in the value of scientific understanding. By \n     training and temperament, he was an unusually unsentimental \n     man.\n       About 1904, when Henry Wallace was in his mid-teens, he \n     attended a young farmer's ``corn show'' and watched as ears \n     of corn were judged by their appearance. The ``beauty \n     contest'' winners, based on their uniformity, shape, color \n     and size, were deemed to be the superior breeding stock. \n     Professor P.G. Holden, part crusading scientist and part \n     flamboyant showman, was the great evangelist of corn, and he \n     was undoubtedly the best-known corn show judge in the United \n     States. He was also a personal friend of the Wallace family. \n     Young Henry's grandfather, the beloved preacher-journalist \n     known to thousands of midwestern readers as ``Uncle Henry'' \n     Wallace, had been largely responsible for bringing Holden to \n     his teaching position at Iowa State.\n       The story of what happened at that corn show was later \n     written by Paul de Kruif, author of a colorful book on the \n     great food scientist called The Hunger Fighters:\n\n       Gravely, for the instruction of youth, [Holden] held up a \n     great cylindrical ear that was not so good to his learned \n     eye. ``This ear, boys, shows a marked lack of constitution!'' \n     cried Holden. ``And look at this one for contrast,'' said he. \n     ``Observe its remarkably strong middle!'' And such is the \n     folly of teaching--that every boy, hypnotized, could do none \n     other than see what Holden wanted him to see. Solemnly the \n     professor judged and awarded the medal to the very finest ear \n     of all those hundreds of ears of maize, and pronounced it \n     champion.\n       A mob of disappointed farm boys straggled out of the room. \n     Henry stayed. The professor unbent. ``Now young man, if you \n     really want proof that I'm right, why don't you take thirty \n     or so of these prize ears? Then next spring plant them! Plant \n     them, one ear to a row of corn. Then harvest them next fall--\n     and measure the yield of them.''\n       The next spring Henry Wallace took those 33 fine ears, \n     shelled them into separate piles, stuck them under the soil, \n     four kernels to a hill, in 33 rows, one ear to a row, on a \n     little piece of land his father gave him. What he learned \n     from those 33 rows of corn, of course, was that Holden and \n     his corn shows were all wet. The ten ears of corn judged \n     fairest by the good professor were among the poorest yielders \n     in the test, and some of the ugliest\n\n[[Page S9645]]\n\n     ears produced the highest yields. Conventional wisdom or not, \n     Holden's personal friendship with the Wallace family \n     notwithstanding, the scientific experiment showed the \n     appearance of corn had nothing whatever to do with its yield. \n     As Wallace himself put it succinctly: ``What's looks to a \n     hog?''\n       Henry Wallace's first lesson in agricultural \n     experimentation came from his mother, May, a woman endowed \n     with strong religious convictions and a great love of plants. \n     May Wallace taught her young son how to cross-breed \n     pansies, to his great delight. ``It happened that in that \n     particular outcome, the flowers were not as pretty as \n     either parent, but I attributed to them unusual value \n     simply because they had been crossed.'' His mother also \n     frequently said, ``Henry, always remember, you are a \n     Wallace and a gentleman.'' Wallace never forgot.\n       From his father and grandfather he inherited his first and \n     last names, a tradition of progressive thinking and an \n     intense belief in the value of ``a distinctive and satisfying \n     rural civilization'' that offered ``nothing less than the \n     comforts and the cultural elements of the best city life \n     blended with the individualism and the contact with nature \n     that the country gives.'' His father and grandfather had \n     founded the family's influential farm journal, Wallaces' \n     Farmer, and summed up their philosophy in six words that \n     appeared on the cover of every issue: ``Good farming, clear \n     thinking, right living.''\n       Another important influence on young Henry, as he was \n     called in the family, occurred when he was a very young boy. \n     Wallace had moved with his family to Ames, Iowa, where his \n     father completed his degree at Iowa State and taught for a \n     few years as a professor of dairying. There the shy boy was \n     befriended by one of his father's students, a gangly black \n     man by the name of George Washington Carver, who had been \n     born in slavery. Together this unlikely duo--one who became \n     the nation's greatest secretary of agriculture, and the other \n     who gained international fame as a botanist and chemist--\n     tramped through the woods and fields around Ames exploring \n     nature in intimate detail. Six decades later, it was said, \n     Henry Wallace was still able to impress agrostologists with \n     the minute knowledge of grasses he learned at Carver's feet. \n     His lifelong fondness for grass was later evidenced by a \n     national radio address he made while Secretary of Agriculture \n     entitled ``The Strength and Quietness of Grass.''\n       It was Carver, Wallace said, who introduced him to the \n     ``mysteries of botany and plant fertilization'' and who \n     demonstrated that ``superior ability is not the exclusive \n     possession of any one group or class. It may arise \n     anywhere,'' Wallace noted, ``provided men are given the right \n     opportunities.'' He also learned from Carver an approach to \n     science: ``Carver's search for new truth,'' Wallace later \n     observed, ``both as botanist and chemist, was a three-pronged \n     approach involving himself, his problem, and his Maker.'' He \n     earnestly believed that God was in every plant and rock and \n     tree and in every human being, and that he was obligated not \n     only to be intensely interested but to call on the God in \n     whom he so deeply believed and felt as a creative force all \n     around him. ``There is, of course, no scientific way of \n     proving Carver . . . right or wrong,'' Wallace noted. ``But \n     we can safely say,'' he added, ``that if a corn breeder has a \n     real love for his plants and stays close to them in the \n     field, his net result, in the long run, may be a scientific \n     triumph, the source of which will never be revealed in any \n     statistical array of tables and cold figures.''\n       As a boy growing up in Des Moines, there was always \n     available to Wallace a small plot of land on which to \n     experiment and ample encouragement from his family to let his \n     curiosity range free--provided, of course, that he had milked \n     the cows, fed the chickens and completed his other routine \n     chores. As a student at Iowa State he worked on experimental \n     farms operated on the county's ``poor farm'' and learned \n     first hand that progeny from one ear of open-pollinated corn \n     could yield twice as much as progeny from another ear of corn \n     of the same variety.\n       Having proved that ability to yield is more important than \n     appearance, he was receptive to the concept of hybrid corn. \n     He carefully followed scientific reports and experiments \n     relating to its development while graduating first in the \n     agricultural class of 1910, at Iowa State College.\n       Throughout the 1920s, Wallace worked intensely on his own \n     breeding projects and to promote the development and use of \n     hybrid corn. In the early years of that decade, he had been \n     influential in founding the Iowa Corn Yield Contest, which he \n     saw not only as a scientifically valid replacement of the \n     ``corn shows,'' but as a means to demonstrate to farmers the \n     superiority of hybrid corn.\n       Wallace knew even then that a revolution--his word--was \n     coming to the Corn Belt. It was a revolution which he \n     predicted and, more than any other individual, led. In 1933, \n     six years after he started his own little company to develop \n     and market hybrid seed, only one percent of the corn planted \n     in the midwest was grown from hybrid seed. Ten years later, \n     more than three-fourths of corn grown in the Corn Belt came \n     from hybrids. Today, of course, virtually all commercial corn \n     comes from hybrids. Yields grew from less than 25 bushels an \n     acre in 1931 to 110 or more bushels today. The corn \n     revolution stimulated an agricultural revolution throughout \n     the world and transformed American agriculture from an art to \n     an applied science.\n       Wallace viewed this revolution not in the raw statistics of \n     yields-per-acre, certainly not in bottom-line sales and \n     profits, but in an intimately personal way. ``Every living \n     thing, whether it be plant, animal or human being, has an \n     individuality of its own,'' he wrote at the height of his \n     corn breeding work. ``Some are pleasing, some repulsive, but \n     all are interesting to whosoever tries to understand them. \n     For fifteen years, I have tried to understand corn plants, \n     until now the individuality of corn plants is almost as \n     interesting to me as the personality of animals or human \n     beings.''\n       It has been said that Henry Wallace was the only genius to \n     have served as Secretary of Agriculture. The period 1933 to \n     1940 was the golden age in the Department's history and the \n     creation of much of the intellectual dynamism of the New \n     Deal. Agricultural programs and policies were enacted which \n     remain the basic framework today. Under Wallace's creative \n     stimulus, soil conservation, to protect what his grandfather \n     called ``the voiceless land,'' was promoted. The ever-normal \n     granary, to ensure against famine, an idea which Wallace \n     derived from reading Confucius and the Bible, was \n     established. These food reserves later proved of critical \n     value in World War II. In addition, the REA, food stamps, the \n     school lunch program, and ``food for peace'' were all begun.\n       He was responsible for the Yearbooks of Agriculture in 1936 \n     and 1937, which were the first devoted to agricultural \n     research and plant genetics. He was proud that he had \n     not succumbed during this period to the pressures to have \n     the scientific work of the department reduced. He wrote: \n     ``Science, of course, is not like wheat or cotton or \n     automobiles. It cannot be over-produced. It does not come \n     under the law of diminishing utility, which makes each \n     extra unit in the stock of a commodity of less use than \n     the preceding unit. In fact, the latest knowledge is \n     usually the best. Moreover, knowledge grows or dies. It \n     cannot live in cold storage. It is perishable and must be \n     constantly renewed. Static science would not be science \n     long, but a mere junk heap of rotting fragments. Our \n     investment in science would vanish if we did not freshen \n     it constantly and keep training an alert scientific \n     personnel.''\n       Secretary Wallace was also directly involved with the \n     expansion of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Facility. \n     He noted in his diary on April 5, 1940, just prior to the \n     fall of France:\n       ``President Roosevelt was very emphatic about moving the \n     Agricultural Department out of the farm at Arlington [where \n     the Pentagon now sits]. He wanted to bring in the rest of an \n     army battalion and a regiment of cavalry. The President has \n     the War of 1812 in mind and doesn't want some foreign nation \n     to come in and burn up Washington. Perhaps his ideas are \n     sound, although responsible people seemed to be inclined to \n     pooh-pooh them. The President wanted Agriculture to get in \n     touch with the Budget Bureau and the War Department and get \n     prepared to move out at once.''\n       President Roosevelt had developed great respect for \n     Wallace's counsel as a Cabinet member for eight years on a \n     great variety of subjects beyond agricultural policy. He \n     referred to him as ``old man common sense,'' and selected him \n     as his vice presidential candidate in 1940 because, according \n     to Eleanor Roosevelt, he could best carry out Roosevelt's \n     domestic and foreign policy if something should happen to the \n     president.\n       In December 1940, Wallace, recently elected vice president, \n     was sent to Mexico by President Roosevelt to attend the \n     inauguration of its new president. While there, Wallace, who \n     had learned Spanish a few years before, asked to tour the \n     rural areas and saw the desperate need for better \n     agricultural methods to improve food yields. He was impressed \n     by the prominent role of corn in Mexican agriculture, as well \n     as the reverence the people had for it. Upon his return to \n     the United States, he persuaded the Rockefeller Foundation to \n     establish the first of a series of highly successful \n     international agricultural research centers. The Wallace \n     proposal was timely because the foundation had begun to \n     realize that its global public health programs, while \n     controlling diseases such as hookworm, yellow fever and \n     malaria, might be saving people from disease only to have \n     them experience slow starvation due to inadequate diets. He \n     was also responsible for the establishment of the Institute \n     of Tropical Agriculture in Costa Rica and took an active part \n     in the plans which led to the creation of the Food and \n     Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.\n       A fellow Iowan, Norman Borlaug, who received the Nobel \n     Prize for his work with the ``Green Revolution,'' once \n     remarked that the award should have gone to Henry Wallace, \n     whose leadership and inspiration was the moving force in \n     these efforts.\n       Wallace was the first vice president in American history to \n     be given formal executive branch responsibilities as head of \n     the Board of Economic Warfare. This agency was charged with \n     the critical task of obtaining and ensuring the availability \n     of vital raw resources from Latin America and elsewhere after \n     the United States entered World War II.\n       Wallace, in implementing the procurement contracts with \n     countries from whom materials were obtained, required the \n     commitment that they would in turn provide improved wages and \n     living conditions for the workers. His objective was two-\n     fold: healthy workers would best provide the supplies\n\n[[Page S9646]]\n\n     needed, and, in Wallace's view, such economic and social \n     developments within the society would help advance democracy, \n     ensure better post-war trading opportunities and good \n     relations with the U.S. This approach was vigorously opposed \n     by conservatives within the administration and the U.S. \n     Congress, and the practice was therefore discontinued.\n       Wallace typically, like his forebears, was concerned not \n     only with the problems of his generation, but also with those \n     of his grandchildren. Painfully mindful of the errors in U.S. \n     policy, which he felt lost the peace following World War I, \n     Wallace, as early as 1941, predicted with typical vision: \n     ``The wisdom of our actions in the first three years of peace \n     will determine the course of world history for half a \n     century.''\n       On May 8, 1942, Vice President Wallace delivered his most \n     well known public address entitled ``The Price of Free World \n     Victory,'' but known to millions throughout the world as the \n     ``Century of the Common Man'' speech.\n       The speech represented Wallace's effort to inform World War \n     II with a moral purpose: ``This is a fight between a slave \n     world and a free world,'' he declared, ``and the free world \n     must prevail.'' His remarks, however, went far beyond a call \n     for the defeat of Germany and Japan. Wallace saw the war as a \n     struggle against oppression everywhere. ``Victory for the \n     allies,'' he said, ``must lift the men and women of all \n     nations from the bonds of military, political and economic \n     tyranny.'' In short, Wallace envisioned a worldwide \n     revolution against the old order.\n       ``Some have spoken of the `American Century,' '' he said, \n     referring to an earlier address by Henry Luce of Time \n     Magazine. ``I say that the century on which we are entering--\n     the century which will come out of this war--can and must be \n     the century of the common man.'' In Wallace's mind the post-\n     war situation should be a world free from want and \n     deprivation in which nations traded freely and where lawful \n     international order superseded national militarism. Wallace \n     wrote:\n       ``When a political system fails to give large numbers of \n     men the freedom it has promised, then they are willing to \n     hand over their destiny to another political system. When the \n     existing machinery of peace fails to give them any hope of \n     national prosperity or national dignity, they are ready to \n     try the hazard of war. When education fails to teach them the \n     true nature of things, they will believe fantastic tales of \n     devils and magic. When their normal life fails to give them \n     anything but monotony and drabness, they are easily led to \n     express themselves in unhealthy or cruel ways, as by mob \n     violence. And when science fails to furnish effective \n     leadership, men will exalt demagogues and science will have \n     to bow down to them or keep silent.''\n       Wallace preached that Americans must be prepared to support \n     decolonization, international demilitarization and economic \n     cooperation if victory was to have any true meaning. He was, \n     however, frequently frustrated in these objectives. The voice \n     of the common man, he complained in his diary, was not heard \n     by the powerful elitists who ran foreign affairs. ``So long \n     as the foreign affairs of the U.S. are allowed to be \n     controlled as the sacrosanct preserve of one social class \n     only, the weight of this country will continue to be thrown \n     on the side of the `proper' people in other countries, all \n     lip service to democracy notwithstanding * * *.'' In an \n     earlier speech responding to Hitler's claim of the \n     superiority of the Aryan race, Wallace said that, ``As a \n     result of my study of genetics . . . there is nothing in \n     science to interfere with what might be called a genetic \n     basis for democracy. The seed bed of the great leaders of the \n     future, as of those of the past, is in the rank and file of \n     the people.''\n       As the cold was developed in March 1946, Wallace said, \n     ``The common people of the world will not tolerate a \n     recrudescence of imperialism even under enlightened Anglo-\n     Saxon atomic bomb auspices. If English-speaking people have a \n     destiny, it is to serve the world, not to dominate it.'' In \n     light of his scientific background, Wallace had been \n     designated by President Roosevelt as his personal liaison to \n     secretly work with the group proposing the development of the \n     atomic bomb. It has been said that the explosion of the \n     atomic bomb ``changed everything but man's thinking.'' Not \n     true with Wallace, for he immediately understood the threat \n     now represented to human survival and rededicated all his \n     efforts from that point forward to the cause of world peace.\n       On September 21, 1945, in his last Cabinet meeting as \n     Secretary of War, Republican patrician, Henry Stimson, \n     proposed that information about atomic energy (not how to \n     make the bomb) should be shared with other members of the \n     United Nations, including the Soviet Union. Failing that, \n     Stimson argued, the Russians would view atomic energy as \n     another weapon in the Anglo-American arsenal that must--and \n     would--be matched. Wallace sided with Stimson and, in a \n     follow-up letter to President Truman, joined those U.S. \n     atomic scientists who warned that, in attempting to maintain \n     secrecy about these scientific developments, we will be \n     indulging in ``the erroneous hope of being safe behind a \n     scientific Maginot Line.''\n       Wallace was also acutely aware that another bomb was \n     ticking--the growing global discrepancy between rich and \n     poor--and that dramatic population growth, accompanied by \n     even greater human misery and suffering, would lead to an \n     explosion even more probable than the bomb itself.\n       For the last 17 years of his life, Wallace was retired on \n     his New York farm, out of public life and politics, \n     continuing the work he loved most--his experiments with \n     gladioli, strawberries, corn and chickens, as well as his \n     efforts to increase agricultural productivity and improve the \n     nutrition of the people in the less developed world with a \n     special emphasis on Central and Latin America.\n       In 1963, in a commencement address at the Pan American \n     School of Agriculture in Honduras, Wallace told the young \n     graduates that if any people wished long to survive, they \n     should work at least one-third of the time with their hands \n     and preferably in contact with soil. He urged them to invest \n     ``their personal interest wisely,'' and the ``depth of that \n     interest will draw other people to you. Some of them good, \n     some bad. Eventually some of you will come to understand \n     human beings which is the most difficult job of all.'' He \n     went on to say that ``you are scientists who have learned to \n     use your hands in a practical way. In so doing you will be \n     intensely patriotic, serving your country in the most \n     fundamental way. You will not belong to the right or the left \n     or the center, but to the earth and those who work the earth \n     lovingly and effectively so that it may be preserved and \n     improved century after century.''\n       What, then, are we to make of this shy revolutionary, this \n     complex genius with such an elusive personality, and what can \n     we learn from his attitude towards plants, science, \n     agriculture--and human life and progress?\n       We might begin by asking ourselves the question he often \n     asked himself: ``What is worthwhile?'' This is the question \n     at the heart of our inner selves, part of the Presbyterian \n     catechism he learned as a young boy from his grandfather. It \n     is a question of faith. The answer given by the catechism is: \n     ``The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him \n     forever.'' How is one to glorify God? The Wallaces were \n     believers in the ``social gospel;'' that is, one glorified \n     God by serving one's fellow human beings.\n       In his oral history, Wallace said that if he were:\n       To draw conclusions from my life so far I would say that \n     the purpose of existence here on earth is to improve the \n     quality and increase the abundance of joyous living. The \n     improved quality and increased abundance of life is a \n     progressive matter and has to do not only with human life but \n     with all plants and animals as well. The highest joy of life \n     is complete dedication to something outside of yourself. I am \n     convinced that God craves and needs humanity's help and that \n     without that help expressed in terms of joyous vitality, God \n     will have failed in this earthly experiment.\n       This is the core of Henry A. Wallace. If these views strike \n     you as an odd way for a plant geneticist to talk about his \n     work, rest assured you are not alone. Plenty of Wallace's \n     contemporaries were equally perplexed. ``A senator moves \n     easily from corn to hogs,'' the journalist Jonathan Daniels \n     wrote. ``But he can be disturbed by a grinning Iowan who \n     moves casually from genetics to God.''\n       Dr. Raul C. Manglesdorf, head of the Harvard University \n     Botanical Museum, said, ``It was Wallace's fate to be often \n     regarded as a `dreamer' when actually he was only seeing in \n     his own pragmatic, realistic way some of the shapes of things \n     to come and more often than not he was right. . . . Wallace's \n     predictions,'' he further noted, ``were based less on \n     inspiration or intuition than upon an objective evaluation of \n     the available facts in the light of historical perspective. \n     As a student of history he was well aware that history often \n     repeats.''\n       During his lifetime, political opponents often derided \n     Wallace as a ``mystic,'' a term which they intended to \n     conjure up visions of crystal balls and secret ceremonies. \n     Wallace himself accepted the term ``practical mystic.'' \n     ``I've always believed that if you envision something that \n     hasn't been, that can be, and bring it into being, that is \n     a tremendously worthwhile thing to do.'' Wallace once co-\n     authored a wonderful little book with William Brown on the \n     history of corn, titled Corn and Its Early Fathers, at the \n     beginning of which he devoted an entire page to this \n     quotation from Jonathan Swift: ``And he gave it for his \n     opinion, that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two \n     blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only \n     one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do \n     more essential service to his country, than the whole race \n     of politicians put together.''\n       Wallace, the ``practical mystic,'' saw a way to make the \n     equivalent of two or four ears of corn grow where one grew \n     before. This, in his view, seemed a ``tremendously worthwhile \n     thing to do,'' precisely because it seemed an obvious way of \n     improving the lot of his fellow human beings.\n       But there was another component to his vision. This was the \n     hope that hybrids would help bring about the ``distinctive \n     rural civilization'' of his family's dreams. He asked: ``Can \n     we go ahead to create a rural civilization that will give us \n     a material foundation solid enough so that life can be \n     enjoyed instead of being wasted in a chase after enough \n     dollars to keep the sheriff and wolf away?'' Perhaps hybrid \n     seed, and science in general, provided an answer.\n       It may be charged--certainly it was in his own time--that \n     such a vision is utopian. But Wallace was not intimidated by \n     such language. ``Our utopias,'' he wrote, ``are the\n\n[[Page S9647]]\n\n     blueprints of our future civilization, and as such, airy \n     structures though they are, they really play a bigger part in \n     the progress of man than our more material structures of \n     brick and steel. The habit of building utopias shows to a \n     degree whether our race is made up of dull-spirited bipeds or \n     whether it is made up of men who want to enjoy the full \n     savoring of existence that comes only when they feel \n     themselves working with the forces of nature to remake the \n     world nearer to their heart's desire.''\n       It is worth reflecting upon this comment, for it \n     encompasses Wallace's answer to both those who would say \n     science must be allowed to work its will regardless of the \n     consequences, and to the critics of science who would rather \n     forego knowledge than cope with change.\n       To scientists he said this:\n       ``The cause of liberty and the cause of true science must \n     always be one and the same. For science cannot flourish \n     except in an atmosphere of freedom, and freedom cannot \n     survive unless there is an honest facing of facts . . . . \n     Democracy--and that term includes free science--must apply \n     itself to meeting the material need of men for work, for \n     income, for goods, for health, for security, and to meeting \n     their spiritual need for dignity, for knowledge, for self-\n     expression, for adventure and for reverence. And it must \n     succeed.''\n       In other words, the ends of science must always be mankind. \n     Scientists, no less than the rest of us, must every day ask \n     themselves; What is worthwhile?\n       To the anti-scientists, Wallace said this in 1933:\n       ``I have no patience with those who claim that the present \n     surplus of farm products means that we should stop our \n     efforts at improved agricultural efficiency. What we need is \n     not less science in farming, but more science in economics . \n     . . . Science has no doubt made the surplus possible, but \n     science is not responsible for our failure to distribute the \n     fruits of labor equitably.''\n       In other words, the answer to society's problems lies not \n     in blocking progress but in guiding it to serve mankind's \n     ends.\n       And to everyone he offered this warning:\n       ``The attacks upon science stem from many sources. It is \n     necessary for science to defend itself, first, against such \n     attacks, and second, against the consequences of its own \n     successes. What I mean is this: That science has \n     magnificently enabled mankind to conquer its first great \n     problem--that of producing enough to go around; but that \n     science, having created abundance, has now to help men live \n     with abundance. Having conquered seemingly unconquerable \n     physical obstacles, science has now to help mankind conquer \n     social and economic obstacles. Unless mankind can conquer \n     these new obstacles, the former successes of science will \n     seem worse than futile. The future of civilization, as well \n     as of science, is involved.''\n       Wallace also once observed ``scientific understanding is \n     our joy. Economic and political understanding is our duty.'' \n     His concept of scientific research was a broad one and \n     included the lifting of the social sciences to the same level \n     as the natural sciences. In turn, he challenged these \n     scientists to have a greater conscience concerning the \n     implications of their work. Applied research would properly \n     involve social planning, which would enable man to have more \n     leisure time and thus better enjoy non-material things, such \n     as ``music, painting, literature, sport for sport's sake, and \n     the idle curiosity of the scientist himself.''\n       The New Republic, which he served briefly as editor after \n     his retirement from politics, once described his concept of \n     political democracy as ``. . . that of a science which would \n     blend political freedom with the full use of resources, both \n     of manpower and of technologies, for everyone's welfare.''\n       It is intriguing to speculate about what Wallace might say \n     if he were here today, about the state of agriculture in this \n     country and around the world, about the movement for a \n     sustainable alternative agriculture, about the role of \n     science and the march of human progress. Probably his \n     comments would surprise all of us, as they so often surprised \n     audiences during his lifetime. His was a provocative and \n     remarkably original mind, unfazed by popular opinion and \n     conventional wisdom. The absence of ``corn shows'' testifies \n     to that.\n       First, on a very contemporary note, we can assume Wallace \n     would be appalled and disgusted by the attack now being made \n     on the nation's conservation programs, especially those \n     related to agriculture. The efforts made to preserve land--to \n     remove marginal land from production and protect the \n     remainder from erosion and abuse--were among his proudest \n     accomplishments. ``People in cities may forget the soil for \n     as long as a hundred years, but mother nature's memory is \n     long and she will not let them forget indefinitely,'' he \n     wrote. ``The soil is the mother of man and if we forget her, \n     life eventually weakens.\n       Second, Wallace would admonish us to use our abundance more \n     ``virtuously and wisely.'' In the long run, Wallace believed, \n     a healthy democracy could not tolerate the politics of \n     scarcity. In his own time, Wallace saw the devastating \n     consequences of scarcity run amuck; one-third of a nation \n     ill-nourished, ill-clad, and ill-housed. Today, however, we \n     might imagine that Wallace would see too much money, made in \n     unproductive ways, in the hands of too few people, too many \n     people without health insurance or secure and satisfying \n     employment, and far, far too many people leading wasted lives \n     in the poverty and degradation of our major cities. He would \n     deplore the national priorities which call for huge defense \n     budgets while reducing investments in education, environment, \n     and job training. He would be greatly troubled by the lack of \n     concern for the ``general welfare,'' the widespread violence \n     in our country, and the lack of civility and loss of \n     community in our national life. He would urge creative social \n     and economic planning to address these issues.\n       While he would welcome the liberalization of international \n     trade, he would decry the enormous expenditure of scarce \n     Third World resources on arms. He would advocate a stronger \n     U.N. military force and greater foreign assistance through \n     more efficient and reformed multilateral lending \n     institutions.\n       Third, we might guess that Wallace would look upon the \n     sustainable agriculture movement with considerable affection. \n     This is speculative because Wallace, like all of us, was a \n     man of his times, and no one would say he was close to being \n     ``certified organic'' in his own practices. He used chemical \n     pesticides and fertilizers liberally, and, some would argue, \n     helped pave the way for a highly mechanized, industrialized \n     agriculture through the introduction of hybrid seed to \n     commercial farming.\n       Still, Wallace was a man who believed in facts. If the \n     facts argued against chemical pesticides, he would have \n     accepted them totally. What he sought, in his life's work, \n     was not prosperity for corporations, but for the men and \n     women living on farms, doing God's work, preserving their \n     land and seeing ``the fruits of their labor raise the living \n     standards of mankind.'' Prosperity, he often warned farmers, \n     was not an end but the means to an end. He wrote: ``Can we \n     remember that prosperity is worthless except insofar as it \n     gives us more freedom and strength to do good work, to love \n     our fellow men and to take delight in the beauty of a world \n     wonderful enough to give pleasure to the Workman who planned \n     it?''\n       Finally, we can guess that he would say to farmers and \n     scientists: ``Small is good.'' When Wallace began his corn \n     breeding experiments, he recalled, he ``had only a fraction \n     of an acre within the city limits of Des Moines on which to \n     work. An inbred corn capable of unusually high yield came out \n     of [this] backyard garden, which was but ten by twenty feet. \n     . . .'' He was concerned that breeders might substitute \n     masses of data for real understanding and pointed out that \n     James Logan, an 18th Century experimenter, had learned from \n     four hills of corn, and that the principles of heredity were \n     discovered by Gregor Mendel, growing peas in a monastery \n     garden about 15 feet wide and 30 or 40 feet long, and \n     finally, that George H. Shull, one of the inventors and \n     developers of hybrid corn, used no more than one quarter of \n     an acre each season in conducting his experiments.\n       He deplored that the modern trend in science is in exactly \n     the opposite direction. ``The present emphasis,'' he wrote, \n     ``is directed toward doing things in a big way, toward large \n     numbers and multidisciplinary research. In many of our \n     educational institutions, scientific progress seems to be \n     measured in terms of the growth of departments and the number \n     and size of financial grants that can be obtained for support \n     of the work. . . . The great scientific weakness of America \n     today.'' he said, ``is that she tends to emphasize quantity \n     at the expense of quality--statistics instead of genuine \n     insight--immediate utilitarian application instead of genuine \n     thought about fundamentals. . . . True science cannot be \n     evolved by mass-production methods.''\n       At 75 years of age and in outwardly remarkable physical \n     condition, Wallace became afflicted with Amyotrophic Lateral \n     Sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. This disease affects the \n     nervous system and causes muscular atrophy. There is no cure. \n     An experimenter to the end, he kept a careful record of his \n     symptoms and reactions in a memo entitled, ``Reflections of \n     an ALSer.'' In the final weeks of his illness, in September \n     1965, Wallace was visited by a friend while a patient at NIH. \n     The visitor noted that the flowers in his room had been sent \n     by President Lyndon Johnson. Wallace, who, given the \n     disease's progression, could no longer speak, wrote on a \n     notepad, ``I hope they think about decentralization as the \n     hope of the future. Big cities will become cesspools.''\n       Wallace always rose very early on his Farvue farm and, as \n     long as his failing health permitted, continued to type his \n     own correspondence with geneticists, plant breeders and \n     others around the world before going out to the field in a \n     mechanized wheelchair to work with his research plots.\n       One of his last letters was to a long-time friend and corn \n     breeder:\n       ``Your 3306 [a hybrid seed corn code] has me all excited. \n     So glad you have 2,000 acres of it. . . . I was feeling \n     rather blue when I got up this morning, thinking the end of \n     the road was not far off. But when I got to thinking about \n     3306, I felt I just had to live to see how [it] would adapt \n     to the tropical program, the Argentine program, and the South \n     Georgia program. Yes, this is the most exciting letter I have \n     ever received from you.''\n       That was his message. Think big, plant small, work hard, \n     seek the truth, glorify God, and have sympathy for the \n     plant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9644-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9647-S9648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9648]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3680 which was received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3680) to amend title 18, United States Code, \n     to carry out the international obligations of the United \n     States under the Geneva Conventions to provide criminal \n     penalties for certain war crimes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this particular act is known as the War \nCrimes Act of 1996. This was called to my attention by a very \narticulate young Congressman from North Carolina, Walter Jones, Jr., \nwhose father we served with for many, many years over in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  He was very observant in discovering something, that after 40 years, \nafter the ratification of the Geneva Conventions, that it was not self-\nenacting, and we actually have never passed the necessary legislation \nto accept jurisdiction within our Federal courts to prosecute war \ncrimes that we were aware of.\n  So this legislation will correct that after this long period of time. \nIt is kind of inconceivable to me that we would send out to battle and \nto various parts of the world our young troops, trying to equip them \nproperly--I would say properly, that if we ever get our authorization \npassed--and have these people ready to do the work that they are \ntrained to do, and yet if a crime is perpetrated against them, and that \ncriminal happens to be in the United States, we cannot even prosecute \nthem in our Federal courts. That is all going to come to a stop.\n  I think also this bill might even address another problem that is \ntaking place right now in this country. As you know, I am from \nOklahoma. And one of the worst terrorist acts took place just a little \nover a year ago in Oklahoma City with the bombing of the Murrah Federal \nOffice Building. And with all of the terrorist acts recently, this \ncould act as a deterrent, this War Crimes Act of 1996, for people who \nmay be considering perpetrating some terrorist act that could be \ndefined as a war crime.\n  So I believe this is something that should have been done some 40 \nyears ago, but was not. So we will correct that tonight. This has been \ncleared by both sides.\n  Mr HELMS. Mr. President, this bill will help to close a major gap in \nour Federal criminal law by permitting American servicemen and \nnationals, who are victims of war crimes, to see the criminal brought \nto justice in the United States.\n  Before addressing the need for this legislation, let me thank and \ncommend the distinguished Walter Jones, who so ably represents the \nthird district of North Carolina, for his commitment and hard work \ntoward the passage of this bill. I'd also like to thank my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator James Inhofe, for his support of this \nimportant bill.\n  Many have not realized that the U.S. cannot prosecute, in Federal \ncourt, the perpetrators of some war crimes against American servicemen \nand nationals. Currently, if the United States were to find a war \ncriminal within our borders--for example, one who had murdered an \nAmerican POW--the only options would be to deport or extradite the \ncriminal or to try him or her before an international war crimes \ntribunal or military commission. Alone, these options are not enough to \ninsure that justice is done.\n  While the Geneva Convention of 1949 grants the U.S. authority to \ncriminally prosecute these acts, the Congress has never enacted \nimplementing legislation. The War Crimes Act of 1996 corrects this \noversight by giving Federal district courts jurisdiction to try \nindividuals charged with committing a grave breach of the Geneva \nConventions, whenever the victim or perpetrator is a U.S. serviceman or \nnational.\n  The bill would also allow an American, who is charged with a war \ncrime, to be tried in an American court and to receive all of the \nprocedural protections afforded by our American justice system.\n  Mr. President, at a time when American servicemen and women serve our \nNation in conflicts around the world, it is important that we give them \nevery protection possible. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan bill and reaffirm our commitment to our country's \nservicemembers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 25, 1996]\n\n                      Ms. Maloney and Mr. Waldheim\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n       For a full half-century, with determination and skill, and \n     with the help of the law, U.S. intelligence agencies have \n     kept secret the record of how they used Nazis for so many \n     years after World War II, what the agencies got from these \n     services--and what they gave as payback.\n       Despite the secrecy blockade, we do know how one \n     cooperative former Wehrmacht officer and war crimes suspect \n     was treated. We know the U.S. got him the Secretary \n     Generalship of the U.N. as reward and base.\n       For more than two years, Congress has had legislation \n     before it to allow the public access to information about \n     U.S.-Nazi intelligence relations--a bill introduced by \n     Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Manhattan Democrat, and \n     now winding through the legislative process.\n       If Congress passes her War Crimes Disclosure Act, H.R. \n     1281, questions critical to history and the conduct of \n     foreign affairs can be answered and the power of government \n     to withhold them reduced. The case of Kurt Waldheim is the \n     most interesting example--the most interesting we know of at \n     the moment.\n       Did the U.S. know when it backed him for Secretary General \n     that he had been put on the A list of war-crime suspects, \n     adopted in London in 1948, for his work as a Wehrmacht \n     intelligence officer in the Balkans, when tens of thousands \n     of Yugoslavs, Greeks, Italians, Jew and non-Jew, were being \n     deported to death?\n       If not, isn't that real strange, since the U.S. \n     representative on the War Crimes Commission voted to list \n     him? A report was sent to the State Department. Didn't State \n     give the C.I.A. a copy--a peek?\n       And when he was running for Secretary General why did State \n     Department biographies omit any reference to his military \n     service--just as he forgot to mention it in his \n     autobiographies?\n       If all that information was lost by teams of stupid clerks, \n     once the Waldheim name came up for the job why did not the \n     U.S. do the obvious thing--check with Nazi and war-crime \n     records in London and Berlin to see if his name by any chance \n     was among those dearly wanted?\n       Didn't the British know? They voted for the listing too. \n     And the Russians--Yugoslavia moved to list him when it was a \n     Soviet satellite. Belgrade never told Moscow?\n       How did Mr. Waldheim repay the U.S. for its enduring \n     fondness to him? Twice it pushed him successfully for the \n     job. The third time it was among few countries that backed \n     him again but lost. Nobody can say the U.S. was not loyal to \n     the end.\n       Did he also serve the Russians and British? One at a time? \n     Or was he a big-power groupie, serving all?\n       One thing is not secret any longer, thanks to Prof. Robert \n     Herzstein of the University of South Carolina history \n     department. He has managed through years of perseverance to \n     pry some information loose. He found that while Mr. Waldheim \n     worked for the Austrian bureaucracy, the U.S. Embassy in \n     Vienna year after year sent in blurby reports about his \n     assistance to American foreign policy--friendly, outstanding, \n     cooperative, receptive to American thinking. All the while, \n     this cuddly fellow was on the A list, which was in the locked \n     files or absent with official leave.\n       On May 24, 1994, I reported on Professor Herzstein's \n     findings and the need for opening files of war-crime \n     suspects. Representative Maloney quickly set to work on her \n     bill to open those files to Freedom of Information requests--\n     providing safeguards for personal privacy, ongoing \n     investigations and national security if ever pertinent.\n       Her first bill expired in the legislative machinery and in \n     1995 she tried again. She got her hearing recently thanks to \n     the chairman of her subcommittee of the Government Reform \n     Committee--Stephen Horn, the California Republican.\n       If the leaders of Congress will it, the Maloney bill can be \n     passed this year. I nominate my New York Senators to \n     introduce it in the Senate. It will be a squeeze to get it \n     passed before the end of the year, so kindly ask your \n     representatives and senators to start squeezing.\n       If not, the laborious legislative procedure will have to be \n     repeated next session. Questions about the Waldheim \n     connection will go unanswered, and also about other cases \n     that may be in the files or strangely misplaced, which will \n     also be of interest.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be\n\n[[Page S9649]]\n\ndeemed read a third time, and passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3680) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATFIELD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       In furtherance of the purposes of this title, there is \n     hereby authorized to be appropriated the sum of $2 million.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5150\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I understand that there is a substitute \namendment at the desk offered by myself and I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Hatfield] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5150.\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, at the end of \nthis year, I will leave the Senate and return to the inviting shores of \nOregon. Oregon is the State of my birth and the State that I have \nlabored to represent for over four decades. It has never been a mystery \nto me why so many have been drawn to my State. The rich pioneer spirit \nof Oregon's citizenry is matched only by the blessings of the State's \nbountiful natural treasures.\n  I am pleased to speak today about legislation that will ensure that \nseveral of Oregon's most significant natural treasures will be \nprotected for future generations. This legislation, the Oregon \nResources Conservation Act, of which I am the proud sponsor, includes \neight titles addressing a host of natural resource issues. Many of the \nissues within these titles have been the subject of great debate and \nlingered unresolved for years.\n  The heart of this proposal is title one, which creates a 25,800-acre \nOpal Creek Wilderness and National Scenic Recreation Area. Opal Creek \nis one of the last remaining intact, low-elevation old growth forest \nareas in Western Oregon. The Opal Creek title of the Oregon Resources \nConservation Act would create a 25,800-acre Opal Creek Wilderness and \nNational Scenic-Recreation Area. Of the 25,800 acres, 12,800 acres \nwould be designated as new wilderness to be managed under the \nWilderness Act of 1964, and 13,000 acres would be managed as a national \nscenic-recreation area.\n  A great public debate has surrounded the Opal Creek issue for \ndecades. It is my firm hope that this is a debate we are about to \nresolve. Opal Creek is a very special place, and I have always believed \nthe area merits permanent protection.\n  I sought to include protection for the area in my 1984 Oregon \nwilderness bill, and again in my 1988 wild and scenic rivers bill. Both \ntimes I was forced to remove the provision at the request of Oregon's \nGovernor. Representative Mike Kopetski made a bold effort to legislate \nprotection in 1994, but time ran out in the 103d Congress before final \naction could be taken in the Senate.\n  Today, the entire 35,000 acre watershed that includes the Opal Creek \nsub-basin is protected from commercial timber harvest under President \nClinton's forest plan. Timber companies have indicated to me that they \ndoubt commercial timber harvests will ever occur again in the drainage. \nSimilarly, environmentalists have indicated to me that they believe \nthere is no danger of harvests in the drainage in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n\n  Surely this is an area fertile for agreement. It is time to show the \npublic some small sign of reconciliation in this continuing feud over \nour natural resources. It was my hope that the Opal Creek Working \nGroup, which met over a period of 6 months with the assistance of a \nprofessional mediator, would provide the agreement Oregonians of all \npersuasions desire so much. While the working group failed to reach a \ncomprehensive agreement, areas of common interest and shared values \nwere uncovered, and the group's deliberations assisted me greatly in \ndeveloping this legislation.\n  This issue has lingered unresolved for far too long, and with this \nlegislation, we have an opportunity to settle it, once and for all.\n  The Opal Creek title of my legislation addresses each and every one \nof the sub-watersheds in the Little North Fork Santiam River drainage, \neither through a wilderness or a National Scenic Recreation Area \ndesignation. By doing this, I have attempted to protect the outstanding \nresource values in each of these sub-drainages, while at the same time \naddressing the area comprehensively as an intact ecosystem.\n  Significant portions of the Cedar Creek sub-watershed have been \nincluded, part in the Opal Creek Wilderness and part in the Scenic \nRecreation Area. This protection includes approximately three-quarters \nof the old growth in the sub-watershed. The five sections that comprise \nthe center of the area include private interests. The presence of these \nprivate interests has made this area one of the most difficult to \nresolve. Through the cooperation of the Rosboro Lumber Co. and the \nForest Service, we have provided the framework for a very directed land \nexchange. This exchange will allow this full section, approximately 640 \nacres, to be included in the Scenic Recreation Area. In exchange, \nRosboro will receive sufficient parcels to accomplish an equal value \nexchange. The prioritized list of parcels provided in the S. 1662 \nrepresent parcels which border, many on three sides, land already owned \nby Rosboro.\n  One important part of this protection is the designation of Elkhorn \nCreek as Oregon's newest wild and scenic river. This designation will \nprotect nearly the full length of the Elkhorn as it moves from land \nmanaged by the Forest Service to land managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement. The BLM manages approximately three sections through which \nthe Elkhorn flows. It is my intent that the full amount of these three \nsections be included in the wild and scenic designation. The language \nin the bill has been written to accomplish that result. The BLM \nportions are designated as ``scenic'', while\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\nthe Forest Service portions are designated as ``wild''. This \ndistinction is provided for to allow the BLM to put in a trail head and \nviewpoint for recreationalists to view this very special area.\n\n  In addition to addressing the protection of the entire watershed, the \nOpal Creek title of this bill maintains recreation at existing levels \nand allows for growth in uses where appropriate. The bill also calls \nfor historical, cultural, and ecological interpretation in the newly \ncreated area to be conducted in a balanced and factually accurate \nmanner. Motorized recreation will be prohibited except on the existing \nroad system and nonmotorized use will be permitted throughout the area, \nexcept, of course, in the wilderness. The existing road system will be \nanalyzed and evaluated through a management planning process, which \nwill decide which roads to close and which to leave open. No new water \nimpoundments will be allowed in this area. No new mining claims will be \nallowed to be filed under the 1872 Mining Law, and no existing claims \nwill be allowed to be patented. In addition, the bill calls for the \ncreation of an advisory council composed of members of the local \ncommunity, industry, environmental groups, locally elected officials, \nthe Forest Service and an appointee by the Governor. Finally, the bill \nwill not allow commercial timber harvesting of any kind in the Opal \nCreek area except to prevent the spread of a forest fire or to protect \npublic health and safety. It is important to note that the lands \ncovered by my legislation are not included now in the timber base and \nare not currently open to commercial harvest.\n  The final element of the Opal Creek package, Mr. President, was an \nimportant part of the working group's discussions. I am referring to an \neconomic development package for the Santiam Canyon, which includes the \ncommunities immediately adjacent to the Opal Creek area. This package \nis based, primarily, on a set of infrastructure improvements developed \nby these communities in conjunction with the State Economic Development \nOffice, which are designed to improve the water quality and delivery \nsystems of the communities in the area. It is also my intention that \nthe funding allowed here would be available for cleanup and \ntransportation costs related to the Amalgamated Mill site in the Opal \nCreek area on Battle Ax Creek.\n  I have made the first down payment on this economic commitment \npackage by including a $300,000 appropriation in the fiscal year 1996 \nOmnibus Appropriations Act to help begin the cleanup of the \ncontaminated Amalgamated Mill site. There is a continuing discussion of \nthe best way to accomplish the cleanup of this site at the earliest \npossible date and in a manner that does not endanger public health or \nsafety. This legislation is neutral on the method of cleanup, but \nshould be read as a directive to all parties involved to move forward \nwith deliberate speed to clean up this anomaly in an area of such \nprofound beauty.\n  Throughout the coming fiscal year 1997 appropriations cycle, I will \nwork closely with Oregon's Governor, John Kitzhaber, and my colleague \non the House Appropriations Committee from Oregon, Jim Bunn, to further \nrefine this package and provide additional funding, as needed, for the \nAmalgamated Mill cleanup and for the critical community infrastructure \nprojects designed to allow these former timber communities to diversify \ntheir economic bases and improve their water systems.\n\n  In short, the Opal Creek title of this bill attempts to address every \nissue raised both in the 1994 hearings on Opal Creek and in the working \ngroup process conducted out in Oregon. This is an issue I have worked \non for almost 20 years. I am extremely pleased that, with this \nlegislation and accompanying infrastructure development package, we \nwill finally be able to address the protection of Opal Creek and the \nadjacent portions of the Little North Fork Santiam Watershed, as well \nas improvements to the water quality and delivery systems of nearby, \ntimber-dependent communities.\n  Mr. President, the second and third titles of the Oregon Resources \nConservation Act provide for the establishment of 5-year pilot projects \nfor two, consensus-based natural resource planning bodies now working \nin Oregon's Klamath and Deschutes Basins. Both of these bodies are \nalready in place and have been working to provide the Federal agencies \nwith recommendations about how best to prioritize spending for \necological restoration, economic health and reducing drought impacts.\n  I called for the creation of the Upper Klamath Basin Working Group in \n1995. This group is citizen-led and includes environmentalists, \nirrigators, local business leaders, locally elected officials, \neducators, the Klamath Tribes, and Federal land management agencies in \nan advisory capacity. This group was charged with developing both \nshort- and long-term recommendations for restoring ecological health in \nthe Klamath Basin. They were successful in developing short-term \nfunding recommendations ranging from riparian and wetland restoration, \nto fish passage and the coordination of geological information systems \nin the basin. I followed through on these recommendations and was able \nto obtain either funding or direction to the pertinent agencies in the \nfiscal year 1996 appropriations process. I am again attempting to \nprovide funding for the consensus based projects of the Klamath Working \nGroup in the fiscal year 1997 appropriations process.\n  The group has also developed a long-term recommendation which \nincludes a formal registration of the group as a State-sanctioned \nfoundation and congressional legislation enabling them to help land \nmanagement agencies set priorities for how money is spent in the basin \non various ecological restoration and economic stabilization projects.\n  Senate bill 1662 addresses the group's long-term recommendation by \ncreating a 5-year pilot project to allow the Upper Klamath Basin \nWorking Group/Foundation, in conjunction with the Federal land \nmanagement agencies in the basin, to develop funding priorities for \necological restoration in the basin. It will authorize $1 million per \nyear to be spent consistent with these priorities. This money will be \nadministered by the agencies and matched by an equal amount of non-\nFederal dollars.\n\n  Under title III of the bill, the Deschutes Basin in central Oregon \nwould also be allowed to develop a similar regime using, as its base, a \ngroup formed by the Warm Springs Tribes, the Environmental Defense \nFund, local irrigators, and locally elected officials. This group has \nbeen meeting and collaborating on projects in the basin for several \nyears.\n  Recently, both of these working groups have been able to make \nsignificant progress in building coalitions and consensus on natural \nresource management challenges that, not too long ago, many felt were \ninsurmountable. By giving them more authority to temporarily assist \nFederal agencies with setting policy priorities using a finite amount \nof money, I hope we can begin to enter a new era of more local control \nand greater public input regarding resource management decisions. I \nalso hope these groups, and others that may follow, will continue to \nuse the consensus-based management approach to return resource \nmanagement decisions to a collaborative, inclusive process rather than \nthe divisive, litigious morass in which we find ourselves today.\n  The fourth title provides for a land exchange in Oregon's beautiful \nMt. Hood corridor. The purpose of this title is to protect the viewshed \nalong the Highway 26 corridor on the way to Mt. Hood, the highest \nmountain peak in my State. The exchange between the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Longview Fibre timber company would withdraw lands \nwithin the viewshed of the Mt. Hood corridor from the timber base. Both \nparties are willing participants in this process.\n  Longview Fibre owns approximately 3,500 acres of timber land in the \nscenic Mt. Hood corridor, which are interspersed with BLM lands in a \ncheckerboard fashion. Longview would like to harvest these lands within \nthe next 5 years, but is sensitive about the public perception \nregarding these clearcuts along such a heavily traveled route. I agree \nwith Longview Fibre and feel harvesting these trees along Highway 26 \nwould be a disaster both for the ecological and visual characteristics \nof the resource. Longview, to their credit, has been extremely \ninterested in working with local planning and environmental groups to \nidentify BLM parcels elsewhere in western Oregon that could be traded \nfor the Longview Fibre lands in the corridor.\n\n[[Page S9656]]\n\n  This proposal is a unique opportunity to forge ahead with a plan that \nhas been built at the local level over the past 5 years and which has \nvirtually unanimous support, including the local county government, \nlocal businesses, the timber industry, and local environmental groups.\n  Included in this title is a very limited exemption from the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act. I want to be clear that this exemption is in \nno way to be used as a precedent for future waivers of NEPA. This is a \nunique circumstance, and to counterbalance this exemption, I have \nincluded funding in the fiscal year 1997 appropriations process to \nundertake environmental analysis for this exchange.\n\n  The fifth title of S. 1662 would establish the Coquille Forest near \nthe town of Coos Bay, OR. During my Senate career, it has been my \npleasure, and I believe my obligation, to take an active role in the \nrestoration of Federal recognition to a number of Indian tribes in the \nState of Oregon. One of those tribes, the Coquille Tribe from near Coos \nBay, OR, was restored in 1989. In the Coquille Restoration Act, Public \nLaw 101-42, which I was proud to sponsor in the Senate, a requirement \nwas included that the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe develop \nand submit a plan for the tribe's pursuit of economic self-sufficiency.\n  The Coquille Tribe took that mandate to heart and developed and \nsubmitted an extraordinarily comprehensive plan. Wisely, I think, the \nplan encompassed self-suficiency initiatives across a diverse range of \nprojects. The centerpiece of the plan was a proposal to establish a \nsignificant forest land for the tribe within its aboriginal territory. \nThe overall goal of the plan and the forest are to move the standard of \nliving for the members of the Coquille Tribe closer to that of the \npeople of Oregon overall and to provide for the cultural restoration of \nthe Coquille people.\n  The Coquille Tribe's forest proposal is not, nor is this legislation, \nsome new and novel precedent. Land bases have already been established \nfor a number of federally recognized Oregon tribes, including the Grand \nRondes, Siletz, Warm Springs, and Umatillas. These tribal land bases \nrange from 3,600 acres to 640,000 acres. This title would establish a \n5,400-acre land base for the Coquille Tribe. Hardly a precedent in \neither size or action.\n  Moreover, the Coquille proposal is quite innovative and unique. The \nproposal originally developed by the Coquille Tribe was a cutting-edge, \nscientifically based plan to manage the land. The plan would have used \nenvironmentally sensitive methods of land management to benefit not \nonly the tribe but the surrounding communities as well. This land \nmanagement approach was as innovative as any I have seen during my \npublic career, and it prompted me to lend my support to the tribe's \neffort.\n  This provision is intended to provide a measure of restitution to the \nCoquille Tribe. This land was forcibly taken from its inhabitants, an \nact that I think anyone today would decry as unjust. In the past, \natrocities have been heaped upon Oregon's native American tribes, \nincluding the Army's efforts to round up the southwestern Oregon tribes \nlike cattle and march them hundreds of miles to government-created \nIndian reservations at Siletz and Klamath Falls.\n  To the tribes affected by these U.S. Government policies, the act of \nuprooting them from their homelands and herding them to far-away \nreservations destroyed their culture and killed many of their people. \nThese acts were the equivalent of the ethnic cleansing we have seen in \nrecent years against the Muslim people in Bosnia. The restoration of \n5,400 acres could never atone for the hardships imposed upon the \nCoquille people. It can, however, begin to help restore some semblance \nof culture and a tie to the land that our Federal Government attempted \nto destroy over 150 years ago.\n  I have gathered as much public input on the Coquille Tribe forest \nproposal as on any single legislative effort throughout my entire \nSenate career. I held two Senate hearings on the matter, one in Salem, \nOR, and one in Washington, DC. I also have received many letters and \nphone calls carefully analyzed related public polls, and reviewed \nnewspaper editorials. All of these factors have contributed to the \n5,400-acre proposal I have developed.\n  The forming of this title as it appears today in the substitute has \nbeen very challenging. The myriad interests of the Interior Department, \nthe people of Coos County, the logging and environmental communities, \nthe State of Oregon, and certainly the Coquille Tribe have brought \ntogether starkly divergent viewpoints.\n  This title reflects many of the elements from the tribe's earlier \nproposal, but it is also very different. To accommodate the diversity \nof interests, and to do so within the parameters of the current \ndiscourse regarding the Federal lands, I have fashioned a unique and \nscaled-down hybrid. I must say that in so doing, the Coquille Tribe has \nmade some very substantial concessions.\n  First, title five creates a Coquille Forest of only approximately \n5,400 acres in size. While the parcels are shown on a BLM map, \nreferenced in the legislation, for clarity I am adding the legal \ndescriptions in the Record. The Coquille Forest consists of the Federal \nportions of the following descriptions:\n\n     Willamette Meridian West, Oregon\n     T28S R10W S. 30,33\n     T28S R11W S. 14,25,26\n     T29S R10W S. 5\n     T30S R11W S. 5,7,15,24,25,29,33\n     T29S R11W S. 23 SE\\1/4\\ SE\\1/4\\\n       S. 26 E\\1/2\\ NE\\1/4\\\n       S. 26 SW\\1/4\\ NE\\1/4\\\n       S. 26 N\\1/2\\ SE\\1/4\\\n     T29S R12W S. 26 S\\1/2\\ SW\\1/4\\\n       S. 35 NE\\1/4\\ NW\\1/4\\\n       S. 35 NW\\1/4\\ NE\\1/4\\\n\n  Second, a 2-year transition period is required prior to the Forest \ntransferring into trust for the tribe. To preserve Federal timber \nrevenues to the O Counties, the Interior Secretary is authorized to \ndesignate an appropriate amount of nearby Federal public domain land \ninto O status.\n\n  Third, after the forest is transferred to the Assistant Secretary for \nIndian Affairs, its management must be consistent with the standards \nand guidelines of adjacent and nearby Federal forest plans. While this \nconsistency requirement is to extend into the future, it should be \nnoted that I do not anticipate that this requirement will foreclose the \ntribe from realizing at least some significant cultural or economic \nbenefits from its forest.\n  Fourth, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs is to manage the \nCoquille Forest pursuant to all applicable State and Federal forestry \nand environmental laws, specifically including critical habitat \ndesignations under the Endangered Species Act. Federal log export \nrestrictions will apply to logs from the Coquille Forest, and \ncompetitive bidding is specifically required on all sales.\n  Fifth, this statute assures continued public access and State \nregulation of hunting and fishing. Conversely, it is expected that \ntribal access is assured to all its parcels.\n  Sixth, Federal law and policies fostering Indian self-determination \nare recognized by providing opportunity for the tribe to assume some or \nall of the management of the Coquille Forest. As a requirement for the \ntribe assuming such management functions, a memorandum of agreement is \nrequired with the State of Oregon that details the State's jurisdiction \nand regulatory functions, and which incorporates the requirements for \nmanagement consistency with surrounding plans. To assure enforceability \nof the MOA, both the tribe and the State are authorized to take each \nother to Federal court.\n  Finally, the title provides that any affected citizen may sue the \nSecretary of the Interior for violations of the title. This is not \nintended to expand laws or case law related to standing to sue. The \ncourt is specifically authorized to order the Secretary to withdraw any \nmanagement authority delegated to the tribe for the management of the \nforest.\n  I want to emphasize again the unique arrangement of this provision. \nIt is intended to establish a Coquille Forest for the Coquille Tribe \nthat will mesh into the broader forest management of Coos County. \nWithin that context, the Coquille Forest is to provide a basis for \nrestoring the tribe's culture as well as providing economic benefits.\n  I hope this proposal, with its relatively modest acreage and the \nrequired adherence to the most environmentally friendly forest \nmanagement plan ever implemented in the Pacific\n\n[[Page S9657]]\n\nNorthwest--President Clinton's forest plan--is successful and can \nbecome a model for how our Nation deals with other claims by native \nAmerican tribes.\n\n  The sixth title of S. 1662 addresses a longstanding issue in my \nState. The Portland area has been blessed with one of the cleanest \nsources of drinking water in the Nation. The Bull Run Watershed, east \nof Portland in the Cascade Mountains, has been providing safe and pure \ndrinking water to Portlanders for over a century. I have always \nsupported protection for this vital resource, including my working to \nenact the 1977 Bull Run Protection Act, Public Law 95-200.\n  Title six amends Public Law 95-200 by additional restrictions on \nmanagement within the hydrographic boundary of the Bull Run Watershed. \nThis is depicted on a map refered to in the legislation. The additional \nprotections do not include the controversial buffer areas or the \nadjacent Little Sandy Watershed. These additional areas have long been \nthe source of controversy which has effectively blocked providing the \nadditional protections within area that have a direct impact on \nPortland's drinking water.\n  I am pleased that, in working with my colleague from Oregon, Mr. \nWyden, we have reached an important agreement on this matter, which is \nincluded in S. 1662. The vital part of the agreement involves a study \nof the impact of management activities within the Little Sandy on \nPortland's drinking water. This is the heart of the issue with respect \nto the Little Sandy. With that critical agreement, the additional \nprotections for the main drainage may go forward.\n  I want to pay a special tribute to my colleague for working so \nconstructively with me on this important matter to Oregonians. Senator \nWyden has made an impressive commitment to this issue and I commend him \nfor his leadership. Let me also commend Representative Elizabeth Furse \nfor her commitment to this issue. She has partnered with Senator Wyden \nto resolve elevate this important issue in the public dialog.\n  Finally, I wish to commend the newest member of the Oregon \ndelegation, Representative Earl Blumenauer, for the valuable role he \nplayed in resolving this issue. The Bull Run Reservoir is located in \nCongressman Blumenauer's legislative district, and through his prompt \nintervention in this matter at a critical stage, he performed a \nvaluable service to his constituents.\n  The seventh title of this bill would add approximately 120 acres to \nthe existing Oregon Islands Wilderness. This area is comprised of \nislands, reefs and rocks within 3 miles of the Oregon coast.\n  In 1991, the Fish and Wildlife Service completed a wilderness \nsuitability study on 1,200 of these formations, which extend 307 miles, \nfrom Tillamook Head to just north of the California border. The Fish \nand Wildlife Service has recommended a wilderness designation for the \nstudy area.\n\n  These islands, rocks, and reefs are small and extremely rugged in \nappearance. The soil cover is shallow. Light vegetation consists \nprimarily of low-growing grasses and herbaceous plants. These areas are \nvaluable as nesting, roosting and foraging habitat for bald eagles, \nperegrine falcons, California brown pelicans, Canadian geese, and a \nnumber of other seabirds and shorebirds. They are also extensively used \nby marine mammals, such as Steller sea lions, California sea lions, \nPacific harbor seals, and threatened northern elephant seal.\n  Protection of this area would help preserve a reflection of America's \nrich island heritage. They are also closely associated with the culture \nof coastal native Americans and early European settlers.\n  The final title of this legislation provides direction for a land \nexchange study within the Uppqua Basin in southern Oregon. The goal of \nthe Uppqua land exchange project is to determine if there is a land \nownership pattern within the Uppqua River Basin, different from the \ncurrent one, that would more effectively protect fish and wildlife \nhabitat and allowing more sustainable resource production. The project \nhas hired a team of Oregon scientists to study the resources of this \nbasin to determine if opportunities exist for public and private land \nexchanges are possible to achieve this goal.\n  On Federal lands, the opportunity exists for increasing wildlife and \nfisheries habitat protection as well as sustainable supply of timber as \na result of exchanging lands. On private lands, the project could \nassist land owners better meet their land management goals by providing \nlands better suited for timber productions that are not as ecologically \nsensitive as those traded into Federal ownership.\n  To test this theory, this title directs the land management agencies \nto take a careful look at the land ownership patterns in this area and \nat the current makeup of laws and policies. I believe this study will \nuncover great potential for improvements in our land ownership \npatterns.\n  Mr. President, this is comprehensive legislation. I am extremely \npleased with this bill. It protects some of Oregon's most important \nnatural resource areas, Opal Creek, Bull Run, the Oregon Islands and \nthe Mt. Hood corridor. It also promotes consensus-based, watershed \nplanning at the local level in the Klamath and Deschutes Basins. \nFinally, it makes investments in the future through important studies.\n  I have worked many years to protect Oregon's magnificent natural \nresources. I am pleased that in this, my last year in the Senate, I \nwill be able to continue this legacy of protecting Oregon's natural \nbeauty for the enjoyment and use of future generations.\n  At this point I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter addressed to myself from Under Secretary James Lyons of the \nDepartment of Agriculture in which they indicate the administration \nsupport for the two titles, the Opal Creek title and the one on the \nBull Run.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter from Mayor Vera Katz of the city of Portland and Commissioner \nMike Lindberg also endorsing title VI which relates to Portland's main \nand only water supply, which is called the Bull Run.\n  And I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a section-\nby-section analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 1996.\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     Washington, DC 20510.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: I am writing in support of the two \n     provisions in S. 1662, as amended, which affect Opal Creek \n     and Bull Run in the Willamette National Forest in Oregon.\n       The Administration testified in support of the Opal Creek \n     Wilderness and Opal Creek Scenic Recreation Area Act of 1996. \n     S. 1662 adds approximately 12,800 acres of mixed old growth \n     forest and anadromous fish habitat to the Wilderness \n     Preservation System granting it permanent protection for \n     primitive use and resource conservation. In addition, the \n     legislation provides Wild and Scenic River protection for \n     Elkhorn Creek as recommended in our hearing testimony. You \n     have worked hard to prepare legislation which balances the \n     concerns of all parties and I appreciate your diligent \n     efforts.\n       The Department of Agriculture supports the compromise \n     position taken in Title VI of the bill regarding the Bull Run \n     and Little Sandy Watersheds. Conservation in these two \n     watersheds is important to the success of the President's \n     Forest Plan for the owl region and for the City of Portland. \n     The report to Congress authorized in the legislation will \n     help provide information to decide whether any further action \n     is necessary regarding these lands. I especially support the \n     public process which will be used to prepare the study.\n       Again, I want to congratulate you on your hard work on \n     these provisions. The Department of Agriculture supports \n     enactment of these two titles.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James R. Lyons,\n     Under Secretary.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                July 24, 1996.\n\n     Hon. Mark O. Hatfield,\n     711 Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatfield: On behalf of the citizens of \n     Portland and the drinking water consumers of the Portland \n     metropolitan region, thank you for your outstanding efforts \n     in the development of Title VI, Bull Run Watershed \n     Protection, in S. 1662, ``The Oregon Resource Conservation \n     Act of 1996''.\n       We were pleased by the unanimous passage of S. 1662 on June \n     19 by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. We \n     have been very grateful to work with you and your staff since \n     then on enhancements to the provisions of Title VI which will \n     be added during forthcoming consideration by the full Senate.\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\n       It has been a great honor to work with you on the issue of \n     additional statutory protection for Bull Run water quality \n     since the adoption by the City Council Resolution covering \n     this subject in October 1993.\n       The provisions of Title VI covering a ban on timber cutting \n     in the hydrographic boundary of the Bull Run drainage, \n     including certain lands within the unit and located below the \n     headworks of the City's water storage and delivery project, \n     except in activities expressly reserved for the City, and the \n     ban on salvage sales, will greatly improve the City's ability \n     to ensure water quality protection in the years to come. The \n     study on the portion of the Little Sandy Watershed within the \n     unit, to be undertaken by the Secretary of Agriculture in \n     consultation with the City, will help to provide useful \n     guidance for the future regarding logging in the Little Sandy \n     and water quality impacts.\n       We plan to work very closely with you and your staff as S. \n     1662 continues through the subsequent phases of the \n     legislative process to help in any way we can to ensure that \n     it can be enacted in the few remaining weeks of this \n     Congress.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this important \n     initiative.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                        Vera Katz,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                                    Mike Lindberg,\n     Commissioner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n           s. 1662--oregon resources conservation act of 1996\n\n     TITLE I--Opal Creek Wilderness and Scenic-Recreation Area\n       12,800 acre Opal Creek Wilderness Area.\n       13,000 acre Opal Creek National Scenic-Recreation Area.\n       Designates Elkhorn Creek Wild and Scenic River.\n       Sets up management planning process for Scenic Area.\n       Sets up 13 member Advisory Council consisting of locally \n     elected officials, environmentalists, timber industry, mining \n     industry, inholders.\n       Establishes guidelines for disposition of existing \n     inholdings.\n       Authorizes $15 million Economic Development Plan.\n     TITLE III--Upper Klamath Basin Pilot Project\n       Creates a five-year pilot project to allow consensus-based \n     citizen working group to provide ecological restoration \n     recommendations to federal agencies.\n       Authorizes $1,000,000 per year for consensus-based \n     projects.\n       Projects must be matched 1-to-1 with non-federal sources.\n       Fish and Wildlife Service is lead agency.\n     TITLE III--Deschutes Basin Pilot Project\n       Creates a five-year pilot project similar to the Klamath \n     Working Group.\n       Also authorizes $1,000,000 per year for ecosystem \n     restoration projects, 1-to-1 match with non-federal funds.\n       Bureau of Reclamation is lead agency.\n     TITLE IV--Mt.

Mr. President, there are some very important people who \nhave helped bring this day, now, to fruition. I want to mention the \nformer Congressman from Oregon, Mike Kopetski, who made a valiant \neffort in 1994 to pass an Opal Creek protection bill. The bill was \npassed in the House. However, time ran out, in the Senate. It was not \nenacted. But, certainly, for years he and I had the privilege of \ntrekking this whole area together. That is a wonderful memory I have. I \nwant to pay tribute to his efforts as part of the overall \naccomplishment of this bill.\n  I want to also make particular mention of the staff, of David \nRobertson and Doug Pahl of my staff, who, for years, have been involved \nin this and have done a great job; to Ms. Alexandra Buell of Senator \nWyden's staff, who has been very meshed into the whole common effort \nand has an excellent background in resource management; the Energy \nCommittee staff, Gary Ellsworth, Mark Rey and Tom Williams worked \ntogether as one staff, so to speak, even though they represent both \nsides of the aisle. I am very grateful, always, to each of those staff \nmembers for their real nitty-gritty and their real creative ability.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to say first, I very much share \nSenator Hatfield's view with respect to the yeoman work that has been \ndone by many parties, in terms of bringing this legislation together. I \nam especially pleased he has mentioned Ms. Buell and Mr. Pahl. It \nreflects the bipartisan effort that has gone into moving this \nlegislation forward. I very much want to associate myself with Senator \nHatfield's words of praise for the many staff who have worked on this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to begin by telling Senator Hatfield, on behalf of the \npeople of our State, how much we appreciate the extraordinary efforts \nhe has made in the conservation field specifically. As Oregonians know, \nwhen you think about the history of our State, it will not just be \nconservation that Senator Hatfield has touched. It will be the Oregon \nHealth Sciences Center, where we have built a remarkable medical \ninfrastructure that is going to serve our State into the 21st century. \nPeople are going to talk about the exceptional work that was done in \nthe transportation field, where, again, we have led the Nation in terms \nof looking forward, in terms of making gutsy decisions.\n  We are going to talk about the agriculture, the maritime efforts, \nparticularly in the field of research which, again, gives us a chance \nto get out in front of these huge waves of change that so mark these \nand so many of the issues that are before the Senate.\n  I just want to tell Senator Hatfield, I think it is particularly \nappropriate now, as we move to the last days of this session, that this \nlegislation, which is something of a crowning jewel, moves forward in \nthe Senate. It is a tribute to all of the exceptional work that he has \ndone, now, for 3 decades for the people of our State. I want you to \nknow how much I appreciate all this effort. As you know, I am looking \ninto the possibility of being able to phone you express, when you are \nat the coast in a much-deserved retirement, to have you help on other \nmatters. I am just so pleased that this legislation is moving forward \ntoday, and to be associated with you.\n  Mr. President, very briefly let me comment on some of the provisions, \nthe excellent provisions in this legislation. It is going to protect \nOpal Creek, both the drinking water source for the city of Salem and \none of the crown jewels of our old growth forests. It is a remnant of \nwhat used to be common in the Oregon Cascade Range, but it is now the \nlargest intact low elevation old growth forest that is left, after \nyears of management in the region.\n\n  Opal Creek is simply beloved. People hike and swim, and many go \nsimply to experience the grandeur and solace that tall trees and \nwaterfalls have to offer. Visitation is now at about 15,000 people \nannually, and increases each year.\n\n[[Page S9659]]\n\n  The President's Forest plan recognized the special nature of Opal \nCreek and designated it as a late-successional reserve and tier 1 \nwatershed. Although that designation puts some limits to management in \nthe watershed, it does not ensure permanent protection. Only an act of \nCongress can do that and Senator Hatfield is responding to the great \ninterest among the people of our State in making sure that there will \nbe permanent protection for Opal Creek. We have been trying to protect \nthis treasure for more than 25 years. Last year, Senator Hatfield \nconvened a working group of Oregonians interested in Opal Creek that \nincluded environmentalists, the timber industry, State and local \nofficials, and the Forest Service. This legislation is a product of \nthose efforts. One prominent Oregon environmental group called the \nprovision precedent setting, and the most protective they have seen in \nany Federal legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, Senator Hatfield has noted, contains \nother extremely important provisions for our State. I am especially \npleased Senator Hatfield has included in his bill, additional \nprotection for the Bull Run Watershed. This is so important to water \nusers in our State. Hundreds of thousands of Oregonians depend on that \nwatershed for pure, clean drinking water. And the history of Federal \nprotection for the Bull Run Watershed goes back more than 100 years, to \nPresident Harrison's proclamation reserving the drainage basin of the \nBull Run and Little Sandy Rivers as protected sources of water for the \nCity of Portland.\n  The Bull Run Watershed now serves more than 20 water districts and \nover 735,000 people in our metropolitan area.\n  It is projected by the year 2050, it will be the prime source of \ndrinking water for over 1 million Oregonians.\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, I joined with \nCongresswoman Elizabeth Furse in introducing H.R. 4063 in the 103d \nCongress. This earlier piece of legislation increased substantially \nprotections for the Bull Run and the Little Sandy watersheds. Although \nS. 1662 does scale down the scope of lands covered by new protections, \nI am pleased that this legislation increases protections for the \nportion of the Bull Run watershed that serves as the municipal drinking \nwater source for the city of Portland, while maintaining the existing \nprotections for the remainder of the watershed. The city of Portland \nstrongly supports these added protections for the Bull Run watershed.\n  This legislation includes several other important provisions. It \nwould fund two citizen working groups that have been active in \naddressing a wide array of ecological restoration, economic development \nand stability and drought impact reduction projects in the Klamath and \nDeschutes River basins in our State.\n  I am excited about both of these groups because I firmly believe that \nthe key to solving many of our environmental problems--the key to \nsolving environmental problems--has to come from strong local input. \nOregonians have been successful using this model of strong local \ninvolvement in reforming health care, in reforming welfare, and I am \npleased to see that as a result of Senator Hatfield's legislation, the \nsame effort to encourage local involvement is being used in the \nenvironmental area.\n  I believe that no bill is ever perfect, and we all have things that \nwe might want in an ideal situation. The proposal to create the \nCoquille Tribal Forest has caused concern, has caused anxiety among a \nnumber of our citizens. I commend Senator Hatfield for his hard work in \naddressing many of these concerns, while at the same time remaining \ntrue to his commitment to the Coquille tribe. I believe that the \nprovision in this legislation is improved by reducing greatly the size \nof the transfer. I also believe it has been improved by requiring the \nland to be managed under applicable State and Federal forestry and \nenvironmental protection laws.\n  The bill also would require that these lands be subject to critical \nhabitat designations under the Endangered Species Act and the standards \nand guidelines of the Federal forest plans adjacent or nearby forest \nlands apply now and in the future.\n  Additionally, changes to the bill ensure that the land will remain \nopen to public access for hunting, fishing and recreation, and that the \nprohibition on the export of unprocessed logs from Federal lands are a \nmatter of great importance to our citizens and will continue.\n  With that said, I still remain concerned about the size of the land \nto be transferred from the Bureau of Land Management to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs to be held in trust for the Coquille tribe.\n  Further, I am concerned about adding another layer of complexity to \nan already confusing array of forest and environmental management \nrequirements and a potential lack of clarity with regard to Tribal, \nState and Federal roles in environmental requirements. I am also very \nconcerned about a lack of clear direction with regard to citizen \nappeals. I am very pleased to have a chance to work with Senator \nHatfield on these matters. Senator Hatfield has worked very, very hard \nto try to develop consensus with respect to this issue which is \nextremely controversial, and I intend to work closely with him on this \nmatter in the days ahead.\n  Mr. President, despite my reservation about the Coquille Tribal \nForest, I believe that, on balance, this is a good bill for Oregon. I \nalso want to say that recognition for our former colleague, Mike \nKopetski, is especially appropriate. I recall several years ago when my \ngood friend, Mike Kopetski, first made his pledge to protect Opal \nCreek. Because Mike showed exceptional vision and leadership, the bill \nmade great progress. I join Senator Hatfield in saying that because of \nthe work done by former Congressman Kopetski, it has been possible to \nmove this bill towards a reality.\n  Though this bill is not perfect, through Senator Hatfield's efforts \nand wise judgment, there is a bill now before the Senate that will \nbenefit countless Oregonians for generations to come. It remains one of \nthe most important conservation efforts for the State of Oregon put \nforward in many, many years. I look forward to working closely with our \nsenior Senator to ensure that this bill is signed into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nsubstitute amendment be considered and agreed to, the committee \namendment be agreed to, as amended, the bill be deemed read a third \ntime, and passed as amended. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5150) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1662), as amended was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, on the bill that we have just passed, \nwhich is the Oregon Resources Conservation Act of 1996, I would ask \nunanimous consent to list Senator Wyden, my colleague, as a cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we would like to go ahead and get these \nunanimous-consent agreements done so that the distinguished Democratic \nleader could go to a very important meeting.\n  Senator Daschle, if I could just say once again--I have told you \nprivately--I want to say publicly, I appreciate the cooperation we have \nhad over the last 3 weeks. We could not get it all done at the end, but \nI think we made a lot of good progress. And I appreciate your help \nwherever you could give it. I think we did pretty good overall.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader would allow me to \nrespond, I want to commend him. He has taken on his responsibilities \nunder very difficult circumstances. I cannot imagine a more challenging \nway with which to begin your new role than to take on the \nresponsibilities midcourse.\n  I must say, Mr. President, he has done it in a way that he can be \nproud. It has been a joy to work with him.\n  I think we have gotten more done than most people would have \nexpected. I think, in fact, we surprised a few people. And we will \ncontinue to do our best to represent our caucuses but also to work to \ntry to represent our country. I look forward to working with him for \nmany months and years to come.\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. We do have a number of unanimous-consent agreements that we \nhave worked out. We would like to go through these. And some of them \nare still being worked on as we speak.

I think they came \nvery, very close to getting an overall agreement, and I thought \nyesterday afternoon, actually, it was going to be achieved. They did \nnot quite make it. This is something we will have to work on.\n  I do personally think additional authority should be granted on \nwiretap. I think a lot of the aviation security matters that are \nincluded in this bill are very, very important. I am sorry we could not \nget it worked out. I think more than anything else, time has run out on \nus.\n  However, I have to object to that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I share the view \nexpressed by the majority leader.

Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Christopher Coburn to the Board of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation. \nI believe the nomination of Mr. Coburn to this board would put the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant at a disadvantage in the siting of the \nAtomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation [AVLIS] technology.\n  As a member of the USEC Board, Mr. Coburn will have the \nresponsibility of implementing the privatization of the USEC and \ncharting its future course, including the implementation of the AVLIS \ntechnology.\n  The commercialization of this technology would mean billions of \ndollars of investment as well as ensuring the continued viability of \nthe U.S. enrichment industry. If I may put the issue in stark, but \naccurate terms, the USEC's decision about siting AVLIS is more \nfundamentally a decision about which one of these plants will be able \nto remain competitive and viable into the next century.\n  Earlier this year, President Clinton appointed Mr. Coburn to the \nboard because he believed Mr. Coburn was uniquely qualified following \nhis service as the executive director of the Thomas Edison Program and \nas the science and technology advisor to the Governor of Ohio. It has \ncome to my attention that while serving as the executive director of \nthe Thomas Edison Project, Mr. Coburn developed a proposal to locate \nthe AVLIS technology in Portsmouth, OH.\n  Mr. President, the placement of Mr. Coburn on the USEC's board at \nthis time would cause serious doubts about the objectivity and fairness \nof the USEC as it begins to assess which facility should obtain the \nAVLIS technology. The stakes concerning this decision are so monumental \nthat we cannot allow any inference of bias to infect the process by \nwhich that decision is made.\n  In an effort to protect the interests of the workers employed at the \nPaducah plant and the economy of western Kentucky I asked the President \nto withdraw the nomination of the Mr. Corburn. Since the President has \nignored my concerns I have tried to block the confirmation of Mr. \nCoburn.\n  Unfortunately, I realize the votes are not in my favor. Nonetheless, \nI will\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\ncontinue to follow the actions of the Board and Mr. Coburn to ensure \nthat the best interests of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant are \nprotected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9660-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 104-28 AND TREATY \n                          DOCUMENT NO. 104-29\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the injunction of \nsecrecy be removed from two treaties: A Protocol Amending the 1916 \nConvention for the Protection of Migratory Birds (Treaty Document No. \n104-28); and a United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in \nCountries Experiencing Drought, Particularly in Africa, with Annexes \n(Treaty Document No. 104-29); transmitted to the Senate by the \nPresident today; and ask that the treaties be considered as having been \nread the first time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed and \nthat the President's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Protocol between the United \nStates and Canada Amending the 1916 Convention for the Protection of \nMigratory Birds in Canada and the United States, with a related \nexchange of notes, signed at Washington on December 14, 1995.\n  The Protocol, which is discussed in more detail in the accompanying \nreport of the Secretary of State, represents a considerable achievement \nfor the United States in conserving migratory birds and balancing the \ninterests of conservationists, sports hunters, and indigenous people. \nIf ratified and properly implemented, the Protocol should further \nenhance the management and protection of this important resource for \nthe benefit of all users.\n  The Protocol would replace a protocol with a similar purpose, which \nwas signed January 30, 1979, (Executive W, 96th Cong., 2nd Sess. \n(1980)), and which I, therefore, desire to withdraw from the Senate.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol, with exchange of notes, and give its advice and consent \nto ratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, August 2, 1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification \nin Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, \nParticularly in Africa, with Annexes, adopted at Paris, June 17, 1994, \nand signed by the United States on October 14, 1994. The report of the \nDepartment of State is also enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The purpose of the Convention is to combat desertification and \nmitigate the effects of drought on arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid \nlands through effective action at all levels. In particular, the \nConvention addresses the fundamental causes of famine and food \ninsecurity in Africa, by stimulating more effective partnership between \ngovernments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and aid \ndonors, and by encouraging the dissemination of information derived \nfrom new technology (e.g., early warning of impending drought) to \nfarmers.\n  The United States has strongly supported the Convention's innovative \napproach to combatting dryland degradation. I believe it will help \nAfricans and others to make better use of fragile resources without \nrequiring increased development assistance. Ratification by the United \nStates would promote effective implementation of the Convention and is \nlikely to encourage similar action by other countries whose \nparticipation would also promote effective implementation.\n  United States obligations under the Convention would be met under \nexisting law and ongoing assistance programs.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Convention and its Annexes, with the declaration described in the \naccompanying report of the Secretary of State, and give its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, at the close of business today, the \nSenate will lose a valued and important part of the Democratic floor \nstaff. Today, Kelly Riordan leaves the Senate to pursue a law degree at \nthe University of Virginia in Charlottesville.\n  Kelly graduated from Northwestern University and came to the Senate \nin August of 1989 to work in the mail room for the former Senate \nmajority leader, George Mitchell. She spent much of the following 4 \nyears in Senator Mitchell's office working as a legislative \ncorrespondent before she was chosen to join the Democratic floor staff \nin 1993.\n  Kelly has never forgotten where she comes from.

Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for Mrs. Kassebaum, \n     for herself, Mr. Pressler, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. \n     Moynihan, Mr. Simpson and Mrs. Frahm, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5155.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5155) was agreed to.\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. \n3269, a bill to make technical corrections in the law that governs the \nImpact Aid Program. This bill represents the culmination of months of \nhard work. I would like to thank the Chair of the Labor and Human \nResources Committee, Senator Kassebaum for her diligent work in \nbringing this extremely important bill to the floor. Her efforts helped \nto ensure that federally impacted schools will get the financial \nassistance they deserve and need.\n  Impact Aid is an important program for many schools. Impact Aid is a \nFederal responsibility. The program reimburses school districts that \nlost tax base due to a Federal presence, such as a military base or \nIndian reservation. This program provides funds for day-to-day school \noperations, such as buying books and paying teachers. These are not \nspecial funds for extra projects. This is a program based on the basic \nprinciple of fairness. We should fund the basics of education before we \nspend money on extra programs.\n  The expeditious passage of this bill today would ensure that many \nFederally impacted schools will have the funds needed to keep their \ndoors open, literally, this fall. School districts depend on Impact Aid \nfor basic operating expenses. This bill would ensure that payments are \nmade in a timely manner.\n  I am particularly concerned about Section 2 of the Impact Aid program \nas\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\nit pertains to two school districts in South Dakota. Specifically, \nwithout passage of this critical bill, two South Dakota schools, \nBonesteel-Fairfax and Wagner, could stand to lose together almost $1 \nmillion. That must not be allowed to happen. Essentially, the bill \nbefore us would allow these school districts to claim eligibility under \nSection 8003. The Bonesteel-Fairfax and Wagner districts were in fact \neligible for Impact Aid funds, but were unaware of their eligibility \nbecause of a change in the Federal statute. Unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Education could not allow these districts to amend their \napplications. Consequently, they were denied funds that they deserved \ndue to the simple error of not checking the proper eligibility box. \nThis bill would correct this situation and provide these districts the \nopportunity to reapply for Impact Aid funds. As always, I will fight to \nsee that both these schools and all other federally impacted schools in \nSouth Dakota get the funding they need under the Impact Aid program. \nThis is the fair thing to do. It was not the intention of Congress to \ndeny schools funds due to administrative errors or technical \noversights. Quite simply, this is a fairness issue.\n  The bill before us would not create new criteria to implement the \nintent of Congress. These technical corrections permit the Department \nof Education to administer the Impact Aid program consistent with the \nintent of Congress. The technical amendments provide recourse for the \nschools to receive funds to which they are entitled under the intent of \nthe law.\n  I am pleased that we are taking action on this legislation. The \nschools that would benefit from this bill need and deserve the \nassistance. The Federal Government has placed these schools in a very \ndifficult position, through no fault of their own. That's why impact \naid must remain a top Federal responsibility.\n  Unfortunately, getting this bill through has not been easy, in part \nbecause the current administration does not have its priorities \nstraight. For the fourth consecutive year, the Clinton administration's \nbudget called for the Federal Government to lessen its commitment to \nimpact aid. For the next year, the Clinton administration requested \nonly $617 million for impact aid. It recommended the elimination of \npayments for Federal lands. This means 23 South Dakota school districts \nwould not have been eligible for Federal funds. That is wrong. How can \nPresident Clinton claim he is the education President when his budgets \nwould deny the most basic needs to schools in South Dakota? Federally \nimpacted districts and the children they serve cannot withstand further \nreductions in the program.\n  It is my understanding that the President will not sign this \nlegislation, but allow it to become law. This is yet another indication \nof the administration's hostility to the Impact Aid Program. Obtaining \nthe appropriate level of funding is a struggle every year. There will \nbe more battles over impact aid funding. I'm ready. I will continue to \nfight for our Nation's children and federally impacted school \ndistricts. This is my commitment to those schools and the familes they \nserve.\n  Again, I thank the chair of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nits ranking member and their counterparts in the House for their good \nwork to get this bill through Congress and to the President. This bill \nenjoys widespread, bipartisan support. With the support of my \ncolleagues, we can fulfill our legislative responsibility to federally \nimpacted school districts and pass this impact aid technical \ncorrections.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be placed at \nthe appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3269) was deemed read the third time and passed, as \namended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9663-4", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9664-S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BANKRUPTCY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Financial Management \n     Improvement Act of 1996''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Much effort has been devoted to strengthening Federal \n     internal accounting controls in the past. Although progress \n     has been made in recent years, Federal accounting standards \n     have not been uniformly implemented in financial management \n     systems for agencies.\n       (2) Federal financial management continues to be seriously \n     deficient, and Federal financial management and fiscal \n     practices have failed to--\n       (A) identify costs fully;\n       (B) reflect the total liabilities of congressional actions; \n     and\n       (C) accurately report the financial condition of the \n     Federal Government.\n       (3) Current Federal accounting practices do not accurately \n     report financial results of the Federal Government or the \n     full costs of programs and activities. The continued use of \n     these practices undermines the Government's ability to \n     provide credible and reliable financial data and encourages \n     already widespread Government waste, and will not assist in \n     achieving a balanced budget.\n       (4) Waste and inefficiency in the Federal Government \n     undermine the confidence of the American people in the \n     Government and reduce the Federal Government's ability to \n     address vital public needs adequately.\n       (5) To rebuild the accountability and credibility of the \n     Federal Government, and restore public confidence in the \n     Federal Government, agencies must incorporate accounting \n     standards and reporting objectives established for the \n     Federal Government into their financial management systems so \n     that all the assets and liabilities, revenues, and \n     expenditures or expenses, and the full costs of programs and \n     activities of the Federal Government can be consistently and \n     accurately recorded, monitored, and uniformly reported \n     throughout the Federal Government.\n       (6) Since its establishment in October 1990, the Federal \n     Accounting Standards Advisory Board (hereinafter referred to \n     as the ``FASAB'') has made substantial progress toward \n     developing and recommending a comprehensive set of accounting \n     concepts and standards for the Federal Government. When the \n     accounting concepts and standards developed by FASAB are \n     incorporated into Federal financial management systems, \n     agencies will be able to provide cost and financial \n     information that will assist the Congress and financial \n     managers to evaluate the cost and performance of Federal \n     programs and activities, and will therefore provide important \n     information that has been lacking, but is needed for improved \n     decisionmaking by financial managers and the Congress.\n       (7) The development of financial management systems with \n     the capacity to support these standards and concepts will, \n     over the long term, improve Federal financial management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) provide for consistency of accounting by an agency from \n     one fiscal year to the next, and uniform accounting standards \n     throughout the Federal Government;\n       (2) require Federal financial management systems to support \n     full disclosure of Federal financial data, including the full \n     costs of Federal programs and activities, to the citizens, \n     the Congress, the President, and agency management, so that \n     programs and activities can be considered based on their full \n     costs and merits;\n       (3) increase the accountability and credibility of Federal \n     financial management;\n       (4) improve performance, productivity and efficiency of \n     Federal Government financial management;\n       (5) establish financial management systems to support \n     controlling the cost of Federal Government;\n       (6) build upon and complement the Chief Financial Officers \n     Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-576; 104 Stat. 2838), the \n     Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (Public Law \n     103-62; 107 Stat. 285), and the Government Management Reform \n     Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-356; 108 Stat. 3410); and\n       (7) increase the capability of agencies to monitor \n     execution of the budget by more readily permitting reports \n     that compare spending of resources to results of activities.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT \n                   IMPROVEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each agency shall implement and maintain \n     financial management systems that comply with Federal \n     financial management systems requirements, applicable Federal \n     accounting standards, and the United States Government \n     Standard General Ledger at the transaction level.\n       (b) Priority.--Each agency shall give priority in funding \n     and provide sufficient resources to implement this Act.\n       (c) Audit Compliance Finding.--\n       (1) In general.--Each audit required by section 3521(e) of \n     title 31, United States Code, shall report whether the agency \n     financial management systems comply with the requirements of \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Content of reports.--When the person performing the \n     audit required by section 3521(e) of title 31, United States \n     Code, reports that the agency financial management systems do \n     not comply with the requirements of subsection (a), the \n     person performing the audit shall include in the report on \n     the audit--\n       (A) the name and position of any officer or employee \n     responsible for the financial management systems that have \n     been found not to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a);\n       (B) all facts pertaining to the failure to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (a), including--\n       (i) the nature and extent of the noncompliance;\n       (ii) the primary reason or cause of the noncompliance;\n       (iii) any official responsible for the noncompliance; and\n       (iv) any relevant comments from any responsible officer or \n     employee; and\n       (C) a statement with respect to the recommended remedial \n     actions and the timeframes to implement such actions.\n       (d) Compliance Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than the date described under \n     paragraph (2), the Director, acting through the Controller of \n     the Office of Federal Financial Management, shall determine \n     whether the financial management systems of an agency comply \n     with the requirements of subsection (a).

Such authority shall be used only for priority \n     financial management system improvements as identified by the \n     head of the agency, with the concurrence of the Director, and \n     in no case for an item for which Congress has denied funds. \n     The head of the agency shall notify Congress 30 days before \n     such a transfer is made pursuant to such authority.\n       (4) Report if noncompliance within time period.--If an \n     agency fails to bring its financial management systems into \n     compliance within the time period specified under paragraph \n     (2), the Director shall submit a report of such failure to \n     the Committees on Governmental Affairs and Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the Committees on Government Reform and \n     Oversight and Appropriations of the House of Representatives. \n     The report shall include--\n       (A) the name and position of any officer or employee \n     responsible for the financial management systems that have \n     been found not to comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a);\n       (B) the facts pertaining to the failure to comply with the \n     requirements of subsection (a), including the nature and \n     extent of the noncompliance, the primary reason or cause for \n     the failure to comply, and any extenuating circumstances;\n       (C) a statement of the remedial actions needed; and\n       (D) a statement of any administrative action to be taken \n     with respect to any responsible officer or employee.\n       (f) Personal Responsibility.--Any financial officer or \n     program manager who knowingly and willfully commits, permits, \n     or authorizes material deviation from the requirements of \n     subsection (a) may be subject to administrative disciplinary \n     action, suspension from duty, or removal from office.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on October 1, 1996.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, several years ago, in an effort to identify \nexcess spending in the federal budget, I inquired as to overhead costs \nin federal programs. I was advised that the federal accounting system \nmakes it impossible to identify overhead expenses for most federal \noperations. The Federal Government, it turned out, has over two hundred \nseparate primary accounting systems, making it impossible to compare \nsomething as basic as overhead costs.\n  Worse, many of these systems are shamefully inadequate even on their \nown terms. A 1995 General Accounting Office report reveals that the \nPentagon made more than $400 billion in adjustments to correct errors \nin defense reporting data for fiscal years 1991 to 1993--and the \nresulting statements still were not reliable. The Pentagon paid vendors \n$29 billion that could not be matched with supporting documents to \ndetermine if these payments were proper. The Pentagon made an estimated \n$3 million in fraudulent payments to a former Navy supply officer for \nmore than 100 false invoice claims, and approximately $8 million in \nArmy payroll payments were made to unauthorized persons, including six \n``ghost'' soldiers and 76 deserters.\n  The Internal Revenue Service offers another disturbing example of \npoor financial management and its consequences. The General Accounting \nOffice testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee on June 6, \n1996 that despite years of criticism, ``fundamental, persistent \nproblems remain uncorrected'' at the IRS. For example, the IRS cannot \nsubstantiate the amounts reported for specific types of taxes \ncollected, such as social security taxes, income taxes, and excise \ntaxes. The IRS cannot even verify a significant portion of its own \nnonpayroll operating expenses, which total $3 billion. One can \nhardly resist observing that this is the agency that demands precision \nfrom every taxpayer in America.\n\n  The General Accounting Office also reports that the Medicare program \nis undermined by flawed payment policies, weak billing controls and \ninconsistent program management. Instances of fraud and abuse abound in \nthe $190 billion program. In a January 1996 report, GAO detailed a long \nlist of frauds. They include a $4.3 million overpayment to a company \nproviding heart monitoring services as well as 4,000 fraudulent claims \nby a Medicare supplier totaling approximately $1.5 million. GAO \ndiscovered that frauds like these are perpetrated on a vast scale; one \nrecently uncovered was operating across 20 states. The GAO report\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\nlocates the root of the problem in financial management: ``[O]ur work \nshows that outlandish charges or very large reimbursements routinely \nescape the controls and typically go unquestioned.'' Even when \nfraudulent billing is discovered, Medicare usually has paid out the \nmoney and rarely acts effectively to recover it.\n  Together the Department of Defense, the IRS, and the Medicare Program \nare just a small part of a government so massive and complex that it \ncontrols and directs cash resources of almost $2 trillion per year, \nissuing 900 million checks and maintaining a payroll and benefits \nsystem for over 5 million government employees. Clearly it is \nimperative that the government use a uniform and widely accepted set of \naccounting standards across the hundreds of agencies and departments \nthat make up this government.\n  Today we are taking a great step toward putting Federal financial \nmanagement in order. The Federal Financial Management Improvement Act \nof 1996 requires that all Federal agencies implement and maintain \nuniform accounting standards. The result will be more accurate and \nreliable information for program managers and leaders in Congress, \nmeaning better decisions will be made: tax dollars will be put to \nbetter use, and a measure of confidence in the government will be \nrestored. While this is not the kind of legislation that makes \nheadlines, it is of great significance and I am proud that the Senate \nhas passed it. I am very grateful to Senator Stevens for steering the \nbill through his Committee.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, over the last 6 years, we have enacted \nseveral laws to improve Federal agency financial management. The Chief \nFinancial Officers Act of 1990 put into place the first requirements \nfor agencies to prepare annual audited financial statements. These \nrequirements were strengthened by the Government Management Reform Act \nof 1994, and now all the major agencies are covered by the CFO Act \nrequirements.\n  In oversight hearings conducted by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, both when I was Chair and now as Ranking Minority Member, we \nhave seen how these laws are making significant improvements in agency \nfinancial management. Unfortunately, we also have seen that many \nagencies still have a ways to go to make the necessary reforms.\n  The legislation before us today, the ``Federal Financial Management \nImprovement Act'' (S. 1130), which I co-sponsored, helps agencies go \nthose final miles to put into place necessary financial management \nsystems and provide real accountability for the expenditure of public \nfunds.\n  The legislation addresses the financial management systems that are \nneeded to provide financial accountability. Annual financial statements \nwill not do it alone, if agencies do not have the systems or personnel \nin place to account for their financial operations. Accordingly, the \nbill requires agencies to comply with applicable accounting standards \nand systems requirements.\n  The legislation further requires auditors to identify agencies with \ndeficient financial management systems. This puts added teeth in the \nCFO Act financial statement process, and will lead to practical \nremediation steps, to be overseen by OMB. I am concerned, however, that \nthe legislation's requirements for auditors to identify officials \nresponsible for agency financial systems may have the untoward \nconsequence of intimidating our civil servants.\n  If this requirement is used to identify specific decisions that have \nfrustrated the development of needed financial management reforms, it \nwill be a success. It will also be a success if it creates incentives \nfor improved training for financial management personnel. If, however, \nit is used to unfairly blame managers who are constrained by resource \nor policy decisions made above them, whether in the agency or by \nCongress, then we will have to revisit this requirement. At this point, \nhowever, I believe that on balance the time has come to demand more \naccountability from our agencies and agency officials for their \nfinancial management performance.\n  I commend Senator Brown for introducing this bill and for working \nwith us in Committee to improve it. I believe the ``Federal Financial \nManagement Improvement Act'' is important legislation and will work to \nimprove agency financial management. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be deemed read the third \ntime, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatement relating to this bill appear at the appropriate place in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1130), as amended, was deemed read the third time and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9666-1", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9668-S9670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION AMENDMENT ACT OF 1996\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, today the Senate is passing an important \npiece of legislation, S. 1873, the National Environmental Education Act \namendments. I introduced this bill on June 13 along with my colleagues, \nSenators Chafee, Lieberman, Faircloth, Kempthorne, Moynihan, Reid, and \nLugar. Since that date nine more senators have joined me in this \nbipartisan show of support for this legislation.\n  This bill will reauthorize the educational efforts at the National \nEnvironmental Education and Training Foundation and the EPA's Office of \nEnvironmental Education. These programs support environmental education \nat the local level. They provide grant money and seed money to \nencourage local primary and secondary schools and universities to \neducate children on environmental issues.\n  With the importance of the environment and the continuing debate on \nhow best to protect it, it is vital to educate our children so that \nthey truly understand how the environment functions.\n  Over the last few years environmental education has been criticized \nfor being one-sided and heavy-handed. People have accused environmental \nadvocates of trying to brainwash children and of pushing an \nenvironmental agenda that is not supported by the facts or by science. \nThey also accuse the Federal Government of setting one curriculum \nstandard and forcing all schools to subscribe to their views. This is \nnot how these two environmental education programs have worked, and I \nhave taken specific steps to ensure that they never work this way.\n  The programs that this act reauthorizes have targeted the majority of \ntheir grants at the local level, allowing the teachers in our community \nschools to design their environmental programs to teach our children, \nand this is where the decisions should be made. In addition, the grants \nhave not been used for advocacy or to lobby the Government, as other \ngrant programs have been accused of doing.\n  This legislation accomplishes two important functions. First, it \ncleans up the current law to make the programs run more efficiently. \nAnd second, it places two very important safeguards in the program to \nensure its integrity in the future.\n  I have placed in this bill language to ensure that the EPA programs \nare balanced and scientifically sound. It is important that \nenvironmental education is presented in an unbiased and balanced \nmanner. The personal values and prejudices of the educators should not \nbe instilled in our children. Instead we must teach them to think for \nthemselves after they have been presented with all of the facts and \ninformation. Environmental ideas must be grounded in sound science and \nnot emotional bias. While these programs have not been guilty of this \nin the past, this is an important safeguard to protect the future of \nenvironmental education.\n  Second, I have included language which prohibits any of the funds to \nbe used for lobbying efforts. While these programs have not used the \ngrant process to lobby the Government, there are other programs which \nhave been accused of this and this language will ensure that this \nprogram never becomes a vehicle to lobby Congress or the Executive \nbranch.\n  This bill also makes a number of housekeeping changes to the programs \nwhich are supported by both the EPA and the Education Foundation which \nwill both streamline the programs and make them more efficient.\n  For those people who remain concerned about the Federal role in \nenvironmental education let me assure everyone that I will be \npersonally monitoring these programs. If there are abuses or \nquestionable grants or programs I will be the first to call for an \ninvestigation or to invoke the oversight functions of Congress. \nEducating our children is a serious matter and should not be abused by \nanyone. It is my intent and goal that these programs provide objective \nmaterial in a balanced and scientifically sound manner that does not \ninstill any particular viewpoint in our Nation's youths. We need to \nteach our children the facts and let them reach their own conclusions, \nand I believe this bill accomplishes this goal.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this bill and I hope the House \ncan act\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n\nquickly and this legislation can be signed into law.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join Senator Inhofe in urging the Senate \nto pass S. 1873, the National Environmental Education Act Amendments of \n1996. I commend Senator Inhofe for his leadership on this bill. Mr. \nInhofe and other members of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee have crafted a reauthorization of the National Environmental \nEducation Act of 1990. It is a bipartisan bill sponsored by 11 members \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, including myself and \nSenators Inhofe, Baucus, Lieberman, Faircloth, Kempthorne, Moynihan, \nReid, Lautenberg, Smith, and Graham.\n  S. 1873 extends the authorization for programs authorized by the \nNational Environmental Education Act until 2007. The bill also includes \na number of changes to make programs authorized under the act operate \nmore effectively and efficiently.\n  The goal of the National Environmental Education Act is to increase \npublic understanding of the environment and to advance and develop \nenvironmental education and training.\n  The act has been successful in supporting environmental education \nthrough grants and training programs aimed at schools, nature centers, \nmuseums, and other educational organizations. The act has benefited \nthousands of teachers and millions of students--children and adults.\n  Educational programs supported through this act increase the public's \nawareness and knowledge about environmental issues, and provide them \nwith the skills needed to make informed decisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important \nenvironmental education legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate has \napproved S. 1735, the United States Tourism Organization Act, \nlegislation I introduced on May 8, 1996. This bill is aimed at \npromoting the United States as a tourist destination in the \nincreasingly competitive world tourism market. Passage of this \nbipartisan measure would help to ensure the United States\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\nremains a leader in this growing industry. In particular, I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Nevada, Senator Richard Bryan, and my good \nfriend from Virgina, Senator John Warner, who joined me in sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, the travel and tourism industry is the second most \nproductive in the world. In the United States, the tourism industry \nemploys more than 6.3 million people--making it the second largest \nemployer in the country.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is no longer the world's No. 1 \ntourist destination. As other nations have recognized the economic \npotential of tourism, the United States has allowed itself to fall \nbehind. We must reverse this trend.\n  As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation and Co-chair of the Senate Tourism Caucus, I am \ncommitted to increasing tourism--both in my home State of South Dakota \nand across the nation. S. 1735 is designed to keep the industry vibrant \nand growing. Most significantly, the legislation would develop a \npublic-private partnership, charged with research, advertising, and \nmarketing our country as a tourism destination.\n  This bill also would establish a U.S. Tourism Organization--a non-\nprofit, private group to promote the United States both in our country \nand abroad. This is not an expensive new program funded by the hard-\nearned dollars of America's taxpayers. Instead, the organization would \nbe funded primarily by members of the tourism industry.\n  One source of revenue made possible by this bill is from the sale of \nU.S. tourism logos, trademarks or emblems, similar to the five \nadjoining rings used with great financial success by the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee. In addition, American business could pay an annual fee to \nbecome an official member of the U.S. Tourism Organization and use the \nlogo for advertising and business promotion. Not only would this boost \nindividual businesses, it also would advance the tourism industry as a \nwhole.\n  Significantly, under this legislation, the structure of the tourism \norganization would ensure that no member business--big or small--would \nbe left behind. A National Tourism Board would represent all aspects of \nthe tourism industry--from transportation to accommodations, from \ndining and entertainment to tour guides. This board would put South \nDakota's small-business owners on an equal footing with New York City's \nlarger businesses as they compete for potential visitors.\n  This provision would be particularly helpful to small-business owners \nin South Dakota like Al Johnson who runs the Palmer Gulch Resort near \nHill City, or for Alfred Mueller, owner of Al's Oasis in Chamberlain--\nthe famous home of the buffalo burger.\n  U.S. tourism needs to aim for high-tech promotion. Today's technology \nhas enormous potential to shape positively and promote the tourism \nindustry. Tomorrow's technology will be even more useful. In this area, \nthe travel and tourism industry will benefit significantly from \nlegislation I sponsored earlier in this Congress, the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996. That new law will unleash even more \nadvanced communications technologies and services. South Dakotans, like \nthe Husteads, owners of the famous Wall Drug, in Wall, SD, already are \ntaking advantage of such technologies as the World Wide Web. These \nevolving technologies can transmit information on U.S. tourism \ndestinations to all corners of the globe.\n  Austrians could learn about the world-class Shrine to Music Museum in \nVermillion. Kenyan safari hunters would be able to find out when \nhunting season is in Redfield, SD--the pheasant capital of the world. \nDog-sledders in the Yukon may want to try out the snowmobile trails of \nthe Black Hills National Forest.\n  The use of the latest developments in communications technology could \npromote places like the city of Deadwood--one of the fastest growing \ntourist destinations in South Dakota. Across the globe, people could \nlearn that Deadwood's main street is lined with old-fashioned saloons \nand gaming halls--inspiring memories of the 1890's gold rush. This, in \nturn, might inspire them to visit Saloon No. 10 where Wild Bill Hickock \nwas shot--making famous his poker hand of aces and eights, the \n``Deadman's Hand.''\n\n  S. 1735 represents just one more step in a series of actions I've \ntaken to boost tourism in South Dakota and the Nation. For instance, \nearlier this year, I wrote to foreign Ambassadors and other heads of \nmissions in the United States urging them to promote the virtues of \nSouth Dakota as a prime U.S. tourist attraction. I gave them copies of \nthe South Dakota vacation guide to pass along to appropriate officials \nin their embassies and home governments who are responsible for \ndisseminating tourism information. Not long after receiving my letter, \nthe Ambassador from Austria visited our State. Foreign visitors are our \nfastest growing tourist population. We welcome them.\n  The U.S. Tourism Organization would partner the Federal Government \nwith the men and women who are the tourism industry. This type of \npublic-private partnership was discussed by South Dakotans like Vince \nCoyle, of Deadwood, and Julie Jensen, of Rapid City, when they attended \nthe White House conference on tourism last year. The legislation we are \nconsidering today was drafted using the recommendations of the White \nHouse conference. Working together, we can make tourism the new key to \nthis country's economic success.\n  This is our opportunity to forge ahead. There is no reason the U.S. \ntravel and tourism should be relegated to the back seat any longer. I \nam pleased that the Senate has given this legislation its unanimous \nsupport. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to \nsend this bill to the President before the end of the 104th Congress. \nThe time is now. We must once again make the United States the top \ntourist destination in the world.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered read and agreed to, the bill be deemed read the \nthird time, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The amendment (No. 5156) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1735) was deemed read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Tourism \n     Organization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the travel and tourism industry is the second largest \n     retail or service industry in the United States, and travel \n     and tourism services ranked as the largest United States \n     export in 1995, generating an $18.6 billion trade surplus for \n     the United States;\n       (2) domestic and international travel and tourism \n     expenditures totaled $433 billion in 1995, $415 billion spent \n     directly within the United States and an additional $18 \n     billion spent by international travelers on United States \n     flag carriers traveling to the United States;\n       (3) direct travel and tourism receipts make up 6 percent of \n     the United States gross domestic product;\n       (4) in 1994 the travel and tourism industry was the \n     nation's second largest employer, directly responsible for \n     6.3 million jobs and indirectly responsible for another 8 \n     million jobs;\n       (5) employment in major sectors of the travel industry is \n     expected to increase 35 percent by the year 2005;\n       (6) 99.7 percent of travel businesses are defined by the \n     Federal Government as small businesses; and\n       (7) the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in \n     1995 brought together 1,700 travel and tourism industry \n     executives from across the nation and called for the \n     establishment, by federal charter, of a new national tourism \n     organization to promote international tourism to all parts of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 500, which is House bill H.R. \n1975.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1975) to improve the management of royalties \n     from Federal and Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leases, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to urge my Senate colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Fairness and \nSimplification Act, also known as the ``royalty fairness'' bill, which \npassed the House of Representatives on July 16, 1996. H.R. 1975 is \nidentical in every respect to S. 1014, reported to the Senate by the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources on May 1 by a unanimous voice \nvote, with one exception: It makes a technical amendment in the \neffective date section that was not made in S. 1014. The technical \namendment was included at the urging of the administration and, as a \nresult, the Clinton administration strongly supports H.R. 1975. The \nbill also is supported by the governors of fourteen States.\n  This is historic legislation, Mr. President. It is the only \nlegislative initiative taken in the last 14 years to cost effectively \nincrease the Nation's third largest source of revenue--mineral \nroyalties from Federal lands, more specifically, oil and gas royalties. \nThis legislation would establish a comprehensive statutory plan to \nincrease the collection of royalty receipts due the United States. \nThose receipts will help reduce our budget deficit. Without this \nlegislation, an ineffective and costly royalty collection system will \ncontinue, perpetuating long delays and uncollected royalties.\n  Let me make clear, Mr. President: This legislation does not apply to \nIndian lands. It applies only to royalties from oil and gas production \non Federal lands.\n  Let me also make absolutely clear that this bill does not--repeat, \ndoes not--provide royalty relief or lower royalty rates for oil and gas \nproducers who operate on Federal onshore lands or the Outer Continental \nShelf. H.R. 1975 is about royalty collection, not royalty rates. This \nbill is about improving government efficiency, not about increasing \ngovernment bureaucracy. And this bill is about increasing\n\n[[Page S9676]]\n\nrevenues to the Federal Treasury, not about giving money away.\n  This legislation is historic for another reason, Mr. President: It \nwould empower States to perform oil and gas royalty management \nfunctions, such as auditing and collecting, that are essential to \nbringing additional receipts to the Treasury and the States within a 7-\nyear limitation period established by this legislation. By expanding \nthe States' role in performing Federal oil and gas royalty management \nand collection functions consistent with Federal law and regulation, \nStates will be given a great economic incentive that will benefit the \nFederal Treasury. The more aggressive States are in performing \ndelegated functions, the greater their share of net receipts under the \nMineral Leasing Act. That act requires 50 percent of all royalties from \nFederal onshore oil and gas production to be shared with the States \nfrom which that production comes.\n  H.R. 1975 establishes a framework for the federal oil and gas royalty \ncollection program that will accelerate the collection of offsetting \nreceipts to the Treasury by $80 million in the 1997-2002 period, half \nof which moneys would be shared with the States. These receipts result \nprimarily from: (1) requiring the Secretary of the Interior and \ndelegated States to timely collect all claims within 7 years rather \nthan allow the claims to become stale and uncollectible; (2) requiring \nearly resolution and collection of disputed claims before their value \ndiminishes; (3) requiring federal and State resources to be used in a \nmanner that maximizes receipts through more aggressive collection \nactivities; and (4) increasing production on federal lands by creating \neconomic and regulatory incentives. Without the statutory framework of \nthis legislation, the Nation's third largest revenue source (the \nInterior Department's Minerals Management Service is the third largest \nsource of revenue behind the IRS and Customs Service) will continue to \nbe subject to greatly delayed collections and the risk of reduced \nreceipts due to non-collection over time.\n  To achieve the goal of maximizing collections through more timely and \naggressive collection efforts, this legislation would do the following \nspecific things. It would require the Secretary, delegated States, and \nlessees to take action respecting a royalty obligation within seven \nyears from the date that obligation became due. The provisions require \nthat judicial proceedings or demands (e.g., orders to pay) be commenced \nor issued within seven years of the date when the obligation became due \nor be barred. Lessees would be required to maintain their records \nduring the 7-year period in order to verify production volumes.\n  H.R. 1975 would expedite the administrative appeals process at the \nInterior Department by establishing a 33-month limitation on appeals. \nPresently, over $450 million in disputed claims languish in a \nbureaucratic appeals process and continue to lose value. By speeding up \nthe appeals process, the Secretary would increase the value of those \nobligations and collections to the Treasury.\n  The legislation also would level the playing field for royalty payors \nby authorizing the payment of interest on overpayments. Present law \nrequires lessees to pay interest on late payments and underpayments as \na disincentive for being tardy or underpaying royalties, but does not \ncompensate lessees who overpay royalties and who lose the time value of \nthat money through some legitimate error.\n  And finally, Mr. President, the legislation would authorize the \nSecretary to allow prepayment of royalties and to provide other \nregulatory relief for ``marginal properties,'' and require that \nadjustments or requests for refunds for underpayments or overpayments \nbe pursued within a 6-year window coinciding with the 7-year limitation \nperiod.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague, Senator Nickles, for \nintroducing the Senate companion to H.R. 1975, S. 1014, last June. \nSenator Domenici and I joined Senator Nickles as sponsors of this \nhistoric bill, and Senator Thomas has been deeply involved as well. I \nwant to thank Senators Nickles, Domenici, and Thomas for their efforts \nin regard to the royalty fairness legislation.\n  Mr. President, the fact that S. 1014 was reported from the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources on May 1 by a unanimous voice vote and \nsubsequently drew the support of the Clinton administration, and the \nfact that the House swiftly passed H.R. 1975, speaks to the merits of \nthis legislation, the lengths to which we have gone to resolve \ndifferences with the administration over the language of the bill, and \nthe fact that this legislation is not partisan legislation.\n  This is good-government legislation, and no mater what criticism we \nmay hear of it, it will be good for the taxpayers, good for the States, \nand good for the energy producing sector of our economy.\n  Importantly, Mr. President, H.R. 1975 will empower States to join in \npartnership with the Federal Government in assuming certain royalty \nmanagement functions pursuant to a delegation of authority. By \nproviding States with a role in performing oil and gas royalty \nmanagement functions, we will be giving States the economic incentive \nto perform those functions in a more cost effective manner. Aggressive \npursuit of royalty obligations by States will be rewarded by higher net \nreceipts shares for the States, because 50 percent of oil and gas \nreceipts are shared with the States, and it will result in higher \nreceipts to the federal treasury.\n  This is a fiscal ``win-win'' no matter how you view it. This is good \npublic policy. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nFederal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated June 6, \n1996, from the Department of the Interior; a statement of \nadministration policy, dated July 16, 1996, from OMB; a letter dated \nMay 30, 1996, from Leon Panetta; and a DOE news release dated July 16, \n1996, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the views of the \n     Department of the Interior on S. 1014, the ``Federal Oil and \n     Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996.'' As you \n     are aware, we have conducted extensive discussions with the \n     staff of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in \n     an effort to address concerns and resolve differences raised \n     by both parties.\n       S. 1014, as marked up and passed by the full Committee on \n     May 1, incorporated negotiated language that is acceptable to \n     the Department. After marking up the bill, the Committee \n     staff and the Minerals Management Service identified a \n     technical error, and the Committee has developed an amendment \n     for Senate floor consideration. The amendment would correct \n     an error in section 11, so that the effective date exception \n     will apply to the appeals provision in section 115(h) and not \n     to the records retention provision in section 115(f). The \n     Department supports S. 1014 as reported out of the Committee, \n     with the adoption of the pending technical amendment.\n       In general, S. 1014 would amend the Federal Oil and Gas \n     Royalty Management Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \n     Act, and the Mineral Leasing Act. The amendments change the \n     requirements that govern how the Secretary of the Interior \n     manages royalty payments from Federal oil and gas leases \n     onshore and on the OCS. The bill would limit the persons that \n     can be held liable for royalty payments; establish a 7-year \n     statute of limitations and detail the circumstances under \n     which the statute of limitations can be tolled; establish \n     time limits for administrative appeals decisions; require the \n     Secretary to pay interest on all overpayments; process OCS \n     refunds and credits in the same manner as onshore leases; \n     undertake measures to encourage efficiency and reduce \n     duplicate reporting; and relax reporting and payment \n     requirements on marginal producing leases, including \n     accepting prepayments of future royalties. Lastly, S. 1014 \n     would change existing statutory authority for the Secretary \n     to delegate royalty management activities to States.\n       This delegation issue has been of particular interest to \n     the Department. Our priority has been to ensure that the \n     delegation provision does not contain unacceptable bars to \n     the exercise of Secretarial discretion. We believe that the \n     language contained in the current version of S. 1014 provides \n     new benefits for states by expanding the list of delegable \n     authorities which a state may seek and requiring the \n     Secretary, to make a decision regarding any pending state \n     application for delegation within 90 days of its submission. \n     At the same time, however, the bill preserves the Secretary's \n     discretion regarding important decisions affecting public \n     lands, unlike similar language in the companion House\n\n[[Page S9677]]\n\n     bill (H.R. 1975) which unacceptably diminishes the \n     Secretary's discretionary authority. Certainly, we could not \n     accept any amendments that would weaken the Secretary's \n     authority as currently provided in S. 1014.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the presentation of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Sylvia V. Baca,\n\n                                    Acting Assistant Secretary for\n     Land and Minerals Management.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1996.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n     h.r. 1975--Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Simplification/Fairness\n\n                  (Calvert (R) CA) and 10 cosponsors)\n\n       The Administration is committed to ensuring the efficient \n     management of the Federal oil and gas program and to finding \n     new ways for the States to work cooperatively and creatively \n     with the Federal Government. Accordingly, the Administration \n     strongly supports enactment of H.R. 1975 if amended to adopt \n     the language of S. 1014, as reported by the Senate, with the \n     technical amendment agreed upon by the Administration and the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Senate \n     reported bill maintains Federal discretion in delegating \n     royalty collection and other duties to States while expanding \n     the list of delegable authorities that a State may seek.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 30, 1996.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Murkowski: I am writing to inform you of the \n     Administration's position regarding the pending Oil and Gas \n     Royalty Simplification and Fairness legislation (S. 1014). \n     Let me assure you that the Administration remains committed \n     to ensuring the efficient management of Federal lands and \n     finding new ways for the States to work cooperatively and \n     creatively with the Federal Government. The President shares \n     your hope that an agreement can be reached on the State \n     delegation issue.\n       In an effort to resolve this issue, Administration \n     representatives, working with the staff of the Senate Energy \n     Committee, were successful in reaching an agreement on \n     language that would expand the list of delegable royalty \n     management authorities, without reducing the Secretary of the \n     Interior's responsibility with respect to the management of \n     Federal lands. That language was included in S. 1014, which \n     was reported out of the Senate Energy Committee on May 1st. \n     The Administration supports S. 1014 as reported out of \n     Committee, but will seek a minor technical amendment. The \n     Administration believes this bill's State delegation language \n     is acceptable, unlike the language included in H.R. 1975, the \n     House Resources Committee bill on Royalty Simplification.\n       The Administration will continue to work with Congress as \n     the legislative process moves forward, and stands ready to \n     work in support of the language included in the Senate Energy \n     Committee bill. I appreciate your interest and support in \n     this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leon E. Panetta, Chief of Staff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                DOE News\n\n\n statement of charles b. curtis, deputy secretary, u.s. department of \n                                 energy\n\n                          On Royalty Fairness\n\n       ``The Clinton Administration is extremely pleased by \n     passage in the House today of H.R. 1975, the Federal Oil and \n     Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act. This legislation \n     will improve the competitiveness of America's natural gas and \n     oil industry by reducing red tape and making the federal \n     regulatory structure more efficient and responsive.\n       ``The Administration has worked hard to advance this \n     legislation because we believe that simplifying royalty \n     collection procedures will make it less costly for domestic \n     energy producers to find and produce more natural gas and oil \n     on federal lands. That, in turn, will reduce America's \n     reliance on foreign oil. Furthermore, the Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates that enactment of this measure will \n     contribute an additional $51 million in federal revenues and \n     $33 million in state revenues over seven years.\n       ``The bipartisan support in the House for this bill is a \n     major step forward in making government work for the American \n     people. If the Senate also approves this legislation, it will \n     be good news for American workers, good news for the U.S. \n     Treasury and, most important, good news for our Nation's \n     energy and National security.''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I speak today about extremely important \nlegislation that we will pass in the Senate: The Federal Oil and Gas \nRoyalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996.\n  This bill is a win-win solution for our beleaguered domestic oil and \ngas industry, oil and gas-producing States like my State of New Mexico, \nand the Federal Treasury.\n  As one of the three cosponsors of this legislation, I wish to commend \nSenator Nickles for introducing the bill, Senator Murkowski for joining \nwith me as a cosponsor, and Senator Thomas for fighting hard with us to \nmove this bill through committee and past initial administration \nobjections.\n  The bill before us reflects solid bipartisan support and the hard \nwork of the majority and the minority to narrow our differences and \nreach a good compromise.\n  The Royalty Fairness bill will generate more revenue for the State \nand Federal Government, which means more funding will be available for \nNew Mexico schools and for other vital State programs that depend on \nrevenues from oil and gas royalties.\n  According to CBO, the Royalty Fairness bill has the potential to save \ntaxpayers more than $50 million over 7 years. States keep half of the \noil and gas royalties, and because of our legislation will have the \npotential to receive over $30 million of additional royalty revenue \ninto their State treasuries when this bill is enacted into law.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Federal royalty collection \nsystem is our Nation's third largest source of revenue, and this bill \nmakes long-needed improvements to that system.\n  This bill will finally give the oil patch more consistency and less \nuncertainty in the royalty collection process, which will, in turn, \ngive a much-needed boost to our domestic oil and gas industry and \nlessen our dependence on foreign imports.\n  This is a good-government bill, a win-win bill, and I urge the \nPresident to sign this bill into law as soon as possible.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today we have finally passed the Federal \nOil and Gas Royalty Simplification and Fairness Act of 1996. I \nintroduced this bill last year. It is a bipartisan bill that has the \nsupport of the administration as well as 14 State Governors who \nrepresent 99 percent of all Federal onshore production, the Interstate \nOil and Gas Compact Commission and industry trade associations who \nrepresent virtually 100 percent of all Federal lessees.\n  This bill amends the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of \n1982 and applies to leases issued by the Secretary of the Interior on \nFederal onshore lands and the Outer Continental Shelf. The bill's \nobjectives are to provide greater certainty, simplicity, fairness and \nadministrative efficiencies in the laws that govern Federal royalties.\n  Over time, serious problems have developed with the ways courts and \nconsequently the Minerals Management Service [MMS] have interpreted the \nFederal statute of limitations governing royalty collection. Basically \nthe issue is: At what time does the statute of limitations begin to run \non the underpayment of royalties?\n  Some courts claim that the statute of limitations does not begin to \nrun until the MMS ``should have known about the deficiency'' in the \namount the producer has paid [Mesa versus U.S. (10th Cir. 1994)]. Other \ncourts have held that the current 6-year statute ``is tolled until such \ntime as the government could reasonably have known about a fact \nmaterial to its right of action.'' [Phillips versus Lujan (10th Cir. \n1993)].\n  Either of the above interpretations subjects producers to unlimited \nliability--a period that well exceeds the statute of limitations on \nother agency actions regarding producers. This situation has created a \nclimate of deep uncertainty in the payment of royalties that was not \nintended by Congress and that is not in the best interests of \nconsumers, producers, or ultimately the U.S. Government.\n  Oil and gas producers pay billions of dollars every year for the \nopportunity to drill on Federal land. The payment of royalties is a \nroutine part of doing business with the Federal Government. There is no \nattempt here to alter that obligation to pay.\n  However, as in all other businesses, oil and gas producers need \ncertainty in their business relationships and in their business \ntransactions with the Federal Government. That certainty is not now \npresent in the MMS's regulations or in numerous court decisions \ninterpreting the applicable statute of limitations. Certainty can be \nachieved\n\n[[Page S9678]]\n\nonly through legislation. For that reason, I introduced the Royalty \nFairness Act of 1995.\n  The main objective of this legislation is to establish a clear \nstatute of limitations and identify the time when the statute of \nlimitations begins to run on royalty payments. This bill establishes a \n7-year statute of limitations and in most cases, the statute will begin \nto run when the obligation to pay the royalty begins.\n  In addition, this bill permits the Secretary of the Interior to \ndelegate royalty collections and related activities to the States, it \nprovides for adjustments or refund requests to correct underpayments or \noverpayments of obligations, it authorizes the payment of interest to \nlessees who make overpayments, and it provides alternatives for \nmarginal properties including prepayment of royalties or regulatory \nrelief.\n  In conclusion, the Congressional Budget Office estimates this bill \nwould increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury by $36 million over 6 \nyears, and cumulatively to the States by $9 million during the same \ninterval. I am confident that passage of this bill is much needed to \ncreate a climate of certainty in the oil and gas industry as well as \nbeing very much in the national economic interest.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \ndeemed read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be placed \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1975) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/08/02/senate-section/article/S9675-5", "month": "08", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 1975\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
