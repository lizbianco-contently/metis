Dever, pastor of Capitol \nHill Baptist Church, Washington, DC, offered the following prayer:\n  Let us pray:\n  Most High God, we begin this day of business by praising You for Your \ninfinite wisdom. We know what You've committed to our hands, and our \nown harried schedules, and we turn to You, Lord, and consider Your \nways, and we marvel at all You do. Thank You, Lord, that in Your \ngreatness You care for us. Thank You, Lord, as part of Your care that \nYou teach us our need of You. You have invited us in Your word to come \nto You for aid: ``If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who \ngives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to \nhim.'' We praise You that You do not reproach us for our ignorance, but \nthat You invite us to come to You for Your wisdom. So we come to You on \nthe basis of Your words and ask for wisdom.\n  For questions of international and national needs, for questions \nabout personnel and policy, for questions about family and friends, for \nquestions about our own personal needs today. Strengthen the people of \nthis Nation, O Lord; nourish their lives with wise laws crafted here. O \nMost Wise and Giving God, prevent these servants gathered in this place \nfrom engendering quiet tyrannies and subtle stiflings of Your will. \nGive Your wisdom we pray particularly today to each Member of this \nChamber, that as they go about their public business here they would \nwork to make laws which bring honor to this place, and not shame, which \nbreed respect in the public, and not cynicism, which aid the lives of \nall Your people, rather than inhibit them. Be our guide. Convict and \ncomfort as we need. Teach us in all things to rely on You, through \nJesus Christ. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S685-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, following that, there is to be morning \nbusiness until 10 a.m. with Senators permitted to speak for not to \nexceed 5 minutes each. At 10 a.m. we will resume consideration of S. 2, \nthe congressional coverage bill, and under a previous unanimous-consent \nagreement, at 2:15 today the Senate will proceed to a 15-minute \nrollcall vote on the McConnell second-degree amendment to the Ford \namendment regarding frequent flier mileage.\n  I just say to my colleagues, just to recap, this is the fourth day in \nthe Senate we have been on a bill that passed the House in 20 minutes \nby a vote of 429 to 0. I would not want to rush anything too much over \nhere, but it seems to me that after 4 days we ought to be prepared to \nbring this matter to a conclusion, so that tomorrow we can start on \nunfunded mandates, which is very, very important legislation with \nstrong bipartisan support, supported by Governors, mayors, county \ncommissioners, and State legislators. And I hope that we will complete \naction on that bill by Friday.\n  In fact, so far we have moved at a rather leisurely pace. We have not \npushed anybody. But it seems to me that we will complete action on this \nbill tonight, either 6 o'clock, 7 o'clock, 8 o'clock, 9 o'clock, 10 \no'clock--whenever, however long it may take. And then tomorrow we will \nstart the debate on unfunded mandates.\n  Hopefully, we could have some agreement. I know it is a very, very \nimportant bill, but I know there are very legitimate concerns that \nMembers on each side of the aisle have and there are very legitimate \namendments that have to be discussed. So I do not want to downplay the \nfact that there are differences. But I hope we could come together, \nwork out a schedule or an agenda so the amendments could be offered, \ndebated at length if necessary, but then have the votes and complete \naction sometime early on Friday. So I\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\nurge my colleagues to cooperate in every way they can.\n  But I must say, I think in these first 3 months we may have to \nextend, at least sometimes, how long we might be around here in the \nevening. Hopefully we will get back on a family-friendly schedule \nsometime after the Easter recess.\n  The Senate will be in recess today between the hours of 12:30 and \n2:15 for our weekly policy luncheon.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The absence of a quorum has been \nnoted. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S685-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, I am introducing the committee's funding resolution for \nMarch 1, 1995, to February 28, 1997. This resolution reflects a 5-\npercent cut from the 1994 funding level with a 2.4-percent cost-of-\nliving adjustment for January 1996. This resolution was approved by the \nFinance Committee today. In addition, the committee approved the \ndesignation of myself, Senators Dole, Roth, Moynihan, and Baucus to be \nmembers of the Joint Committee on Taxation and to be congressional \nadvisers on trade policy and negotiations. Furthermore, the committee \nformally adopted its rules of procedure and in accordance with Senate \nrule XXVI, I request unanimous consent that the rules of the Finance \nCommittee be reprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Committee on Finance\n\n\n                         i. rules of procedure\n\n                       (Adopted February 1, 1993)\n\n       Rule 1.

The notification will include a written \n     agenda together with materials prepared by the staff relating \n     to that agenda. After the agenda for a committee meeting is \n     published and distributed, no nongermane items may be brought \n     up during that meeting unless at least two-thirds of the \n     members present agree to consider those items.\n       (b) In the absence of the chairman, meetings of the \n     committee may be called by the ranking majority member of the \n     committee who is present, provided authority to call meetings \n     has been delegated to such member by the chairman.\n       Rule 3.

Reporting of Measures or Recommendations.--No \n     measure or recommendation shall be reported from the \n     committee unless a majority of the committee is actually \n     present and a majority of those present concur.\n       Rule 6. Proxy Voting; Polling.--(a) Except as provided by \n     paragraph 7(a)(3) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate (relating to limitation on use of proxy voting to \n     report a measure or matter), members who are unable to be \n     present may have their vote recorded by proxy.\n       (b) At the discretion of the committee, members who are \n     unable to be present and whose vote has not been cast by \n     proxy may be polled for the purpose of recording their vote \n     on any rollcall taken by the committee.\n       Rule 7.

Bringing a Matter to a Vote.--If the chairman \n     determines that a motion or amendment has been adequately \n     debated, he may call for a vote on such motion or amendment, \n     and the vote shall then be taken, unless the committee votes \n     to continue debate on such motion or amendment, as the case \n     may be. The vote on a motion to continue debate on any motion \n     or amendment shall be taken without debate.\n       Rule 9. Public Announcement of Committee Votes.--Pursuant \n     to paragraph 7(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate (relating to public announcement of votes), the \n     results of rollcall votes taken by the committee on any \n     measure (or amendment thereto) or matter shall be announced \n     publicly not later than the day on which such measure or \n     matter is ordered reported from the committee.\n       Rule 10. Subpoenas.--Subpoenas for attendance of witnesses \n     and the production of memoranda, documents, and records shall \n     be issued by the chairman, or by any other member of the \n     committee designated by him.\n       Rule 11. Open Committee Hearings.--To the extent required \n     by paragraph 5 of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate (relating to limitations on open hearings), each \n     hearing conducted by the committee shall be open to the \n     public.\n       Rule 12.

Witnesses at Hearings.--(a) Each witness who is \n     scheduled to testify at any hearing must submit his written \n     testimony to the staff director not later than noon of the \n     business day immediately before the last business day \n     preceding the day on which he is scheduled to appear. Such \n     written testimony shall be accompanied by a brief summary of \n     the principal points covered in the written testimony. Having \n     submitted his written testimony, the witness shall be allowed \n     not more than ten minutes for oral presentation of his \n     statement.\n       (b) Witnesses may not read their entire written testimony, \n     but must confine their oral presentation to a summarization \n     of their arguments.\n       (c) Witnesses shall observe proper standards of dignity, \n     decorum and propriety while presenting their views to the \n     committee. Any witness who violates this rule shall be \n     dismissed, and his testimony (both oral and written) shall \n     not appear in the record of the hearing.\n       (d) In scheduling witnesses for hearings, the staff shall \n     attempt to schedule witnesses so as to attain a balance of \n     views early in the hearings. Every member of the committee \n     may designate witnesses who will appear before the committee \n     to testify. To the extent that a witness designated by a \n     member cannot be scheduled to testify during the time set \n     aside for the hearing, a special time will be set aside for \n     the witness to testify if the member designating that witness \n     is available at that time to chair the hearing.\n       Rule 14. Audiences.--Persons admitted into the audience for \n     open hearings of the committee shall conduct themselves with \n     the dignity, decorum, courtesy and propriety traditionally \n     observed by the Senate.

At the request of any such \n     witness who does not wish to be subjected to radio or \n     television coverage, all equipment used for coverage shall be \n     turned off.\n       Rule 16. Subcommittees.--(a) The chairman, subject to the \n     approval of the committee, shall appoint legislative \n     subcommittees. All legislation shall be kept on the full \n     committee calendar unless a majority of the members present \n     and voting agree to refer specific legislation to an \n     appropriate subcommittee.\n       (b) The chairman may limit the period during which House-\n     passed legislation referred to a subcommittee under paragraph \n     (a) will remain in that subcommittee. At the end of that \n     period, the legislation will be restored to the full \n     committee calendar. The period referred to in the preceding \n     sentences should be 6 weeks, but may be extended in the event \n     that adjournment or a long recess is imminent.\n       (c) All decisions of the chairman are subject to approval \n     or modification by a majority vote of the committee.\n       (d) The full committee may at any time by majority vote of \n     those members present discharge a subcommittee from further \n     consideration of a specific piece of legislation.\n       (e) Because the Senate is constitutionally prohibited from \n     passing revenue legislation originating in the Senate, \n     subcommittees may mark up legislation originating in the \n     Senate and referred to them under Rule 16(a) to develop \n     specific proposals for full committee consideration but may \n     not report such legislation to the full committee. The \n     preceding sentence does not apply to nonrevenue legislation \n     originating in the Senate.\n       (f) The chairman and ranking minority members shall serve \n     as nonvoting ex officio members of the subcommittees on which \n     they do not serve as voting members.\n       (g) Any member of the committee may attend hearings held by \n     any subcommittee and question witnesses testifying before \n     that subcommittee.\n       (h) Subcommittee meeting times shall be coordinated by the \n     staff director to insure that--\n       (1) no subcommittee meeting will be held when the committee \n     is in executive session, except by unanimous consent;\n       (2) no more than one subcommittee will meet when the full \n     committee is holding hearings; and\n       (3) not more than two subcommittees will meet at the same \n     time.\n       Notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), a subcommittee may \n     meet when the full committee is holding hearings and two \n     subcommittees may meet at the same time only upon the \n     approval of the chairman and the ranking minority member of \n     the committee and subcommittees involved.\n       (i) All nominations shall be considered by the full \n     committee.\n       (j) The chairman will attempt to schedule reasonably \n     frequent meetings of the full committee to permit \n     consideration of legislation reported favorably to the \n     committee by the subcommittees.\n       Rule 17. Transcripts of Committee Meetings.--An accurate \n     record shall be kept of all markups of the committee, whether \n     they be open or closed to the public. This record, marked as \n     ``uncorrected,'' shall be available for inspection by Members \n     of the Senate, or members of the committee together with \n     their staffs, at any time. This record shall not be published \n     or made public in any way except:\n       (a) By majority vote of the committee after all members of \n     the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to correct \n     their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately reflect \n     statements made.\n       (b) Any member may release his own remarks made in any \n     markup of the committee provided that every member or witness \n     whose remarks are contained in the released portion is given \n     a reasonable opportunity before release to correct their \n     remarks.\n       Notwithstanding the above, in the case of the record of an \n     executive session of the committee that is closed to the \n     public pursuant to Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate, the record shall not be published or made public in \n     any way except by majority vote of the committee after all \n     members of the committee have had a reasonable opportunity to \n     correct their remarks for grammatical errors or to accurately \n     reflect statements made.\n       Rule 18. Amendment of Rules.--The foregoing rules may be \n     added to, modified, amended or suspended at any time.\n\n\nii. excerpts from the standing rules of the senate relating to standing \n                               committees\n\n                     Rule XXV--Standing committees\n\n       1.

The bill eliminates much of the ``pork'' \n     contained in the 1994 Crime Bill and strengthens prison and \n     sentencing provisions.\n       Should you have questions about the bill not answered by \n     this summary, please call Mike O'Neill or Mike Kennedy of the \n     Judiciary Committee staff at extension 4-5225.\n\n\n                      section-by-section analysis\n\n                          Sec. 1. Short Title\n\n       The short title of the bill is the Violent Crime Control \n     and Law Enforcement Amendments Act of 1995.\n\n              Sec. 2. Elimination of Ineffective Programs\n\n       Section 2 eliminates the wasteful social programs passed in \n     the 1994 Crime Bill, including the Local Partnership Act, the \n     National Community Economic Partnership Act and the Family \n     Unity Demonstration Project, among many others. These \n     programs would have wasted billions of dollars on \n     duplicative, top-down spending programs without reducing \n     violent crime.\n       Of the over $4.5 billion dollars saved by eliminating these \n     programs, approximately $1 billion is redirected to prison \n     construction and operation grants.\n\n   Sec. 3. Amendment of Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth in \n                   Sentencing Incentive Grant Program\n\n       Section 3 amends the prisons grants included in the 1994 \n     Crime Bill to insure that the funds are spent on the actual \n     construction and operation of prisons for violent offenders \n     and would also remove provisions tying the funds to federal \n     mandates on state corrections systems. Specifically, the \n     proposal would make the following changes:\n       The Act currently allows prison funds to be spent on \n     alternative correctional facilities in order ``to free \n     conventional prison space.'' This section requires that \n     prison grants be spent on conventional prisons to house \n     violent offenders, not on alternative facilities.\n       The proposal removes from the Act a provision which would \n     have conditioned state receipt of the prison grants on \n     adoption of a comprehensive correctional plan that would \n     include diversion programs, jobs skills programs for \n     prisoners, and post-release assistance. Accordingly, these \n     grants will be used exclusively to build and operate prisons.\n       The proposal amends the prisons grant allocation provisions \n     of the Act by increasing the minimum per-state allocation and \n     removing the Attorney General's discretionary grant \n     authority.\n\n                 Sec. 4. Punishment for Young Offenders\n\n       Section 4 repeals Subtitle B of title II of the 1994 Crime \n     Bill, authorized $150 million in discretionary grants for \n     alternate sanctions for criminal juveniles.\n\n   Sec. 5. Increased Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Criminals Using \n                                Firearms\n\n       Section 5 establishes a mandatory minimum penalty of 10 \n     years' imprisonment for anyone who uses or carries a firearm \n     during a federal crime of violence or federal drug \n     trafficking crime. If the firearm is discharged, the person \n     faces a mandatory minimum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment. \n     If death results, the penalty is death or life imprisonment.\n\nSec. 6. Mandatory Minimum Prison Sentences for Those Who Use Minors in \n                      Drug Trafficking Activities\n\n       Section 6 establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 \n     years' imprisonment for\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\n     anyone who employs a minor in drug trafficking activities. \n     The section also establishes a sentence of mandatory life \n     imprisonment for a second offense.\n\n     Sec. 7. Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Persons Convicted of \n                    Distributions of Drugs to Minors\n\n       Section 7 establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 \n     years' imprisonment for anyone 21 years of age or older who \n     sells drugs to a minor.

Flexibility in Application of Mandatory Minimum Sentence \n                  Provisions in Certain Circumstances\n\n       Section 9 includes a narrowly circumscribed mandatory \n     minimum reform measure that returns a small degree of \n     discretion to the federal courts in the sentencing of truly \n     first-time, non-violent low-level drug offenders. To deviate \n     from the mandatory minimum, the court would have to find that \n     the defendant did not finance the drug sale, did not sell the \n     drugs, and did not act as a leader or organizer.\n\n       Sec. 10. Mandatory Restitution to Victims of Violent Crime\n\n       Section 10 amends 18 U.S.C. 3663 by mandating federal \n     judges to enter orders requiring defendants to provide \n     restitution to the victims of their crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S688-3", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REGARDING S. 14, THE LEGISLATIVE LINE-ITEM VETO ACT OF 1995\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, year after year, billions of the taxpayers' \ndollars are larded across the Nation for pork barrel projects created \nat the behest of our fellow Members.\n  This is nothing new. Each session, Congress persists in passing \nappropriations bill groaning with this type of spending for individual \nprojects in a Members home State or district.\n  Pork barrel spending has become a symbol of political prowess and \neffectiveness. Members can stump back home, claiming that they have the \nclout to deliver these projects to their constituents.\n  Although some of these projects no doubt have their merit, pork \nbarrel spending has become an emblem of out of control spending. Pork \nis Congress' shameful scarlet letter.\n  Ideally, Congress should exhibit the type of self-restraint and \nsacrifice that would swiftly put this wasteful practice to an end. We \nowe that to future generations of Americans and to our commitment to \ncontinue to reduce the deficit.\n  However, I am a realist and I know that while some Members would \nvoluntarily refrain from pork barrel spending, others would continue \nwith business as usual.\n  Mr. President, the American people are fed up with business as usual. \nIt's time to change the Nation's spending habits.\n  The President is also faced with an enormous dilemma. These pork \nprojects are carefully woven into the appropriations legislation, or as \nSenators Bradley and Domenici have rightly observed, through targeted \ntax credits and expenditures in revenue acts. The President cannot \nsimply pull out one thread without unravelling the entire bill. He does \nnot have that authority.\n  The President must look at each bill as a whole, determining whether \nto accept the bad with the good--whether the bad outweighs the good. \nMore often than not, it's a case of the President holding his nose and \nsigning the spending bill.\n\n  The obvious solution is to grant the President the line-item veto. \nToday, 43 of the 50 State Governors have some form of veto authority. \nAs Governor of the State of Nebraska, I was privileged to have the \nline-item veto authority. To me, it was an invaluable weapon in my \narsenal to effectively control the spending of my State legislature.\n  I have long believed that the President too should have this power to \nchallenge wasteful Government spending and keep us on the path of \ndeficit reduction. All but two Presidents in the 20th century have \nsupported some type of line-item veto authority. It's not time; it's \npast time we granted the President this power.\n  Mr. President, in previous years, I have championed efforts to amend \nthe Constitution to allow for a line-item veto. I have led the charge \nto give the President enhanced rescission powers.\n  Over 7 years ago, I worked with then Senator Dan Quayle in sponsoring \na porkbuster enhanced rescission proposal. I also supported an \namendment by my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain \nthat would have granted the President greater rescission powers.\n  It is a somewhat melancholy task to come to the Senate floor year \nafter year seeking these powers for the President and then to come away \nempty handed. The McCain amendment garnered only 40 votes--far short of \nthe 60 votes needed to break the filibuster that would surely occur on \nany such proposal.\n  I have come to the sad conclusion that proposals such as these stand \nlittle if any chance of becoming law. But that does not mean that we \nshould allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good. Through \ncompromise--a bipartisan compromise--we can still move forward on this \nissue. As such, I am an original sponsor of the legislative Line-Item \nVeto Act.\n\n  The bill would change our current rescissions process by giving the \nPresident the authority not to spend specific funding included in the \nappropriations bills.\n  Upon making a decision to rescind certain spending, the President \nwould then be required to seek congressional approval. If Congress does \nnot agree by at least a majority vote--not a super majority--in both \nHouses, the funding is released.\n  Members are less likely to pile on the pork in the appropriations \nbill if they know that they might have to defend each item on its own \nmerits.\n  Mr. President, there are some critics who argue that the savings \nreaped from such a proposal will not make a significant dent in the \nmenacing budget deficit; but that is a feeble excuse to oppose these \nefforts.\n  Of course, a single bill is not going to solve the budget deficit in \nand of itself, or erase a $4.5 trillion debt. These problems did not \noccur overnight and they will not be solved overnight. There are no \nquick fixes, silver bullets or panaceas. We should not rise to these \nshiny lures.\n  I believe that those who think clearest about reducing the budget \ndeficit realize that we will solve the problem in an incremental \nfashion. We will solve it in a bipartisan fashion.\n  In the coming weeks I look forward to working with the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee Senator Domenici to move this \nlegislation. I also plan further discussion with Senator Bradley of the \nFinance Committee as to whether we should include rescission authority \nover tax expenditures as well.\n  What is demanded of us now is to push the process forward to a speedy \nand successful conclusion. This bill is the vehicle of compromise that \nwill carry us to the finish line.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S692-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to learn yesterday \nof the decision of my friend and colleague Bennett Johnston of \nLouisiana not to seek reelection to a fifth term in the U.S. Senate.\n  Bennett Johnston has been a leader in the Senate. Indeed, when I \nfirst entered the Senate in 1979, he already had a long record of \naccomplishment. He has long been established as one of the Senate's \nmost knowledgeable and respected voices on energy policy, and also as a \npersuasive voice on a broad range of issues. He was, during the Reagan \nadministration, for example, one of the foremost opponents of the \nexcesses of the strategic defense initiative.\n  I know that my good friend has made a difficult decision. I hope that \nhe has made the right one for him and his family. I know that it is one \nwhich will leave the Senate diminished. Over the years he has been \nconstant in his decency, his independence and his openness. We are all \ngoing to miss him and his many fine qualities.\n  While I look forward to 2 more years of productive work alongside the \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, I know that I will sorely miss Bennett \nJohnston when he leaves this body at the end of the 104th Congress.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S692-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, before I send my amendment to the desk, let me one \nmore time thank my colleague, the Senator from Iowa, for his leadership \non this Congressional Accountability Act. I think it is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. I am certainly confident that by the \nend of the day we will indeed vote on this important piece of \nlegislation and it will be a very strong affirmative vote.\n  Mr. President, before I send my amendment to the desk, I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, let me just briefly give some background and talk \nabout the amendment.\n  This amendment essentially says is that it is the sense of the Senate \nthat the Senate should consider comprehensive gift ban legislation no \nlater than May 31, 1995.\n  At the end of last week, the Senate defeated a tough comprehensive \ngift ban amendment that was offered by Senator Levin, myself, and \nSenators Feingold and Lautenberg. I regret that my Republican \ncolleagues were unwilling to move forward on this piece of legislation \nwhich I think had everything in the world to do with congressional \naccountability. My Republican colleagues who opposed that amendment, \neven though many had cosponsored the same language just a few months \nago, contended that it was more an issue of timing.\n  But it did seem to me then and it seems to me now that if we could be \nready to move forward this week on an extremely important piece of \nlegislation dealing with unfunded mandates, that goes to the heart of \nthe interrelationship between Federal and State and local governments, \nand goes to the very heart of what Federalism is about, we should be \nable to address this straightforward issue without a lot of further \nconsideration. And if, in fact, my colleagues are willing to amend the \nU.S. Constitution with a balanced budget amendment with just a couple \nof weeks preparation, then it seems to me astounding that we are not \nwilling to move forward on a very simple amendment that has everything \nin the world to do with reform, which just simply puts an end to this \npractice of accepting the gifts, perks, lobbyist-sponsored vacation \ntravel, and the like offered by special interests.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, simply attempts to put the Senate on \nrecord formally in favor of returning to this issue promptly and acting \non tough gift ban legislation no later than the end of May 1995, which \nthe majority leader has indicated it was his intention to do.\n  Mr. President, the nice thing about this amendment is that it is \nconsistent with the debate and the discussion that we had on the floor \nof the Senate last week. At that time, Senator Cohen, who has again \nprovided a tremendous amount of leadership on these reform issues, said \non the floor: ``I intend to give Senator Dole an opportunity to bring \nit up in a relatively short time,'' the gift ban. ``He has not given me \na specific timetable, but I would say within the next couple of months, \nI expect we will consider this legislation and any amendments that \nmight be offered to it--and I suspect there will be amendments. There \nare people on this side that still do not agree with the provisions \nthat we supported.''\n  But, again, there will be action on this; it will be considered \nwithin the next several months.\n  Senator Dole, the majority leader, came to the floor and said:\n\n       I certainly commend the Senator from Michigan, Senator \n     Levin, for his leadership. But we believe there are some \n     changes that could be made even in the gift ban. This \n     amendment would not be effective in any event until the end \n     of May 1995.\n       It would be my hope that by that time we will have even a \n     better package.\n\n  So I really am essentially following the lead of the majority leader \nwith this amendment. As he pointed out, our amendment would not have \nbecome effective until the end of May. I simply think that it is time \nnow for the Senate to go formally on record that, in fact, we will take \naction no later than the end of May.\n  Mr. President, let me give this amendment a little bit of context, a \nbrief history.\n  Almost 2 years ago, we started dealing with this problem of gifts \nbeing lavished on Members of Congress from outside sources. And I had \nan amendment which simply said lobbyists had to disclose specifically \nwhat these gifts were. I said at the time it was a first step, and I \nmeant that.\n  Mr. President, that lobbying registration bill, with the amendment \nthat I had to that bill, passed the Senate by a vote of 95 to 2. Months \nof waiting took place for the House to act on strong gift ban \nprovisions as a part of the lobbying bill. Then, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator Feingold, and myself introduced a tough, comprehensive gift ban \nbill. We introduced a tough, comprehensive gift ban bill. Senator \nLevin's committee then held hearings and reported out a solid, \ncomprehensive, more refined version of our earlier gift bans bill. \nUnder Secretary Levin's leadership, we were able to beat back Senate \namendments which would have weakened the bill. That bill passed last \nMay by a 95-4 vote.\n\n  Prodded in part by this action, the House then acted on a reasonably \ntough version. A strong version came out of a House-Senate conference \ncommittee. Then the lobbying registration gift ban bill to which the \ngift ban was attached was killed in the last days of the session--I \nthink based upon unfounded complaints by lobbying groups that were \nconcerned about the registration part.\n  Legislation that we brought forward to the Senate floor last week was \nvery similar to a Senate-passed version last year, and to the \nconference report; that is to say, the amendment that dealt with gift \nbans.\n  Now, Mr. President, on the merits of the gift ban, 37 Republicans, \nincluding the majority leader, cosponsored the same legislation. In \nother words, the wording of the amendment that we brought to the floor \ndealing with gift ban was essentially identical to the wording that the \nmajority leader and 36 other Republican Senators had voted for last \nsession.\n  Now, as I wrap up my remarks, and I am about ready to send the \namendment to the desk, I make an appeal to my colleagues. I believe my \ncolleagues when they say we are going to act on this. I believe them. \nBut I want to ensure that we do not let this gift ban amendment, this \ngift ban legislation, slip by in the legislative rush of this session. \nAgain, this is a simple amendment. It puts the Senate on record in \nfavor of acting on a tough, comprehensive gift ban legislation no later \nthan the end of May 1995, precisely what the majority leader has called \nfor.\n  Mr. President, I do not think I need to again rehearse the \nsubstantive arguments in favor of enacting a tough, comprehensive gift \nban. We have debated this legislation and we have debated this \namendment more than once on the floor of the Senate. I will simply say \nthis: The evidence is irrefutable that the giving of these special \nfavors\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\nto Senators and Representatives has only added to the deepening \ndistrust that citizens have of this political process, of this \ncongressional process. Despite assertions by my colleagues that we are \ncompletely unswayed by trips or fancy dinners, such gifts give the \nappearance of impropriety, and they erode public confidence in the \nCongress as an institution. Mr. President, they erode public confidence \nin each of us, personally, as representatives of our constituents.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues will agree that in any town meeting \nSenators hold, Senators hear about this and other reform issues from \npeople in the country. They want to put an end to this practice, and \nclean up the system. Public trust in the Congress is at a historic low \nand demand for political reform is very high. Banning outside gifts \nwould be an extremely positive signal that we could send to people in \nthis country that we are serious about making this political process \nmore honest, more open, and more accountable.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I now send to the desk reads:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate should \n     consider comprehensive gift ban legislation no later than May \n     31, 1995.\n\n  This is what the majority leader called for. This is what I believe \nwe talked about last week. I am disappointed we did not act to approve \nthe actual gift ban at the very beginning of the session. But I intend \nto come back at this issue until we are done.\n  I think it is extremely important that the Senate now go on record \nthat we shall consider comprehensive gift ban legislation no later than \nMay 31.\n  One final time, Mr. President, for my colleagues: There is no hidden \nagenda to this amendment. It is very simple. It is very \nstraightforward. As a matter of fact, it simply is a confirmation of a \ncommitment that I believe we made last week. Now, I call on all of my \ncolleagues, I call on the U.S. Senate, to go on record that the Senate \nshould consider comprehensive gift ban legislation no later than May \n31, 1995.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 9.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.  . It is the sense of the Senate that the Senate \n     should consider comprehensive gift ban legislation no later \n     than May 31, 1995.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for the moment I yield the floor, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I certainly support what Senator Wellstone \nis trying to do.\n  The gift ban is something we have tried to put through. There has \nbeen controversy on it back and forth. He has kept on this, to his \neverlasting credit. I think it is good he brings it up.\n  I hope the majority, after checking with the leadership, might be \nable to accept this so that we do not have to go to a vote. I hope that \nwill be acceptable to my distinguished colleague from Minnesota. I \nthink, as I understand it, that is the process we are in now.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr, President, I state that we are checking with the \nappropriate committees to make sure if any of those Members want to \ncome and speak on this subject, as well as checking to see the \nleadership's position.\n  Then, as well, if it does not work out, I would like to have a \nunanimous-consent later on that. I would propose to have a vote on it \nimmediately after the McConnell amendment, which takes place at 2:15.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays, and would like to have a vote on \nthis amendment, and that vote take place at a convenient time.\n  Mr. President, let me right now ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague yield?\n  Would the Senator want the yeas and nays if the majority was going to \naccept it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would ask for the yeas and nays. I do \nwant to have a recorded vote on it.\n  Mr. GLENN. That would sort of obviate the need for Members to try to \naccept it then, at this point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I understood the Senator from Iowa to \nsay there would be a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, right now we are in the process of \nletting the appropriate committees know about the amendment, and \nreserving time for them to come over and debate if they want to debate. \nI do not know that there is any request for debate on it.\n  I am also checking with the leadership to see if there would be any \nobstacles to accepting the amendment. If we accept the amendment, we \nhope, then, that there will not be a vote on it. If the leadership does \nnot want to accept the amendment, then I suggest that we vote on it \nimmediately after the McConnell amendment, and we would have the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I renew my request for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand the state of parliamentary \nprocedure is that there is an amendment currently pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Offered by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be temporarily \nset aside for the purpose of consideration of another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 10\n\n (Purpose: To restrict the use of campaign funds for personal purposes)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 10.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.   . RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS.\n\n       Section 313 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (2 \n     U.S.C. 439a) is amended)--\n       (1) by striking ``Amounts received'' and inserting ``(a) \n     Amounts received''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b)(1) Any candidate who receives contributions may not \n     use such contributions for personal use.\n       ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term `personal \n     use' shall include, but not be limited to--\n       ``(A) a home purchase, mortgage, or rental;\n       ``(B) articles of clothing for the use of the candidate or \n     members of the candidate's immediate family (other than \n     standard campaign souvenirs, articles, or materials \n     traditionally offered or provided in connection with bona \n     fide campaign events);\n       ``(C) travel and related expenses that are substantially \n     recreational in nature;\n       ``(D) entertainment, such as sporting events, theater \n     events, or other similar activities, except when offered or \n     provided by the campaign in connection with a bona fide \n     campaign fundraising event;\n       ``(E) fees or dues for membership in any club or \n     recreational facility;\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\n       ``(F) automobile expenses within the Washington, D.C. \n     metropolitan area (except that a candidate whose district \n     falls within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, may \n     lease automobiles used for campaign purposes consistent with \n     subparagraph (G));\n       ``(G) any other automobile expense, except that a campaign \n     may lease automobiles for campaign purposes if it requires \n     that, if the automobile is used for any other incidental use, \n     the campaign receives reimbursement not later than 30 days \n     after such incidental use;\n       ``(H) any meal or refreshment on any occasion not directly \n     related to a specific campaign activity;\n       ``(I) salaries or per diem payments to the candidate; and\n       ``(J) other expenditures determined by the Federal Election \n     Commission to be personal in nature.\n       ``(3) Any personal expenditure described in paragraph (2) \n     shall not be considered to be an ordinary and necessary \n     expense incurred in connection with a Member's or Member-\n     elect's duties as a holder of Federal office.''.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that, at \nfirst blush, some might try to argue does not belong on this bill \nbecause it addresses one facet of campaign finance reform. But I want \nto make it very clear at the outset that this amendment is not broad-\nbased campaign finance reform. It is a small reform which we adopted by \nvoice vote previously last year. I think it was offered in similar form \nby the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain. I believe that, indeed, it \nis appropriate to join it with the issue of congressional coverage, and \nthat it therefore is fully appropriate to offer it as an amendment to \nthis bill.\n  This amendment asks us to behave like other Americans. In the spirit \nof reform that has been so embraced in the House of Representatives, in \nthe spirit of reform that is at the center of the efforts of this \nCongress to try to respond to the mandate of the election, and in the \nspirit of reform that I believe is at the center of all of the dynamics \nof our politics today, this amendment is relevant and germane and \nimportant.\n  What this amendment seeks to do, simply, is to make it illegal to \nconvert campaign funds to personal use. This is not campaign finance \nreform as much as it is an effort by the Congress to say we are going \nto behave like everybody else in this country, and everybody else in \nthis country does not have the ability to go out and ask people to \ndonate money for one purpose and then turn around and decide, with \nenormous discretion, to spend that money for entirely different \npurposes--and, in fact, for personal gain and benefit.\n  The amendment is based on the proposed rules addressing the same \nsubject published by the Federal Election Commission late in 1994. It \nwould close the loopholes by prohibiting personal use of campaign funds \nand by setting forth a clear definition of what constitutes personal \nuse. And most important, Mr. President, it prohibits a candidate from \ndrawing a salary from his or her own campaign funds.\n  I believe that this amendment is synchronized with the effort to lift \nthis institution out of the morass of partisanship and out of the \nmorass of disdain with which most Americans have viewed in recent \nyears.\n  While I have been deeply involved in campaign finance reform and it \nhas been one of my principal areas of legislative focus since I was \nelected to this body--indeed, it was the subject of one of the very \nfirst pieces of legislation that I introduced, and I will continue the \nfight for comprehensive campaign finance reform this year--I emphasize \nthis amendment is not bringing a broad-based campaign finance reform \nproposal. I understand from Majority Leader Dole that there will be a \ntime for that later in the year, though it cannot come soon enough as \nfar as this Senator is concerned.\n  But I do believe this is an opportunity for us to make an important \nchange in the way campaign funds are used while simultaneously making a \nstatement fully in keeping with the spirit of congressional coverage \nlegislation. The bottom line of that legislation is an effort to say to \nAmericans: Congress ought to live by the same standards as all other \nAmericans. And this seeks to say that our management of campaign funds \ngiven to us for the specific purpose of campaigning should entail an \nexplicit responsibility to spend that money for campaign purposes--that \nit should not be taken to buy Super Bowl tickets, or to pay for trips \nto places that many hard-working Americans would like to go but cannot \nafford to go, under the guise of some kind of campaign effort. It \ncertainly should not be used by a candidate to pay himself or herself a \nsalary, particularly a salary that might be in excess of what that \ncandidate was able to earn in the marketplace or was previously \nearning. Each of those activities is outside the norm of life for the \ngreat majority of Americans. They are activities that are available to \npeople in Congress only because they are in Congress and are raising \nlarge amounts of money necessary for campaigns under our current system \nof campaign finance.\n  When the Federal Election Commission was considering the new rules on \nthis subject which it proposed late in 1994, the Sacramento Bee \nnewspaper said:\n\n       The FEC should approve them. Most important, for the vast \n     majority of those in Congress who are honest public servants \n     who are at times genuinely confused about the proper use of \n     campaign funds, the rules provide some guidance.\n\n  That is what we seek to do here, provide some guidance in order to \nhelp Members to live up to reasonable standards.\n  The Chicago Tribune said:\n\n       Despite a 15-year-old Federal law that bars candidates from \n     converting campaign funds to personal use, the Federal \n     Election Commission has never offered rules on what personal \n     use is.\n\n  And the New York Times said:\n\n       The law should be revised.\n\n  This amendment does exactly that. It ends the confusion, it defines \npersonal use, and it revises the law. I hope my colleagues will support \nit. I want to make it clear that there is an awful lot more to do than \njust this on campaign finance reform. We passed major legislation last \nyear. Regretfully it got caught up in House politics and later in \nSenate politics and the American people were cheated of the most far-\nreaching and important campaign finance reform in the history of this \ncountry. This is vital legislation because I think every American \nunderstands that underneath the term limits movement, underneath the \ndisdain for Congress, underneath the sense of a lack of access to the \nU.S. Congress, underneath the feeling of powerlessness and the great \ngulf between elected officials and the people, there is one source that \nis to blame more than any other. It is money--the money used for \ncampaigning for elective office. Money is moving and dictating and \ngoverning the process of American politics, and most Americans \nunderstand that. The reason so many people find it hard to run for \noffice and keep our democracy vibrant is because of the extraordinary \ncost.\n  So we have a great task ahead of us in order to pass a comprehensive \ncampaign finance reform law and in order to avoid the increasing \nperception of the American people that no matter what they do, Congress \nseems wedded to interests that have money and somehow divorces itself \nfrom the real concerns and aspirations of the American people. So I \nhope this small measure--which is aimed at helping us to live under the \nsame rules as do the rest of Americans--will be accepted by the \nmajority and it will not need a rollcall vote. But in the event that it \ndoes, I, at this time, ask for the yeas and nays, which I certainly \nwill be happy to vitiate should it be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, let me rise to strongly support the \nproposal by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. We have had \nthis before us several times, as to what kind of limitation we should \nput on funds that are gathered for specific purposes and wind up being \nused for other purposes; where money that was given for a particular \nelection use winds up feathering the nests or lining the pockets--\nhowever you want to say it--anyway, being used by the former candidate \nfor his or her own personal use. That was not the intent of the giving \nin most cases, that the funds could be converted for that purpose.\n  That is what the Senator addresses, basically. This is a small step \nforward. It does not try to encompass all of the\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\ndifficulties involved with the problems of campaigns and campaign \nfinance reform. It is a small step forward, and I hope we will have \nsupport on both sides of the aisle for this, so I rise to support the \nproposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, once again I express to my colleagues \nthe desire that we not put amendments on this bill that will possibly \nbe able to be discussed later on in this session on the floor of the \nSenate when offered to bills more germane to the subject, in this \nparticular case campaign finance reform. In the case of the Wellstone \namendment it would be the gift ban.\n  This is a bill that is very basic and easily understood. The \nunderlying bill I introduced, and Senator Lieberman has been my \nDemocratic counterpart, is a bill that is going to end the situation \nwhere we have a dual set of laws in this country, one for Capitol Hill \nand one for the rest of the country. We think there is a consensus on \nthis. There is very little discussion on the underlying legislation. \nBefore this day is out we hope to have this legislation become the law \nof the land by being able to pass it here, the House having agreed to \nit, and immediately getting it to the President of the United States.\n  There is nothing wrong with the proposals the Senator from \nMassachusetts presents to us in the way of campaign finance reform, \nonly that it is being offered as an amendment to a bill that otherwise \nis basically noncontroversial. It will not pass unanimously, I know, \nbut there is a fair consensus because it tries to correct a situation \nthat we all agree for too long has been unjust, a situation where the \nlaws that apply to the private sector do not apply to Congress and \nCapitol Hill.\n  So I hope we can get these amendments behind us and move on. I do not \nsay to the Senator from Massachusetts that his subject should not be \ndiscussed or that there is anything wrong with what he is proposing to \ndo. I just think now is not the time to do it. The bill we are dealing \nwith, the subject matter of the bill, in S. 2, passed the House of \nRepresentatives unanimously, with only about 20 minutes of debate, in \nthe first day of their session. Senator Dole set this bill for \ndiscussion on Thursday, the first day we were having legislative \naction. That is how important the leadership, the new leadership of the \nSenate, feels that this legislation is.\n  We discussed it on Thursday, on Friday, on Monday, and now Tuesday \nwill be the fourth day. We have spent most of our discussion on this \nlegislation on issues unrelated to congressional coverage--\ncongressional coverage by these laws of our employees. I hope that we \ncan get on with this legislation, that we will not accept this \namendment, and that we will before the day is out get this bill passed. \nThat will mean that we have spent 4 days on a bill that the House of \nRepresentatives spent 20 minutes on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague and others on the other \nside what it is of which they are afraid. I ask my colleague if my \nRepublican friends are really in favor of reform. There is no strict \nformula by which we determine what legislation will be brought before \nthe U.S. Senate, in what order it will be brought, or when it will be \nbrought. Everyone serving in this body knows that. Where is it ordained \nthat there is a better moment 5 months from now than right now to say \nto the American people we are not going to spend campaign money for \npersonal use? Of what are those Members who oppose this amendment \nafraid? If they support it, why not attach it to this vehicle and make \nthe statement of reform to the American people now? Why wait 5 months?\n  My colleague just stood up and said that the purpose of this \nlegislation is to show Americans that we are prepared to live like they \ndo. Why would you not want to attach to that bill a statement that we \nare not going to allow people to raise campaign funds to spend money in \na way that no other Americans can spend money? I thought the \nRepublicans who are the new majority party were the folks who are \nsaying to the people back home, we are not going to do business as \nusual anymore in Washington; no more business as usual. But business as \nusual is coming to the floor and saying, ``Oh, we are going to do this \nin 5 months; we are going to do this in 6 months.'' I note that this is \ncoming from the very people who filibustered the last round of campaign \nfinance reform and who saw their President, President Bush, veto the \nbill that was passed 2 years ago.\n  So here is a chance to demonstrate to the American people whether we \nreally are just rhetorically talking about reform and are just going to \ndo the kind of pushbutton, feel-good things that happen to appeal to \none party but do not constitute basic reform. What could be simpler \nthan a fundamental principle that people who run for political office \nare not going to spend their campaign funds for personal use, are not \ngoing to go out and buy clothing with campaign funds, and are not going \nto pay for a trip to the Super Bowl with campaign funds?\n  I have a lot of workers in Lynn, MA, or in Fall River or New Bedford \nwho dream about buying new clothes or going to the Super Bowl but who \ndo not have campaign funds with which to do so.\n  So here we are with an opportunity to say to the average American we \nare going to live just like you do, we are going to spend our campaign \nmoney strictly on campaigning. Is that frightening? But we are being \ntold by those on the other side of the aisle that somehow such a \nproposal does not belong on a bill that is specifically geared to \nrequiring Congress to live like the rest of America.\n  So what we are seeing, Mr. President, is that there is a difference \nbetween the reality and the rhetoric once again. Some people are \nprepared only to talk a good game about reform. Is there anybody here \nwho truly disagrees that campaign funds should not be spent on personal \nuse? My friend from Iowa talked about a consensus. Is there really not \na consensus in the Congress that campaign funds should not be spent on \npersonal use? I would think there would be 100 votes to support that.\n  Let us put that to the test. I think we ought to find out whether \nthere are 100 votes for that proposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nto set aside the pending amendment so that I might offer an amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, has the unanimous-consent request been \nagreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it has not.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator McCain was on his way over to speak on the \nKerry amendment. Could we wait for that?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I would be happy to. I should say to my friend \nfrom Iowa that I will probably take only 3 or 4 minutes. I wonder if I \nmight go forward and I would be happy to immediately yield to Senator \nMcCain when he arrives.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would Senator McCain be able to get the floor?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Oh, yes. I would yield. Give me about 20 seconds after he \nmotions that he wants it and I will yield to him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 11\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 11.\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following,\n       ``No congressional organization or organization affiliated \n     with the Congress, may request that any current or \n     prospective employee fill out a questionnaire or similar \n     document in which the person's views on organizations or \n     policy matters are requested.''\n\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me explain why I have done this. I \nremember when I first came to the Senate, I think within the first year \nor so I was here, I introduced legislation saying that I wished all \nlaws would be applied to Members of Congress that apply to everybody \nelse. The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] has been doing the same for \nyears, and Senator Grassley from Iowa has been doing the same for \nyears. I think we have joined as cosponsors of each other's \nlegislation. But I remember giving an eloquent speech--as I thought \nanyway--as a young Member of the Senate, on a Friday as I recall, about \nwhy we should apply all the same laws to Members of Congress. As I was \nleaving, one of the older Members of the Senate, a very senior Member \nof the Senate, said, ``Where are you going?'' I said I was heading to \nthe airport to catch a plane back to Vermont. His response was, ``Good. \nStay there.'' The legislation was not greeted with enormous enthusiasm. \nI know the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Iowa have experienced \nsimilar things--we have commiserated with each other about it--the \nlatest being even on Sunday when the Senator from Ohio and I had a \nchance to join each other for lunch. But what I want to do is give \nemployees of the Congress the same protections available to other \nworkers in the Federal Government and private sector.\n  As we changed from the majority to the minority, the new majority \ncame in and, as is perfectly appropriate, they did a great deal of new \nhiring. I have no problem with that. I have been here in the majority \nand then the minority, and I have gone back and forth four times. I \nknow a lot of staff changes with that. But I was surprised by news \nreports that the Republican Study Committee required prospective \ncongressional employees to take an ideological litmus test, not so they \ncould be hired but they had to take it before they could even be listed \nwith a placement service.\n  Mr. President, I think Senators know me well enough to know this is \nnot partisan. I would object to this whether Republicans or Democrats \ndid it. I do not know whether these questionnaires are legal under \nFederal laws or the rules of the Senate, but they smack of McCarthyism \nwhile I was a teenager during the fifties. I know enough about \nMcCarthyism to know how destructive to human beings and the sense of \nthe public comity loyalty oaths can be.\n  I have a copy of the questionnaire, and I ask unanimous consent that \nit be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Republican Study Committee--Issues Questionnaire\n\n       The following questions are designed to assist us in \n     placing you with an office in which you are most compatible. \n     If you tend to agree with the statements put a ``Y'' in the \n     blank.

Crews, Job Bank Coordinator.\n       This is just a brief note to explain the RSC Job Bank to \n     you. The RSC is a Republican research organization which \n     exists solely for the aid of its members.\n       The RSC provides numerous services for its members \n     including the Job Bank. When a member calls with a job \n     vacancy, he/she gives us the description which includes \n     title, duties, salary, contact, etc. We then refer resumes of \n     qualified applicants to them for their consideration. If they \n     are interested, they will contact you. You will not receive a \n     call from us. Because most of our members prefer it, we never \n     disclose the location of a vacancy.\n       Rest assured that the RSC wants you to find a job. We will \n     do everything possible to aid you in your search. However, we \n     cannot guarantee you a job, and we do not know of all the \n     jobs on the Hill. Therefore, we ask that you do everything \n     you can to aid in your search.\n       Because we receive so many resumes, it is impossible for us \n     to keep in contact with you. Therefore, we ask that you keep \n     in contact with us by letting us know when you have found a \n     job or if you are still looking. If we do not hear from you \n     within three (3) months, we will discard your resume. If you \n     are still looking after that, you will have to give us a new \n     one.\n       And now, for some important advice. Be flexible. We would \n     all like to start at the top--very few of us get the chance. \n     Be willing to do whatever it takes to get that Hill \n     experience, even if you have to open mail for someone for a \n     while. Don't price yourself out of the market. Be willing to \n     negotiate salary. If you turn down a job because you think \n     you are worth more than the Congressman is willing to pay, \n     you may find yourself looking longer than you anticipated.\n       The RSC wishes you the best in your search for employment \n     on the Hill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Job Placement Information\n\n       Date: ______\n       Name: ______\n       Street: ______\n       City: ______\n       State: ______\n       Zip: ______\n       Home Phone: ______\n       Work Phone: ______\n       Home State: ______\n       Position(s) Desired: (You may circle more than one.)\n       Chief of Staff/AA.\n       Legislative Counsel.\n       Committee Staff.\n       Legislative Director.\n       Legislative Assistant.\n       Legislative Correspondent.\n       Press Secretary.\n       Caseworker.\n       Office Manager.\n       Scheduler.\n       Receptionist.\n       Systems Manager.\n       If applying for a clerical position, please indicate your \n     appropriate skills:\n       Typing (wpm).\n       Shorthand (wpm).\n       Computer system(s) & applications.\n       Salary Range: __ to__.\n       Ideology: Do you consider yourself (please circle one): \n     conservative  moderate  liberal.\n       Campaign Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Fundraising Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Hill Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Press Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Senior Management Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Speech Writing Experience: Yes {time}  No {time} .\n       Issue(s) Expertise: ______\n       Security Clearance: Yes {time}  No {time}  Level __.\n       Would you like this inquiry kept confidential?

This legislation is designed to give the employees of the \nCongress the same protections that are available to other workers in \nthe Federal Government and the private sector.\n  I was surprised by recent news reports that the Republican Study \nCommittee required prospective congressional employees to take an \nideological litmus test before they could be listed with their \nplacement service.\n  I do not know whether such questionnaires are legal under Federal law \nor under the rules of the Senate. I do know, as one who lived through \nthe McCarthyism of the 1950's, how destructive, to both human beings, \nand to the sense of public comity, loyalty oaths can be.\n  That is why I requested a copy of the questionnaire and related \nmaterials. Let me take a few minutes of the Senate's time to describe \nwhat I found.\n  The Republican Study Committee, an organization of the House of \nRepresentatives, which among other activities, provides an employment \nservice for persons who are applying for jobs with Republican Members \nof the House. It provides prospective employees with a set of materials \nwhich includes a questionnaire. This questionnaire asks a large number \nof very definitive policy questions about a prospective employee's \nviews.\n  For example, it asks questions about the applicants views on \nabortion, school prayer, and AID among others.\n  It also asks whether the applicant is in general agreement with ACLU, \nNational Right to Work, Newt Gingrich, Ted Kennedy, or Richard \nGephardt. Apparently new litmus tests to judge an employee's political \ncorrectness are now in order.\n  Of course, these questions are ``designed to assist in placing you \nwith an office in which you are most compatible.''\n  The reality is that these kinds of questions are getting close to \nloyalty oath type questions of the 1950's.\n  Soon will employees be asked, ``Are you now or have you ever been a \nmember of Common Cause?\n  ``Are you now or have you ever been a member of Planned Parenthood?\n  ``Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Sierra Club.''\n  Are we on the way to a new type of politically correct rightwing \nthinking?\n  This questionnaire is not new. One of my current employees \nencountered this questionnaire when she was looking for an entry-level \njob on the Hill over 3 years ago. More concerned about being a part of \nthe democratic process than in ideology she applied at both Democratic \nand Republican service offices. What kind of signal does the RSC \nquestionnaire send to prospective employees like her? Clearly, it \nstrikes a blow at the idealism of our young people and discourages them \nfrom participating in the democratic process.\n  This is not a difficult issue to decide.\n  The public wants an end to partisan politics, and this litmus test is \nnothing but partisan.\n  We want to encourage our youth to participate in the democratic \nprocess, this litmus test destroys the idealism of our youth.\n  The Republican leadership has pledged to make Congress be held to the \nsame laws as it imposes on others, this litmus test flies in the face \nof that pledge.\n  Above all there is too often a sense of intolerance in the tone of \ndebate in this country. We see this in tone in the abortion clinic \nshootings and bombings and when talk show hosts insult the President's \nwife.\n  I will not stand quietly and let a new ``McCarthyism'' take hold of \nthis institution.\n  Mr. President, I will close with this: I have no problem with any \nMember, Democrat or Republican, wanting to hire staff that bears their \nviews. I must say that in my own staff, I do not know whether most of \nthe people in my office are Republicans or Democrats, unless they have \nbeen involved in something where they have made it clear to me. I know \nthat I have hired people who were identified as Republicans back home, \nas well as identified as Democrats. I do not know what they belong to. \nI just do not want us to do things that would never be allowed at IBM, \nor Monsanto, or any other company.\n  I do not want to get into a litmus test for people even to be able to \nmake a job application, because there are so many extremely good men \nand women in this country who should have an opportunity to seek jobs \nin the Congress if they want. But they should not have the door closed \nin their faces initially because they do not pass a particular litmus \ntest.\n  I will ask the floor managers something and then I will yield to \nSenator McCain. What happens with this amendment? Should we ask for the \nyeas and nays? What has been the process? I have been off the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The yeas and nays have been requested on most \namendments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I understand it, these votes will be stacked.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I take the floor this morning, Mr. President, to comment \non both the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, \nconcerning the frequent flier, frequent travelers benefits and its \napplication to Members of Congress, as well as the Kerry amendment \nconcerning personal use of campaign funds. The reason I do so is \nbecause I have been involved in both issues to a significant degree.\n  First of all, on the issue of the amendment by Senator Ford, Mr. \nPresident, I point out that in the legislation passed in the last \nCongress, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act conference report, \nmy amendment, which appears on page 130 of the conference report said, \n``Requirement: Any awards granted under such a frequent traveler \nprogram accrued through official travel shall be used only for official \ntravel.''\n  I see my friend from Ohio on the floor. If I can get the attention of \nthe Senator from Ohio, I would appreciate it, since I am asking, and I \nknow there were many aspects of this legislation he was responsible \nfor, which I think was a landmark piece of legislation, the Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act. An amendment of mine was included in \nthat, which said:\n\n       Requirement: Any awards granted under such a frequent \n     traveler program accrued through official travel shall be \n     used only for official travel.\n\n  I do not know if the Senator recollects that or not. From the nodding \nof his head, I see that he recalls that. Does the Senator recollect, \nalso, that at that time it was mine, his, and Senator Roth's \nunderstanding that it would apply to Congress as well as Federal \nemployees?\n  Mr. GLENN. I would respond to my good friend by saying I think it \nshould. We discussed that at the time, as I recall, and our exact \nreasoning why we did not make it apply that way, I do not quite recall \nat the moment. Looking at what is in the procurement bill this \nmorning--and I think you have a copy--I would like to see that same \nprovision go all across Government and apply to everybody. We gave some \ntime to work this thing out.\n  In that procurement bill, section 6008, entitled ``Cost Savings for \nOfficial Travel,'' it says:\n\n       (a) Guidelines: The Administrator or General Services \n     Administration shall issue guidelines to ensure that agencies \n     promote, encourage, and facilitate the use of frequent \n     traveler programs offered by airlines, hotels, and car rental \n     vendors by Federal employees who engage in official air \n     travel, for the purpose of realizing to the maximum extent \n     practicable cost savings for official travel.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Any awards granted under such a frequent traveler program \n     accrued to official travel shall be used only for official \n     travel.\n\n  I think it should apply across the board. We gave them 1 year to \nreport on how they would enact this. I would like to see that same \nthing applied all\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\nacross Government. We were discussing this morning whether to try to \nput this in as an amendment to this bill or subsequent legislation. The \nsame thing should apply, and the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, I remind my friend, Senator Glenn, that there was a \ncolloquy between him and Senator Roth, with the understanding that this \nparticular provision would apply to Congress. Since then, it has been \ninterpreted as not applying to Congress. And that is wrong, in my view.\n  I agree with the Senator from Ohio that it should apply to Congress. \nI believe that Senator Ford in bringing it up is entirely correct in \ndoing so, because if we are going to take advantage of frequent \ntraveler programs, those advantages should not then accrue to the \npersonal use of Members of Congress.\n  So I would say I regret that the interpretation of what was already \nin law did not apply across the board to Congress. I think that it \nshould in the future, and I believe the Ford amendment should make it \napplicable.\n  I also want to talk about the Kerry amendment here, which applies to \nthe use of campaign funds for personal use. Last year, Mr. President, \nin the consideration of the campaign finance reform bill, I proposed an \namendment prohibiting the use of campaign funds for personal purposes. \nThen Senator Boren, the manager of the bill, accepted that provision. \nAnd, obviously, as we know, the campaign finance reform bill never went \nanywhere. I applaud Senator Kerry for bringing up this issue. The fact \nis that there have been outrageous and incredible abuses of the system. \nOn several occasions I talked about some of these abuses on the floor \nof the Senate, and it is part of the Congressional Record of May 25, \n1993. I talked at length about it, as I did several other times.\n\n  Mr. President when people are using campaign money to commission \nartists to paint portraits of their father, thousands of dollars to \ndecorate Senate offices, $6,000 on furniture and picture framing, \n$4,494 for an illuminated globe, resort vacations, and on and on and \non, it is not only an abuse, but it is an outrage.\n  I intend to vote on the majority side to table both of these \namendments. But I say to my Republican colleagues on this side of the \naisle, the reason the American people voted as they did on November 8 \nis that they are fed up with the abuses, such as the personal use of \ncampaign funds, such as frequent flier mileage and frequent traveler \nmileage, going for personal use. These must be addressed.\n  Now, I understand the desire of the majority, and I will accede to \nthe desire of the majority, to table these so that we can get a bill \nthrough Congress.\n  If I had been writing the legislation, I say to my friend from Iowa, \nI would have included these, because they are needed reforms. They are \nthe things which the American people, when they hear about them, are \nsimply outraged, and they are not going to put up with it any longer.\n  So I say to my friends on this side of the aisle, speaking for only \none individual Senator, if these reforms are not brought up in a \nreasonable time, meaning this year, and implemented, I will join with \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle, whose newfound scheme for \nreform I applaud vigorously. But we cannot, by virtue of being in the \nmajority, lull ourselves into a sense of complacency, into believing \nthat issues such as personal use of campaign funds, such as the \npersonal use of frequent flier mileage which is accrued through \nofficial business and used for personal use, are going to be acceptable \nto the American populace. It is not like that anymore.\n  So I strongly urge my colleague from Iowa, who is the manager of this \nbill--and I appreciate his enormous efforts on behalf of this \nlegislation--to give serious consideration to bringing forward \nadditional legislation at the appropriate time, in a timely manner, \nthat addresses these and other issues that are being raised by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  So, Mr. President, I will not go on and on and specify the abuses, \nespecially of the personal use of campaign funds. I did that last year \non several occasions. Those abuses are well known, and they have to \nstop. I think we have to address it very soon.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague from Iowa for his very hard work \non this very important legislation. I look forward to supporting him. \nBut again, we have to address all of these abuses and we have to do it \nsoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to commend the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, Senator Ford, for \nhis efforts in raising this issue and shedding some light on an \ninappropriate practice in which some elected officials have apparently \nbeen engaged.\n  Quite honestly, in my 2 years as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I do \nnot believe we have had a vote that should be so straightforward for \nSenators to case as the vote on this amendment. In fact, this issue and \nthis amendment can be summed up with one question: Should federally \nelected officials, who are well-compensated and receive ample health, \nretirement, and other such benefits, be allowed to take free frequent \nflyer trips at taxpayer expense? Some might suggest that I have just \noversimplified what this issue is about. But I'm not oversimplifying \nthe issue--it is that simple.\n  Mr. President, I am not aware of any public polling on this frequent \nflyer issue. But I am going to make a bold prediction here. Let's say \nyou posed the following choice to 1,000 randomly selected individuals: \nIf federally elected officials earn frequent flyer awards from travel \nthat is paid for with taxpayer dollars, they should use the free travel \naward to: One, take a vacation; or two, save taxpayer dollars by using \nthe award for future official travel expenses. I am willing to predict \nthe vast majority would pick number two.\n  Last night, during debate on this amendment, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] argued that we should not dictate to \nthe House of Representatives what their rules should be. The Senator \nfrom Iowa went on to say that we shouldn't worry about the House \nbecause they were on the verge of making this rule change last August \nand will deal with the issue again.\n  I would like to share the Senator's confidence in the House leaders \non this particular issue, but I am afraid I cannot. The Senator from \nIowa is quite correct when he states that the House came close to \nchanging this rule last August. But it is my understanding that effort, \nled by a freshman Representative, was derailed with the help of the \nthen-minority whip, Mr. Gingrich. If it was possible to prevent this \nmeasure from passing last year while in the minority party, how are we \nto expect Mr. Gingrich to raise this issue in his new position as \nSpeaker of The House?\n  In fact, I recall speaker Gingrich's comments on a Sunday morning \ntelevision program just a few short weeks ago. When pressed on the \nissue of the frequent flyer perk, Mr. Gingrich responded by asserting \nsomething to the effect that if Congress was able to balance the \nbudget, fight crime and reform the welfare system, then people did not \ncare about issues such as the frequent flyer perk.\n  Though I certainly share the Speaker's concern that we must address \nissues such as reducing the Federal budget deficit, I strongly disagree \nwith his view that the American people do not care about reforming the \nCongress and changing the way Washington, DC, does business. People do \ncare about the many perks Members of Congress receive, whether it is \nthe free meals, travel and other gifts that are showered upon Members \nby the lobbying community, or the practice of converting these frequent \nflyer miles earned while traveling on official matters to free vacation \ntrips.\n  The underlying bill, which I support, is an attempt to make Congress \nlive under the same rules as our constituents do. But our constituents \ndo not receive free meals and gifts from lobbyists, and when they go on \nvacation or travel on a personal matter, they pay for it. These are the \nrules by which elected officials should abide. And if these rules are \nright for those in the private sector, and are right for the executive \nbranch, and are right for the U.S. Senate, then they should be right \nfor the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying that I am sensing \nanother partisan vote on this amendment, similar to the vote last week \non the gift\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nban amendment, and that is truly unfortunate. This is certainly not a \npartisan issue. The underlying bill will pass this Chamber with strong \nbipartisan support, and I am disappointed that further efforts to enact \nswift passage of critical reforms of our political system, such as \nbanning gifts and changing the frequent flyer rule for elected \nofficials, has fallen victim to the same partisan wrangling that has \nprevented such reforms from passing in previous years.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to say that I support the substance of both of \nthe amendments that have been offered. But for reasons that are \nsimilar, really, and with the same sense of urgency expressed by my \nfriend and colleague from Arizona and consistent with the position that \nmy friend and partner on this underlying bill, S. 2, the Senator from \nIowa, has stated all along, I will oppose these amendments, as I have \nall other amendments to this bill.\n  Mr. President, we have talked at length about the number of years \nthat people have been working here in Congress to establish the basic \nprinciple of accountability. What I have said here earlier in this \ndebate is kind of a reverse version of the Golden Rule, which is that \nwe should do unto ourselves as we have done unto others for lo these \nmany years, and that is to live by the laws that we imposed on the rest \nof America.\n  Senator Glenn, among those who are here, in my opinion, holds the \nrecord for having started this campaign--perhaps ``crusade'' is a \nbetter term--earlier on in the late 1970's. Senator Grassley has been a \nleading and foremost advocate in recent years. It has been my \nprivilege, over the last several years, to join with them, as a \ncosponsor of this bill with the Senator from Iowa in the last session \nof Congress, and a cosponsor again this year although, as I have \nindicated for the record, in the preceding session of Congress, this \nmeasure was known as the Lieberman-Grassley Act, and in this session it \nis known as the Grassley-Lieberman Act.\n  Whatever the name, the content and the purpose is the same. And it is \nthe long overdue recognition that there is a double standard here that \nis no longer acceptable, that is unfair to our employees, and that \nshields us from the real world experience of understanding the impact \nof our deliberations and our actions on those millions of people out \nthere, particularly small business people, who must live by the laws \nthat we pass.\n  So when this debate began, Mr. President, I made a personal decision \nthat when one considers the length of time that Congress has been \naspiring to pass this measure, when one considers that last year it \nswept, in a bipartisan basis, through the House, I think with perhaps \nfour votes opposed to it, when one considers there seemed to be a \nstrong bipartisan support for this here in this Chamber last year, but \nin the final day or two of the session it was stopped from being taken \nup by the use of a rarely used parliamentary point, I made a judgment \nas this session started that I was going to oppose all amendments to S. \n2, the Congressional Accountability Act, that did not go to the heart \nand substance of this proposal but that were adding on additional \nthoughts, even if one could stretch and construe some connection to the \nbasic purpose of eliminating the double standard in these employment \nand safety laws.\n  It has not been pleasant or easy to sustain this position. Some of \nthese amendments are good amendments. But it seemed to me that--not \nonly because of my personal involvement in this issue and my desire not \nto gum up the works as we move toward adopting it, but also as an \nexpression here at the outset of the session that the support for this \nmeasure is genuinely bipartisan and has always been so and is \nbicameral, and in fact extends to the executive branch of Government, \nwhere President Clinton has consistently over the last couple of years, \nand as recently as the last few days, restated his position strongly \nsupporting the adoption of the Congressional Accountability Act--it \nseemed to me, mindful of the election returns last November and fresh \nfrom my own reelection campaign, in which I heard the people of \nConnecticut certainly clearly saying to me that they do not really care \nthat much anymore about what party label you wear, they care about what \nyou have done or what Congress has done, that they want the nonsense \nand the gridlock to end; they want us to deal with some real problems, \nand they want us to shake up this institution and put some value into \nwhat we are doing here and not get into partisanship.\n  So in that sense, I made the judgment that the best that we could do \nwas to adopt this, to not let anything stand in the way, and hopefully \nget it to the President--get it back to the House, let the House \nreceive it in a form which they could adopt without the need for a \nconference committee--send it to the President, and let us show the \nAmerican people that both parties, both Houses, and the executive and \nthe legislative branch, agree on this basic principle. Let us get it \ndone. If I may paraphrase an earlier great Democratic President, \nPresident Kennedy, who said, ``A rising tide raises all boats,'' part \nof what I am saying here is that a rising tide of accomplishment by \nCongress will, in fact, raise all boats.\n\n  This will not and should not be a partisan achievement, but very much \na victory for principle, a victory for Congress, and a victory for the \nAmerican Government, showing it can quickly and expeditiously do \nsomething right. I wanted to state that on the record to explain why I \nvoted against all previous amendments, why I will vote against these \ntwo amendments, and why I will continue to vote against amendments on \nthis bill, hoping that we can pass this bill tonight or tomorrow and \nget it on its way to becoming the law it ought to be.\n  Mr. President, having stated that, I would like to respond to some of \nthe points that have been made against the bill. I say to the two \nmanagers of the bill, the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Ohio, \nif at any point either Senator would wish to regain the floor, or \nothers come and wish to proceed on their amendments, I will be glad to \nyield upon notification to that affect.\n  Mr. President, some of the arguments made in opposition to S. 2 in \nthe last couple of days are serious ones. I want to respond to them. \nOne argument made goes to the heart of the construct of the bill that \nSenator Grassley, I, and Senator Glenn, in his capacity as chair last \nyear of the Government Affairs Committee, have brought out. The \nargument is that this bill--and forgive the pejorative use of the term, \nan excuse for inaction on this measure for years--this bill represents \na violation or a potential violation of the separation of powers \ndoctrine and the speech or debate clause.\n  I must say to the presiding officer and my colleagues that when I \nfirst arrived here, the first time this measure came up, I inquired why \npeople were opposing it because it seemed pretty sensible that we \nshould live by the same laws we apply to everybody else. The answer I \nheard was the separation of powers doctrine. I remember going back home \nto a town hall meeting and having somebody ask me about the measure, \nand I started to give the separation of powers doctrine response. It \nwas a moment where the more I declared it, the less I believed it, \nremembering that old wisdom that, if you are making a statement that \nyou yourself have trouble believing, you better not make the statement \nand you better reconsider your position.\n  I do not think this is a violation of the separation of powers \ndoctrine. First of all, there is no express separation of powers clause \nin the Constitution. It is important to point that out. This is a \ndoctrine that is said to underlie the structure of the Constitution. In \nfact, there is some obvious strength to that argument. The principle is \nmost visibly seen in the separation of the powers of the three branches \ninto three separate articles respectively. The doctrine is also \ndiscussed in the Federalist Papers, as well as other writings that \ninformed the drafting of the Constitution.\n  The separation of powers doctrine has been the most frequently cited \nconstitutional objection to private rights\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nof action in district court for our employees under this bill, as well \nas executive branch enforcement of the laws. Using this broad-based \nargument, I think, distorts the historical intent of the separation of \npowers doctrine. It is also not an adequate explanation for why we do \nnot apply the laws we adopt to ourselves.\n  The basic idea, it seems to me, is to limit each branch to a certain \nset of powers subject to checks by the other two branches, so that no \none branch can accumulate a level of power that becomes--to use the \nterm that was very much in the mind of the Framers--tyrannical or like \na monarch in its effect on the public or on individual American \ncitizens.\n  The separation of powers principle was envisioned and incorporated \ninto the Constitution by the Framers not explicitly but implicitly with \nthe idea of precluding any one branch of the Federal Government from \nseizing a degree of power that could be used against the people of \nAmerica in a tyrannical fashion without check by the other two branches \nof Government. However, it is clear from Madison's writing in \nFederalist 47 that the separation of powers principle was not designed \nto insulate one branch of the Government or its servants, that is to \nsay, those who serve within that branch of Government, from the rule of \nlaw. That would have been a strange result for those who framed our \nConstitution and were so mindful of not insulating those in power from \nthe rule of law.\n  Indeed, Madison wrote in Federalist 57 that:\n\n       The Congress can make no law which will not have its full \n     operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the \n     great mass of society. This has always been deemed one of the \n     strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers \n     and the people together. It creates between them that \n     communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments of which \n     few governments have furnished examples; but without which \n     every government denigrates into tyranny.\n\n  What a magnificent statement by Madison, resonating with real insight \nand strength through the centuries to this debate on this floor of this \ngreat Chamber today in 1995.\n  Mr. President, in concluding my remarks on this question, I would \nlike to note that it is the speech and debate clause, and that clause \nonly, which provides Members of Congress any immunity whatever from \nprosecution or action by the executive or the judiciary. In the case of \nDavis versus Passman, a 1979 case, the Supreme Court held that while \nthe speech or debate clause does protect Members of Congress from suit \nfor actions which were strictly legislative in function--and I will \ndiscuss in a moment what the Court has defined as ``legislative''--\nspeech or debate immunity is the only source of immunity, not other \nprinciples of separation of powers as well. In short, the broad \nprinciple of separation of powers is meant to protect the people from \nthe Government, not to protect one branch of Government from the other \ntwo, nor to protect Members of Congress from prosecution or suit for \ntheir own misdeeds.\n  Mr. President, at the Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in June \nof last year on this measure, constitutional law professor Nelson Lund \nand our own Senate legal counsel, Michael Davidson, both said, while it \nmay be constitutionally permissible to allow the executive branch to \nenforce employment laws on the legislative branch, this legislation \nrecognizes, as a policy decision, not a constitutional decision, that \nallowing executive enforcement might upset the current balance of power \nbetween the executive and legislative branches.\n  So our goal in creating the independent Office of Compliance within \nthis bill, S. 2, was to avoid, frankly, politically motivated \nenforcement actions by executive branch agencies. One cannot imagine--\nwithout regard, obviously, to the current occupant of the position--a \nSecretary of Labor ordering an OSHA inspection of a Senator's personal \noffice because that Senator had aggravated that Secretary for some \nreason, perhaps by holding oversight hearings on the Department of \nLabor, or perhaps by casting a vote that displeased the Member of the \nCabinet. I think you can see why, on a practical basis, this decision \nwas made to set up the independent Office of Compliance. It is, really, \nmore in deference to the checks and balances principle than to the \nseparation of powers principle.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me speak for a moment about the speech or \ndebate clause immunity which is in article I, section 6, of the \nConstitution.\n  I, frankly, think this provides the most interesting argument against \nexecutive branch enforcement or judicial review. But historically, it \nis important to state the speech and debate clause has been read \nnarrowly by the courts, and our conclusion was that it should not and \ncannot provide Members of Congress with immunity for illegal employment \nactions, for illegal actions in our capacity as employers of those who \nwork for and with us here on Capitol Hill. The speech and debate clause \nsays:\n\n       They--\n\n  The Members of Congress--\n\n     shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the \n     Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at \n     the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and \n     returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in \n     either House, they shall not be questioned in any other \n     Place.\n\n  The origins of speech or debate immunity can be traced to the \nformation of the English Parliament when members of Parliament sought \nto protect themselves from retribution by the monarch for speeches or \nacts in the House of Commons that were viewed as hostile to the crown.\n  Mr. President, in July of last year, the Court of Appeals for the \nD.C. circuit rejected a House Member's speech-or-debate-clause defense \nin a prosecution by the Justice Department. These cases are very \nrecent. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia also \nissued a similar ruling, in the same week last year against a Senator \nsaying the Department of Justice has the power to prosecute violations \nof Senate Rules Committee regulations, even when the Rules Committee \nitself has not concluded that a violation occurred.\n  In the first ruling, the appeals court cited several cases in which \nthe Supreme Court had held that the speech-or-debate clause immunity \nextends only to acts that are ``legislative in nature'' or related to \n``the legislative process.'' The defendant's alleged impropriety, the \nCourt said, ``was not related to a pending bill or to any other \nlegislative matter; it was, instead, the Congressman's defense of his \nhandling of various financial transactions.''\n  So I would say, drawing analogy from these cases and others I could \ncite, it is reasonable to assume that an illegal employment action \nwould not be regarded by the courts as an act that is ``legislative in \nnature.'' In fact, this issue is thoroughly examined in a memo by John \nKillian, senior specialist, American constitutional law, American Law \nDivision at CRS, dated June 4, 1993, in which Mr. Killian writes:\n\n       A persuasive argument can be made that the speech or debate \n     clause does not encompass employment decisions.\n\n  While Mr. Killian prefaces his interpretation by noting that the \nconstitutional text, history, purposes and the judicial precedents are \nnot fully dispositive, ``the text,'' he says, ``as informed by the \ninterpretive judicial decisions does rather strongly suggest that the \ncourts would sustain the validity of the enactment should Congress \nchoose to take the step.''\n  He adds:\n\n       Certainly, an expressed decision made legislatively by \n     Congress that employment decisions of Members can be placed \n     outside coverage of the clause would be a determination by \n     the body most familiar with the issue that should be entitled \n     to special deference by the courts when they are called upon \n     to pass on the question of the validity of congressional \n     coverage under the appropriate statute.\n\n  Of course, this is just common sense that the speech-and-debate \nclause on its face would not seem to be a clause that would make us \nimmune from the impact of the laws we adopt and impose on all other \nemployers when we are acting as employers instead of as Members of the \nCongress involved in legislation.\n  Mr. President, I will go on to another argument that has been made a \ncouple of times here on the floor; and that is that this bill, S. 2, \nwill cost too much money. At times, opponents of congressional \ncompliance have claimed that it would cost billions of dollars to \nimplement and even require the construction of new office buildings. \nThe testimony\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\nthat the Governmental Affairs Committee received last June, as well as \nCBO's analysis of the committee-reported bill, showed that such fears, \nwhile understandable, are unfounded. There is no OSHA space requirement \nfor offices. Indeed, the Architect of the Capitol and the Congressional \nBudget Office both anticipated in their reviews of this legislation \nlittle, if any, additional expense for OSHA compliance.\n  Because this new bill, S. 2, was introduced just last week, we have \nnot had time to receive a formal cost estimate from the CBO. But I \nsuggest to my colleagues that it is fair and reasonable to assume from \nthe CBO estimate of the bill reported by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee in September, since this bill is so close to that bill, that \nthe original cost estimate would prevail for this as well.\n  We also received a cost estimate from CBO on last year's House-passed \nbill as well as the bill reported by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee and the estimates CBO arrived at in both cases were far, far \nlower than anyone expected or thought possible.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I would like to submit for the Record \nthose two cost estimates which I believe the Members may wish to \nperuse, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the estimates were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 3, 1994.\n     Hon. John Glenn,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4822, the \n     Congressional Accountability Act.\n       Enactment of H.R. 4822 would not affect direct spending or \n     receipts. Therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply \n     to the bill.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                     James L. Blum\n                             (For Robert D. Reischauer, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n       Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, October 3, 1994\n\n       1. Bill number: H.R. 4822.\n       2. Bill title: Congressional Accountability Act.\n       3. Bill Status: As ordered reported by the Senate Committee \n     on Governmental Affairs on September 20, 1994.\n       4. Bill Purpose: H.R. 4822 would apply a host of employee \n     protection laws to legislative branch employees and would \n     create an Office of Congressional Fair Employment Practices \n     (OCFEP) to enforce those protections. The board of directors \n     of OCFEP would issue rules to apply the laws to the \n     legislative branch, enforce those rules through inspections, \n     and establish procedures for remedying violations of the \n     rules. Most rules would take effect when the board issues \n     them in final form, unless the House and Senate pass a \n     concurrent resolution that disapproves them. Certain rules \n     that, in effect, create new law would have to be enacted by \n     the Congress and signed into law by the President.\n       In addition, H.R. 4822 lays out a four-step process by \n     which employees can seek, redress if their rights under most \n     of the employee protection laws are violated--counseling, \n     mediation, formal complaint and hearing, and judicial review \n     of the process. As an alternative to a formal complaint and \n     hearing before the OCFEP, the bill would allow employees to \n     take their case to a U.S. district court after the mediation \n     step. The four-step process basically duplicates the process \n     that the Senate already has in place for its employees, and \n     would expand the options available to House employees who \n     currently cannot present their case before an independent \n     hearing board (because House hearing boards have consisted \n     only of House employees) and who have no access to judicial \n     review. Currently, few Congressional employees, and none in \n     the House or Senate, have the option of taking their case to \n     a district court (instead of formal complaint and hearing) as \n     the bill would permit.\n       For certain laws, the bill would provide alternative \n     procedures. For example, for violations of title II of the \n     Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act (OSHA), private citizens and \n     Congressional employees, respectively, could ask the general \n     counsel of OCFEP to investigate. The general counsel, in the \n     case of ADA, could initiate the four-step process, or in the \n     case of OSHA, could issue citations. In neither case could \n     the employees take their complaints to a district court. \n     (Under OSHA, private citizens also may not bring a complaint \n     to court.)\n       If the appropriate entity, whether the OCFEP or district \n     court, finds that an employee's rights were violated, it \n     could enter an order for a remedy for the employee, subject \n     to the availability of funds that may be appropriated by the \n     Congress after enactment of H.R. 4822. The bill would \n     establish separate settlement and award reserve funds in the \n     House and the Senate to pay compensation that may be ordered \n     as part of the remedy, and would authorize the appropriation \n     of amounts necessary to pay compensation as ordered. Such \n     appropriations would be the only source for paying \n     compensation because the bill dictates that no compensation \n     may be paid from the Claims and Judgments Fund in the \n     Treasury.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates \n     that enactment of H.R. 4822 would cost about $1 million in \n     each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and $4 million to $5 \n     million annually thereafter for the new OCFEP, for agency \n     costs of negotiating with employees' bargaining units, and \n     for paying compensation under remedy orders. Applying certain \n     laws, such as the OSHA and the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     (FLSA), to the entire legislative branch could result in some \n     additional costs, but we do not expect such costs to be \n     substantial. To some extent, the amount of such costs would \n     depend on decisions to be made by the OCFEP as to precisely \n     how the laws would apply to legislative branch employees.\n\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n           Office of Congressional Fair Employment Practices\n\n       The primary budgetary impact of H.R. 4822 would stem from \n     creating the new office to implement the employee protection \n     laws throughout the Congress. Based on the costs of the \n     Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices and of the \n     Personnel Appeals Board at the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO), CBO estimates that the OCFEP would cost an additional \n     $1 million in each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996. (The rules \n     implementing all of the laws would be phased in and would be \n     in effect by the end of 1996.) The cost would be relatively \n     small in these years because the office would be evaluating \n     how to apply certain laws to the Congress. In subsequent \n     years, the cost would increase to $2 million to $3 million \n     annually because the office would have to implement \n     enforcement procedures and arrange for OSHA inspections.\n\n                      Settlement and Award Payment\n\n       The bill would authorize the appropriation of such sums as \n     necessary to pay compensation to employees whose rights under \n     H.R. 4822 are violated. Under existing law, if the rights \n     that Congressional employees currently have are violated and \n     the House or Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices \n     orders payment of compensation, the Congress must appropriate \n     funds to make the payment. Otherwise, an employee has no \n     recourse to another mechanism to receive compensation. Based \n     on the limited, recent experience of the House and Senate in \n     paying compensation under existing employee protection laws, \n     CBO expects that total compensation paid to legislative \n     branch employees in some years could be between $0.5 million \n     and $1 million. CBO assumes that the Congress would \n     appropriate the necessary amounts. If the Congress does not \n     appropriate sufficient funds, then there would be no \n     mechanism to provide compensation ordered under the processes \n     provided in the bill.\n\n                   Federal Labor-Management Relations\n\n       H.R. 4822 would extend to all legislative branch employees \n     the same right that the Government Printing Office (GPO), the \n     Library of Congress (LoC), and executive branch employees \n     currently have to organize, form bargaining units, select a \n     union representative, negotiate with employers, and bring \n     grievances to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA). \n     (GAO already negotiates with its employees, but its cases do \n     not go to the FLRA.) If employees in the House, Senate, the \n     Architect, CBO, and the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) \n     were to decide to organize and force their employers to \n     negotiate with various bargaining units, the employers would \n     incur additional staff costs in order to meet their \n     responsibilities under the law. Based on the experience at \n     GPO and LoC, it appears that an agency with several thousand \n     employees could spend $200,000 to $300,000 per year for a \n     lawyer and part of the time of personnel officers who must \n     work with the bargaining units. CBO cannot predict to what \n     extent employees at the affected agencies would decide to \n     take advantage of their opportunity to organize under this \n     law, but even if a few did at each agency, total agency costs \n     could be in the neighborhood of $1 million annually.\n\n                            OSHA Protections\n\n       H.R. 4822 would extend to all legislative branch employees \n     the protections of OSHA, which requires a workplace free from \n     recognized hazards. It is possible that application of OSHA \n     standards could result in additional costs to remedy any \n     violations, but it is likely that many of the major remedial \n     actions would be done in any event.\n       Industrial Settings. Because most existing OSHA standards \n     apply primarily to industrial workplaces, the employees and \n     workplaces most likely affected by the bill would be those of \n     the Architect of the Capitol. The Architect's office has \n     stated in Congressional hearings that it already strives to \n     comport with all relevant standards. The Architect employs \n     several inspectors who visit all workplaces under the \n     Architect's control to identify problems requiring remedy. \n     Over the past several years, the Architect, sometimes with \n     line-item funding direction from\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\n     the Congress, has undertaken many building improvement \n     efforts, such as structural repair and electrical rewiring, \n     in buildings of the House, Senate, and Library of Congress.\n       However, while the Architect might already be identifying \n     big problems, small problems might still arise. In October \n     1992, GAO, at the request of the Congress, reported on \n     violations of numerous OSHA standards by four employers in \n     the legislative branch, including the Architect and the GPO. \n     The employers not only agreed that the violations needed \n     correction, but were able to do so at minimal expense. None \n     needed to request additional funding to remedy the \n     violations. Thus, it appears that the formal application of \n     OSHA standards to the activities of the Architect is unlikely \n     to add significantly to costs that would otherwise be \n     incurred.\n       Office Settings. There are few OSHA standards that apply \n     specifically to an office-type workplace, which is the type \n     of environment most commonly founds in the Congress. For \n     example, there is no OSHA standard guaranteeing employees a \n     minimum amount of space and quiet in which to work (although \n     there is General Services Administration guideline governing \n     the maximum amount of space for executive branch employees so \n     agencies do not consume too much space). Therefore, applying \n     OSHA standards to the House, Senate, and other Congressional \n     entities would not, by itself, necessitate construction of \n     additional Congressional office buildings.\n       The few relevant OSHA standards relate to the proper \n     location and use of wires, extension cords, electrical \n     outlets, file cabinets, and clear walkways to protect \n     employees against tripping, shocks, fires, falling objects, \n     and blocked exits in case of evacuation. Because the \n     Architect does not control the space where these hazards \n     could occur, the rules issued by the board would likely make \n     the employers--Senators, Representatives, committee chairmen, \n     and agency directors--responsible. Complying with these \n     standards probably would require a change in practices rather \n     than significant additional space or cost.\n       Future OSHA standards for office-type workplaces could \n     result in additional costs for the Senate. For example, OSHA \n     is currently preparing regulations for ergonomic office \n     equipment and furniture to protect employees against physical \n     ailments resulting from inadequate lighting and positioning. \n     In the absence of specific standards, CBO has no basis for \n     estimating the cost of providing Congressional employees with \n     furniture that would meet future OSHA requirements.\n\n                            FLSA Protections\n\n       The FLSA requires employers to provide the minimum wage, \n     equal pay, and time-and-one-half for overtime in excess of 40 \n     hours in one week for certain types of employees. H.R. 4822 \n     would require legislative branch employers to pay affected \n     employees according to these standards. But Congressional \n     employers would be allowed to grant compensatory time off \n     (equal to one and a half hours of overtime worked) instead of \n     overtime pay if the employee so chooses in advance of \n     performing the overtime work. This provision would result in \n     some combination of increased spending by Congressional \n     employers because of overtime pay, and increased time off for \n     certain employees who might opt for compensatory time instead \n     of overtime pay. The impact of FLSA ultimately would depend \n     on how the OCFEP defines which employees are to be covered by \n     FLSA and on whether employees would choose overtime pay or \n     compensatory time off. The bill would require the board to \n     issue rules that outline how the protections of the FLSA will \n     apply.\n       If, for example, the board were to issue rules similar to \n     the guidelines issued in 1991 by the Committee on House \n     Administration (FLSA has applied to House employees since \n     1989), then FLSA would probably have little impact on the \n     amount of additional leave employees would be able to take. \n     It appears from the House guidelines and the amount of \n     overtime paid to House employees in recent years (less than \n     $200,000 annually) that most House employees are exempt from \n     FLSA and those who are not exempt do not work much overtime.\n       One group of employees that could potentially receive \n     significant amounts of overtime pay would be the Capitol \n     Police. Under current law, officers receive compensatory time \n     for the first four hours worked in excess of 40 hours and \n     then receive overtime for any additional hours. If all \n     Capitol Police employees opted for overtime pay under FLSA \n     for their first four hours of overtime, spending would \n     increase by about $0.8 million per year. Because some Capitol \n     Police employees are likely to select compensatory time, the \n     amount of additional overtime pay would be less than $0.8 \n     million.\n\n                         Other Applicable Laws\n\n       Some of the laws that H.R. 4822 would apply to the entire \n     legislative branch are laws that already apply to some or all \n     Congressional employers through existing statute or because \n     the employer voluntarily complies. Therefore, they are not \n     likely to result in additional costs. For example, the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title VII of the \n     Civil Rights Act, which prohibit employer discrimination \n     based on disability or race, already apply to the Senate, \n     House, CBO, GAO, GPO, LoC, the Architect, and OTA--entities \n     that employ almost all of the 38,000 legislative branch \n     employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act, which guarantees \n     employees a certain amount of unpaid leave without fear of \n     losing their job in order to care for a new baby or a sick \n     relative, also applies now to all these employers.\n       Other laws apply to some employers now, but would apply to \n     all upon enactment of H.R. 4822. For example, the \n     Rehabilitation Act (which requires the government to contract \n     with vendors that provide employment opportunities for the \n     disabled) only applies to the Senate and the Architect. But \n     because the Rehabilitation Act has been largely superseded by \n     the ADA, which all the employers must already comply with, \n     application of the Rehabilitation Act is not expected to \n     affect employers' practices. The Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act (ADEA) does not apply currently to the House, \n     CBO, and certain employees of the Architect, but the House \n     has adopted a rule that ``personnel actions affecting \n     employment positions in the House . . . shall be made free \n     from discrimination based on . . . age.'' H.R. 4822 would \n     codify this policy. The bill, however, would provide such \n     employees with improved procedures for seeking redress if \n     they experience discrimination because of age (as well as \n     race, color, national origin, religion, sex, or disability). \n     CBO expects that applying the ADEA would not result in \n     significant additional costs.\n       6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       7. Estimated cost to State and local governments: None.\n       8. Estimate comparison: None.\n       9. Previous CBO estimate: On August 2, 1994, CBO prepared a \n     cost estimate for H.R. 4822, as ordered reported by the House \n     Committee on Rules on July 29, 1994. That bill is similar to \n     the Senate version of H.R. 4822, except that in the House \n     version, the Claims and Judgments Fund in the Treasury would \n     be available to pay compensation to remedy violations of \n     employees' rights in the event the Congress does not \n     appropriate sufficient funds. Because, under the House \n     version of H.R. 4822, employees would have a permanent right \n     to be paid compensation, CBO estimated an increase in direct \n     spending of $1 million in 1997 and 1998, which would count \n     for pay-as-you-go purposes. In the Senate version of H.R. \n     4822, employees' right to compensation under a remedy would \n     be limited to amounts that may be appropriated to the House \n     and Senate settlement funds (or to other legislative branch \n     entities). The Claims and Judgments Fund in the Treasury \n     would be unavailable to pay compensation in the event of \n     insufficient appropriations. Therefore, the funding mechanism \n     to pay compensation would be discretionary, not direct \n     spending, and pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       Another difference between the House and Senate versions of \n     H.R. 4822 is that the House version would require that \n     certain employees receive overtime pay under FLSA, resulting \n     in higher outlays for legislative branch agencies, especially \n     the Capitol Police. The Senate version of H.R. 4822 would \n     allow employees to choose between receiving overtime pay, \n     which would increase outlays, or receiving compensatory time, \n     which would give them more time off, but would not increase \n     spending.\n       On August 2, 1994, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     4822, as ordered reported by the Committee on House \n     Administration on July 28, 1994. That version of the bill is \n     nearly identical to H.R. 4822 as ordered reported by the \n     House Committee on Rules.\n       On June 30, 1994, CBO prepared a cost estimate for S. 1824, \n     as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Rules and \n     Administration on June 9, 1994. That bill is different from \n     the Senate version of H.R. 4822 because it would cover only \n     Senate employees and because it would only apply OSHA and \n     FLSA to the Senate. H.R. 4822 would apply these two laws, as \n     well as six others, to the entire legislative branch and \n     would create a consistent procedure to enforce the laws \n     equally for all legislative branch employees. CBO has \n     estimated a higher cost for H.R. 4822 than for S. 1824.\n       10. Estimate prepared by: James Hearn.\n       11. Estimate approved by: C.G.

Reischauer.\n       Enclosure.\n\n       Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, August 2, 1994\n\n       1. Bill number: H.R. 4822.\n       2. Bill title: Congressional Accountability Act.\n       3. Bill status: As ordered reported by the Committee on \n     House Administration on July 28, 1994.\n       4. Bill purpose: H.R. 4822 would apply to a host of \n     employee protection laws to legislative branch employees and \n     would create an Office of Compliance to enforce those \n     protections. The office would issue regulations to\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\n     apply to the legislative branch, enforce those regulations \n     through inspections, and establish procedures for remedying \n     violations of the regulations. Further, the board of \n     directors of the office would have to prepare a study on \n     whether any other laws affecting employees ought to apply to \n     the legislative branch, and then would issue regulations \n     specifying the way in which such laws would apply. The \n     regulations would take effect 60 days after the board issues \n     them in final form unless the House and Senate pass a \n     concurrent resolution that disapproves them.\n       In addition, H.R. 4822 lays out a four-step process by \n     which employees can seek redress if their rights under the \n     laws are violated--counseling, mediation, formal complaint \n     and hearing, and judicial review of the process. As an \n     alternative to the formal complaint and hearing before the \n     Office of Compliance, the bill would allow employees to take \n     their case to U.S. district court after the mediation step. \n     The four-step process basically duplicates the process that \n     the Senate already has in place for its employees, and would \n     expand the options available to House employees who currently \n     cannot present their case before an independent hearing board \n     (because House hearing boards have consisted only of House \n     employees) and who have no access to judicial review. \n     Currently, few Congressional employees, and none in the House \n     or Senate, have the option of taking their case to district \n     court (instead of formal complaint and hearing) as the bill \n     would permit.\n       If the hearing board or district court finds that an \n     employee's rights were violated, it may enter an order for a \n     remedy for the employee. The bill would establish separate \n     funds in the House and the Senate to pay compensation that \n     may be ordered by the remedy.\n       5. Estimated cost to the Federal Government: CBO estimates \n     that enactment of H.R. 4822 would cost about $1 million in \n     each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996, and $4 million to $5 \n     million annually thereafter for the new Office of Compliance, \n     for additional overtime pay for officers of the Capitol \n     Police, and for agency costs of negotiating with employees' \n     bargaining units. Applying certain laws, such as the \n     Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), to the entire legislative branch could \n     result in some additional costs, but we do not expect such \n     costs to be substantial. To some extent, the amount of such \n     costs would depend on decisions to be made by the Office of \n     Compliance as to precisely how the laws would apply to \n     legislative branch employees.\n\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n                          Office of Compliance\n\n       The direct budgetary impact of H.R. 4822 would stem from \n     creating the new office to implement the employee protection \n     laws throughout the Congress. Based on the costs of the \n     Senate Office of Fair Employment Practices and of the \n     Personnel Appeals Board at the General Accounting Office \n     (GAO), CBO estimates that the Office of Compliance would cost \n     about $1 million in each of fiscal years 1995 and 1996. The \n     cost would be relatively small in these years because the \n     office would be evaluating whether and how to apply certain \n     laws to the Congress. In subsequent years, the cost would \n     increase to $2 million to $3 million annually because the \n     office would have to implement enforcement procedures and \n     arrange for OSHA inspections.\n\n                            OSHA Protections\n\n        H.R. 4822 would extend to all legislative branch employees \n     the protections of OSHA, which requires a workplace free from \n     recognized hazards. It is possible that application of OSHA \n     standards could result in additional costs to remedy any \n     violations, but it is likely that many of the major remedial \n     actions would be done in any event.\n       Industrial Settings. Because most existing OSHA standards \n     apply primarily to industrial workplaces, the employees and \n     workplaces most likely affected by the bill would be those of \n     the Architect of the Capitol. The Architect's office has \n     stated in Congressional hearings that it already strives to \n     comport with all relevant standards. The Architect employs \n     several inspectors who visit all workplaces under the \n     Architect's control to identify problems requiring remedy. \n     Over the past several years, the Architect, sometimes with \n     line-item funding direction from the Congress, has undertaken \n     many building improvement efforts, such as structural repair \n     and electrical rewiring, in buildings of the House, Senate, \n     and Library of Congress.\n       However, while the Architect might already be identifying \n     big problems, small problems might still arise. In October \n     1992, GAO, at the request of the Congress, reported on \n     violations of numerous OSHA standards by four employers in \n     the legislative branch, including the Architect and \n     Government Printing Office (GPO). The employers not only \n     agreed that the violations needed correction, but were able \n     to do so at minimal expense. None needed to request \n     additional funding to remedy the violations. Thus, it appears \n     that the formal application of OSHA standards to the \n     activities of the Architect is unlikely to add significantly \n     to costs that would otherwise be incurred.\n       Office Settings. There are few OSHA standards that apply \n     specifically to an office-type workplace, which is the type \n     of environment most commonly found in the Congress. For \n     example, there is no OSHA standard guaranteeing employees a \n     minimum amount of space and quiet in which to work (although \n     there is a General Services Administration guideline \n     governing the maximum amount of space for executive branch \n     employees so agencies do not consume too much space). \n     Therefore, applying OSHA standards to the House, Senate, and \n     other Congressional entities would not, by itself, \n     necessitate construction of additional Congressional office \n     buildings.\n       The few relevant OSHA standards relate to the proper \n     location and use of wires, extension cords, electrical \n     outlets, file cabinets, and clear walkways to protect \n     employees against tripping, shocks, fires, falling objects, \n     and blocked exits in case of evacuation. Because the \n     Architect does not control the space where these hazards \n     could occur, the regulations issued by the Office of \n     Compliance would likely make the employers--Senators, \n     Representatives, committee chairmen, and agency directors--\n     responsible. Complying with these standards probably would \n     require a change in practices rather than significant \n     additional space.\n       Future OSHA standards for office-type workplaces could \n     result in additional costs for the Senate. For example, OSHA \n     is currently preparing regulations for ergonomic office \n     equipment and furniture to protect employees against physical \n     ailments resulting from inadequate lighting and positioning. \n     In the absence of specific standards, CBO has no basis for \n     estimating the cost of providing Congressional employees with \n     furniture that would meet future OSHA requirements.\n\n                            FLSA Protections\n\n       The FLSA requires employers to provide the minimum wage, \n     equal pay, and time-and-one-half for overtime in excess of 40 \n     hours in one week. The impact of FLSA on the appropriated \n     accounts that pay salaries and expenses for Congressional \n     employees ultimately would depend on how the Office of \n     Compliance defines which employees are to be covered by FLSA. \n     The bill would require the office to issue regulations that \n     outline how the protections of the FLSA will apply.\n       If, for example, the office were to issue regulations \n     similar to the regulations issued in 1991 by the Committee on \n     House Administration (FLSA has applied to House employees \n     since 1989), then FLSA would probably have little budgetary \n     impact. It appears from the House regulations and the amount \n     of overtime paid to House employees in recent years (less \n     than $200,000 annually) that most House employees are exempt \n     from FLSA and those who are not exempt do not work much \n     overtime. (We do not know whether the result would be \n     different if the Office of Compliance were to adopt the \n     Department of Labor's regulations that apply FLSA to the \n     private sector and to state and local governments.)\n       One group of employees most likely to receive additional \n     overtime pay under any set of regulations is the Capitol \n     Police. Under current law, officers receive compensatory time \n     for the first four hours worked in excess of 40 hours and \n     then receive overtime for any additional hours. Applying FLSA \n     to the Capitol Police would result in overtime pay for the \n     first four hours of overtime as well, amounting to an \n     estimated $0.8 million per year.\n\n                   Federal Labor-Management Relations\n\n       H.R. 4822 would extend to all legislative branch employees \n     the same right that GPO, the Library of Congress (LoC), and \n     executive branch employees currently have to organize, form \n     bargaining units, select a union representative, negotiate \n     with employers, and bring grievances to the Federal Labor \n     Relations Authority (FLRA). (GAO already negotiates with its \n     employees, but its cases do not go to the FLRA.) If employees \n     in the House, Senate, the Architect, CBO, and the Office of \n     Technology Assessment (OTA) were to decide to organize and \n     force their employers to negotiate with various bargaining \n     units, the employers would incur additional staff costs in \n     order to meet their responsibilities under the law. Based on \n     the experience at GPO and LoC, it appears that an agency with \n     several thousands of employees could spend $200,000 to \n     $300,000 per year for a lawyer and part of the time of \n     personnel officers who must work with the bargaining units. \n     CBO cannot predict to what extent employees at the affected \n     agencies would decide to take advantage of their opportunity \n     to organize under this law, but even if a few did at each \n     agency, total agency costs could be in the neighborhood of $1 \n     million annually. Other Applicable Laws.\n       Some of the laws that H.R. 4822 would apply to the entire \n     legislative branch are laws that already apply to some or all \n     Congressional employers through existing statute or because \n     the employer voluntarily complies. Therefore, they are not \n     likely to result in additional costs. For example, the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title VII of the \n     Civil Right Act, which prohibit employer discrimination based \n     on disability or race, already apply to the Senate, House, \n     CBO, GAO, GPO, LoC, the Architect, and OTA--entities that \n     employ almost all of the 38,000 legislative branch employees. \n     The Family and Medical Leave Act, which guarantees employees \n     a certain amount of unpaid leave without fear of losing their \n     job in order to care for a new baby or a sick relative, also \n     applies now to all these employers.\n       Other laws apply to some employers now, but would apply to \n     all upon enactment of H.R. 4822. For example, the \n     Rehabilitation Act (which requires the government to contract \n     with vendors that provide employment\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\n     opportunities for the disabled) only applies to the Senate \n     and the Architect. But because the Rehabilitation Act has \n     been largely superseded by the ADA, which all the employers \n     must already comply with, application of the Rehabilitation \n     Act is not expected to affect employers' practices. The Age \n     Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) does not apply \n     currently to the House, CBO, and certain employees of the \n     Architect, but the House has adopted a rule that ``personnel \n     actions affecting employment positions in the House . . . \n     shall be made free from discrimination based on . . . age.'' \n     H.R. 4822 would codify this policy. The bill, however, would \n     provide such employees with improved procedures for seeking \n     redress if they experience discrimination because of age (as \n     well as race, color, national origin, religion, sex, or \n     disability). CBO expects that applying the ADEA would not \n     result in significant additional costs.\n       Finally, some laws that would apply under H.R. 4822 are not \n     currently followed by any Congressional employer. The Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which requires \n     employers to give employees certain notice and job placement \n     assistance before closing down a workplace, is not expected \n     to have a significant effect, budgetary or otherwise, on \n     Congressional employers because no mass layoffs are \n     anticipated. The Employee Polygraph Protection Act, which \n     forbids employers from using polygraphs on their employees \n     (except when required by the federal government to protect \n     national security), does not now apply to any legislative \n     branch entity. Because Congressional employers do not now use \n     polygraphs for employees, prohibiting this practice is not \n     likely to have any effect.\n       6. Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts through 1998. CBO estimates that enactment of H.R. \n     4822 could affect direct spending. Thus, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply to the bill.\n       The bill would allow a hearing board or a district court, \n     depending on which forum the employee has taken the case, to \n     order a remedy that could include compensation. The bill \n     would establish separate funds in the House and the Senate to \n     pay such compensation (the Senate already has such a fund; \n     the House does not), but it does not authorize an \n     appropriation to the funds nor does it explicitly provide \n     spending authority for the funds. Further, the bill appears \n     to say that all compensation orders, regardless of which \n     legislative entity the employee works for, may be paid from \n     one of the House and Senate funds. The bill does not say what \n     would happen if the affected employer or the two compensation \n     funds do not have sufficient appropriations to pay the \n     compensation. Because the existing Claims and Judgments Fund \n     in the Treasury is available under current law to make \n     payments as ordered by the courts in cases where agencies do \n     not have a source of funding for the payment, it is possible \n     that successful claimants under H.R. 4822 could begin to \n     receive payments from the Claims and Judgments Fund. However, \n     it is unclear what would be the ultimate source of \n     compensation because the bill does not explicitly identify a \n     funding mechanism. CBO expects that the total of such \n     compensation paid to legislative branch employees in some \n     years could be between $0.5 million and $1 million. If paid \n     from the Claims and Judgments Fund, these payments would \n     constitute direct spending. The following table summarizes \n     the estimated pay-as-you-go impact of this bill.\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1994   1995   1996   1997   1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays....................      0      0      0      1      1\nChange in receipts...................

Estimated cost to State and local governments: None.\n       8. Estimate comparison: None.\n       9. Previous CBO estimate: On June 30, 1994, CBO prepared a \n     cost estimate for S. 1824, as ordered reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Rules and Administration on June 9, 1994. That \n     bill is different from H.R. 4822 because it would cover only \n     Senate employees and because it would only apply OSHA and \n     FLSA to the Senate. H.R. 4822 would apply these two laws, as \n     well as seven others, to the entire legislative branch and \n     would create a consistent procedure to enforce the laws \n     equally on all legislative branch employees. CBO has \n     estimated a larger cost for H.R. 4822 than for S. 1824.\n       On August 2, 1994, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     4822, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Rules on \n     July 29, 1994. Because that version of the bill is nearly \n     identical to H.R. 4822 as ordered reported by the Committee \n     on House Administration, CBO's estimate of the cost of the \n     two bills is the same.\n       10. Estimate prepared by: James Hearn.\n       11. Estimate approved by: C.G. Nuckols, Assistant Director \n     for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, CBO estimated that both versions, the \nHouse-passed last year and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, \nquite similar to S. 2 before us now, would cost about $1 million for \nthe first 2 years in effect as the office gears up and $4 to $5 million \nin the third, fourth, and fifth years. Much of the cost expected in \nfiscal years 1997 and 1998 is the cost of working out collective \nbargaining agreements. So once the cost of that is taken care of, the \noverall pricetag should dip back down by the beginning of the second 5-\nyear budgetary cycle.\n  When you look at the total cost figures, I think you also have to \nrealize that the Senate and House offices of the existing Fair \nEmployment Practices Office, which would be supplanted, would be \nreplaced by the independent Office of Compliance created by this bill, \nwill cost almost $1.2 million in this fiscal year, so that the marginal \ncost of the bills considered here is even less.\n  Mr. President, there was some indication on the floor yesterday that \nthe Senate Rules Committee has found the administrative hearing system \ncreated for the Senate by the Government Employees Rights Act to be \nextremely expensive and that this bill would further increase that \nexpense.\n  I hope that my colleagues on the Rules Committee will agree that the \nbulk of the costs involved in the administrative hearing process lies \nin the fact that the GERA, the Government Employees Rights Act, \nrequires three hearing officers to hear any one case. When we drafted \nthis bill, S. 2, and gave employees the right to bring original civil \nactions in Federal district court, we recognized that the \nadministrative hearing process could be streamlined because it would no \nlonger be the only legal recourse for an employee to use in addressing \ngrievances that that employee felt he or she had.\n  Therefore, we create in this bill, S. 2, an administrative hearing \nsystem that only requires one hearing officer to hear any case. That \nsurely will reduce the cost of holding any hearing by 67 percent, one \nhearing officer as opposed to three. I think that my colleagues who \nraise concerns about the costs of the current administrative hearing \nsystem under the Government Employees Rights Act will recognize this \nchange--I hope they will --as a significant cost-saving measure.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to urge my colleagues to \nconsider the estimated cost of last year's bill in its most expensive \nyear, fiscal year 1998, as a percentage of the legislative branch's \nannual budget. For fiscal year 1998, which would have been the fourth \nyear in effect if the bill had been enacted last year, Congress' budget \nwill probably be in the neighborhood of $2.5 billion. Even if this bill \ndid cost $5 billion in fiscal year 1998 as a percentage of Congress' \ntotal operating budget for that year, it would only amount to one-fifth \nof 1 percent--one-fifth of 1 percent--which is surely not too much to \npay to, first, guarantee our employees that they have the same rights \nas every other employee in America working for private business and, \nsecond, for us to adopt the principle of living in the real world, of \ngetting rid of the double standard and of understanding in our own \ncapacity as employers the impact of the laws that we adopt on every \nother employer in America.\n  Because this bill makes very few substantive changes from last year's \nSenate bill, I think it is entirely reasonable to expect that CBO will \nprovide a similarly low score for S. 2, and we can then also assume \nthat the cost of the bill, in its most expensive year, will be an \nequally small percentage of the legislative branch budget. That really \nis not too much to ask.\n  Finally, there is in this another principle which is that we should \nimpose the same laws on ourselves as we do on everybody else because \npresumably, if we adopt them, we believe they are good laws, that they \nmake sense, that they embrace values that we hold to be real and \nimportant for our country.\n  We should pass this bill with strong enforcement, including the right \nfor claims to be heard in court, because we believe the laws we have \npassed are right. By passing this bill, therefore, we not only get rid \nof the double standard and create equity in reality, but we also \ndemonstrate a commitment to the underlying values that we have adopted \nin these bills.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me just put out a general call here for \nthose who may have amendments to this bill. We do have time. We have \nhandled several this morning. The votes on those will be stacked until \nthis afternoon after our 2:15 end of the respective party conferences. \nWe will vote on those after that.\n  I think the distinguished floor manager on the Republican side was \ngoing to propound a UC on that at the appropriate time, on how we will \ngo through the votes, so people will know what to expect. Let me just \nsay, on the Democratic side we are the only ones who have amendments \nleft on this bill. For those watching in the offices, or for Senators \nor staffs who may be listening, I encourage them to get over right now \nwhen we have some time here. We have about another hour before we break \nfor our conference lunches. Get over here and get the amendments taken \ncare of.\n  I heard the majority leader in the opening this morning state we are \ngoing to go on this bill until it is done tonight with all the \namendments. That puts the heat on our side of the aisle to get the \namendments over here and get them taken care of.\n  So I ask staffs and Senators, if they have amendments, let us not \nwait until 10 or 11 o'clock tonight to bring them up. Let us get them \nover here while we have time right now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, am I correct that the Leahy amendment is \npending before this body?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The amendment by the Senator from Vermont is a very \nshort amendment.\n  I will read one sentence that is in the amendment:\n\n       ``No congressional organization or organization affiliated \n     with the Congress may request that any current or prospective \n     employee fill out a questionnaire or similar document in \n     which the person's views on organizations or policy matters \n     are requested.''\n\n  Of course, this amendment is not germane to this legislation. That is \nobvious, as most of the amendments we have been dealing with.\n  The congressional accountability act is designed to make sure that \nCongress lives under the same laws that we impose upon the private \nsector. The private sector does not live under the law that the Senator \nfrom Vermont seeks to impose on Congress, because a private sector \nemployer may ask prospective employees about their political views.\n  To be sure, the private sector does not ask these questions very \noften. Political views are normally irrelevant to the performance of \njob duties as a brick layer, or a secretary, or an airline pilot. Of \ncourse, it may even be poor judgment and poor public relations for any \nprivate sector business to ask such a question. But they are looking \nfor people to perform their jobs. They do not care whether they hire \nRepublicans, Democrats, Independents, or anything else. But the point \nis that it is legal for a private sector employer to ask those \nquestions on political views if they want to. The Leahy amendment would \nprohibit organizations affiliated with Congress from asking the same \nquestion of prospective employees.\n  I spoke about the private sector, but in the political and Government \narena there are varying rules about whether or not this is a legitimate \nquestion. Civil service employees and certain other governmental \nemployees cannot be hired or fired for their political views. These \ntend to be nonpolitical employees who perform nonpolitical Government \njobs. These employees have the first amendment right to hold any \npolitical views. In one famous case, a protected employee could not be \nfired for saying, ``I hope he dies.'' That statement was made when she \nlearned of President Reagan being shot in March of 1981. However, the \nrules are different for political employees in both the legislative and \nexecutive branches. Rules that might apply to political views in the \nexecutive branch may not hold in regard to inquiry into that point for \nemployees of the legislative branch. Under their constitutional duties, \nit is quite obvious that the President and Members of Congress must be \nable to hire people philosophically sympathetic to their agendas. \nPersonnel is policy.\n  When President Clinton fills a position that is a political \nappointment, the applicant is asked his or her political views. \nWhenever any Members of this body hires a legislative staff member, we \nask about their views. That is totally appropriate. That does not mean \nthat we practice any form of McCarthyism. If we properly do that as \nindividuals, then, of course, it seems reasonable to me that \norganizations--the very same organizations that would be prohibited by \nthe Leahy amendment--which we join to help us in doing our jobs act \nproperly if they choose to ask prospective employees about their \npolitical views. Members of these organizations are entitled to know \nthe views of potential employees. Members who rely upon the \norganizations of Congress to submit potential employees are entitled to \nknow if that employee would be compatible with the legislative agenda \nof the Member.\n  The amendment, however, offered by the Senator from Vermont overlooks \nthe essential political requirements of service on Capitol Hill. And it \nis peculiar, because it would ban employees from completing \nquestionnaires on their views, but it would not affect oral \nquestioning. I do not know whether that is an oversight or not. It \nwould not allow questioning to be asked on a form, but you could have \nthe same questions asked orally. Thus, the amendment would not address, \nin any real way, the problems--if there is a problem. I do not see it \nas a problem, but the Senator from Vermont does. It does not, in any \npractical way, address what he wants to accomplish. He wants to make \nsure there is not some sort of litmus test for the hiring of employees \non Capitol Hill. So he says you cannot ask questions on the \nquestionnaire, but you can ask these questions orally. Moreover, I feel \nthat inquiring about a congressional employee's political view is not \nin any way a horror. In fact, it is very vital to the functioning of \nthe institution.\n  In short, the amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont should be \nrejected. It has nothing to do with congressional coverage. It would \nharm the ability of Members to do what they were elected to do, and it \nwould not accomplish its stated objective. So I urge that it be \nrejected.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, Madison in the Federalist No. 53 states, in \npart, as follows:\n\n       No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an \n     upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of \n     knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate. A part \n     of this knowledge may be acquired by means of information \n     which lie within the compass of men in private as well\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\n     as public stations. Another part can only be attained, or at \n     least thoroughly attained, by actual experience in the \n     station which requires the use of it.\n\n  In the same Federalist paper, Madison writes as follows:\n\n       A few of the members, as happens in all such assemblies, \n     will possess superior talents; will, by frequent reelections, \n     become members of long standing; will be thoroughly masters \n     of the public business, and perhaps not unwilling to avail \n     themselves of those advantages. The greater the proportion of \n     new members and the less the information of the bulk of the \n     members, the more apt will they be to fall into the snares \n     that may be laid for them.\n\n  Mr. President, I speak today of a Senator who has demonstrated \nsuperior talents, a Senator with 22 years of experience in this body--\nMadison, having referred to men of ``superior talents'' and also to the \nadvantages of ``experience''--and Bennett Johnston is that man of whom \nI speak.\n  There is no department of public life in which the test of man's \nability is more severe than service in this body. Little deference is \npaid to reputation previously acquired or to eminent performances won \nelsewhere. What a man accomplishes in this Chamber, he does so by sheer \nforce of his own character and ability. It is here that one must be \nprepared to answer for the many talents or for the single talent \ncommitted to his charge.\n  Bennett Johnston came to this body 22 years ago as a man of many \ntalents. He did not wrap his talents in a napkin or hide them in the \nearth, as both Luke the Physician and Matthew make reference, but he \nput them to use that they might bear increase for his State, for his \ncountry, for the Senate, and for his fellow man. He has proved himself \nto be a superior legislator. I have served with him these 22 years on \nthe Committee on Appropriations. He has proved himself to be a man with \ncourage, with vision, with conviction, a man who is diligent in his \nwork and faithful to his oath of office.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations during the \nlast 6 years, I found him always to be conscientious and a man of his \nword. Fully aware of the admonition by Polonius that ``those friends \nthou hast and their adoption tried, grapple them to thy soul with hoops \nof steel,'' it is with pride that I call Bennett Johnston friend. It is \nwith sincere sadness that I have heard of his decision and I regret \nthat, with the passing of these final 2 years of his term, the Senate \nwill have witnessed the departure of one who has effectively toiled \nhere in its vineyards and who has earned the respect and admiration of \nhis colleagues. The people of the State of Louisiana chose well when, \nby the exercise of their franchise, they sent him here. Someone will be \nselected to take his place, just as someone will, in due time, stand in \nthe place of each of us here.\n  After he lays down the mantle of service, we shall feel the same \nrevolution of the seasons, and the same Sun and Moon will guide the \ncourse of our year. The same azure vault, bespangled with stars, will \nbe everywhere spread over our heads. But I shall miss him, just as I \nknow others will miss Bennett Johnston. Other opportunities will come \nto him, other horizons will stretch out before him, and he will sail \nhis ship on other seas.\n  Erma and I will miss Bennett and Mary, but the memories of these past \nyears during which we have been blessed to render service together to \nthe Nation will always linger in our hearts.\n  I think of lines by Longfellow as being appropriate for this \noccasion:\n\n     I shot an arrow into the air;\n     It fell to earth I knew not where,\n     For so swiftly it flew, the sight\n     Could not follow it in its flight.\n\n     I breathed a song into the air;\n     It came to earth, I knew not where,\n     For who has sight so swift, so strong\n     That if can follow the flight of song?\n\n     Long, long afterwards, in an oak,\n     I found the arrow still unbroke,\n     And the song, from beginning to end,\n     I found again in the heart of a friend.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the situation is that we are now on the \nFord amendment, as amended by the McConnell amendment. Then we have, I \nbelieve, four other amendments that can be voted on immediately, if the \nauthors of those amendments are done with their discussion, and I hope \nthe authors of those amendments are done with discussion.\n  I would like to ask the Democratic manager if we can move forward \nthen on the Ford amendment for adoption of the amendment by voice vote. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the Ford amendment, \nand I would ask that we go to the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, the pending business is the Wellstone \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Ford amendment.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside \nthe Ford amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\n\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 9\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, now the pending amendment is the Wellstone \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not want to get into a quarrel with my \ngood friend from Minnesota.\n  I indicated on the Senate floor that there will be gift ban \nlegislation, as well as lobbying reform legislation. I do not know \nprecisely the date. I would hope that the majority leader, in effect, \ngives his word to our colleagues; or the minority leader gives his word \nto our colleagues on this side of the aisle, and that they would accept \nthat in good faith.\n  I just think that this sense-of-the-Senate amendment does not add \nanything. We believe there should be gift ban legislation. We may want \nto make some changes. We are in the process of looking at lobbying \nreform, gift ban. I would hope that my colleague from Minnesota would \nnot press the amendment. If he insists, I would have no alternative but \nto move to table the amendment. I indicated last week, and I think the \nSenator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, indicated we will be doing \nperhaps not precisely what the Senator from Minnesota may wish, but if \nnot, he can amend it when it comes to the floor. I wish he would at \nleast express enough confidence in us in the first week that we do keep \nour word.\n  If I fail to do that, I certainly would not quarrel with coming back \nagain with another amendment. I do not see any real purpose in pursuing \nthis. In the interest of time, if the Senator persists in the \namendment, I move to table and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether I could just respond \nfor a brief moment to the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I withhold my request.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I very much appreciate what the majority \nleader said. This morning I did make it clear that I knew the majority \nleader had made a commitment to bringing this up and talked about May \n31 being the original date that we wanted this to be effective.\n  I take the majority leader's word very seriously. I think he is a \nleader of his word. Second of all, I know that the majority leader had \nsaid last week that there would be some additional work that might be \ndone. This does not spell out the specifics of what the comprehensive \ngift ban legislation would be, but it says we should consider it no \nlater than May 31.\n  I want to make it clear that I have no quarrel with the majority \nleader whatever. This amendment is not about that. What this amendment \nis, is an amendment to put the Senate on record. Since I have been \nworking on this for several years I just thought it would be important \nfor the Senate to be on record essentially confirming what the majority \nleader has said. That way I know as a Senator that we will all be \nbehind what the majority leader has already proposed.\n  I would like to have in that spirit, not in a personal quarrel \nwhatever, a vote on this, and I would hope that the majority leader \nwould support me. I think we are all in agreement. It just puts the \nSenate on record behind what the majority leader has already \nrecommended.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Again, it is our intent to try to move as quickly as we can. I am not \ncertain about any date. I am not certain it will be May 31. It could be \nbefore, maybe after May 31. It does seem to me that we should be given \nthat opportunity. If we do not produce something around May 31, \nobviously, the Senator from Minnesota and a number of others, some on \nthis side, would be offering maybe the same amendment.\n  In view of the fact that we have not had any hearings on it this \nyear, we have new Members of the Senate, I think they will all support \na gift ban.\n  I might add, I would rather be given some latitude in setting the \nagenda and setting when we might schedule this for debate.\n  Therefore, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there any objection to the request?\n  Mr. LEAHY. What was the request? I did not hear the request, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will make this very brief. I think most \nMembers are in the Chamber, and I know they want to get to a vote. In \n20 years here, I can count on how they might vote.\n  I would really urge Senators to think carefully about voting to \ntable. This is basically saying that we are not going to allow \nourselves to set up the kind of political litmus test that nobody in \nprivate business would be allowed to do. This does not stop any Senator \nfrom saying I do not want to hire somebody because I do not feel \nideologically compatible with him or her.\n  But what it is saying is when you go and just put your people into a \ngeneral overall pool of available staff members you do not have to go \ndown through the kind of things that asks you to rate everything from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union and Common Cause to the National \nRifle Association and\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nUnited Nations, rate everybody from Al Gore to Bob Dole as the study \ncommittee's grading was. Can you imagine if somebody at IBM was saying \nbefore we even consider your application where do you stand with the \nSierra Club or the National Rifle Association, or where do you stand \nwith Planned Parenthood or with Right to Life? There would be a hue and \ncry.\n  We should not do the same thing here. It is an outrageous mistake. \nBut if we are going to apply the same laws to ourselves as is applied \nto everybody else, they should be so applied.\n  I told my good friend from Iowa I would be brief. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Ford \namendment be set aside to provide time for this vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, it may be that the Leahy amendment has a \ngreat deal of merit. Let me say again that the House passed this bill \nafter 20 minutes of debate by a vote of 429 to zero. This is our fourth \nday on this same bill to cover Congress as we cover every other \nbusiness in America. And I do not quarrel with that we have not raised \nany objection to any amendments or taken too much time. No cloture has \nbeen filed or anything of that kind. It may be that sometime later this \nyear when we get around to congressional reform there would be an \nappropriate amendment.\n  But I hope that my colleagues will join me in tabling the amendment \nat this point so we can finish this bill without amendments. This may \nbe a good amendment. I am not going to pass judgment on it because I \nhave great respect for the Senator from Vermont. But since I do not \nfully understand it and I am not certain how many others do, since we \nwill have congressional reform legislation before us, I move to table \nthe amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 12.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC. 508. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING ADOPTION OF SIMPLIFIED \n                   AND STREAMLINED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES FOR \n                   SENATE ACQUISITIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration of the Senate should review the rules \n     applicable to purchases by Senate offices to determine \n     whether they are consistent with the acquisition \n     simplification and streamlining laws enacted in the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 104-355).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment for myself \nand Senator Levin that I believe is acceptable to both sides. I thank \nthe distinguished managers of the bill, Senator Grassley and Senator \nGlenn, and the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate \nRules Committee, Senator Stevens and Senator Ford, for this assistance \nwith this amendment.\n  Last year, Congress enacted a bipartisan bill to put an end to \nantiquated and expensive procurement rules that governed the way \nFederal agencies buy goods and services. The Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act of 1994, spearheaded by the distinguished Senator from \nOhio, Senator Glenn and the distinguished Senator from Delaware, \nSenator Roth, repealed or modified more than 225 outdated laws. The \ngoal of the legislation was simplification, and much to the credit of \nSenators Roth and Glenn, it is being realized today.\n  Already, dozens of Federal agencies are changing the way they do \nbusiness. They are functioning like cost-conscious private businesses, \ngetting rid of old rules that, more often than not, led to ``spending \nmillions to save thousands and thousands to save hundreds.''\n  In the Senate, our offices may not spend millions to save thousands, \nbut I would bet that we often spend ``hundreds to save tens'' and \n``tens to save pennies.'' Take my office in Santa Fe, NM, for example. \nWhen my staff runs out of staples, how do they purchase refills? The \nlogical, economical course of action would be to run over to \nWoolworths, only two blocks way. But under our interpretation of \ncurrent Senate regulations, they cannot do that. Senate rules prohibit \nit. Instead, my New Mexico staff must call my office here in \nWashington; a member of my staff here must make a purchase from the \nSenate; then he or she must ship the staples to Santa Fe. The cost of a \n$1.50 box of staples just rose to at least $10.\n  The same antiquated and expensive rules apply to purchases of paper, \nenvelopes, pens, clocks, computers, and teleconferencing equipment--\nvirtually everything a small office needs to function day-to-day. I \nbelieve it is time to put an end this costly practice.\n  S. 2, which is before us today, provides the ideal opportunity. \nToday, while we are taking action to make other laws applicable to the \nlegislative branch, we should do the responsible, economical thing and \nmake the cost-saving goal of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \napplicable to the U.S. Senate.\n  My amendment would help us accomplish this task in a short and \nstraightforward manner. The amendment simply expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Senate Rules Committee should review rules applicable \nto purchases by Senate offices to determine whether they are consistent \nwith the acquisition simplification and streamlining laws enacted in \nthe Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994.\n  I believe this amendment will help bring simplified, cost-effective \npurchasing procedures to all Senate offices. In the end, everyone from \nSenate staff to America's working families will benefit from the cost-\nsavings we can achieve. Again, I thank the distinguished managers of \nthe bill, and the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nSenate Rules Committee for their assistance with this amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I compliment the Senator from New Mexico for his \namendment. It is an amendment that is acceptable to us both from the \nstandpoint of its substance and it will not jeopardize our bill as far \nas avoiding conference and all the other things we have been trying to \ndo by not amending this bill with nongermane amendments.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Mexico. I \nknow he has worked on the 800 panel as part of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, the work we did on that procurement bill. It was \nabout 3 years in the making. I think that should be applied here. I \nthink the procurement bill was an excellent bill, and its provisions \ncan well be applied here. I am glad to accept it on our side.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I, too, compliment the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico for his amendment. As ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, I pledge to him that we will move forward to try to give him \nthe kind of answers I think he wants and I support. So I pledge to him \nwe will attempt to get this out to the Senator in a reasonable length \nof time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Bingaman amendment.\n  So the amendment (No. 12) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Ford amendment.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 13 to Amendment No. 4\n\n(Purpose: To apply to the legislative branch the requirements regarding \n use of frequent flier awards for official travel that are established \n          in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994)\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment in the \nsecond degree to the Ford amendment and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 13 to Ford amendment No. 4.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n       (d) Applicability to Legislative Branch.--\n       (1) The requirements of section 6008 of the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (5 U.S.C. 5702 note) \n     shall apply to the Legislative branch, except that the \n     responsibilties of the Administrator of General Services \n     under such section shall be exercised as prescribed in \n     paragraph (2).\n       (2) The responsibilities of the Administrator of General \n     Services under section 6008(a) of the Federal Acquisition \n     Streamlining Act of 1994 shall be exercised, with respect to \n     the Senate, by the Committee on Rules and Administration, \n     with respect to the House of Representatives, by the \n     Committee on House Oversight, and, with respect to each \n     instrumentality of the Legislative branch other than the \n     Senate and the House of Representatives, by the head of such \n     instrumentality. The responsibilities of the Administrator of \n     General Services under section 6008(c) of such Act shall be \n     exercised, with respect to each instrumentality of the \n     Legislative branch other than the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, by the head of such instrumentality.\n       (e) Exercise of Rulemaking Powers.--The provisions of this \n     section that apply to the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate are enacted--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\n     considered as part of the rules of such House, respectively, \n     and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent \n     that they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such \n     House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of each House.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, my amendment would apply to the legislative \nbranch the same principles on frequent flier programs that Congress \nadopted last year in section 6008 of the Federal Acquisition \nStreamlining Act of 1994.\n  That procurement act was worked on for about 3 years here, as I \nmentioned just a few moments ago in referring to Senator Bingaman from \nNew Mexico. Part of that bill provided that frequent flier miles would \nnot accrue to the benefit of the individual in the executive branch but \nwould come back to the Government for the Government's use. In other \nwords, you could not have taxpayer-supported travel and then have a \nrebate apply for that individual.\n  So the purpose of my amendment, like the purpose of the underlying \nFord amendment, is to save taxpayer money.\n  Now, the use of frequent traveler programs is to reduce the cost of \nofficial travel, not to accrue to the personal benefit of somebody.\n  Last year's legislation on this subject contained three key \nprovisions. First, guidelines must be issued to ensure that Federal \nagencies promote and facilitate the use of frequent traveler programs \nfor the purpose of realizing cost savings for official travel.\n  Under my amendment, such guidelines would be issued for the Senate by \nthe Senate Rules Committee, for the House of Representatives by the \nCommittee on House Oversight, and for each congressional \ninstrumentality by the head of the instrumentality.\n  Second, last year's law states that frequent traveler awards accrued \nthrough official travel shall be used only for official travel, not \npersonal travel. My amendment would clarify that this principle applies \nnot only to the executive branch but also to the legislative branch of \nGovernment.\n  Third, like last year's law, my amendment would require the head of \neach congressional instrumentality to report to Congress on efforts to \npromote the use of frequent traveler programs.\n  The bill before the Senate, Mr. President, S. 2 is called the \nCongressional Accountability Act. Nothing could be a more critical part \nof congressional accountability than this amendment. It would require \nus to abide by the same principles that we have enacted last year in \nthe act to ensure that Members and staff will not convert our frequent \nflier awards to personal use and will instead use these awards to \nreduce the costs to the taxpayer.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the Record \nat the end of my statement the provision in the procurement act of last \nyear which I send to the desk. Section 6008 of the procurement bill of \nlast year, entitled ``Cost Savings for Official Travel'' is a short \nsection. It describes exactly how the administration, the executive \nbranch will ``issue guidelines to ensure that agencies promote, \nencourage, and facilitate the use of frequent traveler practice \nprograms offered by airlines, hotels, and car rental vendors by Federal \nemployees who engage in official air travel, for the purpose of \nrealizing to the maximum extent practicable cost savings for official \ntravel.''\n  It is difficult for me how to see anyone can oppose that, but \nopposition we have had all during the consideration here in the \nChamber. I am sorry to see that because I think this is something that \nneeds to be done to restore confidence, particularly in the House of \nRepresentatives where they do not follow the same rules that we do in \nthe Senate. I send that to the desk and ask that it be printed at the \nend of my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 6008. COST SAVINGS FOR OFFICIAL TRAVEL.\n\n       (a) Guidelines.--The Administrator of the General Services \n     Administration shall issue guidelines to ensure that agencies \n     promote, encourage, and facilitate the use of frequent \n     traveler programs offered by airlines, hotels, and car rental \n     vendors by Federal employees who engage in official air \n     travel, for the purpose of realizing to the maximum extent \n     practicable cost savings for official travel.\n       (b) Requirement.--Any awards granted under such a frequent \n     traveler program accrued through official travel shall be \n     used only for official travel.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall report to \n     Congress on efforts to promote the use of frequent traveler \n     programs by Federal employees.\n\n     SEC. 6009. PROMPT RESOLUTION OF AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\n       Federal agencies shall resolve or take corrective action on \n     all Office of Inspector General audit report findings within \n     a maximum of six months after their issuance, or, in the case \n     of audits performed by non-Federal auditors, six months after \n     receipt of the report by the Federal Government.\n\n  Mr. GLENN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first vote that we had today, and it \nwas the first vote this afternoon, we voted 55 to 44 for the McConnell \nsecond-degree amendment to the Ford amendment.\n  I suppose there are several reasons we voted that way, but the \nargument that was used very successfully in debate yesterday by Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky was comity between the House and Senate whereas \nthrough this legislation and this amendment we should not be as a body \nof the Senate making rules for the House of Representatives. They have \nthe constitutional right and power to adopt their own rules. They \ngenerally do not attempt to tell the Senate how we should fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibility in setting up the rules of the Senate. I \ndo not find any fault with the goal that either Senator Ford or Senator \nGlenn are trying to accomplish through their respective amendments. The \nMcConnell amendment has modified the Ford amendment so it just applies \nto the Senate.\n  Even though there is a different approach by Senator Glenn, the end \nresult is exactly the same; that if the Glenn amendment is adopted, \neven though it does not mention the House of Representatives, the \npractical impact is, for the Senate to tell the House of \nRepresentatives what they can do in their rulemaking on the subject of \nfrequent flier miles.\n  As I indicated, as a body, we decided earlier this afternoon, 55 to \n44, not to do that. I hope we will stand by the same decision we made \nearlier this afternoon and that we will defeat Senator Glenn's \namendment. I think that for the benefit of the public the House of \nRepresentatives has made a determined effort to assure the public that \nthey are going to make a decision on their frequent flier miles \nsituation later on this year. We should defer to their judgment, as we \nwould hope they would defer to our judgment and not tell us how to run \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  So I hope that as people come to vote on this amendment in a short \nperiod of time, they realize that this is a rerun of the McConnell \nsubstitute to the Ford Amendment and, likewise, this substitute should \nbe defeated.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand the reasoning--I do not accept \nit--for defeating this amendment. We are not talking about a House rule \nor a Senate rule. We are talking about law. We will have in the law a \nrestriction of the Senate and no restriction of the House.\n  The Senate, some years ago, decided that when the taxpayers were \npaying your air fare and you were a frequent flier--and most of us \nare--and you accumulated those frequent flier miles, and that belonged \nto your office. As the rules say, it is Government money, but it \napplies to your office, so you could use those frequent flier miles to \nreduce the cost to your office and therefore reduce the cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  In the House, they have allowed the Congressmen to use the frequent \nflier mileage for personal use. So they were receiving a personal perk \nat the expense of the taxpayer dollar. All we are saying here is that \nwe ought to be treated alike, and that the House should not, by rule, \nas my distinguished colleague from Iowa has said, change. But it is not \na matter of law, unless they put it into a piece of legislation. It \nwill be statutory. So if you make a rule, you change a rule.\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\n  So what I think we need to do is to listen to Senator Glenn. As he \nsays, let us see if we cannot, by the very fact of reducing the cost of \nour tickets to our district or to our State, because we would not \nreceive the so-called frequent flier mileage--and then our tickets \nwould be reduced and it would be the same. He is not asking that we do \nit. As I understand it, he is asking that we have a study and make a \nrecommendation, and then the Rules Committee will make the rule that \nwill apply, which would be statutory.\n  And so, Mr. President, it is all right if you use the theory that the \nHouse does not tell us how to run our business and we should not tell \nthem how to run theirs. But the House has told us how to run our \nbusiness on more than one occasion. We are just coming out of the way \nwe keep our books, because it was imposed upon us by the House. It was \nnot done by the Senate, it was done by the House.\n  If we are going to let this one slide and all those on the other side \nare going to be opposed to restricting the use of taxpayer dollars for \npersonal perks, then I think the more things change around here, the \nmore they stay the same. If those new Senators that come into this body \nafter they ran their campaign on trying to say we are going to \nstraighten the place out and we are going to try to take the \nCongressmen and Senators' hands out of your pocket, regulations off \nyour back, and our hands out of your pocket, here is one glowing way \nyou can say, ``I am keeping my campaign pledge'' or, ``No, I am not, I \nam going to let them go ahead and take this perk off the taxpayers.''\n  So the streets of hell are paved with good intentions. What if they \nput it into a bill, a rules change, or make it statutory, and it is a \nbill that does not pass the Senate. They keep on building up these \nfrequent flier miles and can use them personally. There are a lot of \nthings.\n  As the majority leader said--and I take him at his word--if this bill \npasses the Senate as it is--and apparently all the amendments to it are \ngoing to be tabled or defeated--then the House will accept this \nlegislation without a conference, pass it, and send it to the President \nfor signature. So we have missed a grand and glorious chance of doing \nwhat is right.\n  If the House, as they say, is going to do it anyhow, why should they \nobject? Why should they object to putting it in this bill that they are \ngoing to pass and send on to the President? I do not think it is very \ngood cover saying that we want the House to make their own decision and \nthe Senate to make their own, when over the years we have both made \ndecisions that applied to each body. Some were far more significant \nthan this, but has no more imagery, no more moral underpinning than \nthis one amendment.\n  So we are going to apply it to the Senate statutorily, and the House \neventually will get around to a rules change, or maybe put it into a \npiece of legislation. So I have to say to you that my dad always told \nme, ``Son, never underestimate the insignificant.'' Never underestimate \nthe insignificant. This is an insignificant, little amendment. But it \nsays a volume. It says a volume. Are we going to stop the use of \ntaxpayer money for personal use? No. We will for ourselves, but nobody \nelse. And so if the House is going to do it, why not do it here?\n  Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand. Just this week, or \nlast week, we voted that we did not want to have lobbyist reform or \ngift ban proposals here. And those that were vehemently for lobbyist \nreform and gift bans came out and said, ``We do not want Democrats \nsetting the agenda for us. We want to put in our own bill.'' If that is \ncover not to vote for lobbyist reform or gift ban, that is still a weak \nreed. So that is No. 2 this week. That is No. 2 that we have had to \nvote on. You have looked back, and never underestimate the \ninsignificant. Pretty soon, the insignificant is going to be three, and \nit is going to be four, and it is going to be five. And we have just \nstarted. We are not 10 days old and already that pledge out there and \nbeating of the chest and coming back here and saying what you are going \nto do--working all night on the House side--is going to be for naught.\n  I am for this. I think it is the right thing to do. I was for it a \nlong time ago. Unfunded mandates I offered to you 6 years ago at $50 \nmillion, the same figures. Did I get any takers? No. Five years ago, \ndid I get any takers? No. Now it is one of the big deals. Unfunded \nmandates. I have been a Governor, and I understand how this egg is \nnever going to be put back together once we scramble it and give the \nStates unfunded mandates. It goes on and on, and it is going to eat us \nall up, and we are going to be back here trying to reconsider that, \nbecause I have had to endure under what Congress does. We pass a bill \nhere and the bureaucrats do not speak. They then legislate it.\n  We are going to have a balanced budget amendment. That is going to \npass, but then we, after it passes, will pass legislation to implement \nit. What is going to be an emergency? I think we are moving too fast \nand there ought to be some thought given to the fabric that we are \nweaving here that is going to be a tremendous problem down the pike.\n  So we have had two votes, and there may be a third one before the day \nis over. There may be a fourth one. But let me remind my friends, never \nunderestimate the insignificant. This is insignificant, and you are \ngoing to have to pay for it one of these days when you do not want to \ndo what is right. I hope my colleagues will reconsider this. This is \nthe right thing to do. It is not the wrong thing to do. The only excuse \nis that we want the House to set their own rules. And this is not a \nrule; this is statutory. When you put it into the statutes, then you \nhave to take it out. A rule is a lot easier to change.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to reconsider their position and \nlook at what Senator Glenn offered here. It makes a great deal of \nsense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not accept it that this is all just a \nHouse matter for this reason: I, as a U.S. Senator from Ohio, have to \nvote on appropriations for the House. Every Senator here has to do \nthat. I vote those appropriations now, knowing full well that part of \ntheir cost of transportation back and forth comes back in the form of \nfrequent flier miles, and that does not come back to the Government; it \ndoes not inure to the Government or accrue to the Government's benefit, \nas in the Senate and in the executive branch. It comes back to the \nindividuals. So we appropriate more money here to let the House have \ntheir freebies to take families on vacations, fly wherever on their use \nof frequent flier miles, bought and paid for with taxpayer dollars.\n  I think we ought to remember around here, when all else fails, that a \nvote on just plain what is right or wrong is in order. The way they are \ndoing it over there now is wrong. This is a smokescreen that it does \nnot make a difference to the Senate. It does, because we have to \nappropriate the dollars to help them have their freebies. If I rose \nhere and said I am putting in an amendment here that says I want \nfreebies for everybody, not just the House, let us expand it and put \nthe Senate back on the freebies, and the executive branch, and run \nseveral million dollars of additional expense through appropriations to \naccommodate all this so we can take our families everywhere the House \nis able to take theirs. People would think I was nuts, and they would \nbe right.\n  But yet we try to do the opposite and say we are trying to save \ntaxpayers' money, and we get ridiculed and voted down repeatedly. So I \ndo not mind bringing this up for another vote.\n  We see rebates not only on the airlines with frequent flier miles, we \nsee these things once in a while that if you stay 5 days or 4 days in a \ncertain hotel, I saw advertised in New York, you get a free weekend--\nFriday, Saturday--with you and your wife and family, whatever. So we \nhave those rebates.\n  We have some of the rental car companies where, if you rent so many \ndays in a row, you get a freebie or two. Why should that not come back \nin cash? If we are getting back frequent flier miles and using them \nourselves, why should we not say if Hertz gives a Government discount, \nwhy do I not pay the full fare and we want a kickback in cash? That \nwould be a kickback we would never condone, and we should not.\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\n  So I think, when it comes down to it, it is just a matter to me of \nwhat is right and what is wrong. And the way the House is doing their \nbusiness on this right now is just flatout wrong.\n  Mr. President, I do not know whether anyone else wishes to speak, but \nI ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nIowa and the Senator from Ohio whether or not they intend to take a \nvote on this amendment right now. If not, I would like to go ahead with \nan amendment. I have been waiting on the floor for a number of hours. \nIf so, I wonder if I could ask unanimous consent that after the vote, \nmy amendment be then up on the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I might respond to my distinguished \ncolleague from Minnesota that I am ready to vote right now. I do not \nthink anybody else is prepared to speak. I am prepared to vote right \nnow.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. May I just ask the Senator from Ohio a question when \nthe Senator from Minnesota has completed his question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if it is OK with my colleagues--as the \nSenator from Iowa knows, I have been trying to move things along--I ask \nunanimous consent that, after the vote, I be able to then offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Hearing no \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if I may just ask the Senator from Ohio, \nas to this whole issue of frequent flier miles and all, I have \ndifficulty understanding the disagreement that exists. As I understand \nit, you are talking about a public property here, which is these so-\ncalled frequent flier miles that have been accumulated with taxpayers' \ndollars being converted to personal use. I always thought that was \nagainst the law to take public property and convert it to personal use.\n  I do not understand why we are having to pass laws on this issue. I \ndid not realize that it was just a question of which rule you wanted to \nadopt. I always thought it was against the law to take public property \nand convert it to private use.\n  Am I missing something?\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I do not think the Senator is missing \nanything. We are trying to correct that loophole in the law with this \namendment and with the underlying amendment by the Senator from \nKentucky [Mr. Ford]. This would close that loophole so the House could \nnot misuse what I view, just as the Senator from New Mexico says, as \npublic property.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Ohio [Mr. Glenn]. The yeas and nays have been ordered and \nthe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 10 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Cohen\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hatfield\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kassebaum\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Packwood\n     Pressler\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Simpson\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bradley\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Exon\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Heflin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnston\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nunn\n     Pell\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Simon\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n      \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  So the motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 13) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand that the unanimous-consent \nagreement was given to the Senator from Minnesota and that his \namendment would be brought up right after this particular vote.\n  It is my understanding now it will not be necessary to have a \nrecorded vote on my amendment. The Senator from Minnesota is willing to \nallow us to proceed, provided he will be the next one up. If that is \nagreeable to the leadership, we will proceed in that manner.\n  Mr. DOLE. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. FORD. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I indicated to the Senator from Minnesota \nthat we have no desire to quickly move to table the amendment. We would \nlike to do the nomination of Robert Rubin, if we could, this evening.\n  We would like to accommodate both the Senator from Minnesota and the \nSecretary-to-be Rubin. So hopefully we can work it out and still be out \nof here by 7 o'clock.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nof Senator Wellstone be set aside and that the Ford amendment be \nconsidered by a voice vote or by unanimous consent, and at the end of \nthat then we go back and recognize the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4, as amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4, the Ford amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 4), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order of the Senate, the \nSenator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to yield to the \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, just to clarify and help people in \nscheduling, I believe there are two amendments left that might require \nvotes--those of Senator Wellstone and Senator Lautenberg. I do not know \nhow long it will take. Those are the only amendments left, just for the \nguidance of Members.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, before I offer the amendment, could I \nask for order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. The \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the majority \nleader for his willingness to work closely with us on the floor. I say \nto the majority leader that there are some other Senators who would \nlike to speak that are with me, and I would like to get to those \nSenators right\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\naway. We will try to not take up many hours, but we consider this to be \nan important amendment, and we will try to do it within whatever \ntimeframe the majority leader talked about.\n   Mr. President, let me for my colleagues just briefly describe this \namendment. Then there are several Senators that are with me, certainly \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who is going to have to \nleave, and I would like him to open up with some of our remarks.\n  This amendment is twofold. First of all, it reads:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  I would like to repeat that, if I may, for the Chair and for my \ncolleagues. The amendment reads as follows:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Mr. President, the second part of this amendment has to do with the \nduties of congressional committees. What this amendment says is that \neach committee, as it considers any bill that affects children, will \nhave an accompanying report which will deal with the impact of that \nlegislation on children.\n  This is very consistent with some of the direction in which we are \ngoing in the U.S. Senate. If we are going to talk about the impact that \nlegislation has on State governments or on county governments or on \ncorporations or businesses, then surely, Mr. President, we can also \ntalk about the impact that this legislation has on children within our \ncountry.\n  I want to just give a few examples. Today, in Minnesota, there were \nabout 150 people, many of them children, many of them Head Start \nmothers, I say to the Senator from Connecticut, a number of different \norganizations, and the Children's Defense Fund, looking to the year \n2002 and understanding what might very well happen in this country--\nthat is to say, that the cuts we make go the path of least resistance--\nwhich spelled out what they are worried about.\n  As they looked at some of the projected cuts, they talked about \nMinnesota 2002: 29,150 babies, preschoolers, and pregnant women would \nlose infant formula and other WIC nutrition supplements; 31,350 \nchildren would lose food stamps; 154,600 children would lose free or \nsubsidized school lunch programs; 93,000 children would lose Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  Mr. President, I can go on, but the point I simply want to make \nbefore yielding the floor to Senator Dodd is I come from a State that \nhas had a number of great Senators. I hope that if I work hard, I can \nmaybe just be a little bit as good as Hubert Humphrey. Seventeen years \nago, Hubert Humphrey said the test of a Government and the test of a \nsociety is the way we treat people in the dawn of life--children--the \nway we treat people in the twilight of their life--the elderly--and the \nway we treat people in the shadow of their lives--those that are \nstruggling with an illness, those that are struggling with a \ndisability, and those that are poor or those that are needy.\n  I believe that this Contract With America takes us precisely in the \nopposite direction. Surely there is a way that we can continue with \ndeficit reduction and not ride roughshod over children. Surely, we can \ngo on record in the U.S. Senate today, making it clear that it is the \nsense of the Congress that we will not enact any legislation that will \nincrease the number of children who are hungry or homeless. And surely \ntoday in this amendment, we can make it clear that we will do child \nimpact of our legislation to make sure that whatever we do does not \nmake more children homeless, does not make more children hungry; that \nwhatever we do supports our future, which is to support children in \nthis country.\n  I have much more to say about this amendment. I hope that the U.S. \nSenate will go on record and support this amendment. But I would like \nto yield the floor to Senator Dodd from Connecticut, who has been such \na leader in the U.S. Senate on children's issues.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, first let me commend our colleague from Minnesota, \nwith whom I have the pleasure and honor of serving with on the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, and who has been a tireless advocate on \nbehalf of children as a member of that committee. Let me again point \nout and restate what the Senator from Minnesota is attempting to do \nhere.\n  This is an amendment that merely says that for those who are arguably \nthe most vulnerable in our society, those on whom we depend for the \nsuccess and future of this Nation, that as we consider all of the \nfinancial implications of budgets and tax proposals, that we be ever so \nmindful of these children. They have no other choices and no other \nalternatives for their own success and survival than our willingness to \nappreciate how vulnerable they are and our willingness to be supportive \nof them.\n  There are a staggering number of statistics that indicate the \nproblems that younger Americans face in our society today. The child \npoverty rate fell throughout the 1960's, falling from approximately 26 \npercent in 1960 to 13.8 percent in 1969. It is worthy to note that the \nrate began rising again, to more than 20 percent, where it is today. \nThe trend lines are pointing in all the wrong directions. We are told \nthat if the current trends continue, almost 28 percent of children in \nthe United States will be living in poverty by the year 2010.\n  Now, you do not need to be a Ph.D. in sociology to appreciate what \nthe implications of that are for the generation coming along that have \nto be the best-educated, best-prepared generation this Nation has ever \nproduced. We are going to be living in the most competitive global \nenvironment that the world has ever seen, and we need to do everything \nwe possibly can to see to it that those younger Americans at least have \nthe opportunity to be well prepared.\n  Anyone will tell you as they look at these issues that a child who \nlacks the proper nutrition in the earliest years of their development, \nthat is not getting the kind of care and start they need as they begin \nthose lives, then the likelihood they are going to be productive \ncitizens, good parents, independent people capable of taking care of \nthemselves and contributing to our society diminishes dramatically.\n  This amendment is not a Draconian amendment. It says that we should \nat least consider these matters. I am tremendously sympathetic and a \nsupporter, I might add, of the unfunded mandate proposal. I think there \nis a lot of value in that, looking at the implications in our \ncommunities and in our States of the decisions we make.\n  In fact, in this very Chamber a year ago I offered an amendment which \nrequired that we meet at least 30 percent of the obligation we promised \n20 years ago for special education needs in this country. We only do it \nto the tune of 7 percent today. And yet we made the commitment back in \nthe 1970's we meet at least 40 percent of that obligation. It is a \ntremendous burden for our communities.\n  That amendment failed. Well, there is some hope with the unfunded \nmandate approach, if we handle it properly, that we will be able to \nstep in and make a contribution to lessen the burden at the local and \nState level. Can we not also say, at least for this one constituency, \nfor the children of our country, that we are going to examine the \nimplications of our decisions when it comes to basic things like \neducation, like nutrition, like child support?\n  It seems to me that is not a great deal to ask. If we are going to \nexamine the implications on a business from a regulatory scheme that we \nadopt here, I think that is an appropriate and proper question to ask. \nIt should not take a great deal to at least come up with some rough \ndetermination of what the implications are in a business. Is it too \nmuch to ask, with the children of this country, the children of this \nsociety, that we are going to consider as well what the implications \nare for you?\n  I realize there is a wave afoot here and that we are all sort of in \nlockstep in terms of how people are approaching amendments. This does \nnot mandate in a draconian or violent way at all. It just says that \nRepublicans and Democrats in this Chamber as we begin this new Congress \nregardless of our ideology, regardless of our political persuasion, \nunderstand the price we will pay as a Nation in this society if we do \nnot take into account what happens to the most vulnerable in our \nsociety.\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota for proposing \nthis idea. I hope that people at least look at it and consider it. I \nthink it shows balance here, as we look at all these other issues, to \ncertainly take into consideration what happens to America's children. \nSomeday we are going to be held accountable as a generation as to what \nwe did, not in the face of ignorance but in the face of awareness and \nknowledge of what was happening to a staggering number of our young \npeople.\n  The issue will be raised and the question asked: Well, you knew that. \nWhat did you do? Did you at least try to take into account their needs \non the basic issues, on the basic issues of food and education, decent \nhousing, decent support for these young families and these young \nchildren?\n  I hope, with the adoption of this kind of an amendment we can say at \nleast we tried to take that into account. There is no guarantee you are \ngoing to do it. It does not say you have to. It just says that you are \ngoing to be aware of it and you are going to listen to what the \nimplications are for these younger people.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the Wellstone amendment. I \nthink it would speak well for this body in the opening days of January \nthat for these children, particularly the children of these working \nfamilies out there that are struggling every day to make ends meet, we \nare going to take into account their needs as well as in looking at the \nimplications on governmental bodies and on businesses, children also, \nparticularly the most vulnerable, will be considered as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wish to yield the floor in a moment to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  First of all, let me thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  As we speak about this amendment, I wish to try to talk some about \nthe state of children within our country because I think that is part \nof the context of this amendment. Later on, I also want to talk about \nthis budget debate and what has been taken off the table and why it is \nthat so many people around the country are so frightened that in fact \nwhat we are about to do is really cut children, the most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  But please understand, I say to my colleagues, that every 5 seconds \nin the United States of America a child drops out of school; every 30 \nseconds a child is born into poverty; every 2 minutes a child is born \nto a woman who had no prenatal care; every 2 minutes a child is born \nseverely underweight; every 4 minutes a child is arrested in an \nalcohol-related arrest; I think every 6 minutes a child is arrested in \na drug-related arrest; every 2 hours a child is murdered in our \ncountry, and every 4 hours--this is devastating to me as a grandfather \nand father--a child takes his or her life.\n  Mr. President, we cannot abandon children, and as a matter of fact I \nthink the ultimate indictment is when we do so. Either we invest in \nchildren when they are young or we pay the price later.\n  I will have some very specific figures on hunger of children in the \nUnited States of America a little later on as we go forward with this \ndebate, and I will also have some statistics on the fastest growing \nhomeless population, which are children. But I say to my colleagues the \narithmetic of what we could very well be doing with this contract on \nAmerica is very harsh; it is very mean spirited. We know what has been \ntaken off the table. Military contractors are not asked to make cuts. \nOil companies are not asked to make cuts. Coal companies are not asked \nto make cuts. A whole lot of other corporations are not asked to \nsacrifice at all. But we are going to cut nutrition programs for \nchildren. We are going to cut programs that provide children with some \nassistance so that they can have an opportunity.\n  Now, some of my colleagues say, no, we are not going to do that. This \nis just simply trying to get people to panic. Senator Wellstone or \nSenator Bumpers or Senator Moseley-Braun or Senator Dodd are just \nexaggerating.\n  Mr. President, we can put all of that concern to rest, and we can go \non record tonight in the Senate that it is the sense of the Congress we \nshould not enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number \nof children who are hungry or homeless. We should be able to vote \n``yes'' for that.\n  Mr. President, we can also adopt an amendment that says if we are \ngoing to call for impact statements on legislation that affects \ncorporations and State governments and county governments, surely as we \nmove forward we can call for company reports that issue impact \nstatements as to how this affects children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the author of \nthis amendment, my good friend, Senator Wellstone, for the \nthoughtfulness of his amendment. It may not be perfectly worded. \nOftentimes, we understand the thrust of amendments that come up in the \nChamber at times like this, even though they are not worded quite \nprecisely. What we ought to do now is to vote for this amendment \nbecause we know what the intention is and what the thrust is. We can \nworry about the precise language in conference.\n  Mr. President, shortly we are going to be taking up the unfunded \nmandates bill. I have very serious reservations about that bill. I do \nnot want to debate it. I think the thrust of that bill is probably \ngood. But I think it needs a lot of work.\n  We have been voting today largely along party lines. Virtually every \nvote has been a motion to table voted for by the Republicans and, for \nthe most part, voted against by Democrats. That is understandable. But \nif there is one amendment on this bill that Republicans and Democrats \nought to join hands on it is this one.\n  The Senator from Minnesota proposes that if we are going to pay the \ncities and the counties and the States for any obligation we put on \nthem, surely we must also agree not to enact legislation, the effect of \nwhich is going to increase the number of homeless and poor children in \nthis country. Surely, we can all agree nobody in this body wants that.\n  Mr. President, everybody in this Chamber has his own view as to what \nhappened on November 8--not a happy day for the people on this side of \nthe aisle. Not to offend my colleagues on the other side, I could give \na half dozen reasons that I think are very legitimate on why people \nvoted against Democrats, not for Republicans.\n  I do not believe there is a person in America who believes Government \nis too big, too unwieldy, and too expensive, due to food stamps for \nhungry people. I take the position that food stamps, aid for dependent \nchildren, maternal and child health, Medicaid, medical leave are \nvaluable programs. Some people would have you believe that these \nprograms were enacted by the Congress willy-nilly. They were not. They \nwere debated. Committees considered those proposals thoughtfully.\n  The Chamber of Commerce and Rotary Club back home did not want me to \nvote for a medical leave bill. But I happen to have spent 6 weeks with \nmy daughter in Boston Children's Hospital, 2,000 miles from my home. \nBetty and I talk about it a lot. We were not wealthy, but what if we \nhad been poor? We would not have been in Boston. I do not know. I might \nhave robbed a bank to get my daughter there. We were so fortunate \nbecause all I had to do was go back home and open my law office, a one-\nman, solo practice in a town of 1,500 people and start practicing law \nagain. If I had been out on the assembly line, I would not have had a \njob to go home to. I daresay that while an awful lot of people in this \ncountry took strong exception to the family and medical leave bill, \nthere are not 10 people in this Chamber who would undo this law right \nnow.\n  This country decided years ago we did not want a single one of our \nchildren to go hungry, and that is the reason we have food stamps. We \ndecided we did not want a poor child to suffer for lack of medical \nattention. That is why we have Medicaid. We decided we did not want \npoor women having premature or disabled babies who require costly \ntreatment and frequently do not\n\n[[Page S716]]\n\nsurvive. That is why we provide prenatal care. And we provide school \nlunches for children from poor families. Who here would undo that?\n  I was president of the school board in my city for 12 years. That was \nthe only thing I was ever elected to before I was elected Governor of \nmy State. I must say, I ran for Governor to get off the school board. \nThat is the worst job I ever had. I know how important school lunches \nare. The school board struggled with that and tried to raise a little \nmoney to improve the nutritional quality of those lunches.\n  The American people have every right to be mad, upset, disenchanted, \nand to distrust Congress. It is trendy to do so. But I am telling you \nthat the people of this country do not want us to undo the programs \nI've described. They do not want us giving the States block grants if \nthe effect is to increase hunger among our children.\n  In 1950, 27 percent of the people of this Nation over 65 years of age \nlived below the poverty line. Since then we have reduced the poverty \nrate among senior citizens to below 12 percent. We can pat ourselves on \nthe back and say Social Security and Medicare did it. Today, you talk \nabout Social Security and you talk about the third rail of politics. \nNobody would dare suggest cutting Social Security and Medicare. Why? \nBecause there are 40 million votes out there. You do not have to be a \nrocket scientist to figure that one out either.\n  So how about our children? In 1950, the poverty rate among children \nwas 14 percent. At the same time we were reducing poverty among our \nolder citizens, the rate for children was growing dramatically to its \ncurrent level of 23 percent. Senator Dodd says it will be 28 percent by \nthe year 2010. Are we going to stand idly by and allow that figure to \ncome true? If we do not adopt an amendment like this, we could very \nwell see it. Everybody favors welfare reform. But when you get down to \nthe specifics of it, it gets very tenuous indeed.\n  Mr. President, I do not believe people want welfare reform in order \nto make cuts that would devastate the most vulnerable among us, namely \nour children. Here is a good opportunity for Republicans and Democrats \nto show the American people that when it gets to some basic values, we \ncan indeed join hands and agree on something.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I never yielded \nthe floor. Do I retain the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The Senator cannot hold the \nfloor after having yielded to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I wonder whether the Senator will \ngrant me a moment to thank the Senator from Arkansas. I just say to my \ncolleague from Arkansas that I deeply appreciate his remarks, and I \nthink, one more time, that this amendment is really an amendment that \nwill attract and should attract bipartisan support. This is an \nextremely important message that we can convey today on the floor of \nthe Senate. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I want to \nbegin by congratulating and commending the Senator from Minnesota for \nthis initiative. I think that it is a classical initiative, one that is \ncertainly in keeping with the tradition of this body because really, \nstripped to its essentials, this sense-of-the-Senate amendment simply \nsays that we in the Senate will do no harm. That is really, I think, \nour fundamental mandate and fundamental charge as Members of this great \nbody.\n  As we discuss the change--the revolution, some have called it--the \nreform that has come to the hill, I think we have to also be mindful, \nas we speculate about the political ramifications, of why it happened \nand what all is going on and what all this means. I think we have to be \nmindful of the realities. We must never lose sight of the realities--\nwhat is going on, putting aside the slogans and the politicization of \nthese issues, the reality. The fact is, as the Senator from Minnesota \npointed out, the most vulnerable Americans are really at this point the \nmost frightened, because the rhetoric seems to suggest that their \nrealities will be ignored in this debate, and that they will not be \nfactored in the decisionmaking as we rush headlong to begin to get some \nfiscal discipline to balance the budget and as we address issues having \nto do with the unfunded mandates, and the like.\n  The statistics cited by the Senator from Minnesota paint a grim, but \na very viable reality, and one that I think we must not lose sight of, \nand one certainly that underscores the need for his sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. His back stop, the back stop this resolution suggests is \nthat we will do no harm to children, the most vulnerable people in our \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, I am a supporter of the balanced budget amendment. In \nfact, my senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon proposed a \nbalanced budget amendment--and I add parenthetically, since we have \ntalked about politics, that a Democrat suggested the balanced budget \namendment. When I campaigned for this office, I supported the balanced \nbudget amendment. I am also a supporter, with Senators Glenn and \nKempthorne, of the initiative having to do with unfunded mandates, \ncoming out of State and local government. I, frankly, resist the notion \nthat fiscal responsibility and responsibility in these areas is mean \nspirited or has to be mean spirited, or that it will put at risk the \nneediest people in our society and especially our children. I think we \ncan have fiscal responsibility, and I think we can and must achieve a \nbalanced budget. We must begin to address the whole issue of unfunded \nmandates and the burden that puts on State and local governments, but \nthat we can do that in a way that elevates and does not diminish the \nstatus of children in our society. That is the bottom line of the \nresolution of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  So I support fiscal responsibility, and I suppose these initiatives \nfor the balanced budget and for the unfunded mandates proposition. I \nalso am a strong supporter of this amendment. I believe they are \nlogically consistent and that they are mutually compatible. I believe \nwe can do both.\n  I want to share with you for a moment--and I will not be much longer, \nSenator Simon. I kind of jotted down a few notes I wanted to share with \nmy colleagues. I first ran for the Senate--and my colleagues on the \nentitlement commission have heard this story, but it is significant to \nme and to this debate. My decision to run for this office came in large \npart based on a conversation I had with my son who was then 15 years \nold. Matthew, after we discussed the great issues of our time, said to \nme, ``You know, Mom, your generation has left this world and country \nworse off than you found it.'' Well, that was like a dagger to the \nheart, the notion that my generation had not kept faith and done what \nwe were supposed to do in our stewardship of the affairs of this \ncountry. So it was for that reason that I have supported efforts to get \non an even keel, to put our fiscal House in order, to be responsible in \nterms of the allocation of responsibilities between State and local \ngovernment.\n  I believe that this issue is so important, and so important a \nstatement for us to make who are supportive of fiscal responsibility, \nprecisely because we are talking about what really comes down, and if \nyou look at the numbers and the realities again as opposed to the \nemotional hot button, they tell us that we are talking about less than \n1 percent of our budget.\n  We really are not talking about an awful lot of money, if you will, \nin the grand scheme of things. If we are talking about entitlement \nspending, discretionary spending, really, over all, the amount that is \nallocated and devoted to children and children's needs is not all that \ngreat.\n  And so the question comes: Why can we not make a strong statement \nthat we believe we are going to not only protect our children's future, \nbut we are also going to protect our children's present; that the \nchildren now will not have to worry about what is going to happen as a \nresult of our move to make all of these changes, all of these reforms, \nand all of the different initiatives that are pending before this new \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by saying that it is my concern for \nchildren that actually got me to stand up here\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\nand make a speech without notes and on behalf of the initiative of the \nSenator from Minnesota, because I believe it is absolutely imperative \nthat we underscore our efforts for fiscal responsibility, underscore \nour efforts with regard to the pending legislation with the statement \nthat we will do no harm to the neediest in our community, we will do no \nharm to our children, and that we are concerned about the realities \nthat all the children of this great country face, and that we have the \ncapacity and the ability and the foresight to state at this point that \nwe will be mindful of their needs as we go forward with these different \nlegislative initiatives.\n  So I want to thank and commend the Senator from Minnesota for taking \nthis initiative, for taking this step. I congratulate him for it. I \ncertainly rise in strong support of his sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds, because I know \nmy colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, is anxious to speak.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, for \nher remarks. I do not think she really needed to go with prepared \nremarks, because I think the Senator knows the issues so well and has \nsuch a commitment to them. I wanted to just simply thank the Senator \nfor being here out on the floor.\n  I wanted to emphasize one point, which is that we might want to call \nthis amendment, if we had to title it, the ``Children's Right to Have \nTheir Congress Know,'' because part of this amendment, again, says it \nis the sense of the Congress that Congress should not enact or adopt \nany legislation that will increase the number of children who are \nhungry or homeless. Surely, we can go on record on that.\n  But the other part, I say to the Senator from Illinois, really is an \nimportant impact that we require, which we really should do in this \nrush to pass this agenda--and I want to talk more about the economics \nof this a little later on. We owe it to the children of this country--\ndo we not always want to have photo opportunities next to children?--we \nowe it to the children of this country that we do an analysis of the \nimpact of the legislation that we pass out of committee. We should do \nthat. That is the right thing to do. It is the policy thing to do, it \nis the justice thing to do, and it is certainly the right thing to do \nfor the children in this country.\n  So this is an amendment that is meant to be part of the law of the \nNation. I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  I thank the senior Senator for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois also for \nher comments. And since she mentioned her son Matthew, let me just add, \nhe is a young man who is going to serve his community and country well \nin the future and Carol Moseley-Braun ought to be a very proud mother \nof that son.\n  I think what Senator Wellstone has proposed here is important. Let me \njust give you one simple fact. Twenty-three percent of the children of \nthis Nation live in poverty. No other industrial nation has anything \nlike that figure; no 23 percent in Great Britain or Canada or France or \nGermany or Italy or Japan or Norway or Denmark or Sweden or the other \ncountries you could mention. Why, why do 23 percent of the children in \nthis country life in poverty?\n  This is not an act of God. There is no divine intervention that says \nthe children in Iowa and the children in Missouri and the children in \nIllinois ought to be living in poverty more than children in other \ncountries. It is not the result of a divine intervention; it is not an \nact of God. It is a result of flawed policies.\n  It starts in this room, my friends, in this Hall where we meet.\n  Will the Wellstone amendment, if it is passed, result in changed \npolicy? No one can know for sure. Even the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota, for whom I have such a high regard, cannot know for sure \nwhether this will have any significant result in moving us in the right \ndirection. But it might.\n  At least when we are talking about welfare reform, we are going to be \nlooking at things. And I hear everybody wants welfare reform, including \nthe people on welfare. But I think there are a lot of people who think \nwe can do welfare reform on the cheap. There can be no real welfare \nreform without a jobs program. And you are going to hear me saying this \nover and over again.\n  And I am pleased my colleague from Illinois mentioned the balanced \nbudget amendment. It is very interesting. This year, we will now spend \n10 times as much on interest as we will on education. We will spend \nalmost twice as much on interest as all the poverty programs put \ntogether.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer, who is a distinguished former governor \nof Missouri, if the people of Missouri had a choice of spending less \nmoney on interest and more to help poor people, which would they \nprefer? You know the answer and I know the answer.\n  But we have just kind of backed into this without thinking. The \namendment of the Senator from Minnesota says: Let us think about it. \nLet us pay attention. Let us at least look at what we are doing to our \nchildren.\n  Again, I simply ask you: Why is the United States alone among the \nWestern industrial nations in having 23 percent of its children in \npoverty? It grows out of this room, and in this room we can change that \npolicy and give a brighter future to our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was not on the floor for most of the \ncomments by the Senator from Minnesota regarding his proposed \namendment. I have just read it. It would provide that it is the sense \nof the Congress that we should not enact legislation to increase the \nnumber of children who are hungry or homeless. And then, if I might \ndirect a question to the Senator from Minnesota, the amendment also \nstates that any bill or joint resolution coming before the Senate or \nthe House should contain an analysis of the probable impact of the bill \nor resolution on children, including the impact on the number of \nchildren who are hungry or homeless.\n  Let me just be sure I understand this amendment. What the Senator is \nsaying in his amendment is, prior to any bill coming here, that there \nought to be a report filed with it detailing, or outlining, I should \nsay, its probable impact regarding whether it would increase the number \nof children who are either hungry or homeless or both.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You know, a lot of times, we mandate reports concerning \nbills here as to their impact on the budget. We have that requirement.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The accompanying report that would come out of \ncommittee would actually deal with the impact on children, not just on \nhunger or just on homelessness, but its impact on children, more \nbroadly defined.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In other words, if the bill enhanced the well-being of \nchildren, that report would point that out, too?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So it is not just an amendment dealing with measures that \ncould be detrimental to children. It is also saying, how might a bill \nhelp them? So if a bill came up, and the question arose: How can we \nhelp children, make sure they have an adequate breakfast or a school \nlunch? That report could also detail that, too.\n  I just wanted to make sure that was the case.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for \nmaking, I think, an important point, which is actually that this \naccompanying report is a valuable tool for us as we try to make the \nbest possible policy, for two reasons. In the negative, if you will, it \ntells us if we are about to pass a piece of legislation that will in \nfact be harmful to children in America. But it also tells us in the \npositive, when we pass legislation, this is in fact the contribution of \nthis legislation to the lives of children in America. That is the \npurpose.\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if I may reclaim my time on the floor, I \nthank the Senator and I compliment him for this amendment. I think it \nis appropriate that we have this amendment at the beginning of the \nyear; that before we rush to judgment on a lot of bills and measures \nthat will be coming before us that may sound nice, we ought to stop and \nthink about what their impact will be on children in this country.\n  Mr. President, I have here a study that was done by the Food Research \nand Action Center, [FRAC]. They talked about the Personal \nResponsibility Act, which is the legislation developed to implement the \nHouse Republican Contract With America. The report goes on to show this \nact contains a proposal to block grant current Federal nutrition \nprograms, to remove their entitlement status and reduce their funding \nlevels.\n  FRAC's analysis shows that the Personal Responsibility Act's \nnutrition block grant program would result in a reduction of funding \nfor food assistance of over $30 billion, about 14 percent, by fiscal \nyear 2000, with a funding loss of $5 billion, 12.7 percent, in fiscal \nyear 1996 alone. Further, under the Personal Responsibility Act's \nnutrition block grant, all but nine States would experience reductions \nin funding for food assistance in fiscal year 1996. Fifteen States, \nincluding Texas, Ohio, Georgia, Kentucky, and Michigan, would lose 20 \npercent or more of their funding in fiscal year 1996. Five States--\nTexas, Louisiana, Washington, Delaware, and Maryland--and the District \nof Columbia would lose 30 percent or more of their food assistance \nfunding in fiscal year 1996 if the so-called Personal Responsibility \nAct is passed. The FRAC analysis finds that if the so-called Personal \nResponsibility Act is passed, the nutrition block grants will have a \ndevastating impact on individual programs such as the Food Stamp \nProgram. In order to achieve savings in this program, States will have \nto reduce the number of participants by more than 6 million people, or \ncut benefits by 14 percent in the first year alone. Estimates indicate \nthat if States choose to cut participation levels, over half of all \nStates would have to cut their caseloads by 20 percent or more to meet \nthe lower funding levels. Further, over a quarter of the States would \nhave to reduce case loads by 30 percent or more, and 10 States would \nhave to reduce food stamp case loads by more than 40 percent just to \nmeet the cuts made in the block grant program.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is a pretty drastic approach. For those of us \nwho make a decent income and eat in the Senate dining room every day, \nor have lobbyists take us to one of these really nice restaurants \naround the Hill for lunch, it may come as a surprise to know that there \nare hungry kids in America. There are a lot of children out there who \ndo not get a good breakfast. They may get a good lunch, and it may be \ntheir only good meal of the day, because of the free and reduced price \nlunch program. And they go home and have an inadequate dinner that \nevening.\n  There have been a number of studies that have shown in the recent \npast that we have a lot of hungry kids in America. Take the school \nbreakfast program, one that I have been a strong proponent and advocate \nof for many years now.\n  At the outset, let me just say to my friend from Minnesota that he \ncomes from a strong heritage of advocates of a strong and sound \nnutrition program for our kids in America. I refer to his predecessor, \nSenator Hubert Humphrey. Also to former Senator Mondale, who fought \nlong and hard for these nutrition programs, and was successful in \ngetting them implemented.\n  The School Lunch Program was enacted in 1946. It has probably done \nmore to increase the productivity of America than any other single \nprogram we have adopted except perhaps the GI bill of rights. We sent \nour GI's to college. The school lunch program provided for millions of \nAmerican kids then, as it does today, the only nutritionally sound and \nadequate meal that they have during the day.\n  But then studies began to show that kids come to school in the \nmorning and they have not had a breakfast, and they become disruptive \nand unruly. They cannot study, they cannot focus. So we started the \nSchool Breakfast Program. The school breakfast program right now is \nonly available, I think, in fewer than half the Nation's schools that \noffer the lunch program. So it is not accessible to many children who \nneed it. Many of the schools do not offer it.\n  Studies have shown that children who participated in the school \nbreakfast program were found to have significantly higher standardized \nachievement test scores than eligible nonparticipants. Children getting \nschool breakfast also had significantly reduced absence and tardiness \nrates.\n  Now, we know that from a number of studies. We also know from a \nnumber of studies that children who have adequate nutrition, who have a \nbreakfast and a lunch program, who have the benefit of prenatal and \nearly childhood nutrition, have higher IQ levels. Now, we have seen \nrecent arguments that perhaps IQ levels are linked to ethnic \nbackground, or racial background, and all those kind of claims. That is \nbeing argued. But there is one thing that is clear.\n  Mr. DOLE. Will the Senator yield for a procedural question? I do not \nwant to interrupt the Senator's train of thought.\n  We would like to see if we could set a time for a vote on a motion to \ntable. I understand the Senator from Minnesota needs about 20 minutes. \nI do not know how much time the Senator from Iowa needs.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, 10 minutes. I am on a roll. I just want to \ngo through a couple of items here.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask that I might have at least 2 or 3 \nminutes before I move to table because it is something I am very \ninterested in.\n  I have been on the nutrition committees. I have gotten awards from \nFRAC, and I do not think this amendment belongs here. I want to make a \nbrief record.\n  So, maybe we could agree to vote at 6:10. That gives the Senator from \nMinnesota 20 minutes and the Senator from Iowa 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just have a few more points.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, we can vote at 6:10.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Knowing the Senator from Iowa well, I wonder if we \ncould plan on 6:15.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at 6:15 we vote on \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOLE. I would just like to have 2 or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader. \nThe Senator has been a strong supporter of nutrition programs, and I \ncan attest to that personally. I wish he would support this amendment. \nI am sure he will have something to say about that.\n  Mr. President, as I was saying, one thing that is unassailable and \nincontrovertible is that kids who do not have an adequate diet do \nsuffer lower IQ. A study reported in the Washington Post found that \nchildren suffering persistent poverty in their first 5 years of life \nhave IQs 9 points lower at age 5 than children who did not experience \npoverty. And we all know that poverty is closely tied to inadequate \ndiet, and inadequate food for kids in their early years.\n  We know, for example, from a study done by GAO, the cost \neffectiveness of our WIC programs. Every dollar invested in WIC \nprenatal assistance saves anywhere from $1.92 to $4.21 in Medicaid \ncosts. These are studies that have been done, and which document the \nvalue of sound nutrition for children.\n  In another study, GAO estimated the initial investment of $296 \nmillion in WIC prenatal assistance in 1990 would save over $1 billion \nin health and education expenditures over 18 years compared to the \ncosts for children who did not get this assistance. So we know children \nin poverty, children who do not get an adequate diet, who do not get \nthe school breakfast program, they have lower IQ's, they have lower \nattendance records at school, they are more disruptive, and they do not \nlearn properly.\n  We are going in the opposite direction with this so-called Personal \nResponsibility Act in terms of putting the nutrition programs into a \nblock grant\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\nand then cutting it. If 5 States, Texas, Louisiana, Washington, \nDelaware, and Maryland, plus the District of Columbia, lose 30 percent \nof their food assistance next year, how will they make it up? Who will \nthey cut? Well, they will cut the school breakfast program and other \nbasic nutrition programs for children. We are already hearing about \ncutting the school lunch program and making kids pay more and that kind \nof thing. I will have more to say about that as the year progresses. \nTalk about a noncost-effective approach. I say this is a so-called \nPersonal Responsibility Act because it is our responsibility here in \nCongress to make sure that kids are not denied adequate nutrition in \nour country. It has been a responsibility of the Federal Government \nsince 1946 when we enacted the school lunch program and subsequently \nenacted school breakfast programs, WIC programs, and other nutrition \nprograms, because we recognize a child who is poor and malnourished in \nTennessee is not just a responsibility of that State. That child who \ngrows up ill-educated with a lower IQ will not just be a burden on \nTennessee but that child could move to Iowa or Illinois, Minnesota or \nCalifornia. And in any event, the loss of that child's potential is a \nloss for our entire Nation. So the nutrition of our children is really \na problem for all of us as a Nation. We have looked upon it that way \nsince the school lunch program was enacted in 1946.\n  Personal responsibility? Yes, we have a responsibility in this \nCongress to make sure that all children have a good start in life. That \nmeans a good, solid WIC Program, prenatal programs, that we have a good \nbreakfast program for our kids in school, and a school lunch program, \nand a food stamp program--which is in fact a major child nutrition \nprogram.\n  Now, are there ways of streamlining and of cutting out waste, fraud \nand abuse? Sure there are. I think it has been about 17 years ago, as a \nMember of the other body, that this Senator advocated that we issue \nfood stamp recipients an ID card along with food stamps so that they \ncould not just go out and barter and sell food stamps on the streets \nfor drugs or whatever else. I advocated that in 1977. I was told there \nwas a problem with that idea and we could not do it then. We can do it \ntoday. If there are ways of streamlining the program, making people \nmore accountable, making the programs more cost-effective, that is \nfine.\n  Just to say that we will lump it all in a block grant, send it to the \nStates and then cut it, I think is the height of foolishness. I think \nthat would be more properly called the Personal Irresponsibility Act, \nif that is what we are about.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from Minnesota. He is right on target.\n  As I said, I know the majority leader has been a strong supporter of \nnutrition programs in the past. I would hope that he would not move to \ntable this amendment. I wish we had accepted it in the spirit it was \noffered, that is to make sure that we do no harm to these children who \nneed this kind of help and assistance.\n  Really, it is not just the children we are talking about. I think it \nis in our own best interest to ensure that our children have adequate \nnutrition. We can look at it selfishly. We want a more productive \nAmerica. We want to be able to compete in the world markets. We want to \nhave a better-educated populace. Then we certainly want to make sure \nour kids have an adequate diet early on in life.\n  I believe that is what the Senator from Minnesota is saying in his \namendment. Let us take care in the legislation that comes before us \nthat it does not impact adversely upon these kids. If we take away \nthese feeding programs for our poor kids in America today, it is like \neating our seed corn.\n  I cannot think of a better analogy than that. These kids are our \nfuture, and we better have the personal responsibility to understand \nthat the Federal Government has a role to play here and not abdicate \nthat responsibility.\n  So, again, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his amendment. I \nsupport it, and I certainly hope it will be adopted because I think it \nis in the best interest of this country.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n   (Purpose: To improve legislative accountability for the impact of \n                        legislation on children)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Iowa. \nThere is no Senator who knows these issues better. There is no Senator \nwho is a stronger advocate for children. It is my honor to have him out \non the floor speaking in behalf of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me now send the amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 14.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new title:\n\n               TITLE  --IMPACT OF LEGISLATION ON CHILDREN\n\n     SEC.  1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that Congress should not enact \n     or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n     SEC.  2. LEGISLATIVE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR IMPACT ON CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Duties of Congressional Committees.--The report \n     accompanying each bill or joint resolution of a public \n     character reported by any committee of the Senate or of the \n     House of Representatives shall contain a detailed analysis of \n     the probable impact of the bill or resolution on children, \n     including the impact on the number of children who are hungry \n     or homeless.\n       (b) Enforcement.--\n       (1) Senate.--It shall not be in order for the Senate to \n     consider any bill or joint resolution described in subsection \n     (a) that is reported by any committee of the Senate if the \n     report of the committee on the bill or resolution does not \n     comply with the provisions of subsection (a) on the objection \n     of any Senator.\n       (2) House of representatives.--It shall not be in order for \n     the House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that \n     waives the application of subsection (a) to a bill or joint \n     resolution described in subsection (a) that is reported by \n     any committee of the House of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, will the Senator just yield for about 2 \nminutes without losing his right to the floor?\n  I want to make one other point. There is so often the assertion some \nof these programs designed to attack poverty and hunger actually make \nthe problems worse. For the record, I am looking here at figures \nshowing that in 1960, the percent of American children below the age of \n18 living in poverty was 26.9 percent. By 1969, after the enactment of \na number of the programs addressing child poverty, that percentage went \ndown to 14 percent.

They have an effect and have a good effect of helping \nmove kids out of poverty. I just wanted to make that point for the \nRecord. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the names \nof the following organizations that support this amendment be printed \nin the Record: The NAACP, Children's Defense Fund, Leadership \nConference on Civil Rights, Food Research and Action Center, the \nNational Council of Churches, and the Religious Action Center of Reform \nJudaism. I ask that their names and the statements of these different \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statements were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Rabbi David Saperstein, Director, Religious Action Center \n                           of Reform Judiasm\n\n       The ultimate judgment of a nation--of its values, its \n     honor, its basic decency--rests upon how it treats its \n     children, for those children are its future. A nation that \n     neglects its children, that allows children to go hungry or \n     homeless, that fails adequately to educate its children, is a \n     nation that short-changes its future. For this reason, the \n     Union of American Hebrew Congregations, representing 850 \n     synagogues and 1.5 million Reform Jews, strongly supports the \n     proposed Sense of the Congress Resolution that Congress not \n     approve any legislation that will increase the number of \n     children who are homeless and hungry, and that requires a \n     child impact statement before Congress passes new \n     legislation.\n       In the zeal to reform government and to change the way \n     Congress works, members of Congress must not forget how many \n     of the actions they are now considering--how many of the \n     bills they work to pass, budgets they wish to cut, programs \n     they seek to eliminate--affect American children, and, thus, \n     our future. America already has too many homeless children \n     huddled and shivering against winter's chill without adequate \n     shelter, too many children whose young stomachs know too well \n     the empty pain of hunger, too many inadequately educated \n     children whose bright minds daily grow dull. Those who would \n     cut budgets in ways that harm children will cite the \n     financial benefits of their cuts, will claim that by reducing \n     the national deficit they are securing our future. But by \n     reducing that deficit by penalizing children--by making the \n     weakest and the least among us bear the burden of reform--\n     they only bleaken that future.\n       However much we may all disagree over the best solutions to \n     the problems America confronts, on this, at least, let us \n     find common ground: that our children--more than all our \n     industries combined, more than all our raw materials, more \n     than all our science and ingenuity--our children are our most \n     valuable and precious resource, and we must treat them \n     accordingly. We must protect our children from an \n     indiscriminate budget ax as resolutely as we would protect \n     them from violence. We must scrutinize cuts in programs for \n     children as carefully as we scrutinize cuts in defense \n     spending, for even the mightiest military will be useless if \n     our nation's children have no hope. Our children are meant to \n     walk with us the road to peace and freedom and prosperity; we \n     dare not walk that road to a better tomorrow while leaving \n     them trapped in a bleak, a cruel, today.\n       Each child's today is thousands of our tomorrows; nurture \n     these todays and you build those tomorrows; darken these \n     todays and you destroy those tomorrows.\n       So we urge all senators, regardless of political leanings, \n     to support this amendment and to abide by its principles; to \n     keep the children of America always in their minds; and to \n     recognize that short-changing children for short term \n     financial gain is to make a faustian bargain that will cost \n     this nation dearly down the road.\n       Our children reposit our dreams; we must not allow their \n     lives to be nightmares.\n       The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism is the \n     Washington office of the Union of American Hebrew \n     Congregations and represents 1.5 million Reform Jews in 850 \n     congregations throughout the United States and Canada.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Mary Anderson Cooper, Associate Director, Washington \n      Office, National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A.\n\n       We are pleased to support the efforts of the Senators who \n     have introduced legislation to require that Congress not \n     approve any legislation which will increase the number of \n     children who are hungry or homeless. This commitment to the \n     well-being of the nation's children is consistent with the \n     belief of the churches in our constituency that all people \n     have a right to food and shelter, and that we cannot relax \n     our vigilance when there is the prospect that children will \n     be allowed to go hungry and unprotected.\n       We are grateful for the initiative being undertaken today, \n     and we urge the Congress to enact this measure assuring that \n     no action undertaken by the House or Senate will increase the \n     number of hungry and homeless children in this nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement of Robert J. Fersh, President, Food Research & Action Center\n\n       I am pleased to support the resolution that Senator \n     Wellstone will introduce today to protect children from \n     hunger and homelessness. This resolution is timely because \n     there now are serious proposals before Congress that could \n     add dramatically to the numbers of children who experience \n     hunger and homelessness in this country.\n       FRAC is considered the leading national organization \n     advocating for more effective public policies to end hunger \n     in this country. Our analysis of H.R. 4, the Personal \n     Responsibility Act introduced in the House of \n     Representatives, leads us to believe that millions of \n     American children could lose essential school lunch, school \n     breakfast, WIC and food stamp benefits if the bill is \n     enacted.\n       The most fundamental threat to our children's well-being is \n     the proposal to replace the highly effective and successful \n     nutrition programs we have today with a block grant at \n     sharply reduced funding. This will lead not only to immediate \n     pain and suffering, but virtually guarantees that the \n     responsiveness to hunger and undernutrition will diminish in \n     years ahead.\n       We need a continuing Federal commitment to nutrition \n     programs that assures adequate funding and benefit levels. We \n     need programs that provide predictable funding levels and \n     assure that no matter where one lives in the United States, \n     there will be a safety net to prevent hunger.\n       We cannot have a situation where school administrators \n     never know how much support they will receive and opt out of \n     school feeding programs because of inconsistent funding. We \n     cannot have a situation where needy people in a State cannot \n     get help when they lose their jobs because their State has \n     too many people in need and too little money to serve them.\n       There are reforms and improvements that can be made to \n     improve the delivery of food assistance to vulnerable \n     citizens and to preserve the integrity of the programs.\n       But a drive to save Federal dollars and reinvent government \n     roles should not have as a consequence more hungry and \n     homeless children. Before this rush to chaos is approved, \n     Congress should take a careful look at our Nation's nutrition \n     programs. They have a highly successful track record of \n     improving the nutritional status of our most vulnerable \n     citizens. Failure to preserve these programs will exact a \n     high monetary and social cost from our society.\n       I offer our thanks to Senator Wellstone for introducing \n     this measure to assure that Congress has made a careful study \n     of the potential impact of its decisions on our most \n     vulnerable children.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Children's Defense Fund,\n\n                                                 January 10, 1995.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I applaud your efforts to make sure \n     that the members of Congress are informed about the probable \n     consequences to children of legislation they are considering.\n       Like you, I am very concerned that some of the actions the \n     Congress will be considering in the days ahead will, instead \n     of helping children, actually result in more children being \n     left behind--more hungry, more homeless, more without health \n     insurance, more who are poor. I believe that members of \n     Congress, if informed that an action they are contemplating \n     will actually hurt children, will not take such an action.\n       Your amendment ensures that members of Congress have the \n     official information upon which to base that determination. \n     This is, effectively, ``a children's right to have their \n     Congresspeople know'' amendment. Too often, the needs of \n     children, who don't vote or speak for themselves, are \n     invisible in the legislative process. At the very least, \n     children should be able to expect that Senators and \n     Representatives know the impact of their decisions upon \n     children before they act.\n       This is an amendment which every member of the Congress \n     should support. Thank you again for your leadership on this \n     very important issue for children.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Marian Wright Edelman.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that a \nstatement of Women Academics Concerned About Welfare be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S721]]\n\n\n\n          Statement of Women Academics Concerned About Welfare\n\n       (This statement was written and signed in response to the \n     Administration welfare ``reform'' bill introduced in the \n     summer of 1994, Spurred by this proposal Republicans are now \n     championing much worse barbarisms. We should not let \n     ourselves be driven into supporting the bad in the hopes of \n     fending off the worse. We stand against policies which \n     deprive poor children and scapegoat poor mothers. A politics \n     of blaming the poor fosters a downward cycle of \n     impoverishment, stigmatization, and despair.--Linda Gordon, \n     Frances Fox Piven, Louise Trubek, January 1995)\n       As women scholars who have studied welfare programs in the \n     United States and other democracies, and who share a concern \n     for poor women and children, we feel a responsibility to \n     speak out in opposition to the Clinton administration welfare \n     reform proposal.\n       The most publicized feature of the proposal is a two-year \n     lifetime limit on cash assistance from AFDC. The limit shreds \n     precisely that portion of our social safety net on which poor \n     women and children rely. Yet the evidence shows that the \n     majority of recipients do not stay on ``welfare'' very long \n     at one time, but turn to AFDC when they are forced to by work \n     of family emergencies. Many women also turn to welfare to \n     escape from domestic violence. A two-year limit would destroy \n     that lifeline.\n       The Bush administration began freely granting waivers \n     allowing the states to ``experiment with ``reforms,'' and the \n     Clinton administration is continuing this practice. Few of \n     these waivers concern true experiments or reforms. Instead, \n     reminiscent of the 19th century when welfare was a system of \n     disciplinary tutelage, they usually cut welfare grants which \n     are already everywhere below the poverty level. Some states \n     are reducing family benefits if a child is truant or if an \n     additional child is born. From the beginning of AFDC in 1935, \n     the federal government provided some protection against the \n     arbitrary ill-treatment of recipients by states and counties. \n     That protection should not be forfeited.\n       The effort to present a ``revenue-neutral'' welfare reform \n     has resulted in the ludicrous prospect of severe cutbacks in \n     programs that serve some of the poor in order to pay for \n     programs that will ostensibly help others of the poor. \n     Clearly this makes little moral or programmatic sense.\n       Just as troublesome as these programmatic initiatives is \n     the vilification of welfare recipients for lacking the values \n     of work and responsibility which has characterized the \n     Administration's talk about reform. This rhetoric undermines \n     respect for the hard and vital work that all women do as \n     parents. It is particularly egregious when direct against \n     poor single mothers who confront the triple burdens of \n     heading households, parenting, and eking out a livelihood. \n     Given the popular misimpression that welfare recipients are \n     overwhelmingly minority women, this pillorying of poor women \n     also contributes to racist stereotypes.\n       While women have always been consigned to low wage jobs, \n     the situation of working women trying to support children has \n     worsened dramatically in the last two decades as wage levels \n     plummeted. The Administration proposal is silent about that \n     problem.\n       Real welfare reform should be directed to ending poverty, \n     not welfare. We should strive for widely available day care, \n     medical insurance, and education, and for improvements in \n     working conditions and wages. At the same time we should \n     preserve the programs of social support--variously called \n     social security or welfare--that have been vital to the \n     safety, health and morale of millions of women, men, and \n     children in the U.S.\n\n\n             WOMEN ACADEMICS CONCERNED ABOUT WELFARE REFORM\n\n       Emily K.

Mr. President, one day in the life of American \nchildren, three children die from child abuse--this is the Children's \nDefense Fund report last year--nine murdered.\n  One day in the life of American children, 13 children die from guns; \n27 children--a classroomful--die from poverty; 30 children are wounded \nby guns.\n  One day in the life of American children, 63 babies die before they \nare 1 month old.\n  One day in the life of American children, 101 babies die before their \nfirst birthday; 145 babies are born at very low birth weight; 202 \nchildren are arrested for drug offenses; 307 children are arrested for \ncrimes of violence; 340 children are arrested for drinking or drunken \ndriving; 636 babies are born to women who had late or no prenatal care.\n  One day in the life of American children, 801 babies are born at low \nbirth weight; 1,234 children run away from home.\n  One day in the life of American children, 2,868 children are born \ninto poverty.\n  One day in the life of American children, 7,945 children are reported \nabused or neglected.\n  One day in the life of American children, 100,000 children are \nhomeless.\n  Mr. President, we had a rather amazing statement made by one of our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives that the reason there would \nbe no precise figures on precise cuts before a balanced budget \namendment is that Representatives and Senators, therefore, would not \nvote for that amendment. There is a reason for that.\n  By the most conservative Congressional Budget Office estimate, if you \nput Social Security in parentheses, if you do not cut the Pentagon, and \nif you have to pay the interest on the debt in order to get to where we \nare supposed to get to by the year 2002, we have to cut $1.2 trillion.\n  I say conservative estimate, because we are now in a bidding war to \nraise the military budget, the Pentagon budget, to the tune of maybe \n$50 billion over the next 5 years, and we are in a bidding war for more \nand more tax cuts. That is revenue lost. That just leaves certain areas \nof the budget where we can make the cuts. The arithmetic of this is \nvery clear and it is very compelling.\n  I do not present today on the floor of the Senate a sophisticated \neconometric model. There are all sorts of different variables to \nconsider. But I will tell you this: On present course--and we must \nchange that course--when you look at outlays 2002, in terms of where we \nare heading, and then you subtract Social Security, which will not be \ncut, you subtract the Pentagon budget with\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\na given percentage of the overall budget, and you subtract interest on \nthe debt and you look at a projected $319 billion deficit reduction \ntarget, that $319 billion is about one-third of what you have left to \ncut from.\n  So, Mr. President, we could be talking about, roughly speaking, 32-\npercent cuts. Maybe we will not have a 32-percent cut in veterans \nprograms. Maybe we will not have a 32-percent cut in Medicare. In \nMinnesota, that would mean a cut of $1 billion just in my State alone \nin Medicare. Maybe it will be more in child nutrition programs. Maybe \nit will be more in other children's programs.\n  I know that in Minnesota alone, by 2002 on present course, we can see \n$145 million taken out of the following essential food assistance \nprograms. This is not precise, but this is the direction we are going \nin: Food stamps, aid to women, infants, and children, and nutrition \nprograms for the elderly, and the School Lunch Program.\n  I said it before and I am going to say it again. A Food Research and \nAction Council 1991 report, 5.5 million children under 12 years of age \nare hungry in the United States of America. U.S. Council of Mayors' \nstatus report on Hunger and Homelessness in American Cities 1994 \nestimates 26 percent that were homeless. The increase of the \npopulation, 26 percent, I believe, of the homeless population were \nchildren. National Academy of Sciences, 100,000 children are homeless \neach day in our country.\n  Mr. President, if we continue on the present course and say we are \nnot going to cut the military contractors; no, we do not want to do \nthat; they have a lot of power. Heaven forbid that we do anything about \noil company subsidies or coal or gas or all sorts of other subsidies. \nHeaven forbid that as we think about how to contain health care costs, \ninsurance companies and pharmaceutical companies are part of the \nsacrifice. All that is off the table.\n  Willie Sutton was asked, Why did you go rob the banks? He said, \nThat's where the money was. In this Contract With America, we are going \nto make cuts that affect the most vulnerable among the citizens in our \ncountry, and they are children because they do not make the large \ncontributions, they do not lobby every day, and they do not have the \npolitical power of some of these other interests.\n  Mr. President, again, today in Minnesota, 100 to 150 citizens, many \nof them children, at a press conference, a number of the organizations, \nChildren's Defense Fund and others that have worked with children and \nhave such credibility for their work, were making predictions on where \nwe are going to be in 2002 with this Contract With America as it is \nimplemented: 29,150 babies, preschoolers and pregnant women would lose \ninfant formula and other WIC nutrition supplements; 31,000--actually, I \nthink it is 51,500--children would lose food stamps; 154,600 children \nwould lose free or subsidized school lunch programs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that every Senator take a look at his or her \nState and ask the question: What exactly is going to happen here? If we \nare going to cut these programs that affect children in the country, \neither it becomes a shell game and our States then have to pick up the \ncost through a sales tax or a property tax, or the food shelves go \nbare, we see a rise in hunger, we see a rise in homelessness, and we \nsee a rise in poverty among children in this country.\n  I said it once and I am going to say it again tonight before this \nvote: I come from a State, as the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin \nsaid, with a rich tradition of care and commitment for and to children. \nSenator Hubert Humphrey personified that better than any other Senator \ncould.\n  Senator Humphrey said the test of government and society is how we \ntreat people in the dawn of life, and he meant the children; and in the \ntwilight of life, and he meant the elderly; and in the shadow of their \nlife, and he meant people struggling with an illness or struggling with \na disability or those that were poor.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, one out of every four children in \nAmerica are poor; one out of every two children of color are born into \npoverty today.\n  Mr. President, I heard the majority leader say two things, one with \nwhich I agree and one with which I am in profound disagreement. The \nfirst thing he said was that he has a history of concern and a history \nof commitment when it comes to nutritional programs and children in \nAmerica, and he is absolutely correct. For that I pay him my greatest \nrespect.\n  But, Mr. President, the second point that the majority leader made \nwas that somehow the timing is not right, this is not the right time.\n  Now, I am not today going to do an analysis of the number of \namendments that have been brought to the floor on different bills which \nmay or may not have been a part of those bills by some sort of test of \ngermaneness or relevancy. Believe me you, there have been many brought \nto this floor, and certainly by now the current majority party.\n  That is not my point. My point is that Senators bring amendments to \nthe floor, just so that people who are watching this debate are clear, \nbecause of timing. If you think an amendment is important and you think \nthat the timing of it is critical, that is when you do it.\n  Now, before we rush headlong into legislation that is going to hurt \nchildren in this country, why is the time not right for the Senate to \ngo on record that it is the sense of the Congress that Congress should \nnot enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number of \nchildren who are hungry or homeless? Why is not the time right for the \nSenate to go on record that with our committees, when we report bills \nout, there will be reports accompanying those bills which will spell \nout the impact of that legislation on children in America?\n  Tomorrow and the next day the timing is not right, the majority \nleader says. Tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, and I am not \nsure how many days afterwards we are going to be talking about unfunded \nmandates and we are going to be talking about precisely this; that when \nlegislation comes out of committee there will be a cost-benefit \nanalysis, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Mr. President, if we can say that we ought to do an impact analysis \nof legislation on State governments and county governments and city \ngovernments and corporations or small businesses, can we not today at \nthe beginning of the session before we get into this agenda and start \npassing legislation, especially legislation that is going to hurt \nchildren, pass a piece of legislation in the form of this amendment \nthat says no, we are not going to do anything, we are not going to do \nanything that will increase the number of children who are hungry or \nhomeless?\n  Has it come to the point that the Senate is unwilling to go on record \nsaying that? Is it not timely for us to say that today? I say to my \ncolleagues in a nice way, I am sure that you listen to all your \nconstituents. And since I am sure you do, you must realize that there \nare many people in this country who believe that we are about to go \nthrough some cuts that are going to hurt those citizens who are the \nmost vulnerable in this country.\n  Now, I have had colleagues disagree with me, and they have said you \nare sounding an alarm but not based upon any serious problem. Mr. \nPresident, all you have to do, for those who have said no, we are not \ngoing to do that, I would say why then do you not support this \namendment?\n  Mr. President, I have to say to the majority leader and my \ncolleagues, I cannot believe that you are trying to make the argument \nthat the timing is not right for this. Why is it not time for the \nSenate to make it clear we are not going to enact or adopt any \nlegislation that will increase the number of children who are hungry or \nhomeless? Why is it not time for us to make a commitment to children \nand make it clear that we will have a child impact statement which goes \nwith legislation reported out of committee as to how that legislation \nwill affect children?\n  I say to my colleagues that if you vote against this today, you \ncertainly are sending a message loud and clear. And what you are saying \nto people around this country is, yes, you all have reason to be \nfearful and you have reason to worry and you have reason for some \nindignation that we are about to make some cuts that are going to hurt \nthe most vulnerable citizens in the United States of America, children, \nbecause we are unwilling to go on record otherwise.\n  What do you mean the timing is not right today? When is the timing \ngoing\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\nto be right? When is the timing going to be right? And I say to my \ncolleagues, yes--I say this to the Senator from Iowa, because I so \nappreciate his grassroots approach to politics--populism is alive in \nAmerica. People are in an anti-status-quo mood, and people voted for \nchange.\n  But, Mr. President and my colleagues, there is a tremendous amount of \ngoodness in the United States of America. People did not vote to cut \nnutrition programs for children. People did not vote for legislation \nthat could increase the number of children who are hungry or the number \nof children who are homeless.\n  I say to my colleagues, if you do not think there is some compassion \nin this Nation, and you do not think there is some sense of fairness in \nthis Nation, and you do not think there is some sense of justice in \nthis Nation, then you are profoundly wrong.\n  I hope the majority leader does not come out here and move to table \nthis amendment, which is all about congressional accountability. I want \nthe Senate to go on record and be accountable that we will not enact or \nadopt any legislation that will increase the number of children who are \nhungry or homeless. But if the majority leader should come out and move \nto table, and we have a straight party-line vote, I sort of wonder when \nsome of my colleagues--I know I have in the past not necessarily voted \nwith leadership--are going to sort of vote exactly what they believe. I \ncannot believe there is not anybody on the majority side of the aisle \nwho does not support this amendment on its merits.\n  But if it is voted down, then, Mr. President, I wish to say to my \ncolleagues tonight I will bring this amendment up in the Senate over \nand over again. It will be up on the unfunded mandates bill and it will \nbe up on every piece of legislation, because I am going to hold my \ncolleagues accountable on this.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The minority manager of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota. I compliment him for bringing \nthis up.\n  If people just look at the wording in this bill, it is not some wild-\neyed thing. It is not something that requires us to do a great deal \nmore work than we are otherwise going to have to do.\n  Let me read what the sense of the Congress is.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that Congress should not \n     enact or adopt any legislation that will increase the number \n     of children who are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Now, I cannot conceivably think that any Senator would take just the \nopposite view and say that it is the sense of the Congress that we \nshould adopt legislation that would increase the number of children who \nare hungry or homeless, and it would be ludicrous to think anybody \nwould do that. So why something of this nature could not be supported I \ndo not know. We would not even consider the opposite and say we will \nadopt legislation that will increase the hungry or homeless. All this \nsays is that Congress has to be careful and not do something \ninadvertently that will increase the number of children who are hungry \nor homeless.\n  Now, the second part of it:\n\n       Section 2. Accountability. Duties of Congressional \n     committees.\n\n  Pretty simple really.\n\n       A report accompanying each bill or joint resolution of a \n     public character reported by any committee of the Senate or \n     of the House of Representatives shall contain a detailed \n     analysis of the probable impact of the bill or resolution on \n     children, including the impact on the number of children who \n     are hungry or homeless.\n\n  Now, I would say that with probably 90 percent or more of the \nlegislation that goes through here, that requirement will mean \npractically no work at all for the committee. If you are on the Energy \nCommittee or whatever other committee, it is going to be pretty simple \nto say no, there is no direct impact on hungry or homeless children.\n  But if, for those committees that deal with things where there is an \nimpact, then at that time it would seem to me that we had better be \nlooking at it, because we certainly do not want to add to the problems \nwe already have with the number of children who are hungry or homeless. \nThe rest is simple. It says that you cannot consider a bill, the same \nthing for the House, and so on, and the rest is very simple.\n  I think it would be difficult to vote against something that just \nsays we will not adopt legislation that will increase the number of \nchildren who are hungry or homeless. I do not see this as adding a big \nburden to our committee activity around here at all. There will be very \nfew committees. Where some legislation is passed, it would definitely \nhave a negative impact on the number of children who are hungry or \nhomeless.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Senator from Minnesota, and I \nam glad to support him on this.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I do not know quite what this amendment \ndoes. Well, it does not do anything; that is what it does. I have been \na member of the Nutrition Committee for years. I worked with Senator \nMcGovern from South Dakota. We repealed the requirements of the food \nstamp law that require people to put up money, and things of that kind. \nIt may have been a mistake. We thought we were doing the right thing. \nWe worked a lot on the nutrition and school lunch programs and WIC \nprograms. I do not know that we can pass laws here that say--I do not \nknow who will count these people every day, or every week, or every \nmonth. We do not know, if the law is passed, what the economy is going \nto be. This all ought to be discussed when we have the budget before \nus.\n  We are talking about dollars here, because there is no way we are \ngoing to be able to tell, if the law passes, whether somebody would be \nhungry in America or one more might be hungry. That is the import of \nthis, even though it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It is not \nbinding.\n  We are trying to cover Congress here with all the laws we inflict on \neverybody else in America. We have had a dozen amendments that have \nnothing to do with that at all. The American people want us to be an \nexample, not part of the problem. We will be an example if we cover \nourselves with laws that we inflict on small businessmen and women in \nMinnesota, Iowa, Ohio, Kansas, Vermont, Pennsylvania, or wherever it \nmay be.\n  The House did this in 20 minutes, as I said. This is our 4th day on \nthis bill because of all of these extraneous amendments. I understand \nthat this is an opportunity to offer a lot of amendments and make the \nRepublicans look heartless and cold, and all this. This is not going to \nwork. The American people want us to cover ourselves. Every day we wait \nis another day it is not going to happen. I will be just, I hope, as \ndiligent as the Senator from Minnesota when it comes to children's \nprograms or nutrition programs. For that reason, I will move to table \nthe amendment.\n  We want to finish this bill quickly. We have agreed that at 6:15, we \ncould either vote up or down or on a motion in relation to the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the Congressional Accountability Act. This legislation is \nvery much needed and I would like to commend Senator Grassley and the \nmany others who have played a role in developing S. 2, for all the work \nthey have done in assembling this bipartisan measure. I believe the \nsupport this bill has from both sides of the aisle is a testament to \ntheir work and to the desire of the American people to have the \nCongress live by the laws it creates.\n  I have long stated my belief that a government which governs best is \nclosest to the people. Conversely, a government which begins to drift, \nand separate itself from those for whom it works is likely to forget \nthe needs and wants of its citizens. For far too long we have seen the \nCongress drift in such a direction. S. 2 will help correct this \nsituation and put us back on course.\n  Last spring, I joined several of my colleagues in Russia where we met \nwith our legislative counterparts in the fledgling democracy. Do you \nknow what two of the most prized documents in Russia are today? It is \ncopies of the Constitution of the United States and the Federalist \nPapers.\n  In Federalist 57, James Madison--the father of our Constitution--\nwarned that if the American people ``tolerate a law not obligatory on \nthe legislature as well as on the people, the people will be prepared \nto tolerate anything but liberty.'' In essence, he was saying if the \ntime comes when the people accept a legislature which does not live by \nthe laws it passes, the people will have lost their freedom. The idea \nthat the government shall not have rules which distinguishes it from \nthe people, is the critical connection between the rulers and the \nruled, and establishes a communion of understanding and sympathy.\n  Well, Mr. President, is it any wonder why public opinion ratings of \nCongress are significantly low? The general public doesn't feel \nCongress is in touch with the issues which impact their daily lives. In \nliving outside the limits of the same workplace laws it imposes on \nothers, the Congress has lost touch.\n  Whenever I visit with Idaho business owners and operators, their \nfrustrations with Federal workplace regulations quickly enter into the \nconversation. In fact, one of my first acts as a Member of this body \nwas to help a small company in Boise which had been fined due to the \noverzealous and misguided application of Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration regulations. I saw first-hand the problems small \nbusinesses face in trying to meet the demands of the Federal \nbureaucracy. I also came to better understand the frustration these \nsame businessmen and women feel when they find Congress has \nconveniently exempted itself from those same rules.\n  The Congressional Accountability Act will correct this. By providing \ncongressional employees--approximately 39,000 of whom will be impacted \nby the legislation--with the same protections which exist in the \nprivate sector, Congress no longer will be allowed to set the rules for \nothers without setting them for themselves as well. This will place us \nsquarely on track to follow the form of government intended by the \nFounding Fathers and which later generations fought so hard to \npreserve. This is the first step toward once again giving us a \ngovernment which is ``of the people, by the people, and for the \npeople'' rather than one which is over the people, at the people, and \nin spite of the people.\n  Some would argue that the estimated annual cost of the bill of \nbetween $4 and $5 million is reason enough to oppose this legislation. \nYes, the additional cost of complying with the laws included in S. 2 is \nsomething we should keep in mind, but it is also something which should \nhave been kept in mind when these laws were originally passed for the \nprivate sector. Either the expense of a law is too high for the public \nor private sector to justify enactment or it is not. We cannot, in good \nconscience, claim workplace laws are too expensive for the Congress \nwhile at the same time claiming they are sufficiently affordable for \nthe Nation's business owners and entrepreneurs. It is my hope enactment \nof S. 2 will serve as an impetus for Members of Congress, in their own \nself-interest, to thoroughly examine the ramifications of any \nlegislation we consider prior to passing it. In so doing, we will also \ngain a better understanding of what we are asking of others.\n  Mr. President, we have before us an opportunity to show the people we \nserve just how serious we are about reforming Congress. In passing the \nCongressional Accountability Act we will take solid action to show the \nAmerican people that we are a part of the Nation, not a separate entity \nwhich is above the law. We can, in one easy step, take a significant \nstride toward restoring public confidence in the legislative branch, \nopening the door to a more responsive and attentive government in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this past year, I created a Small \nBusiness Advocacy Council in New Mexico. Its purpose was to advise me \nabout the problems of small businesses and how, together, we might be \nable to resolve some of their critical concerns.\n  This council held seven meetings in six locations throughout the \nState of New Mexico, with more than 400 small businesses participating. \nThey vented their concerns, and most of their issues centered on what \nappeared to them to be: First, an adversarial relationship between the \nFederal Government and business; and second, the lack of accountability \nof regulatory agencies and their work with business.\n  Underlying these two categories of problems, however, is the basic \nissue that we, in Congress, simply do not understand what is passed on \nto them in the way of laws and regulations.\n  To the people in my State of New Mexico, it appears that Congress--no \nmatter how well-intentioned--simply passes the laws and exempts itself \nfrom their application. The public certainly has had a right to ask us: \nWhy? If these laws are important, if they provide protections for an \nemployee, if they provide benefits for an employee, why doesn't \nCongress think they are equally important and applicable to itself and \nto its employees?\n  Like any unfunded mandate, Congress passes along to others the \nresponsibility of implementing the law; and, if the law is ignored or \ndisobeyed, to pay the penalty.\n  These rules, regulations, and laws are good enough for everyone else, \nbut it appears that Congress, itself, is too good for them.\n  The businesses in my State complain about the inefficiency, the loss \nof productivity, and the loss of revenue when they must implement \nhundreds of laws and regulations. They rightfully argue that if we \nsubjected ourselves to the same requirements, we might understand more \nfully the implications of these mandates.\n  They are correct. When we pass a law to extend family and medical \nleave, for example, it is not just about an employee's absence and \nredistributing the workload, it is also about creation of a specific \nand precise set of office bookkeeping programs and procedures.\n  This does not mean that a sick leave policy is a superfluous one. \nHowever, few of us recognize the underlying management issues that must \nbe instituted--that it takes people to manage these systems and that it \ntakes funds to do so. We never think about it because we do not have to \nworry about implementing the laws or paying a penalty if we fail to \nact.\n  Now, with passage of this bill, we are going to have an opportunity \nto assess the secondary effects of these laws. We,\n\n[[Page S726]]\n\ntoo, will be subject to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the \nFederal Labor Management Relations Act, the Worker Adjustment and \nRetraining Notification Act, and many others.\n  We will now better understand what many of our constituents have been \ncomplaining about--not the basic social good of these laws--but, \nrather, what it takes to carry them out and the resulting impacts on \nproductivity, time, and costs. I suggest we may find that we have been \nimposing laws that are often inconvenient, impractical, and costly. \nMost important, we will recognize that the ability to carry on our work \nwith creativity and flexibility will be sorely tested, if not severely \ninhibited.\n  We are going to be able to determine for ourselves if there are ways \nto bring about equitable conditions in the workplace while ensuring we \ndo not impose unrealistic reporting responsibilities or inefficient \nmethods of management. We will find out that we have been very \nfortunate, indeed, to occasionally sweep problems under the rug because \nwe know there will be no enforcement of any penalty to pay for \nnoncompliance. And, we will now understand the complaint that ``form \nover substance'' often becomes a priority for getting the job done.\n  Like many other conditions in life, we have to first look at our own \nhouse before we make demands on others. This bill will now make that \noversight much more understandable, and, frankly, more equitable. I \nbelieve that we will have more empathy for those who have extended \ntheir legitimate complaints to us. And, I believe that we will now have \nthe opportunity to reassess whether we can make reasonable changes that \nserve the interests of the workplace and its employees while lessening \nthe costs and day-to-day burdens on the employer.\n  This measure is an important one. For many years the American public \nhas asked us to ``do unto ourselves what we do unto others.'' Its time \nhas come, and I am pleased to support this bill wholeheartedly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Congressional Accountability Act, which I am proud to cosponsor. \nThis bill is about a simple principle: What is good enough for the \nAmerican people ought to be good enough for Congress. There should be \nno double standard for elected officials in Washington.\n  The Congressional Accountability Act will begin to bring Congress \nunder the jurisdiction of the laws it passes. Some of my colleagues who \nsupport this bill say that living under the laws we pass will \ndiscourage us from passing more laws because we will see how horrible \nthey really are. I disagree with that view 100 percent.\n  I support the Congressional Accountability Act because I want my \nemployees to enjoy the full protection of the laws of the United States \nof America. Among other laws, this bill will make Congress subject to \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, which sets minimum wages and work \nstandards for our employees. This bill brings Congress under the \njurisdiction of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which \nguarantees that our employees will not labor in unsafe conditions. It \nbrings Congress under the jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Acts, so our \nemployees will have protection from job discrimination on the basis of \nrace, religion, and sex, and it will give them legal protection from \nsexual harassment.\n  This bill brings Congress under these laws and several others, \nincluding the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the \nRehabilitation Act.\n  Mr. President, congressional employees deserve better than to take \ntheir complaints of sexual harassment to congressionally-established \nbureaucracies. They deserve the right to press their complaints to the \ndistrict court. This bill will give them that right.\n  Mr. President, the laws covered in this bill are good laws and I am \nglad that my employees will enjoy their full protection. When we pass \nthis bill, Congress will no longer be the last plantation. We will no \nlonger live by a different set of rules than the rest of the country.\n  While I support this bill strongly and will vote for its passage, I \nwish to take this opportunity to state my disappointment that several \nimportant reform measures were tabled by the Republican majority. In \nthe past week, initiatives to restrict gifts to Members of Congress and \nto limit lobbyists' contributions to Federal candidates were defeated \nlargely along party-line votes. Amendments to limit the personal use of \ncampaign funds and to end the McCarthy-esque practice of subjecting \ncongressional employees to political litmus tests also were defeated by \nour friends across the aisle. Each of these amendments would have \nstrengthened this bill, and I am very disappointed they were dismissed \nso easily.\n  Despite this reservation, I am pleased that we are finally acting on \ncongressional accountability legislation. Last year, when this bill was \nstalled by endless debate, I said:\n\n       The American people are demanding that Congress change the \n     way it does business. They want reform now--not next session \n     or next year. So let's move this bill forward and vote on it \n     before the end of the year.\n\n  In my view, Mr. President, we are a few months late in acting on this \nimportant legislation, but there remains an urgent need to pass it. I \nurge my colleagues to respond to the American people's demands for \nchange by passing this important bill.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I rise to voice my support for \nlegislation that takes one more small step in reforming Congress. While \nwords such as ``accountability,'' ``responsibility,'' and \n``restoration'' are used to describe almost every legislative proposal, \nS. 2 offers us the real opportunity to restore accountability.\n  As you know, Mr. President, S. 2 will apply labor, civil rights, and \nworkplace laws to Congress. I strongly believe that Congress should \nfollow the laws it writes. Congressional coverage is a necessity. \nCongress is not above the laws that it passes for the rest of the \nNation.\n  Mr. President, this is not the first time congressional coverage \nlegislation has been proposed. In the 103d Congress, I supported S. \n2071, which was sponsored by Senators Lieberman and Grassley. \nUnfortunately, the bill was blocked from floor consideration. In fact I \nhave voted for similar congressional coverage on other occasions as \nwell. In 1990 and 1992, during consideration of civil rights \nlegislation, I supported extending many of these laws to Congress.\n  I am deeply disappointed, however, that the amendment regarding gifts \nto Members of Congress was defeated in a partisan vote. The gift \namendment was designed to treat Congress like the executive branch of \ngovernment; to remove any suspicion that Members of Congress are \nreceiving special favors for legislative activities. That reform \namendment would have truly made Congress more accountable to the \npublic. Many say that the November election was about a revolution and \nthat the public has demanded that Congress change the way it does \nbusiness. We had an opportunity to make such an important change, and I \nbelieve we let the public down. I hope we will revisit this issue again \nthis year, and that we will find the courage to adopt real gift reform \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 2, and any amendments that will \nstrengthen S. 2 to make it even more true to the concept of \naccountability. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2, the Congressional \nAccountability Act, which will require Congress to live by the same \nlaws and regulations under which it requires businesses and individuals \nin the private sector to operate.\n  S. 2 is the first in a series of bills the Republican-led 104th \nCongress will take up to respond to the mandate the citizens of this \ncountry sent to Congress last November. That mandate calls for Congress \nto take action to make this institution more accountable to the people \nand to produce a smaller, less intrusive, and more efficient \ngovernment.\n  Step one of this important mandate is S. 2, a bill to apply all the \nmajor labor, safety, and antidiscrimination laws to Congress. Making \nCongress live under the same laws it imposes on private sector \nbusinesses is simply a matter of fairness. Congress has exempted itself \nfrom these laws for over 50 years, but today, under new congressional \nleadership, this institution will no\n\n[[Page S727]]\n\nlonger apply one very different standard to itself and one to business \nand individuals.\n  Congressional employees will now have the same legal protections as \nemployees in the private sector. Currently, congressional employees \ncannot bring suit in Federal district court. But, with passage of the \nCongressional Accountability Act congressional workers for the first \ntime may bring a private action in Federal district court against \nCongress. Currently, House staff members have no rights of judicial \nreview and Senate staffers can, after a lengthy internal process, take \nto the Federal circuit court of appeals complaints about decisions made \nby the Chamber's internal Office of Fair Employment Practices.\n  As I traveled the State over the past year, from Yuma to Flagstaff to \nCottonwood, the subject of congressional accountability evoked strong \nreactions from the citizens of Arizona. Their message was clear: \nCongress currently operates above the very laws it imposes on the \npeople and that must change. Arizonans want their congressional \nRepresentatives and Senators accountable. They not only want, they \ndemand passage of the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  Grassroots support for congressional accountability certainly \nevolved, to some degree, out of a desire for fair treatment of the over \n23,000 workers on the congressional payroll. But, by and large, what I \nhave heard from small business owners and, yes, workers across Arizona \nis that Congress passes well-intentioned safety, labor, et cetera laws \nbut they are often unrealistic and irrational. Business owners and \nworkers believe Congress should feel the burden of these laws and \nregulations just as businesses across America feel the burden.\n  It is these regulations and laws that get in the way of business \nowners and workers carrying out their respective purposes and earning \nan honest living. For example, Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration [OSHA] regulations require businesses to post employee \ninjuries. A company faces a fine if a list is not posted, even if there \nhave been no injuries. Businesses are also often required to fill out \nsafety data sheets, which show how a company will handle various \nhazardous materials, for such simple substances as dishwashing liquid \nor even chalk. It is for violating these regulations that small \nbusinesses often face hefty fines from OSHA. Since Congress passed \nthese laws and regulations, however, it should be subject to their \nimplementation--to, for example, random OSHA site inspections that \noften result in unnecessary fines and burdensome paperwork. The \nCongressional Accountability Act will force Congress to adhere to the \nsame regulations and pay the same fines, however unwise, as every other \nprivate business in America. Again, that is what is fair. And, that is \nwhat will give Members and Senators a better practical understanding of \nthe laws and regulations it passes--in the end, I believe, it is this \nforced compliance and practical understanding of our Nation's civil \nrights, labor and safety laws that will result in the repeal or \nmodification of the ones that are burdensome, ill-drafted, or \nunnecessary to ensuring the safety and labor rights of our Nation's \nworkers.\n\n  As John Motley of the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nstated so well in a recent letter to me\n\n       When Congress exempts itself from burdensome laws, it sets \n     itself above the people it governs. A small business owner \n     who fails to comply with these laws must face the full weight \n     of the Federal Government. Congress will only understand the \n     effect of the laws they impose on America's entrepreneurs and \n     job creators if they are required to live under the very same \n     laws.\n\n  Under S. 2, the 11 major safety and labor laws that are either \ncompletely or partially inapplicable now will apply to Congress. Those \n11 laws are the Federal Labor Standards Act of 1964, and VII of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993, OSHA, the Federal Service Labor \nManagement Relations Act, the Employee Protection Act, the Worker \nAdjustment and Retraining Notification Act and the Veterans \nReemployment Act.\n  Congressional coverage will not be limited to those 11 laws. Under S. \n2, all future legislation must include a report to describe how it \napplies to Congress or to describe why it does not. Consideration of a \nbill on the House or Senate floor would not be permitted if the bill \nreport lacked such a statement. When the Congress knows that it must \nadhere to the provisions of whatever future legislation it passes, it \nwill more likely pass legislation respecting the rights of individuals \nand businesses.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Accountability Act will not only \nmake the U.S. Congress a better employer, it will show the American \npeople that we understand the unfairness of existing congressional \nexemptions. The old saying, ``Do as I say, not as I do,'' will no \nlonger apply to this institution because Congress will be living \naccording to the same laws as others.\n  Passage of this bill completes an important first step up the ladder \nof change the American people have demanded. I am pleased to be a part \nof a national commitment to fundamentally changing the way business is \nconducted here in Washington, DC, and I urge my colleagues, without \ndelay, to pass S. 2.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S707-2", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S727-S729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF ROBERT E.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to go into \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of Mr. Robert E. Rubin to \nbe Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Robert E. Rubin of New York to \nbe Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to vote.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I have known Bob Rubin for many years. He is \na man of honesty and integrity who is certainly qualified to be \nTreasury Secretary.\n  Mr. Rubin has an excellent background as a lawyer, an investment \nbanker, and most recently as the assistant to the President for \neconomic policy.\n  His reputation on Wall Street, and more recently here in Washington, \nDC portrays a man who is not only hard-working and capable--but an \neffective consensus builder.\n  As we heard this morning in the Senate Finance Committee hearing, Bob \nRubin is rare in that he has shown humility, and his self-effacing \nattitude toward getting things done has earned the respect of many of \nus on Capitol Hill.\n  If his frank and candid performance at the Senate Finance Committee \nis any indication of how he will serve as the Secretary of the \nTreasury, I believe that the U.S. Congress will have a Secretary who is \nnot only capable, but will listen to us and engage in dialog that will \nbe honest and fair.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nwholeheartedly supporting Robert E. Rubin for the position of Secretary \nof the Treasury. I have no doubt but that Bob will serve our country \nwith a steadiness and honor similar to that evidenced by my old friend, \nand our former Senate colleague, outgoing Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.\n  I believe that Mr. Rubin has a full understanding and appreciation of \nthe critical link between spiraling entitlement spending and the \nchallenge of deficit reduction. I also believe that he shares my \nopinion that all tinkering at the margin of deficit reduction, such as \neliminating Federal spending for a tse-tse fly program, or Lawrence \nWelk's boyhood home, or even foreign aid, or eliminating ``Waste, Fraud \nand Abuse,'' will do little to slow future deficit growth so long as \nentitlement spending remains unreformed.\n  This morning during Mr. Rubin's testimony before the Finance \nCommittee, he assured the committee that deficit reduction was on the \nadministration's\n\n[[Page S728]]\n\nlist of priorities, although not its top priority. One reason he gave \nfor this ordering of priorities was that annual deficits were poised to \nshrink in the short term. That is true, but this is only because of a \ntemporary lull in the growth of the number of retired Americans, a \ntrend which will reverse at the end of this decade and set deficits \nsoaring again. I urge Mr. Rubin and the administration to thoughtfully \nreview that priority list and reconsider placing deficit reduction at \nthe very top. If we postpone our commitment to deficit-reduction, the \nchoices facing us later will be grievous.\n\n  I have spoken with Mr. Rubin about my commitment to deficit reduction \nand entitlement reform, and he has responded by citing anew the \nadministration's commitment to health care reform. I was pleased that \nhe made clear that it would be unrealistic to expect that a huge new \nentitlement such as was presented in last year's Health Security Act \nwould pass this Congress. We agreed that incremental reform was a far \nmore realistic goal, and he spoke first about the necessity of cost \ncontainment in any health care reform package. I was pleased by that. \nToo often health care reform pitches are given in terms of what \nwonderful promises the Government is going to make in the area of \nexpanded coverage, as opposed to the tough choices which must be made \nto reduce cost growth. Mr. Rubin focused first on cost containment in \nhis comments to me, and I took favorable notice of that emphasis.\n  Mr. Rubin's credentials are well known to the Finance Committee and \nto the Senate, and there is no significant opposition that I know of to \nhis nomination, aimed either at his qualifications or his temperament. \nHe is clearly an outstanding choice and I commend the Senate for \napproving his nomination.\n  Mr. MOYHIHAN. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Committee on \nFinance, I join my distinguished colleague, the newly installed \nchairman of that committee, in recommending in the strongest terms that \nthe Senate vote to confirm the nomination of Robert E. Rubin as \nSecretary of the Treasury. The Committee on Finance reported out his \nnomination earlier today, with a favorable recommendation.\n  As Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and head of the \nNational Economic Council, Mr. Rubin was one of the principal \narchitects of the administration plan, enacted in 1993, to get our \nNation's fiscal house in order. As a result, we have witnessed 3 \nstraight years of declining deficits--the first time that has happened \nsince the administration of Harry S. Truman. The deficit for the 1994 \nfiscal year, which ended last September 30, is $100 billion lower than \nit would have been without the 1993 deficit reduction legislation; that \nis, the deficit had been projected to be over $300 billion; with the \n1993 act changes, it has been reduced to $203 billion.\n  This serious, indeed historic, undertaking to reduce the deficit has \nhad its rewards. Enactment of the 1993 deficit reduction legislation \nproduced the lowest interest rates in 20 years. In the 2 years since \nPresident Clinton, took office, 5.6 million new jobs have been created; \nthe unemployment rate during this period has dropped from 7.1 to 5.4 \npercent. There has been an average growth in real GDP of 3.5 percent \nper year. And with the exception of 1986, when oil prices plummeted, \nthe economy has experienced the lowest inflation rates since the \n1960's.\n  Mr. Rubin played a key role in these accomplishments, and the country \nis fortunate to have him take the helm at Treasury. He has been \ninvolved professionally in matters involving financial markets and the \nnational and international economy for over 28 years, first in a series \nof positions in the distinguished investment banking house of Goldman \nSachs, culminating in the cochairmship of the firm, and more recently \nin his economic policy role in the administration.\n  I was heartened to hear at this morning's hearing Mr. Rubin emphasize \nhis commitment to Treasury's important law enforcement mission.\n  I believe I reflect the view of every member of the Committee on \nFinance in enthusiastically urging his confirmation as the next \nTreasury Secretary. Should he be confirmed, he will be the 68th \nindividual to occupy that post and, I might add, the 13th New Yorker--a \nNew Yorker by professional and civic association, even if he was reared \nin Florida.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of \nRobert E. Rubin as the next Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Robert E. Rubin, of New York, to be \nSecretary of the Treasury.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I am delighted that we have shown a \nunanimous vote of confidence--we did in the Finance Committee this \nmorning--in Bob Rubin to be Secretary of the Treasury. He is an \neminently qualified man.\n  I have had occasion to talk with him over the last 2 years from time \nto time, but one of my best memories of him was when he and I were \nspeaking at a conference in Williamsburg, a conference by and large of \nbusiness leaders and chief executive officers and boards of directors \nof the larger corporations in America. I though he handled with great \naplomb a particular question.\n  One questioner got up and said, ``Mr. Rubin, you asked us to come to \nthe aid of the administration last year and to lobby hard on behalf of \nthe North American Free-Trade Agreement. You asked us to spend a lot of \nmoney and effort and manpower to support the administration in that \neffort, isn't that correct?''\n  And he said, ``Yes, sir''\n  And then the questioner said, ``Why is it then you won't let us \ndeduct the expenses for that lobbying on behalf of the \nadministration?''\n  To Mr. Rubin's credit he said, ``Sir, I cannot give you a good answer \nto that question.''\n  I thought, rather than trying to finesse that, that was as good an \nanswer as you could give. I flew back on the plane with him from the \nconference that day, complimented him on the answer, and also \ncomplimented him on one other thing.\n  Most people do not realize outside the beltway that Mr. Rubin, for \nthe last 2 years, has been at a very significant and powerful position, \nand the reason they do not realize it is he did not use that position \nto appear on the Sunday morning talk shows or to give interviews. He \nwas very much a behind-the-scenes operator, feeling it was not his \nplace to garner publicity. In the position for which he has just been \nconfirmed, he will no longer be able to have that kind of anonymity. He \nis going to have to appear on behalf of the President and this \nadministration and this country.\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\n  I am proud to know him, proud to have supported him, and I am \ndelighted that the Senate has given him a unanimous vote of approval.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President be immediately notified of \nthe confirmation of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I should like to join my dear friend and \nonce again my chairman, the Senator from Oregon, for having so \ngraciously handled this important, if not indeed, Mr. President, \nurgent, nomination at the earliest possible time, in the second week of \nthe Congress.\n  The Committee on Finance met this morning. We may have hit upon an \ninnovation, Mr. President. This morning we voted to confirm Mr. Rubin, \nand then we asked questions of him. This evening we voted to confirm \nhim and then we are making speeches about our action. This might \nexpedite procedures very considerably.\n  But this is a fortunate moment; at a time when a Secretary of the \nTreasury is urgently needed, we have a message which goes out to the \nNation and to the world that an officer of the Cabinet with fullest \nconfidence of the Senate has been confirmed directly.\n  Senator Packwood was kind enough to mention the work of Mr. Rubin as \nchairman of the National Economic Council for the past 2 years. It \nwould not be wrong to note that during that period we have created 5.6 \nmillion new jobs in the Nation. We have had an average growth of real \ngross domestic product of 3.5 percent. We have had an extraordinary \nrecovery in which the rest of the world we hope will now join with us. \nAnd we have had 3 years running a declining deficit, the first time it \nhappened since the Presidency of Harry S. Truman coming off the Second \nWorld War.\n  I would note sir, Mr. Rubin will be the 68th Secretary of the \nTreasury. Of these 13 have been from New York. We might also add \nNicholas Brady and Douglas Dillon, but they chose to live in New \nJersey.\n  But this is a special moment for all of us. I congratulate the \nSecretary as he now is.\n  I thank the chairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S727-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD.

Mr. President, let me read you the opening line of a \nstory in this morning's Missoulian:\n\n       Phil Tawney, a staunch wildlife supporter, environmental \n     activist and a Democratic party mainstay for more than two \n     decades, died in Missoula, Monday afternoon of complications \n     from leukemia.\n\n  It is a short, stark, sentence. It gets the essential facts. It is \ngood journalism. But this time, it leaves out everything.\n  Phil Tawney was a big man. A man whose soul was great enough to unite \nand transcend opposites. In Phil, passion for the great cause, united \nwith reason and judgment in the details of legislation. Deep concern \nfor the future joined with great joy in the present. Boundless \nidealism, met practical, hands-on knowhow.\n  As much as any person I have known, Phil represented what I believe \nis best about Montana. If you knew Phil, you were inspired by his love \nof Montana, his idealism, his integrity, and his courage in battling \nthe leukemia that took his life.\n  Phil's Montana was Normal Maclean's Montana: A land of vast open \nspaces, and mist hanging in narrow mountain passes; of biting winds in \nthe winter and dazzling sun in the Big Sky summer; of the elk hunts \nPhil took each fall; of snow that crunches under your boots, and \nmuscular fish hanging at the bottom of streams so powerful that even a \nman as big and strong as Phil has trouble keeping his feet. Phil did as \nmuch as any Montanan of our time to preserve this land for his children \nand ours.\n  For over two decades--from the day in 1973, when at the age of 23, \nPhil and his wife Robin founded the Montana Environmental Information \nCenter until yesterday--Phil was perhaps the leading influence on our \nState's fish, wildlife, and habitat protection programs. His ideas on \nstream preservation and mine reclamation became Montana law, and models \nfor the Nation. Most recently, as a lawyer for the Rocky Mountain Elk \nFoundation, he worked with me to preserve thousands of acres of elk \nhabitat north of Yellowstone National Park.\n  Through these years, Phil was always the source of good humor and \nsteady, solid advice. He believed in people.\n  And throughout his involvement in politics and the conservation \nmovement, he understood something we could all live by in this town. He \nunderstood that reasonable people could disagree without being \ndisagreeable.\n  All this would have been extraordinary by itself. But Phil also had a \nsuccessful legal practice. He served with distinction as the executive \ndirector of the Montana Democratic Party. And most important of all, \nPhil was a devoted husband to Robin and father to his children Land, \nMikal, and Whitney.\n  He was always thinking about what he could do for somebody else. For \na friend. For his family. For posterity. Never for himself. And perhaps \nbecause he never thought about himself, while his life may have been \nshort it was fine and full. That is why, as Missoula Mayor Kemmis said \nlast night, somehow Phil always made you feel good about just being \nalive.\n  Mr. President, it is a terrible loss. Phil Tawney takes leave of his \nfamily and friends much too soon. But with us forever is a mighty \nlegacy, and a challenge to match his commitment and achievement with \nour own.\n  I imagine Phil departing with a smile and some words of encouragement \nfor the rest of us--like Valiant at the close of the Pilgrim's \nProgress:\n\n       ``My sword, I give to him that shall succeed me in my \n     pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it. \n     My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me, \n     that I have fought his battles, who will now be my \n     rewarder.'' So he passed over, and the trumpets sounded for \n     him on the other side.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my sad duty to inform my \ncolleagues that this morning the president pro tempore of the Vermont \nSenate was killed in an automobile accident. He was a good friend of \nmine and will long be remembered.\n  In my home State of Vermont, a calling to join the legal profession \nhas historically been taken as a calling to public service. No family \nhas taken that more seriously than the Bloomers of Rutland, VT.\n  Asa Bloomer, legendary trial lawyer and rhetoritician, served his \ncommunity well in the Vermont State Senate. In his heyday, in the \n1950's and early 1960's, he was the acknowledged single source of power \nin the Vermont Senate. He rose to the rank of president pro tempore, a \npost he held at the time of his death, in 1963, suffering a heart \nattack in the legislative halls. He was a close friend of my father's, \nand brought me into close contact with the Bloomer family.\n  Quite naturally, his older son Bob, a lawyer, followed his father to \nthe senate where he served with distinction. Then his brother, a fellow \nlawyer and good friend, John Bloomer, ran for, and was elected to, the \nVermont Senate; 2 years ago he was elected as was his father, as \npresident pro tempore of the senate. He held that position until this \nmorning, when enroute to the State House in Montipelier to preside at \nan important meeting of his judiciary committee, his life was \ntragically taken in an automobile accident. His dedication to his tasks \nin Montipelier\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\nwas well measured by the fact that his failure to appear for the very \nstart of the meeting was taken by his colleagues as a dire portent of \nbad news. John Bloomer was never late.\n  A pall was immediately cast over the State House as the Vermont and \nAmerican flags were lowered to half staff in the brilliant sunshine of \na chill and crystal clear subzero Vermont morning. John Bloomer, \nRepublican senator, was immediately remembered as John Bloomer, dear \nfriend.\n  Margaret Lucenti, a liberal Democrat who served well with John as \nclerk of his judiciary committee, said, ``He was just a wonderful human \nbeing, a friend to everyone.''\n  For me, a fellow member with John of the Rutland County Bar \nAssociation, he was a dear and trusted friend. I knew him for as long \nas I can remember. I will never, ever forget him.\n  He was a true inspiration to all of us who knew him. John Bloomer was \na man of strong convictions that were always tempered by compassion. As \nwe remember his long years of service to Vermont, we will fondly recall \nhis countless deeds of kindness to fellow Vermonters.\n  My sympathies go out to his wife, Judy, to his brother, and to all \nhis four children and to his countless friends, of which I am proud to \ncount myself one.\n  He well carried on the Bloomer family tradition of service to the \nState of Vermont. Our State will miss him, as a tireless public servant \nand as a caring and concerned human being. And I will miss him as a \ntrue friend.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. EXON.

Mr. President, at the beginning of the second session \nof the 103d Congress, I began what became a weekly routine of reporting \nto the Senate on the number of homicides committed by gunshot in New \nYork City. Not surprisingly, the numbers were shocking. In 1994, a \ntotal of 910 victims were shot to death. That is an average of over 17 \neach week. Many more sustained serious injuries from bullet wounds.\n  As of Sunday, January 8, 1995, 21 people had been shot to death in \nNew York City. That despite the frigid weather, which often serves as a \ndeterrent to violent crime. Obviously, the problem is not going away.\n  It is unfortunate that I need to remind my colleagues of these grim \nstatistics. But until we begin to take meaningful steps to remedy this \nappalling situation, I plan to continue my practice of reporting each \nweek on the terrible death toll by gunshot in New York City.\n  Thankfully, there is some good news to report. The number of those \nwho lost their lives to gunshot in New York City last year is \nsubstantially lower than the number in 1993, which was 1,450. The bad \nnews is that national totals are still on the rise. In 1993, the most \nrecent year for which statistics are available, 16,189 people were \nkilled by firearms, nearly 1,000 more than in the previous year.\n  We made some important gains in our fight against gun violence in the \n103d Congress. First we passed the Brady law in November 1993. Since \nthen we have prevented thousands of fugitives and felons from illegally \npurchasing guns. Second, as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994, which was signed by President Clinton on \nSeptember 13, 1994, the Senate agreed to a ban on 19 types of \nsemiautomatic assault weapons. That same bill also included a provision \nsponsored by the Senator from New York banning a new class of cop-\nkiller bullets capable of piercing the soft body armor worn by law \nenforcement officials.\n  We need to continue to enact tough laws that will begin to curb the \nplague of gun violence. But with some 200 million firearms in \ncirculation today, and with an estimated 5,479 new ones hitting the \nstreets each day, it seems obvious that gun control can ultimately have \nonly limited success. That is why I have long advocated ammunition \ncontrol as the best solution to the epidemic of gun violence. While we \nhave a supply of guns that will last us well into the next century, if \nnot longer, we have perhaps only a 3- or 4-year supply of ammunition. \nThe obvious solution, then, is to control the supply of bullets, \nparticularly those used most often in the commission of crimes.\n  On the first day of the 104th Congress, I introduced six bills, some \nof which I had introduced in previous Congresses, relating to the \nsubject of ammunition control. Some of these place bans on certain \nrounds of ammunition, including the deadly Black Talon bullet. Others \nheavily tax these pernicious bullets. A final bill requires records to \nbe kept with respect to the disposition of ammunition and commissions a \nnational study on the use of bullets. Currently, there are no reporting \nrequirements for manufacturers or importers of ammunition. We need to \nknow how much of what kinds of ammunition are being produced in order \nto help us craft more intelligent policy in this area.\n  Mr. President, 1994 saw too many tragic incidents involving guns. \nMany occurred right here in the city of Washington. Doubtless, many \nmore will occur in 1995. We can, and must, do something about this \nwithout delay. I urge my colleagues to support the measures which I \nhave introduced.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to \ntake a major step toward making Congress more accountable to the people \nby passing S. 2, the bill before us, the Congressional Accountability \nAct of 1995.\n  Let us face it. It is easier to make up a set of rules for someone \nelse to play by than to devise guidelines for our own actions. It is \neasy to pontificate: Do as I say, not as I do.\n  And that is what we have been doing right here in the U.S. Congress. \nCongress has been exempting itself from the laws and regulations that \neverybody else in America has to live with.\n  Unlike their Government, the people measure such laws against a \nyardstick of common sense. If a law or regulation is a good idea for \neverybody else in America, surely the public good requires that it be \nimposed across the board right here.\n  As it is, individuals find these laws and regulations more and more \nonerous. The rules have grown so cumbersome that they now hamper \nbusiness, small and large, and make everything we buy more expensive.\n  I do not know. Many of our rules make the goods we hope to export \nmore expensive, threatening our ability to compete in the world \nmarkets.\n  Until now, Congress has totally avoided any firsthand experience with \nthe results of its own rulemaking. But last week the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives fired the first shot in what will be a real revolution \nin Government. It passed its version of the Congressional \nAccountability Act. I hope the Senate will continue the mission and put \nthis bill on the President's desk.\n  By making congressional accountability our very first order of \nbusiness, the first legislation to pass this new session, with so much \nhope we will be sending a clear message to the American people. Signal \nreceived. Congress will comply with the same mandates it imposes on the \nrest of the country.\n  Mr. President, I have owned my own small business. I know the Senator \nin the chair has as well. I know what it is like to make a payroll. I \nknow what it is like to comply with Federal regulations and State \nregulations and local regulations and still try to squeeze out\n\n[[Page S731]]\n\nthat profit in order to make my business go and to create new jobs, to \nhave new markets, to do more. I have felt, personally, the effects of \nFederal laws and regulations. I did not like it when I was in business \nand I surely do not like it now. I think it is high time that the \nCongress experience firsthand the consequences of the laws it passes.\n  Lincoln spoke of government of the people, by the people, for the \npeople. If we in Congress continue passing laws by which we need not \nabide, we will not be living up to Lincoln's expectation nor that of \nthe American people today.\n  As was made clear at the polls in November of last year, the voters \nbelieve that Congress has given itself special treatment. Members of \nCongress seem to be insensitive to the actual impact and costs that we \nimpose on the people who are trying to make this economy go.\n  Mr. President, we must pass the Congressional Accountability Act. We \nmust let the people know that we in Congress are their representatives. \nThat we are not going to be part of a government which just extends \nprivilege to a very few and rests its heavy hand on the rest.\n  By applying the same rules to ourselves that we do to the rest of the \ncountry, Congress will better understand the pain of unfunded mandates. \nCongress will be forced to comply with the thousands of regulations \nregarding Government workplace safety and recordkeeping. Congress will \nbe forced to experience the financial burden and the nuisance value of \nsome of the laws that have been passed through the years in this Hall. \nMembers of Congress will be made to ask themselves, how is this law \ngoing to affect me? Imagine what this will do to the content of the \nbills that come hereafter.\n  I hope that Congress will show that we did make a difference in \nNovember of last year by voting for the Congressional Accountability \nAct. I am going to try to vote to reduce the number of unwanted, \nunneeded, and downright destructive laws in the future because I think \nwhen Congress starts thinking about what impact this is going to have \non the way we are doing business right here, maybe we will take a \ndifferent approach. Once we have a taste of the bitter medicine we are \nputting out, maybe we can rewrite the prescription.\n  We have an opportunity to put Congress back in touch with what this \ncountry truly needs. Less regulation, fewer laws, and less overall \nFederal meddling.\n  So I ask my colleagues in the Senate to do what I think should be the \nvery first order of business when we have this breath of fresh air that \nhas gone across our country, and when the people have spoken, that we \nsay to the people ``message received,'' and vote for S. 2, the \nCongressional Accountability Act that will make Congress understand and \nlive with the laws that everybody else in America has been living with \nfor year after year, day after day, month after month, and maybe, just \nmaybe, it will affect the overall output of this body.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act with \nrespect to purchases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by entities \nin the insular areas of the United States, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   the emergency petroleum supply act\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency \nPetroleum Supply Act, a bill to ensure that Hawaii has access to the \nstrategic petroleum reserve during an oil supply disruption. The \nEmergency Petroleum Supply Act would guarantee Hawaii oil--at a fair \nprice--and give tankers bound for Hawaii priority loading during an \nemergency.\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\n  This legislation passed the Senate in each of the previous two \nCongresses. During the 104th Congress, I will aggressively work to see \nthis legislation enacted into law.\n  The objective of my bill can be summed up in one word: access. \nBecause of its tremendous distance from the gulf coast, Hawaii needs \nguaranteed access to the strategic petroleum reserve [SPR], as well as \npriority access to the SPR loading docks.\n  My bill addresses both these concerns. First, it provides a mechanism \nto guarantee an award of SPR oil. Hawaii's energy companies would be \nable to submit binding offers for a fixed quantity of oil at a price \nequal to the average of all successful bids. This concept is modeled \nafter the Federal Government's method of selling Treasury bills. It \nwould give Hawaii ready access to emergency oil supplies at a price \nthat is fair to the Government. Without this bill, Hawaii's energy \ncompanies, and the population they serve, face the risk that their bid \nfor SPR oil would be rejected and that oil inventories would run dry.\n\n  The second component of my bill addresses the problem of delay. The \nEmergency Petroleum Supply Act grants ships delivering petroleum to \nHawaii expedited access to SPR loading docks. It would be a terrible \nmisfortune if deliveries to Hawaii were delayed because the tanker \nscheduled to carry emergency supplies was moored in the Gulf of Mexico, \nwaiting in line for access to the SPR loading docks.\n  As any grade-school geography student can tell you, Hawaii is a long \nway from the Gulf of Mexico, especially when you have to transit the \nPanama Canal. The distance between the SPR loading docks and Honolulu, \nby way of the canal, is 7,000 miles--more than one-quarter of the \ndistance around the globe.\n  But distance alone is not the issue. When you add together the time \nbetween the decision to draw down the reserve and the time for oil from \nthe reserve to actually reach our shores, the seriousness of the \nproblem emerges. It takes time to solicit and accept bids for SPR oil, \ntime to locate and position tankers, time for tankers to wait in line \nto gain access to SPR loading docks, and more time to transit the canal \nto Hawaii. Obviously, Hawaii is at the end of a very, very long supply \nline. People overlook the fact that insular areas have a limited supply \nof petroleum products on hand at any one time. While Hawaii waited for \nemergency supplies to arrive, oil inventories could run dry and our \neconomy could grind to a halt.\n  Last year, the Department of Energy asked Hawaii's East-West Center \nto study this problem. The East-West Center report concluded that my \nSPR access measure ``is an excellent proposal which would greatly \nreassure the islands that their basic needs would be maintained.'' I \nask that a summary of the report be placed in the Record following my \nremarks. I will also place a copy of Energy Secretary O'Leary's letter \nin support of the Emergency Petroleum Supply Act in the record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The East-West Center report provides strong justification for \ngranting Hawaii special access to SPR oil during an energy emergency. \nThe report found that a major oil supply disruption would have a much \nmore severe impact on the Pacific islands than on the rest of the \nUnited States. Although all of Asia would experience inflation and \nrecession, the small economies of the insular areas would be virtually \nunprotected from volatile economic forces. While the rest of the United \nStates does not have to rely on ocean transport from other nations for \nessential goods and services, the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific \nislands are heavily dependent on ocean-borne trade and foreign \nvisitors.\n  The need for this provision is further justified by a December 1993 \nDepartment of Energy/State of Hawaii analysis of Hawaii's energy \nsecurity which found the following:\n\n       Hawaii depends on imported oil for over 92% of its energy. \n     This makes Hawaii the most vulnerable state in the Nation to \n     the disruption of its economy and way of life in the event of \n     a disruption of the world oil market or rapid oil price \n     increases.\n       Currently, 40% of Hawaii's oil comes from Alaska and the \n     remainder from the Asia-Pacific region. The export \n     capabilities of these domestic and foreign sources of supply \n     are projected to decline by approximately 50 percent by the \n     year 2000. This will likely increase Hawaii's dependence on \n     oil the reserves of the politically unstable Middle East.\n       Hawaii is also vulnerable to possible supply disruptions in \n     the event of a crisis. The long distance from the U.S. \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, combined \n     with a declining number of U.S.-flag tankers capable of \n     transiting the Panama Canal, make timely emergency deliveries \n     problematic.\n\n  Other studies have consistently verified Hawaii's energy \nvulnerability and its need for special access to the SPR. An analysis \nby Mr. Bruce Wilson, an accomplished oil economist, determined that the \ndelivery of SPR oil to Hawaii from the Gulf of Mexico would take as \nlong as 53 days. That exceeds the state's average commercial working \ninventory by 23 days. As Mr. Wilson's research demonstrates, an oil \nsupply disruption is Hawaii's greatest nightmare.\n  Opponents of the Emergency Petroleum Supply Act insist that market \nforces will ensure that Hawaii and the territories receive the oil they \nneed during an energy emergency. Unfortunately, these are the same \nmarket forces that cause Hawaii's consumers to pay 50 percent more for \na gallon of gasoline than consumers pay on the mainland. And when a \ncrisis hits, our energy prices could easily double or triple.\n  Hawaii may be the 50th State, but we deserve the same degree of \nenergy security that the rest of the Nation enjoys. It's simply a \nmatter of equity. Hawaii's tax dollars help fill and maintain the \nreserve; Hawaii should enjoy the energy security the SPR is designed to \nprovide.\n  My bill will safeguard Hawaii from the harsh economic consequences of \nan oil emergency. The Emergency Petroleum Supply Act is not only good \nenergy policy, it's good economic policy for Hawaii.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 186\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to provide you with Department \n     of Energy views on S.     , the ``Emergency Petroleum Supply \n     Act,'' introduced by Senator Akaka.\n       S.     , would amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \n     to give certain preferences to the State of Hawaii and \n     several other insular territories and possessions of the \n     United States in the event of a drawdown and sale from the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       The Department has worked closely with Senator Akaka's \n     staff to understand the concerns of the State and the intent \n     of the legislation, and to help make the bill technically \n     sound. Based upon these discussions, a number of changes to \n     the bill have been made. As redrafted, the legislation would \n     apply solely to Hawaii. It would allow the State, or a \n     company with a refinery on Hawaii with which Hawaii has a \n     contract, to submit a bid for Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     petroleum product that is assured of receiving an award at \n     the average price paid for the same product by other \n     successful bidders. The bill also would provide that Hawaii \n     be given first priority for scheduling deliveries of oil that \n     is purchased from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n       The State of Hawaii always has believed that it is more \n     vulnerable to oil supply disruptions than the mainland due to \n     its high level of dependence on oil in general and its \n     distance from sources of supply and from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve. The provisions of this bill that would \n     assure Hawaii of supply and allow for timely delivery will \n     satisfy the State that it is receiving protection for Hawaii \n     commensurate with that offered to the U.S. mainland by the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve. At the same time, the Department \n     is satisfied that it will receive full market value for the \n     oil that it sells to Hawaii, that the quantity directed to \n     Hawaii will not materially reduce the volume available to \n     other locations, and that the process of making the award and \n     delivering the oil will not be an unreasonable administrative \n     burden.\n       For these reasons, the Department of Energy supports the \n     amendment offered by Senator Akaka during the Committee's \n     consideration of S. 2251, to amend and extend the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the submission of this report for the \n     consideration of the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hazel R. O'Leary.\n                                  ____\n\n\nEnergy Vulnerability Assessment for the U.S. Pacific Islands, the East/\n                        West Center, April 1994\n\n\n        oil supply disruption scenarios for the pacific islands\n\n       The following sections describe the potential oil supply \n     disruptions scenarios provided by the USDOE for this report, \n     the likely impacts of these supply disruptions on the island \n     economies, and selected response issues. The discussions \n     parallel those in chapters 4 to 7, which also discuss \n     vulnerability response options for the individual island \n     entities. The response issues which are discussed below \n     reflect the larger economies of scale which can be gained by \n     linking Guam, the CNMI, Palau, and American Samoa. Hawaii and \n     the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands should also be included in any regional \n     groupings because they are also part of the same oil supply \n     system. Unfortunately, the terms of reference for this report \n     did not allow for assessment of these island entities.\n       Three oil supply disruption scenarios for the Pacific \n     islands are discussed below and evaluated with respect to \n     their potential impacts. Figures 2.16, 2.17, and 2.18 provide \n     the basis for the assessment. The three scenarios are all \n     estimated to last six months and include:\n       Scenario I: Major disruption caused by major political \n     turmoil affecting Middle Eastern and Asian producers with a \n     net loss of 4.5 MMBD (9.0 MMBD production loss minus 4.5 MMBD \n     drawdown of global strategic petroleum reserve).\n       Scenario II: Medium-scale disruption caused by simultaneous \n     upheaval in West African and Latin American producers with a \n     net loss 4.5 MMBD (production loss of 6.0 MMBD minus SPR \n     drawdown of 1.5 MMBD).\n       Scenario III: Minor disruption based on limited upheaval in \n     the Middle East with a loss of 2.0 MMBD (production loss of \n     4.3 MMBD minus production increase by other countries of 2.3 \n     MMBD).\n       Before discussing the specific scenarios, several \n     historical reference points should be noted. First, the Asian \n     market is a net importer of oil sourced largely from the \n     Middle East. Second, during previous oil crises, Asian \n     producers such as Indonesia and Malaysia have not diverted \n     supplies. Instead, Asian producers have generally given \n     preference to traditional markets, including Singapore, for \n     their products. Third, most Asian refineries such as those in \n     Singapore are configured to process Middle Eastern crudes and \n     are not as well adapted to refining the lighter, sweeter West \n     African crudes and the heavier, more sour Latin American \n     crudes. In other words, Asia's refining capacity is geared \n     towards supplies from the Middle East, and substitutes are \n     not readily available or easily incorporated. The scenarios \n     are discussed below beginning in reverse order.\n\n                     Scenario III: Minor Disruption\n\n       Under Scenario III, there would be no redirection of Asian \n     oil supplies. Impact on U.S. West Coast supplies would be \n     negligible. However, there would be a drop of 10 percent in \n     supplies for Singapore (approximately 100 to 150 MBD), and a \n     similar reduction in Australia and New Zealand crude imports. \n     The result is an anticipated shortfall of approximately 10 \n     percent for the Pacific islands region.\n       The effects of this 10 percent shortfall are considered \n     minimal. Oil price rises would be very modest and there \n     should be no appreciable negative secondary effects for the \n     islands region such as a major decline in tourism.\n       No official response measures would need to be instituted. \n     However, it is recommended that monitoring of supplies and \n     prices should be carried out. It is also recommended that \n     utilities, the oil industry, and governments promote energy \n     conservation programs, including voluntary measures by the \n     population to reduce consumption of electricity and gasoline.\n\n                     Scenario II: Medium Disruption\n\n       Although the volume of oil lost to the market is \n     considerable (4.5 MMBD), because the West African and Latin \n     American producers are linked to other markets, the Asia-\n     Pacific region would be only slightly affected. There would \n     be some redirection of Middle Eastern supplies, but it is \n     anticipated that the net effect would lead to only a 10 \n     percent decrease in supplies for Singapore, Australia and New \n     Zealand. Similarly, the effect on the U.S. West Coast would \n     be minimal.\n       The results and response measures for Scenario II are \n     identical to those described above for Scenario III.\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n\n\n                      Scenario I: Major Disruption\n\n       A global net loss of 4.5 MMBD based on major political \n     upheaval in the Middle East and Asia and includes a total \n     loss of 2.5 MMBD from Asia oil producers would affect various \n     Pacific Rim markets very differently. The direct impact on \n     U.S. West Coast supplies would be fairly limited (e.g., 5 \n     percent or less) because imports have only a small role in \n     that market. The direct and indirect effects on supplies to \n     Australia and New Zealand should be relatively modest, \n     approximating a 10 percent decline. The Singapore refiners, \n     however, would be severely affected.\n       In this scenario, Singapore would experience a 30 percent \n     loss in Asian supplies. The cutback in Middle Eastern \n     production would result in additional 20 percent decrease. \n     The combined loss of 50 percent would greatly affect the \n     islands region both directly and indirectly.\n       Directly, the islands region would lose at least 50 percent \n     of its supplies from Singapore. Australia would be able to \n     provide some additional supplies, but it would also have to \n     compensate for its own loss of supplies. The net loss to the \n     islands region could well be in the range of 25 to 50 \n     percent.\n       A secondary impact would be significant price hikes. Under \n     Scenario I, spot prices on the Singapore market would soar. \n     Price doubling and even tripling would be likely outcomes. In \n     the 1979/80 period, the crisis centered on Iran led to an \n     additional 20 percent increase in prices. The short-term \n     consequences of the 1979 oil price rise lead to inflation \n     rates of 7.5 percent in Japan, 11 percent in Australia, 15 \n     percent in Fiji and nearly 30 percent in Tonga and Vanuatu. \n     In other words, inflation rates in some of the islands nearly \n     doubled. If the 1979 experience is applied, it would be \n     reasonable to anticipate a near doubling of inflation rates \n     for Guam, the CNMI and Palau.\n       Compounding the direct supply and price effects of Scenario \n     I, the political complications of the oil supply disruption \n     have to be considered. Following the onset of the recent \n     Persian Gulf War, the Iraqi President threatened to attack \n     U.S. territory and economic interests throughout the world, \n     and there had been several reports of terrorist activity by \n     Iraqis in Asia which heightened concern. As a result, Guam, \n     the CNMI, and Hawaii experienced a downturn in tourism \n     immediately following the outbreak of the 1991 Gulf War \n     because tourists were frightened to fly to U.S. territory. \n     Whether fact or only perception, people reduce their \n     international travel even to relatively ``safe'' destinations \n     during crisis periods: if there is political upheaval in a \n     major Middle Eastern or Asian nation, international business \n     and tourist travel will be restricted in order to reduce the \n     vulnerability to terrorist attacks.\n       Interestingly, the number of tourists to Guam and the CNMI \n     began to revive soon after the Gulf War and by early 1992 \n     tourist arrivals were at record levels. However, in September \n     1992, Typhoon Omar struck Guam and the CNMI and was followed \n     by several other typhoons. The result was a drop of nearly 45 \n     percent in the level of Guam's tourist arrivals, a loss of \n     1,500 jobs, and a substantial decline in tax revenues, all of \n     which have been greatly compounded by the continuing slump in \n     the Japanese economy.\n       These effects would probably be similar to the effects of \n     an oil supply disruption under Scenario I. Although difficult \n     to predict with any level of certainty, tourist arrivals \n     could fall sharply (by as much as 50 percent) if a political \n     upheaval in Asia elevated fears of international terrorist \n     activity and/or resulted in higher travel costs. The near-\n     term effects would be a loss of jobs by roughly 5 percent and \n     a fall in tax revenues by a similar level. However, if a \n     recession were to follow, and this would be a likely outcome, \n     then the downturn would be much more severe and could easily \n     double the effects of the crisis.\n       With Scenario I, it is very likely that in addition to oil \n     supply shortfalls, oil price increases, inflation, and \n     reduced levels of international tourism resulting from the \n     political upheaval causing the oil supply disruption, a \n     recessionary period in the major economies would ensue. The \n     effects of a major recession would again greatly affect the \n     island economies through reduced levels of tourism and \n     reduced demand for their exports, mainly fresh and canned \n     seafoods. As an example, the 1973/74 oil price rise led to \n     global recession, including a severe downturn in Australia \n     which greatly reduced the levels of Australian tourists to \n     Fiji. In other words, a severe oil supply disruption creates \n     downstream effects which are not felt for several months yet \n     may continue for several years.\n       Two key questions emerge under Scenario I. The first is \n     whether the islands would experience more severe impacts than \n     the rest of the United States. Although all of Asia would \n     experience inflation and recession, the islands' small open \n     economies would be virtually unprotected from the global \n     market: nearly all food and all medicine are imported. The \n     economies are nearly totally dependent on off-island trade \n     and international tourism; with the exception of Hawaii, the \n     rest of the United States does not have to rely on ocean \n     transport and other nations for essential goods and services. \n     In sum, there would be no territory of the United States more \n     severely affected by a major Asian oil supply disruption than \n     the Pacific islands.\n       The second question is how to respond with short-term \n     measures to meet basic demands for petroleum. Oil price and \n     supply monitoring and voluntary conservation programs would \n     be insufficient responses to a disruption of this magnitude. \n     With respect to the oil supply, the U.S. West Coast could \n     divert some of its supplies to the islands. The Australian \n     arrangement for the South Pacific islands may provide a \n     useful guide. In the event of an oil supply disruption which \n     results in a net market loss of crude oil or petroleum \n     products of 7 percent of the total International Energy \n     Agency (IEA) market, the IEA member may elect to activate the \n     Emergency Oil Sharing System, the objective of which is to \n     ensure fair sharing of available supplies among the IEA group \n     of countries (the OECD minus France). As a member of the IEA, \n     Australia is committed to take certain demand restraint \n     measures should the IEA Emergency Oil Sharing Scheme go into \n     effect. The demand restraint is measured as a percentage \n     decrease in total consumption, including traditional exports. \n     This means that if a 10 percent demand restraint measure is \n     instituted, then Australia has to cut its combined own \n     consumption and traditional exports by 10 percent.\n       The Australian arrangement covers the independent island \n     nations sourced from Australia. It does not cover American \n     Samoa or any of the North Pacific nations and territories \n     sourced via Guam, including the Federated States of \n     Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. These \n     nations and territories either have to secure emergency \n     supplies via Singapore or from a nontraditional supplier, the \n     United States.\n       The United States via its military infrastructure has \n     considerable levels of stocks in the Asia-Pacific region as \n     well as the shipping capacity to deliver supplies. However, \n     as Figure 3.2 shows, the military is cutting back on its \n     commercially leased storage capacity and is also shutting \n     down some of its own storage facilities in certain locations.\n       Another potential source of crude petroleum is Papua New \n     Guinea whose oil production is now at 135,000 b/d. Currently \n     refined throughout the Asia Pacific region, this crude \n     resource could provide a substantial margin of safety for the \n     Pacific islands. A 30,000 b/d refinery has been approved by \n     the government and could be operating in 1996.\n       Through the supply capacities of the oil companies \n     operating in the region, other regional suppliers, and the \n     U.S. government (Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the \n     military), the Pacific islands should be able to receive \n     emergency supplies. It is possible that some type of formal \n     assurance to the island governments is required. Currently \n     being considered for legislation in the U.S. Congress is a \n     proposal which would guarantee the U.S. Pacific islands \n     including Hawaii a percentage drawdown of the national SPR if \n     emergency measures were placed in effect. This guarantee \n     would ensure access to oil supplies for the islands. Market \n     prices would have to be paid, but basic services could be \n     maintained. Not guaranteed is transport for the oil supplies. \n     However, preliminary indications are that tankers could be \n     acquired, albeit at market rates which would be high during \n     crisis periods. This is an excellent proposal which would \n     greatly reassure the islands that their basic needs would be \n     maintained.\n\n\n             the economic effects of oil supply disruptions\n\n       In addition to the issue of continued access to oil \n     supplies, the economic impacts of a major oil market \n     disruption can be devastating. The most harmful economic \n     repercussions of Scenario I are: inflation, recessions in \n     major markets, and a simple reluctance of potential tourists \n     to travel because of a perceived vulnerability to terrorist \n     acts stemming from the political upheaval which caused the \n     oil supply disruption. The initial loss of jobs and economic \n     activity could be further worsened by the likely occurrence \n     of a subsequent regional or global recession. The longer the \n     recession, the greater the negative impacts, including \n     increased loss of jobs and tax revenues. Small open economies \n     such as the U.S. Pacific islands are especially vulnerable. \n     Would the United States provide any type of assistance to the \n     Pacific islands to compensate for the downstream effects of \n     an oil supply disruption? Are they eligible for emergency \n     aid? This is a complicated issue and cannot be resolved in \n     this discussion. Suffice it to say that it would probably be \n     more useful and more important for the island economies to \n     have a buffer against recessions than an SPR established on \n     Guam or in American Samoa.\n       Discussed below are some of the likely identifiable impacts \n     of an oil supply disruption on the island economies. Data \n     have been drawn from a range of sources. Published data from \n     government and private sector sources have been referenced, \n     and estimates generated as part of the energy vulnerability \n     assessment are appropriately noted. Assessing impacts on the \n     islands in the year 2000 based on current economic growth \n     projections is an order of magnitude exercise. However, the \n     best available data have been utilized and the estimates can \n     and should be revised when more data become available. The \n     section discusses the effects of an oil supply disruption on \n     the value of petroleum imports, GDP, inflation, employment, \n     and government revenues.\n\n             Oil Shocks and the Value of Petroleum Imports\n\n       Table 3.10 shows the impact of petroleum price increases \n     and growth in the volume of petroleum imports. The first \n     column shows projected rates of price increases for petroleum \n     products under low price, base price and high price \n     scenarios. The second column\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\n     shows the most recent value figure for imported petroleum \n     products. The value figure shown in the second column \n     corresponds to a volume figure which is then multiplied by \n     the demand growth scenarios in the third column (e.g., low, \n     medium and high growth in demand for petroleum products) and \n     the three price scenarios to indicate the estimated value of \n     petroleum imports in the years 1995 and 2000. High, medium \n     and low demand growth scenarios were available only for Guam \n     and the CNMI. In addition, among the different scenarios for \n     both 1995 and 2000, there is a scenario which doubles prices \n     for the medium demand growth case. This doubling of prices is \n     a result of a petroleum price increase associated with Oil \n     Supply Disruption Scenario I, a loss of 4.5 MMBD caused by \n     political turmoil in the Middle East and Asia. The price \n     doubling is an estimated price increase which reflects short-\n     term market responses, similar to those following the Iraqi \n     invasion of Kuwait and the 1979/80 oil price increase.\n       The demand growth (1.2 percent per year) and a base case \n     petroleum price increase (3.9 percent per year) result in a \n     doubling in the value of petroleum imports for American Samoa \n     between 1990 and 2000. The values of Guam's, the CNMI's, and \n     Palau's petroleum imports more than double by the year 2000. \n     The effect of a high oil price and high demand growth is a \n     seven-fold increase in the value of the CNMI's petroleum \n     imports. Although this may seem unlikely, demand increased by \n     21 percent between 1991 and 1992, and the planned expansion \n     to the power sector indicates that growth will remain high.\n       Table 3.10 only assumes the indicated growth rates, which \n     is to say that other variables such as the impact of demand-\n     side management programs and other efficiency and \n     conservation activities have not been factored into the \n     analysis because data are not available. The estimates also \n     do not reflect the impact of higher petroleum prices on \n     consumption. For example, when gasoline prices rise, theory \n     suggests that people will drive less. However, the experience \n     during the recent Persian Gulf War indicates that island \n     consumers did not curtail their driving or use of electricity \n     when prices increased. Thus, it has been assumed that \n     consumption rates will not be significantly affected by price \n     increases, a very tenuous assumption.\n       The result of an oil price shock following political \n     upheaval in the Middle East and Asia is a doubling of the \n     values for petroleum imports. For comparative purposes, in \n     1990, American Samoa imported goods valued at $360 million \n     and exported items worth $306 million. Under a high oil price \n     scenario generated by an oil shock in the year 2000, the \n     value of petroleum imports increases to $175 million. Guam, \n     which had imports valued at $385 million in 1988 and exports \n     valued at $85 million in 1991, would have petroleum imports \n     valued at $742 million under a high oil price and high demand \n     growth scenario. Similarly, the CNMI, with imports at $392 \n     million and exports at $255 million in 1991, would have \n     petroleum imports valued at $503 million under the high oil \n     price/high demand growth scenario. Palau, with imports valued \n     at $25 million and exports at $600 thousand in 1989, would \n     have petroleum imports valued at $37 million under a high oil \n     price and demand growth scenario in the year 2000.\n       Given the above projected effects of an oil price shock, it \n     is doubtful that any of the economies would be able to \n     sustain the projected rates of growth. The cost of petroleum \n     imports would require the use of public and private sector \n     surpluses simply to maintain existing standards of living. \n     Even if the oil price shock were short-lived, it is likely \n     that the effects would have substantial repercussions on \n     economic activity for an extended period of time. These will \n     be discussed in subsequent sections.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 187. A bill to provide for the safety of journeymen boxers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   the professional boxer safety act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nProfessional Boxing Safety Act, a bill to make the professional boxing \nindustry safer for boxers across America. This bill is identical to the \nversion of this bill that was favorably reported out of the Senate's \nCommerce Committee as S. 1991 on September 23, 1994. I am also very \npleased that Senator Richard Bryan is the prime cosponsor of this \nlegislation, as he was last year. The professional boxing industry is \nobviously of tremendous importance to the residents of Nevada, and he \nhas been a strong force behind this bills success.\n  I have been an avid boxing fan for over 40 years. Boxing can be one \nof the most exciting and impressive tests of coverage and athletic \nskill that exist in the world of sport. To this very day, boxing is \nviewed by many disadvantaged, yet determined young men as their best \nand only chance to rise above bleak circumstances that most of their \nfellow citizens could not even comprehend.\n  It is these men--some still teenagers, others who are in their \nforties and are at the end of a long career marked by much punishment \nand little reward--who are the object of this proposal. As a Senator, \nmy legislative objective regarding professional boxing revolves around \nmy desire to see that the exploitation of this group of brave but \nhighly vulnerable athletes in our society is brought to an end. The \nProfessional Boxing Safety Act will help accomplish this goal.\n  The physical and economic exploitation I speak of is very familiar to \npeople involved in the professional boxing industry, though it does not \noften come to mind of the general public. Many Americans may think of \nboxing only if a local hometown hero emerges, or perhaps when they read \nabout the huge, multimillion dollar purses that are being battled for \nby today's greatest champions.\n  Big pay days and widespread public acclaim, however, are never \nattained by the overwhelming majority of boxers. A large segment of \nprofessional boxers in America never make more than a $100 a night. \nUnfortunately, in State after State in our country, in gyms and arenas \nboth large and small, there are many boxers who are being led into the \nring to absorb more punishment shortly after they have been knocked \nout, battered, or when they are in need of medical attention. These \nunknown boxers often continue to fight long after their skills have \neroded to the point where they cannot safely compete. The symptoms of \nthe debilitating illnesses they are at risk for may not surface for \nyears, so these men answer the bell, endure another defeat, and trudge \non to the next town. As one journeyman boxer said, they exist in the \nsport solely as ``A body for better men to beat on.''\n\n  The problems in professional boxing that the Professional Boxing \nSafety Act will address are as follows: First, we need to immediately \nshut down the dangerous and disturbing boxing shows that occur in the \nStates that have no regulatory authority to oversee them These bootleg \nshows feature boxers who have no business being in the ring due to \ninjury, advancing age, or lack of skills. Journeymen boxers routinely \nfind themselves overmatched against a promising young prospect in need \nof an easy victory to boost his ranking, and their health and welfare \nis of small concern to unscrupulous promoters. This bill would require \nthat all professional boxing shoes in the United States be held under \nthe oversight of State boxing officials.\n  Second, we need to ensure that no boxer fights in one State while \nthey are under suspension in another. Unfortunately, it is commonplace \nfor boxers in the United States to travel to another State when they \nare supposed to be serving a mandatory injury recuperation period, or \nto avoid a requirement for medical treatment. Some resort to using \naliases or distorting their career records when presenting themselves \nto State officials. To put an end to these practices, the Professional \nBoxing Safety Act would require all State boxing commissions to issue \nan identification card to professional boxers in their State, and to \nhonor all medically related suspensions of other State commissions.\n  Finally, this legislation will strengthen the system by which State \nboxing officials share information on professional boxers and other \nindustry personnel in order to prevent fraudulent and unsafe bouts, and \nto ensure that illegal and unethical practices in the sport are \nproperly punished. The Professional Boxing Safety Act would require \nthat State boxing officials promptly report the results of all shows \nheld in their jurisdiction to the boxing registries that serve the \nindustry. This will provide accurate and reliable information on boxers \nfrom around the world to State boxing officials, and make it easier for \nthem to evaluate the career records and conduct of the boxers, \nmanagers, and promoters who come to their State.\n  I would also like to emphasize what this legislation does not do. The \nProfessional Boxing Safety Act creates no new Federal boxing authority \nto regulate the sport; it mandates no burdensome regulations upon our \nalready under budgeted State commissions; it fosters no unnecessary \nFederal intrusion into legitimate business practices, and it requires \nno Federal funds and imposes no new tax on boxing events across the \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n  The Professional Boxing Safety would be an effective and practical \nstep for the Congress to take in addressing legitimate health and \nsafety issues in the sport, and virtually everyone in the industry that \nI've discussed this proposal with seems to agree. I'm very pleased that \nlast year the Association of Boxing Commissions, the national boxing \norganization which represents 35 State commissions across America, \nendorsed this bill, as did over 20 individual State boxing commissions \nand several major sanctioning bodies who wrote to me in support of it.\n  This bill was developed with the advice and counsel of the most \nexperienced and knowledgeable people in the industry, and I'm confident \nSenator Bryan and I have put forward an innovative and realistic \nmeasure to make professional boxing a safer, better, and more honorable \nsport. I look forward to its prompt passage by the Senate's Commerce \nCommittee, and to its consideration by the full Senate sometime this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Bradley):\n  S. 188. A bill to establish the Great Falls Historic District in the \nState of New Jersey, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the Great Falls preservation and redevelopment act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nGreat Falls Preservation and Redevelopment Act, legislation that \nrecognizes the historic significance of the Great Falls area of \nPaterson, NJ. I am delighted that, once again, my senior colleague from \nNew Jersey, Senator Bradley, joins me as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, this bill was broadly supported in the last Congress. \nThe House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 280 to 130. \nAfter years of opposition, the administration lent its support. The \nSenate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the bill in \nSeptember, but time ran out before the Senate could act. Today I \nreintroduce the draft that achieved this support, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join once again in supporting the bill.\n  I'm proud to say I was born in Paterson. My father worked in the \nmills, and I experienced firsthand the historic importance of industry \nin the city.\n  Paterson is known as America's first industrialized city. Alexander \nHamilton played a role here when, in 1791 he chose the area around the \nGreat Falls for his laboratory and to establish the Society for the \nEstablishment of Useful Manufactures. Textiles held special \nsignificance; Paterson was once called Silk City as the center of the \ntextile industry.\n  While rich in history, the area is also blessed by great natural \nbeauty and splendor. It is an oasis of beauty in an urban environment. \nIts resources offer not just educational and cultural opportunities, \nbut economic and recreational ones as well.\n  The Federal Government acknowledged all this by designating the area \na national historic landmark, a formal recognition by the National Park \nService.\n  Mr. President, the roots and contributions of this area run deep. New \nindustries were responsible for thriving businesses, tight knit \nfamilies and for many of the residents, the first homes of immigrants, \nwho arrived in the United States through nearby Ellis Island.\n  Many of the industries from Great Falls have moved elsewhere. But we \nare left with an area whose significance is great for people like me.\n  I find a source of inspiration in remembering my father in those \nthriving mills of Paterson, so I look at Paterson, and the Great Falls \narea, as a reminder of who I am. We must value our personal and \ncollective histories, because they connect us to our families and to \neach other.\n  Paterson is not alone in this story. New Jersey is rich in \nindustrial, urban history. New Jersey played a major role in the \nindustrial revolution.\n  I sought to highlight this role when I secured funds in the fiscal \nyear 1992 Interior appropriations bill to establish the urban history \ninitiative in three cities in New Jersey. Paterson is one of those \ncities.\n  Paterson's urban history program is in its early stages. The \ncooperative agreement was recently signed and things are moving. This \ninfusion of funds has succeeded in initiating Paterson's historic \nrevitalization.\n  But this bill formalizes the current partnership among the city, its \nresidents and the Federal Government. It establishes the Great Falls \nHistoric District and provides a long-term Federal presence in the \narea. The resources of Great Falls are just beginning to be tapped; we \nneed this bill to give the resources the focus they deserve. Such \nhistorical recognition provides important educational, economic, and \ncultural benefits. Its value is immeasurable.\n  The Secretary of the Interior will enter into cooperative agreements \nwith nonprofits, property owners, State and local governments to assist \nin interpreting and preserving the historical significance and \ncontributions of the Great Falls to the city, to industry, and to our \nheritage.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not impose Federal Government's heavy \nhand on the residents and businesses. The city doesn't want that, and \nneither does the Park Service.\n  Instead, the bill initiates and facilitates cooperative agreements \namong interested parties. The Secretary will determine properties of \nhistorical or cultural significance, and provide technical assistance, \ninterpret, restore, or improve these properties. This historic and \ncultural recognition leads to economic revitalization in the area.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the culmination of years of effort to \ndetermine the correct Federal role in highlighting this important area. \nThe bill does not designate a new unit of the National Park Service--it \nalready is designated a unit--and it will not require additional Park \nService personnel. The bill reflects the current budgetary climate by \nlimiting Federal investment in capital projects, planning, and \ntechnical assistance. It also requires non-Federal matching funds and \nthe authority to spend funds expires after 5 years.\n  This bill, when enacted, will play an important part in advancing the \nhistoric revival of Paterson and of the Great Falls. In turn, it will \nboost the economic vitality of the region while restoring the \nimportance of our industrial heritage for our children. I look forward \nto watching this bill become reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 188\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to \nprovide that any concurrent resolution on the budget that contains \nreconciliation directives shall include a directive with respect to the \nstatutory limit on the public debt, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat if one committee reports, the other committee have 30 days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n                      THE DEBT CEILING REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the final two \npieces of legislation that I believe are the building blocks for a \nsound and responsible Federal budget.\n  For too long, Congress has been building castles in the sky. We owe \nour children and grandchildren a secure financial future. But that \nfuture is flimsily constructed on deficit spending and deficit in the \nform of mounting debt.\n  It's High Noon on fiscal responsibility and the American people have \nasked us to rise to the occasion. And these are the weapons we will \ntake to the showdown.\n  The first piece of legislation I offer today is a Balanced Budget \nAmendment to the Constitution.\n  When I was Governor of Nebraska, I had the benefit of such \na mechanism. It forced budgetary discipline and kept my State fiscally \nsound.\n\n  We should be able to deal with the deficit without a balanced budget \namendment. But all evidence runs to the contrary.\n  The statutory remedies have failed. They are riddled with back doors \nand loopholes. We have also proven ourselves incapable of controlling \nwasteful spending. The deficit numbers speak for themselves.\n  We need this amendment to force responsibility upon the Federal \nGovernment. We need a bold approach--a new approach--to end the \ndangerous habit of deficit spending. This amendment is our best chance, \nperhaps our only chance, to turn back the tide of red ink that \nthreatens to engulf us.\n  A balanced budget amendment does not spare us from the difficult, \nhard choices. And that is why I cosponsored last week S. 14, the \nLegislative Line-Item Veto Act.\n  Pork has become Congress' scarlet letter. Once again, Congress should \ndemonstrate the type of self-restraint and sacrifice that would put \nthis wasteful practice to an end. But I am a realist. While some \nMembers would voluntarily refrain from pork barrel spending, others \nwould continue with business as usual. Business as usual does not pass \nmuster with the American people.\n  Ideally, I would have offered a bill granting The President a \nconstitutional line-item veto. As Governor of Nebraska, I also had a \nsimilar line-item veto and it was an invaluable tool to curb spending \nby my State legislature. However, those of us who have championed the \nline-item veto have always come away empty-handed.\n\n  The obvious solution--the bipartisan solution--is to grant the \nPresident the authority to force Congress to vote on specific funding \nincluded in the appropriations bills.\n  Congressional Members are less likely to pile on the pork if they \nknow that they might have to defend each item on its own merits.\n  Some might ask: ``what's the urgency? And that brings me to the \nsecond bill I am introducing today.\n  Our Federal debt now tops a whopping $4.7 trillion and we are on \nschedule to reach the current debt ceiling of $4.9 trillion in \nSeptember or October of this year. Too many Americans still confuse the \nannual deficit with our national debt. Even if we accomplish our goal \nof a balanced budget by 2002, we will still have a $5.5 trillion \nalbatross hanging around our necks.\n  Obviously, we are living beyond our means. When we raise our debt \nceiling for more than we need in the coming year, we perpetuate that \npractice and risk plunging our Nation into financial ruin.\n  My bill attempts to bring some sanity and control to this practice. \nit requires our budget resolution to state how much we intend to raise \nthe debt ceiling each year. And any bill that would raise the debt \nceiling to exceed the amount stated in the budget resolution would be \nsubject to a budget point of order and a rollcall vote to waive that \npoint of order.\n\n  I have long believed that our Federal Government should balance its \nbudget each year. The facts are, however, that we have not done so \nsince 1969. During the 1980's and now the 1990's, we have become so \naccustomed to operating in the red that we look upon a $200 billion \ndeficit as great progress. I, for one, take cold comfort in a $200 \nbillion deficit.\n  Our Federal debt now tops $4.7 trillion and we are on schedule to \nreach the current debt ceiling of about $4.9 trillion in September or \nOctober of this year.\n  We have now reached a point where we barely lift a finger to balance \nour budget. The much heralded Kerrey-Danforth Commission on Entitlement \nReform attempted to forge an agreement upon lowering the deficit to a\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nproportion of our total economy. It failed to even reach even that \nmodest goal.\n  What is even more discouraging and disenchanting is that Congress \noften fails to limit its deficit spending to the levels that are \nprojected in our annual budgets. We no longer decide upon how much we \nare going to borrow and to limit ourselves to that amount over the \ncoming year.\n  Mr. President, if Congress cannot balance its budget, we should at \nleast not give ourselves a blank check to borrow beyond our means. Yet \nthat is exactly what we do when we raise our debt ceiling more than we \nneed to for the coming year.\n  My bill attempts to bring some sanity and controls to this practice. \nIt requires our budget resolution to state how much we intend to raise \nthe debt ceiling each year. To enforce that goal, any bill that would \ncause the debt ceiling to exceed the amount stated in the budget \nresolution would be subject to a budget point of order and a rollcall \nvote to waive that point of order.\n  In previous years, I have proposed that the point of order be waived \nwith 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. This bill will require only a \nmajority vote. Yet, I believe it will do the job of highlighting this \nissue and alerting the American people to Congress' failure to live \nwithin its budget.\n  I can well understand the reluctance of my colleagues to make raising \nthe debt ceiling any more difficult than it is now. I am convinced, \nhowever, that we simply must change our process to insure some honesty \nand credibility in our Federal budget process.\n  Doing so will be of paramount importance over the coming year as \nleaders from both political parties are promising tax break after tax \nbreak. This is an all too familiar scenario, an all too deplorable \nscenario. Tax breaks and spending cuts are promised yet only the tax \nbreaks are delivered. The result was that our deficits climbed out of \nsight and had no resemblance to what we said they were going to be.\n  Keeping some limits on our debt ceiling will go a long way in keeping \neveryone on both sides of the aisle honest. Let us force ourselves to \ndo what we say we are going to do, and not, with a wink and a nod, \nsimply hide our failure to do so.\n  I have always believed that fiscal responsibility is a partnership \nbetween the Federal Governmental and the States. However, we are not \nliving up to our side of the bargain.\n  Washington passes mandates and regulations, and then drops them like \na foundling on the doorstep of the States, forcing them to dig deep \ninto their own pockets to pay for compliance. This cost shifting is \nkilling the States.\n  This game of budget tag has to end. And under the bipartisan \nlegislation I cosponsored last week, it will. This fourth bill--the \nlast building block--requires the Federal Government to provide direct \nspending for these mandates. If it cannot, the mandate requirements are \nscaled back to the amount of money appropriated.\n  Others have proposed a more radical approach; names, ``no money, no \nmandates backstop.'' But I would caution my friends not to be \nheadstrong. Their treatment would not only swell the ranks of the \nFederal bureaucracy, it could ignite a firestorm of law suits that \nwould rage throughout the Nation.\n  Ours is the right approach. Ours is the fair and reasonable approach \nthat will get the job done.\n  The $4.7 trillion debt was not built up overnight, and it will not be \nresolved overnight. However, we can no longer afford to sit back. As \nGen. Dwight David Eisenhower said when ordering the D-day invasion, \n``OK, let's go!''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. PRESSLER (for himself and Mrs. Kassebaum):\n  S. 190. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexempt employees who perform certain court reporting duties from the \ncompensatory time requirements applicable to certain public agencies, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                  court reporter fair labor amendments\n\n  Mr. PRESSLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Court \nReporter Fair Labor Amendments of 1995. I originally introduced this \nbill last November, during the special GATT session. As I said then, \nthe American people sent a strong, clear signal on November 8: they \nwant less Government and they want it now. My bill would keep the \nFederal Government from intruding into an area it has no business being \nin, and where its protections are unwanted by everyone concerned.\n  Specifically, my bill would exempt State and local courts reporters \nfrom the compensatory time requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n[FLSA] when they perform private transcription work outside of normal \nworking hours or regular working days. A recent interpretation of the \nU.S. Labor Department threatens to radically change the way court \nreporters have been paid for many years. This bill would keep \nundisturbed current pay arrangements between State and local reporters \nand their court employers.\n  I am pleased my friend from Kansas, Senator Kassebaum, the new \nchairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, is cosponsoring \nthis legislation. She has always been a strong proponent of limited \ngovernment. We both realize the public demand for less government has \nnever been greater.\n  Mr. President, let me explain the situation which brought about the \nneed for this legislation. For years, official State and local court \nreporters have enjoyed a unique status among government workers. In \nmost States, they are treated as both government employees and \nindependent contractors, depending on the nature of the work. While \nperforming their primary duties of recording and reading back court \nproceedings, reporters are considered employees of the court. As such, \nthey are typically compensated with an annual salary and benefits.\n  However, in addition to these in-court duties, most jurisdictions \nalso require official court reporters to prepare and certify \ntranscripts of their stenographic records for private attorneys, \nlitigants, and others. The reporter and his or her assistants prepare \nand deliver transcripts using their own equipment, without any \nsupervision by the court. The reporter then bills the attorney or other \nclient directly and collects a per page fee set by law or court rule. \nThe transcription fees earned are usually twice the amount, or more, \nthan those earned during an hour of salaried work for the court. \nIndeed, it is possible for a court reporter to earn more from private \ntranscription work than from his or her annual court salary.\n  When preparing transcripts for a private fee, the court reporter is \nclearly acting as an independent operator, as has been specifically \ndetermined by the Internal Revenue Service. For taxation purposes, \ntranscription fee income is treated as separate and apart from \nreporters' annual court salaries. In fact, in my home State of South \nDakota, court reporters are required to collect and pay sales tax on \nthis income. They also file self-employment income forms with the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  The transcription services provided by court reporters are invaluable \nto private parties. Attorneys are able to obtain a highly accurate \nrecording of court proceedings quickly and reliably. Court reporters \nare small businessmen and businesswomen performing a cost effective and \ntimely service. There may be many flaws in our system of justice, but \nour system of court reporting is not among them.\n  As I stated earlier, everyone is happy with the current situation. It \nhas developed over many years. All interested parties--court reporters, \njudges, and private attorneys--are very satisfied with the present \narrangement.\n  Everyone was happy, that is, until the U.S. Department of Labor \ninserted itself into this situation. Last fall, the Wage and Hour \nDivision of the Labor Division took the position that official court \nreporters in Oregon are still acting as employees of the court, for \npurposes of FLSA, when they prepare transcripts for attorneys, \nlitigants, and other parties. Similar letters have been received \nregarding official court reporters in Indiana and North Carolina. \nOfficial court reporters in the vast majority of States operate in \ncircumstances similar to these three States.\n  The DOL's interpretation would require State and local courts to pay \ncourt reporters one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for \nall transcription work performed during overtime hours in a given week. \nThe Labor\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nDepartment's position also exposes State and local courts to \npotentially enormous liability costs from court reporters suing for \novertime back-pay. If a suit is successful, the court would owe the \nreporter at least 2 years worth of overtime back-pay. The amount would \nbe doubled if the court could not demonstrate that it was acting in \ngood faith and could go back 3 years if the violation were deemed \nwillful.\n  If allowed to stand, the impact of the Labor Department's position of \nthe court reporting system would be dramatic. State and local courts \nwould face increased salary budgets and liability exposure. Court \nreporters facing budgetary cutbacks could lose a significant part of \ntheir income and, in some cases, their jobs. Private parties would lose \nthe productivity and efficiency of the current method of transcription. \nThe decision would have adversely affected all interested parties. As \nyou might imagine, no one involved in the court reporting system is \nhappy with DOL`s position.\n\n  Faced with exposure to millions of dollars of liability nationwide, \nsome courts have already implemented changes. Beginning this month, the \nSouth Dakota Court System imposed a new system of pay for transcription \non their court reporters. Court salary budgets have also been \ntightened. State court judges must avoid using their reporters too \nmuch, to keep overtime down. Court administrators have been burdened \nwith additional administrative duties and headaches. Private attorneys \nare concerned they can no longer rely on speedy transcriptions at a \nreasonable price. No one is happy with the changes.\n  So why are these changes being considered? Because the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor says so. After all these years, the Department has \nsuddenly decided that the Fair Labor Standards Act applies in a \nsituation never contemplated by Congress. What fantastic benefits will \nresult from this governmental meddling? None.\n  I have a solution, however: Don't fix what is not broken. Keep the \nFederal Government out of the situation.\n  The bill I am introducing today would allow official court reporters \nan exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act while they are \nperforming transcription duties for a private party, provided there is \nan understanding between the court reporters and their State or local \ncourt employer. The bill also would bar lawsuits by court reporters for \novertime back pay.\n  Note that only State and local court reporters would be affected. \nThat is because Federal court reporters already enjoy a complete \nexemption from FLSA. State and local court reporters deserve similar \ntreatment. Passage of my bill would allow all official court \nreporters--Federal State, and local court reporters--to perform their \nwork in the same way.\n  The Fair Labor Standard Act is designed to protect workers from \nabusive employers. In this situation, however, the very workers who \nwould receive the so-called protections of the Federal Government, \ndon't want them. Official court reporters would be greatly harmed if \nthe helping hand of the Federal Government takes them under its wing. \nThey don't want, or need, to be taken care of, especially by \nWashington. That is why the National Court Reporter Association \nstrongly supports this bill.\n  Mr. President, here is a rare instance where labor and management are \nin agreement on the best solution regarding a labor issue. Everyone \nagrees that the current system serves everyone's best interests. When \nperforming transcription services for a private party, court reporters \nare acting as independent contractors. That is what the IRS considers \nthem. Federal court reporters are treated that way. I can't think of a \nreason in the world why State and local reporters should be treated any \ndifferently. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 14. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution relating to Federal Budget Procedures; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n       BALANCED BUDGET CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT JOINT RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nproposing a constitutional amendment requiring the President to submit, \nand the Congress to enact, a balanced Federal budget.\n  This is not the first time I have introduced such legislation. For \nyears, I have taken a leadership role promoting passage of a balanced \nbudget amendment.\n  I can think of no greater priority than dealing responsibly with the \nFederal deficit. A balanced budget amendment underscores my bedrock \nbeliefs in a lean and agile government and living within one's means.\n  Thirty-seven States have balanced budget provisions. When I was \nGovernor of Nebraska, I had no choice but to balance our State's budget \nfor 8 straight years. I'm not complaining. It forced budgetary \ndiscipline and kept my State fiscally sound. It was the right thing to \ndo.\n  During last year's debate on the balanced budget amendment, I \nlistened with great care and interest to the arguments that we didn't \nneed it.\n  The critics claimed that self-restraint and legislation could solve \nthe spiralling deficits that have bedeviled us--deficits that trifle \nwith the future and standard of living of our children and \ngrandchildren--deficits that shackle them to a mountain of debt.\n  The opponents further contended that a balanced budget amendment is \nno substitute for tough, honest, and effective leadership.\n  Mr. President, one does not preclude the other. And I might point out \nthat the type of leadership and courage so often extolled on the Senate \nfloor is often in very short supply. There is a lot of breast beating \nabout the deficit, but little will to make the difficult and hard \ndecisions to bring it under control.\n  Yes, we should be able to deal with deficit without a balanced budget \namendment, but the evidence runs to the contrary. All of the statutory \nremedies have failed. They are riddled with loopholes and back doors \nwhich have been exploited to the fullest.\n  Mr. President, we have also proven ourselves incapable of controlling \nwasteful spending. The deficit figures speak for themselves. There is \nstill too much business-as-usual around here, and business-as-usual no \nlonger works and will put future generations of Americans in terrible \nstraits.\n  True, we have made some remarkable headway in reducing the deficit. \nWe turned an important corner by passing the 1993 deficit reduction \npackage and it is performing beyond expectations.\n  However, the deficits projections for the out-years are not \nreassuring. Right now, we are enjoying a brief respite from the storm, \nbut is promises to whip back on us in 5 or 6 years. We cannot afford to \nhide our heads in the sand and hope the problem will go way. It won't.\n  Let there be no mistake, a balanced budget amendment is no panacea \nand we will still have to make a lot of hard\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\nchoices. But I see no alternative to this amendment. We are out of \noptions. We need the balanced budget amendment to force responsibility \nupon the Federal Government. We need a bold approach--a new approach--\nto end the dangerous habit of deficit spending.\n  This amendment presents our best chance, perhaps our only chance, to \nturn back the sea of red ink that threatens to engulf us. It's the \nfirst step to the establishment of a sound fiscal policy and \naccountability in the U.S. Congress.\n  Mr. President, it's time we stopped all the hand wringing over the \nFederal deficit. It's time we stopped dodging the issue. It's time we \nshowed the courage and leadership demanded of us by the American \npeople. It's time we passed a balanced budget amendment and sent it to \nthe States for ratification. This is the legacy I want to leave our \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S731-5", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  s. 1\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kempthorne, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana [Mr. Johnston] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1, a bill to \ncurb the practice of imposing unfunded Federal mandates on States and \nlocal governments; to strengthen the partnership between the Federal \nGovernment and State, local and tribal governments; to end the \nimposition, in the absence of full consideration by Congress, of \nFederal mandates on State, local, and tribal governments without \nadequate funding, in a manner that may displace other essential \ngovernmental priorities; and to ensure that the Federal Government pays \nthe costs incurred by those governments in complying with certain \nrequirements under Federal statutes and regulations; and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                  s. 2\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2, a bill to make certain laws applicable to the legislative branch of \nthe Federal Government.\n\n\n                                  s. 3\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dole, the name of the Senator from New York \n[Mr. D'Amato] was added as a cosponsor of S. 3, a bill to control \ncrime, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 12\n\n  At the request of Mr. Breaux, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n[Mr. Campbell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 12, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage savings and investment \nthrough individual retirement accounts, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 91\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the name of the Senator from \nKentucky [Mr. McConnell] was added as a cosponsor of S. 91, a bill to \ndelay enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 until \nsuch time as Congress appropriates funds to implement such Act.\n\n\n                                 s. 98\n\n  At the request of Mr. Bradley, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Bumpers] was added as a cosponsor of S. 98, a bill to amend the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 to establish a process to identify and \ncontrol tax expenditures.\n\n\n                                 s. 111\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n[Mr. Exon] was added as a cosponsor of S. 111, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to make permanent, and to increase to 100 \npercent, the deduction of self-employed individuals for health \ninsurance costs.\n\n\n                                 s. 122\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Lautenberg] was added as a cosponsor of S. 122, a bill to \nprohibit the use of certain ammunition, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 s. 124\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from New \nJersey [Mr. Lautenberg] was added as a cosponsor of S. 124, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the tax on handgun \nammunition, to impose the special occupational tax and registration \nrequirements on importers and manufacturers of handgun ammunition, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/01/10/senate-section/article/S740-1", "month": "01", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 36--ORIGINAL RESOLUTION REPORTED AUTHORIZING \n                EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD, from the Committee on Finance, reported the following \noriginal resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.
