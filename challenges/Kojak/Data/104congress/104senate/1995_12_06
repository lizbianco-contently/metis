Mr. President, in a few moments, I will make a motion to \nproceed to the consideration of calendar No. 195, Senate Joint \nResolution 31, regarding a constitutional amendment prohibiting the \ndesecration of the flag. By a previous order, at 5 o'clock today, we \nwill resume consideration of H.R. 1833 regarding partial-birth \nabortions and the pending amendments thereto. I assume we will have \nrollcall votes throughout today's session in regard to either of these \nmatters.\n  Just for the information of my colleagues, on the tentative schedule, \nwe would like to finish the constitutional amendment on flags and \ncomplete action on the partial-birth abortions bill and consider any \navailable appropriations conference reports between now and sometime on \nFriday.\n  Next week, the State Department reorganization bill will come to the \nfloor, S. 1441, unless we reach some agreement prior to that time. We \nhave been trying to reach an agreement here for several weeks, and we \nhave had no success. I think the chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Helms, has been very patient, and I am \ndetermined to bring the bill up again. If we cannot get the votes, we \ncannot get the votes. So we will start that up on Monday.\n  In addition, next week we will have available appropriations \nconference reports. We hope to have a welfare reform conference report. \nWe also will take up H.R. 660, the fair housing exemption bill. There \nwill be a short time agreement.\n  Next week, we will bring up the resolution on Bosnia, and I hope we \nmight complete that under some time agreement. But that should come \nnext week. We are still working on the language, as we have indicated \nin the last couple of days. That language has now been, I think, \nsubmitted to a number of our colleagues. We hope we can reach some \nagreement. We do not expect everybody to support the resolution. Some \npeople have different views and different motives, but we hope that we \ncan pass a resolution that indicates our strong support for United \nStates forces, notwithstanding our strong disagreement with the \nPresident's Bosnian policy, which we have said from day one, the past \n30 months, it has been bipartisan--we voted time and again to lift the \narms embargo, to give the Bosnians a chance to defend themselves. Had \nwe done that, we would not be talking about sending 20,000 American \ntroops to Bosnia. The President has repeatedly rejected the bipartisan \nview of the House and the Senate, and he has indicated that troops will \ngo notwithstanding any opposition from Congress.\n\n  I hope we can work out some resolution that would support the forces \nand let him proceed with his commitment, even though we may not share \nhis view on either the agreement in Dayton or the Bosnia policy.\n  One thing we hope to achieve is an exit strategy. It is our view that \nunless we have some exit strategy, we are not certain how long American \nForces and other forces might be there. We believe it is very important \nthat the Bosnians be armed and trained so that in 6 months, 8 months, \nor a year, we will be able to leave that part of the world and come \nback and bring our forces back to America, and the Bosnians will be in \na position to defend themselves. It sort of all gets back to what we \nhave been talking about in the last couple of years. We should have \nlifted the arms embargo in the first place. They would be in a position \ntoday to defend themselves, and we may not be asking Americans to make \nthese sacrifices. That will come up sometime next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18037-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18037-S18038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 31\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, I know there will be debate on the motion. I \ndo not know how long the Senator from New Mexico wishes to debate. But \nI hope that we can go to the bill itself in the next couple of hours. \nThis means we will have to be here longer this evening. We would like \nto complete action. We are going back to partial-birth abortion bill at \n5 o'clock and will try to finish that tonight.\n  Hopefully, if there is some time or any requests for time on the \namendments, we can continue that debate tonight and finish this bill by \nnoon tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I did object to proceeding with the \ndebate on the flag amendment because I believe that we have neglected \nsome other very important constitutional duties. Specifically, we have \nneglected to provide our advice and consent of ratification of START II \nand also on confirming the nomination of ambassadors to nations, which \ninclude over a third of the world's population. That has now been \ndelayed many months.\n  I have been told this morning that a deal which would allow for the \nForeign Relations Committee to meet tomorrow and report the treaty and \nthese nominations, which will allow the Senate to approve them next \nweek and deal with the State Department authorization bill, as well, \nmay be at hand. I would be delighted if that proves to be true, and I \nwould gladly yield the floor and allow the Senate to proceed with \ndebate on the flag amendment as soon as we can get some kind of \nunanimous-consent agreement to that effect.\n  But, for the moment, I think that I have no choice but to talk for a \nperiod here about the constitutional obligations we have to provide \nadvice and consent on treaties and with regard to the appointment of \nambassadors.\n  Mr. President, before we amend the Constitution, I hope we will not \namend the first amendment, as proposed in the flag amendment, for the \nfirst time in the history of this Republic. I believe we should not go \non to consider that before we get about the business of carrying out \nour current responsibilities under the Constitution.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution deals with the powers of \nthe President. The second paragraph says:\n\n       He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of \n     the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the \n     Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and \n     with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \n     Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of \n     the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I have a couple of charts which I would like to refer \nto here just to make the points that need to be made. This first chart \ndeals with the chronology of events related to the START II treaty. \nThis treaty was signed by President Bush on January 3, 1993. It was \nsubmitted to the Senate by President Bush on January 15, 1993. That was \nalmost 3 years ago.\n  Until last December when the issues were resolved that allowed the \nSTART I treaty to enter into course, perhaps it was appropriate not to \nproceed with the ratification of START II. Once that treaty was \novercome, then everyone expected that the START II treaty would be \ndealt with by this body early this year--early in 1995.\n  The last hearing of the Foreign Affairs Committee on the treaty took \nplace on March 29 of this year.\n  Senator Lugar, at a conference the next day on March 30 said,\n\n       I chaired the final Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing \n     in the Senate yesterday on the START II treaty. The committee \n     will seek to mark up the treaty after the April recess. We \n     will look to potential floor action during the middle of the \n     month of May. It is a good treaty, but it is one thing to \n     have reached agreements and understandings, another to have \n     fully implemented.\n\n  Mr. President, next week we will be in mid-December, fully 7 months \nbehind the schedule that was outlined by the senior Senator from \nIndiana, whom I greatly respect for his leadership on our policy toward \nRussia. I wish we had held to the original timetable. Obviously, we \nhave not.\n  I fear the delay has only complicated the prospects for treaty \nratification in the Russia Duma. We have provided an obvious excuse for \ninaction for 7 months now. We should not make that excuse, extend that \nexcuse, for 8, 9, or 10 months.\n  As Senator Lugar went on to point out in his March 30 speech,\n\n       To reach the START II limits by the year 2000 or 2003 will \n     require enormous effort and cost, particularly on the Russian \n     side. This will be difficult in the best of times but it is \n     particularly challenging given the political and economic \n     revolution engulfing Russia today.\n\n  The genius of the Nunn-Lugar cooperative reduction effort has been to \nface the facts squarely and try to help where we can in the Russian's \neffort to dismantle their nuclear stockpile. Months of inaction on our \npart cannot have improved the prospects for ratification in the Duma.\n  In the elections in Russia in less than 2 weeks we are likely to see \na more conservative Duma emerge, where one Start II ratification will \nbe more difficult as a challenge for President Yeltsin.\n  Mr. President, I believe our delay in carrying out our constitutional \nduties on START II has consequences and they are potentially very bad \nconsequences for our security and for our relations with Russia.\n  Similarly, I believe the delay in carrying out our constitutional \nduties on ambassadorial nominations has consequences.\n  I have a second chart here I want to go through. This is a list of \nthe ambassadorial nominations that have been delayed. This is from the \ntime that they were submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee. We have \nthe names of the ambassadors whose papers are entirely in order and who \ncould be confirmed rapidly if the Foreign Affairs Committee were to \nhold a business meeting. There are 18 names on the list. We can go into \nthem in some detail later on in the morning or later in the day.\n  Together, we have also listed, of course, the countries that they \nwould be ambassadors to and the date that the nomination was sent here \nto the Senate.\n  Most of these people, 14 of them to be precise, are Foreign Service \nofficers. Four of them, Jim Sasser, Sandra Kristoff, James Joseph, and \nJohn Gevirtz are noncareer political appointments. Many of these \nnominations have been ready to move since July.\n\n  Mr. President, the lives of these people and their families have been \ndisrupted by our inaction. Our ability to carry on our diplomatic \nefforts with these nations and in these parts of the world have been \ndisrupted, as well.\n  The signal that we send to the rest of the world when we fail to have \nambassadors in key capitals is not a good signal. Look at the list of \nnations that we have here, Mr. President: China, Indonesia, Pakistan, \nThailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, our Ambassador to the Asia \nPacific Economic Cooperation Organization--APEC, which met recently, \nand we were not represented by an ambassador at that meeting. The Vice \nPresident attended in lieu of our President because of the difficulties \nhere in getting agreement on a budget.\n  What sort of signal are we sending to Asia when we will not carry out \nour constitutional duties here in the Senate in a timely fashion? These \nnations include over a third of the world's population and some of the \nworld's fastest growing economies. We have important and very critical \ninterests in these nations, yet we cannot get around to confirming our \nambassadors to them.\n  Many of the other nations listed are in Africa: South Africa, \nCameroon, Rwanda, et cetera. Again, what sort of a signal are we \nsending? In the case of South Africa, again, the Vice President is \nthere on a trip this week.\n  I am sure that our neglect of our responsibilities in the Senate is \nmuch \n\n[[Page S 18039]]\nbigger news in those nations than it is here, but what we are doing or \nfailing to do in my view is wrong and my point this morning is that we \nneed to get agreement in the Senate to take action on these nominations \nand to take action on START II before we proceed with other less \npressing business.\n  Mr. President, the proposal that the majority leader would like to \nmove to today is the amendment to the Constitution dealing with flag \nburning. Whether a particular Senator opposes that amendment or favors \nit, I think all of us would have to agree that it is not urgent for the \nSenate to act on that proposal.\n  We have survived as a nation now for about 206 years without that \namendment being adopted. I am a fairly regular reader of the newspaper. \nI read the newspaper this morning. I could find nothing in there \nindicating that people are burning flags around this country or around \nthe world, in fact. Of course, the proposal is primarily aimed at those \nburning flags in this country.\n  The point is very simply, Mr. President, whether you favor or oppose \nthe amendment, it is not urgent that we deal with it. We do not need to \nput aside other pressing important business in order to deal with the \nflag amendment today and tomorrow. I think it is much more important \nthat we do the business of the Senate, and the business of the Senate \nvery simply as set out in the Constitution which we are now talking \nabout amending, the business of the Senate is to approve nominations--\nor disapprove.\n  I am not saying here I expect every Senator to come to the floor and \nvote for each of these Presidential nominees to be ambassador. It is \npossible that some of our colleagues would like to vote against them. \nThat is fine. I am not insisting on a particular outcome.\n  I am saying that the Senate should have the chance to vote on these \nambassadorial nominations and on the START II treaty before we conclude \nour business this year.\n  I understand that Senator Hatch is on the floor and he would like to \nspeak for a period on the flag amendment. I certainly am willing to \nyield to him to do that since we will still be in a period debating \nwhether or not to proceed to consideration of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. It was very gracious \nof him to do that, because I am concerned whether we are going to get \nto this amendment.\n  Let me, just for a moment, suggest the absence a quorum with the \nunderstanding I will be recognized as soon as we come out of the quorum \ncall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for being willing to \nyield me this time, because we were supposed to start on the flag \namendment at 10 this morning. I do deeply regret that we are now on a \nfilibuster against a constitutional amendment to prevent the \ndesecration of the American flag. I think the American people should \nknow that this is a filibuster.\n  We have had a filibuster on virtually every bill this year. At the \nheight of Republican irritation at Democratic control of the Senate in \nthe past, I cannot remember any year on which there have been \nfilibusters on virtually everything of substance in any given year. \nSelected filibusters, yes--and I am the first to say that should be \ndone. I am the first to uphold the filibuster rule. But not on \neverything.\n  To prevent us from even considering, or at least trying to prevent us \nfrom considering an amendment to protect the flag, which most \nAmericans, at least 80 percent, favor, it seems to me is something I \nhope my colleagues on the other side will think through and change \ntheir ways, because this is not right. But I do appreciate my colleague \nallowing me this time to make a few comments about how important this \namendment is.\n  It comes down to this. Will the Senate of the United States confuse \nliberty with license? Or will the Senate of the United States allow the \npeople of the United States to have the right to protect their beloved \nnational symbol, the American flag?\n  The Supreme Court, in 1989, in the first of two mistaken 5 to 4 \ndecisions, stripped the American people of that right. This is a right \nthe American people had for over 200 years. This is a right they had \nexercised in 48 States and in Congress. Seventy-three percent of my \nfellow Utahns favor a constitutional amendment to protect the flag.\n\n  Forty-nine State legislatures, including the Utah Legislature, have \ncalled upon Congress to pass a flag protection amendment. Here are 49 \npetitions--here are the voices of people reflected in their State \nlegislatures; 49 petitions for this amendment. Three-hundred and twelve \nmembers of the other body have already voted for this constitutional \namendment. This includes nearly half of the members of the other side \nof the aisle, including their leader, Dick Gephardt--a wonderful \ndisplay of bipartisanship over there, one of the few we have had in \nthis whole last 2 years. So, it does come down to the Senate, no doubt \nabout it.\n  Many of the Nation's law professors and editorial boards oppose this \namendment. An intemperate American Bar Association and the American \nCivil Liberties Union oppose the amendment. Regrettably, President \nClinton opposes this amendment, and I am sure that costs us a few \nvotes. They may be critical votes on this particular amendment. If this \ngoes down, it will be primarily, perhaps, because the President is \nopposed to it. But the American people favor this amendment.\n  We live in a time when standards have eroded. Our sensibilities are \nincreasingly bombarded by coarse and graphic speech and by angry and \nvulgar discourse. We and our children and grandchildren can routinely \nwatch television shows that contain material we never saw or heard on \nmovie screens not so many years ago, let alone on TV. I noticed our \ncolleagues, Senators Lieberman and Nunn, have expressed concerns about \nthe erosion of standards in some aspects of daytime television. I need \nnot dwell on what we and our children can watch at the movies these \ndays. I need not dwell on the lyrics our children are listening to \nthroughout our country, or that they can listen to.\n  Drugs, crime, and pornography debase our society to an extent that no \none would have predicted just two generations ago. The breakdown in the \nfamily, the divisions among our citizens, threaten our progress as one \npeople bound together by common purposes and values.\n  Civility and mutual respect--preconditions for the robust expression \nof diverse views in society--are in decline.\n  Absolutes are ridiculed. Values are deemed relative. Nothing is \nsacred. There are no limits. Anything goes.\n  Individual rights are cherished and constantly expanded, but \nresponsibilities are shirked and scorned.\n  We seek to instill in our children a pride in our country--a pride \nthat we hope will serve as a basis for good citizenship and for \ndevotion to improving our country and adhering to its best interests as \nthey can honestly see those interests; a pride in country that takes \nthem beyond the question, ``What's in it for me?'' We seek to instill a \npride in country that may one day be called upon as a basis for painful \nsacrifice in the country's interests, maybe even the ultimate \nsacrifice, as it was in the case of my brother, in the Second World \nWar.\n  We hope our children will feel connected to the diverse people who \nare their fellow citizens--the people they will grow up to work with, \ncross paths with in daily life, and live among.\n  We ask our school children to pledge allegiance to the flag. But, the \nSupreme Court now dictates that we must tell them that the same flag is \nunworthy of legal protection when it is treated in the most vile, \ndisrespectful, or contemptuous manner.\n  At the same time that we seek to foster pride in each rising \ngeneration, our country grows more and more diverse. Many of our people \nrevel in their particular cultures and diverse national origins, and \nproperly so. Others are alienated from their fellow citizens and from \ngovernment altogether.\n  We have no monarchy, no state religion, no elite class--hereditary or \notherwise--representing the Nation and its unity. We have the flag. \n\n[[Page S 18040]]\n\n  The American flag is the one symbol that unites a very diverse people \nin a way nothing else can, in peace or war. Despite our differences of \nparty, politics, philosophy, religion, ethnic background, economic \nstatus, social status, or geographic region, the American flag forms a \nunique, common bond among us. Failure to protect the flag inevitably \nloosens this bond, no matter how much some may claim to the contrary. \nIn my opinion, the defenders of this newly discovered, so-called right \nto desecrate the American flag do confuse liberty with license.\n  The issue really does boil down to this: isn't it ridiculous that the \nAmerican people are unable to protect their flag, if they wish to do \nso? This one, unique symbol of our country? It might come as a shock to \nmany, but the law does not have to be totally devoid of common sense. \nOf course, the amendment and implementing statutes must be carefully \ncrafted and the lawyers consulted on this. But the underlying issue is \nnot nearly as complicated as the legal mumbo--jumbo of the lawyers and \nelitists make it out to be.\n  Perhaps Paul Greenberg, editorial page editor of the Arkansas \nDemocrat Gazette, summarized it best in a July 6, 1995 column:\n\n       ``But didn't our intelligentsia explain to us yokels again \n     and again that burning the flag of the United States isn't an \n     action, but speech, and therefore a constitutionally \n     protected right? That's what the Supreme Court decided, too, \n     if only in one of its confused and confusing 5-to-4 splits. \n     But the people don't seem to have caught on. They still \n     insist that burning the flag is burning the flag, not making \n     a speech. Stubborn lot, the people. Powerful thing, public \n     opinion . . .\n       ``It isn't the idea of desecrating the flag that the \n     American people propose to ban. Any street-corner orator who \n     takes a notion to should be able to stand on a soapbox and \n     badmouth the American flag all day long--and apple pie and \n     motherhood, too, if that's the way the speaker feels. It's a \n     free country.\n       ``It's actually burning Old Glory, it's defacing the Stars \n     and Stripes, it's the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States that oughta be against the law. And the people \n     of the United States just can't seem to be talked out of that \n     notion--or orated out of it, or lectured out of it, or \n     condescended and patronized out of it.\n       ``Maybe it's because the people can't shut their eyes to \n     homely truths as easily as our Advanced Thinkers. How many \n     legs does a dog have, Mr. Lincoln once asked, if you call its \n     tail a leg? And he answered: still four. Calling a tail a leg \n     doesn't make it one. Not even a symbolic leg. The people have \n     this stubborn notion that calling something a constitutional \n     right doesn't make it one, despite the best our theorists and \n     pettifoggers can do.\n       ``The people keep being told that their flag is just a \n     symbol.\n       ``Just a symbol.\n       ``We live by symbols, said a Justice of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court (Felix Frankfurter) . . . And if a nation lives by its \n     symbols, it also dies with them.\n       ``To turn aside when the American flag is defaced, with all \n     that the flag means--yes, all that it symbolizes--is to ask \n     too much of Americans. There are symbols and there are \n     Symbols. There are some so rooted in history and custom, and \n     in the heroic imagination of a nation, that they transcend \n     the merely symbolic; they become presences. . . .\n\n  I think that is a pretty profound editorial.\n  The amendment before us does not itself protect the flag. It empowers \nCongress and the States to do so. The amendment reads: ``The Congress \nand the States shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of \nthe flag of the United States.''\n  That is a very simple statement, as constitutional amendments should \nbe stated.\n  Now I wish we did not have to amend the Constitution to achieve our \npurpose. It should not be necessary. I believe that the Constitution \npermits Congress and the States to enact flag protection laws. But as \nour colleague Senator Feinstein and others have well noted, the Supreme \nCourt has given us no choice. Twice it has struck down statutes \nprotecting the flag--in Texas versus Johnson in 1989, a Texas statute; \nand in U.S. versus Eichman in 1990, a Federal statute that we enacted \nin response to Johnson. This amendment would overturn both decisions.\n  I remember when we debated that on the floor. I said the court would \nstrike that statute down which, of course, it has.\n  Now let me be clear what this debate is not about. This is not about \nwho loves the flag more. President Clinton and other present opponents \nof legal protection of the flag, and opponents of this particular \namendment, love the flag no less than supporters of the amendment. \nPatriots can disagree about this amendment.\n  This is also not about who believes in the first amendment more. \nSupporters of this amendment, no less than its opponents, believe in \nprotecting the right of free speech. In my view, there is no clash \nbetween protecting the American flag and preserving freedom of speech. \nAnd, during all the years that flag protection statutes were on the \nbooks, freedom of speech in this country actually expanded under the \nlaw.\n  The amendment does not prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, \nnationalism, or any matter of opinion. This amendment does not compel \nanyone, by word or act, to salute, honor, or respect the flag.\n  So what, then, is this debate really about? This debate concerns our \njudgment about what values are truly at stake. It is about our sense of \nnational community. It is about whether it is important enough to \nensure that the one unique symbol of all of us, under which many have \nfought and died, may be protected if the people feel strongly enough to \ndo so.\n  This debate, then, is about letting the American people, so many of \nwhom do respect, revere, and honor our flag, decide whether this \nindisputably unique symbol of our country is worthy of legal protection \nfrom those who would physically desecrate it. Right now, the Supreme \nCourt mistakenly has mistakenly stripped the people of their 200-year-\nold democratic right to make this decision.\n  The flag is the quickest and most intense way for those with an \nurgent cause to seek identification with their fellow citizens and \nAmerican ideals and principles. Indeed, it is not uncommon for causes \nseeking popular support to rely on the flag as a silent but extremely \npowerful part of their appeal to fellow Americans. In a wonderful book, \n``Star Spangled Banner, Our Nation and its Flag,'' by Margaret Sedeen, \npublished by the National Geographic Society, one can see vivid \nreminders of this. On page 181, women suffragettes are shown in an open \nair car with placards proclaiming their cause and waving several \nAmerican flags. Two pages later is another picture, and I will read its \ncaption:\n\n       Holding the flag high as a banner for his cause, a marcher \n     makes his way along the road from Selma to Montgomery, AL, in \n     the spring of 1965, protesting continued efforts to deny most \n     southern blacks their rights to register and vote. Within \n     months of the march, Congress approved the Voting Rights Act \n     of 1965.\n\n  Now, parenthetically, I should note that in between these two pages \nis a picture which will make the blood boil of every Member of this \nbody. I will read that inscription:\n\n       On April 5, 1976, a white high school student, 1 of 200 \n     antibusing demonstrators in Boston that day, used the flag as \n     a lance to lunge at a black attorney who walked onto the \n     scene.\n\n  This is a picture of the man. Mr. President, this is as vile a \nphysical abuse of the flag as any flag burning you have ever seen. It \nis also a reminder to us that any amendment we adopt must be worded so \nas to permit legislative bodies to address the variety of \ndisrespectful, physical mistreatments of the flag that can occur.\n  It is not possible to express fully all of the reasons the flag \ndeserves such protection. As then Justice Rehnquist wrote in 1974: \n``The significance of the flag, and the deep emotional feelings it \narouses in a large part of our citizenry, cannot be fully expressed in \nthe two dimensions of a lawyer's brief or of a judicial opinion.'' \n[Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 at 602 (1974)(Rehnquist, J., \ndissenting).] The notion that our law denies the American people the \nability to protect their flag from physical desecration defies common \nsense.\n  This amendment empowers Congress and the States to protect only the \nAmerican flag--and only from acts of physical desecration.\n\n\n                 This Cause Originates with the People\n\n  The current movement for this amendment originates with the American \npeople. It is right and proper that their elected representatives \nrespond affirmatively.\n  I respect those who have a different view. But I also think that \nsupporters of this amendment, who are Democrats and Republicans alike, \ndeserve the same presumption of good faith in our motives. \n\n[[Page S 18041]]\n\n  So let me note at the outset that this has always been a bipartisan \neffort. On June 28, as mentioned earlier, nearly half of the Democrats \nin the House, including their leader, Richard Gephardt, voted for the \namendment.\n  In the Senate, the lead cosponsor is Senator Heflin. The Democratic \nwhip, Senator Ford, is a cosponsor, as are Senators Feinstein, Baucus, \nRockefeller, Johnston, Breaux, Hollings, Exon, Reid, and Nunn.\n  I am troubled, therefore, that some opponents of the amendment would \naccuse its congressional sponsors of trying to score political points \nby pursuing ratification of this amendment.\n  So why are we here today? A grassroots coalition, the Citizens Flag \nAlliance, led by the American Legion, has been working for some time in \nsupport of a constitutional amendment regarding flag desecration. The \nCitizens Flag Alliance consists of over 100 organizations, ranging from \nthe Knights of Columbus; Grand Lodge, Fraternal Order of Police; and \nthe National Grange to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the \nUSA and the African-American Women's Clergy Association. These \norganizations represent millions of Americans. Over 200,000 individuals \nalso belong to the Citizens Flag Alliance. The American Legion, and \nthen the Citizens Flag Alliance as well, worked to obtain support for \nthe amendment. Citizens organizations exist in every State. The \nVeterans of Foreign Wars also supports this amendment.\n  The Citizens Flag Alliance approached Senator Heflin and me last \nyear, well before the November elections, and asked us to lead \na bipartisan effort in the Senate. They told us they had reasonable \nhopes that President Clinton would support this amendment. Senator \nHeflin and I did not initiate this current effort. We would not be here \nnow if the Citizens Flag Alliance had not initiated it. A similar \nbipartisan approach was made in the House of Representatives.\n\n  So why are we here today? We are here for the reasons expressed by \nRose Lee, a Gold Star Wife and past president of the Gold Star Wives of \nAmerica. Her husband died on active duty 23 years ago and she brought \nthe flag that draped her husband's coffin to the June 6 hearing on this \namendment. She testified, ``It's not fair and it's not right that flags \nlike this flag, handed to me by an Honor Guard 23 years ago, can be \nlegally burned by someone in this country * * * [It is] a dishonor to \nour husbands and an insult to their widows to allow this flag to be \nlegally burned.'' Did she and the other Gold Star Wives who accompanied \nher to the hearing show up to play politics?\n  We are here for the reasons expressed by Joseph Pinon, assistant city \nmanager of Miami Beach, FL, who fled Castro's Cuba, fought as a marine \nin Vietnam, and whose Marine unit refused to leave the flag behind at \nhill 695 when that unit had to withdraw under enemy pressure. Did he \ntestify in order to play politics?\n  We are here for reasons which reside in the hearts and minds of the \nAmerican people, reasons which are not easy to put into words. The flag \nitself represents no political party or ideology.\n  Make no mistake: the American people resurrected this amendment. They \nwill keep it alive until it is ratified.\n  There is more wisdom, judgment, understanding, and common sense among \nthe American people on this matter than on our Nation's law faculties, \neditorial boards, and in the Clinton administration. Let me cite some \nof that common sense. In the 1989 Judiciary Committee hearings, R. Jack \nPowell, executive director of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, said \nit as well as anyone:\n\n       ``The members of Paralyzed Veterans of America, all of whom \n     have incurred catastrophic spinal cord injury or dysfunction, \n     have shared the ultimate experience of citizenship under the \n     flag: serving in defense of our Nation. The flag, for us, \n     embodies that service and that sacrifice as a symbol of all \n     the freedoms we cherish, including the First Amendment right \n     of free speech and expression. Curiously, the Supreme Court \n     in rendering its decision [in Texas versus Johnson] could not \n     clearly ascertain how to determine whether the flag was a \n     ``symbol'' that was ``sufficiently special to warrant . . . \n     unique status.'' In our opinion and from our experience, \n     there is no question as to the unique status and singular \n     position the flag holds as the symbol of freedom, our \n     Constitution and our Nation. As such it must be defended and \n     provided special protection under the law.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I am concerned that there is some impression, at least in \n     the media and by some others that are around, that the idea \n     of supporting the flag is some idea just of right-wing \n     conservatives, and I have heard some Senators say, those \n     veteran organizations, and that kind of thing.\n       In fact, the flag is the symbol of a constitution that \n     allows Mr. Johnson to express his opinion. So, to destroy \n     that symbol is again a step to destroy the idea that there is \n     one nation on earth that allows their people to express their \n     opinions, whether they happen to be socialist opinions or \n     neo-Nazi opinions, or democratic opinions or republican \n     opinions.\n\n  Now listen carefully to these further words from Mr. Powell:\n\n       Certainly, the idea of society is the banding together of \n     individuals for the mutual protection of each individual. \n     That includes, also, an idea that we have somehow lost in \n     this country, and that is the reciprocal, willing giving up \n     of unlimited individual freedom so that society can be \n     cohesive and can work. It would seem that those who want most \n     to talk about freedom ought to recognize the right of a \n     society to say that there is a symbol, one symbol, which in \n     standing for this great freedom for everyone of different \n     opinions, different persuasions, different religions, and \n     different backgrounds, society puts beyond the pale to \n     trample with. [Testimony of R. Jack Powell, Sept. 13, 1989, \n     at 432-437].\n\n  There is more wisdom and judgment in these few paragraphs than my \ncolleagues will find in page after page of the Clinton administration's \ntestimony, the arcane testimony of law professors opposed to the \namendment, or the thoughtless and intemperate outbursts of the American \nBar Association.\n  The July 24, 1995, Washington Post published a letter from Max G. \nBernhardt, of Silver Spring, MD. He said:\n\n       I'm certainly a liberal, although I've always made up my \n     own mind on things and have never felt an obligation to \n     accept anyone else's definition of what was and what was not \n     the proper liberal position on any given issue. I can't for \n     the life of me figure out why the proposed amendment to the \n     Constitution outlawing desecration of the United States flag \n     should evoke the furious opposition that it has.\n       There seem to be three principal arguments against it: \n     First, it isn't needed because this isn't what people are \n     doing anymore; second, it will have a chilling effect on the \n     exercise of free expression; third, it will start us down the \n     proverbial slippery slope to various other infringements on, \n     and restrictions of, free speech and expression.\n       If we don't need it, then it won't matter one way or \n     another if it's enacted, and no one has to worry about it \n     being there as a part of the Constitution. I see no reason \n     why desecration of our flag needs to be tolerated in the \n     name of free speech. I cannot see how outlawing such acts \n     adversely affects free expression--other than flag \n     desecration itself--in any manner, shape, or form. Given \n     the nature of the process required to enact an amendment \n     to the Constitution, I see no reason to fear that \n     enactment of this amendment will lead to the enactment of \n     other constitutional amendments that might be adverse to \n     free expression or other rights.\n       Far from destruction of the Bill of Rights, as depicted by \n     Herblock in the July 2 Post, the only thing this amendment \n     does is to outlaw desecration of the flag, which only by the \n     most expansive interpretation of the First Amendment could \n     have been established as legally permissible in the first \n     place. It in no way affects anything else and should be \n     enacted forthwith.\n\n  This individual displayed more common sense and understanding on this \nmatter than one will find in editorials, cartoons, and pundits' \nofferings in the Washington Post, and other illustrious journalistic \npieces and publications.\n\n\n                         Response to Criticisms\n\n  Let me give a response to some of the criticisms. The committee \nreport fully addresses the legal and other arguments against the \namendment. And I urge my colleagues to review it. I am prepared to \naddress some of them later in the debate if I had to. Let me just make \na few comments now.\n  In my view, this amendment, granting Congress and the States power to \nprohibit physical desecration of the flag, does not amend the first \namendment. I believe the flag protection amendment overturns two \nSupreme Court decisions which have misconstrued the first amendment.\n  The first amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech has never been \ndeemed absolute. Libel is not protected under the first amendment. \nObscenity is not protected under the first amendment. Fighting words \nwhich provoke violence or breaches of the peace are not protected under \nthe first amendment. A person cannot blare out his or her political \nviews at 2 o'clock in the morning in a residential neighborhood and \nclaim first amendment protection. \n\n[[Page S 18042]]\n\n  The view that the first amendment does not disable Congress and the \nStates from prohibiting physical desecration of the flag has been \nshared across a wide spectrum.\n  Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, ``I believe that the states and the \nFederal government do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \ndesecration and disgrace . . .'' [Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 605 \n(dissenting)]. Justice Hugo Black--generally regarded as a first \namendment absolutist--stated, ``It passes my belief that anything in \nthe Federal Constitution bars a state from making the deliberate \nburning of the American flag an offense.'' [Id. at 610 (dissenting)]. \nJustice Abe Fortas wrote, ``[T]he States and the Federal government \nhave the power to protect the flag from acts of desecration committed \nin public . . .'' [Id. at 615 (dissenting)]. According to Assistant \nAttorney General Dellinger, President Clinton agrees with Justice \nBlack, but still opposes any amendment.\n  It is not the first amendment which protects physical desecration of \nthe American flag. The Supreme Court misinterpreted the text of the \nfirst amendment, ignored 200 years of history, and superimposed its own \nevolving theories of the first amendment in 1989 in Texas versus \nJohnson. That just 20 years earlier civil libertarians such as Earl \nWarren and Abe Fortas, and a first amendment absolutist such as Hugo \nBlack, took it as elementary that flag desecration laws are \nconstitutional is a measure of how far the Supreme Court has moved in \nthis area.\n\n  We have had flag desecration statutes for many decades--yet the \navenues available for dissent have gotten larger, not smaller, over \ntime. And I would agree with that. Indeed, I would point out that \nduring the time these laws were first enacted in the 19th century, \nfreedom of speech in general has been enlarged: the first amendment has \nbeen made applicable to the states via the 14th Amendment's due process \nclause [Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927)]; commercial speech has \nbeen given protection [Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia \nCitizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748 (1976)]; the public forum \ndoctrine appeared in 1939 [Hague v. CIO, 370 U.S. 496 (1939)]; indeed, \nprivate shopping centers must make their property available for \ndissemination of literature [Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 \nU.S. 74 (1980)]; the overbreadth doctrine developed in 1940 [Thornhill \nv. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88 (1940)]; and the void for vagueness doctrine \ndeveloped in 1972 [Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156 (1972)].\n  Yet, to listen to some of the critics of this amendment, one would \nbelieve ratification of the flag protection amendment would herald a \nnew Dark Age.\n\n\n                         Need for the Amendment\n\n  Let me also address the underlying need for the amendment. The \nClinton administration testified that, in light of what it refers to as \n``only a few isolated instances [of flag burning], the flag is amply \nprotected by its unique stature as an embodiment of national unity and \nideals.'' With all due respect, I find that comment clearly wrong.\n  First, aside from the number of flag desecrations, our very refusal \nto take action to protect the American flag clearly devalues it. Our \nacquiescence in the Supreme Court's decisions reduces the flag's \nsymbolic value. As a practical matter, the effect, however unintended, \nof our acquiescence equates the flag with a rag, at least as a matter \nof law, no matter what we feel in our hearts. Anyone in this country \ncan buy a rag and the American flag and burn them both to dramatize a \nviewpoint. The law currently treats the two acts as the same. How one \ncan say that this legal state of affairs does not devalue the flag is \nbeyond me.\n  This concern is shared by others. Justice John Paul Stevens said in \nhis Johnson dissent:\n\n       . . . in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public \n     desecration of the flag will tarnish its value . . . That \n     tarnish is not justified by the trivial burden on free \n     expression occasioned by requiring that an available \n     alternative mode of expression, including uttering words \n     critical of the flag . . . be employed. [491 U.S. at 437].\n\n  Pro. Richard Parker of Harvard Law School testified:\n\n       ``If it is permissible not just to heap verbal contempt on \n     the flag, but to burn it, rip it and smear it with \n     excrement--if such behavior is not only permitted in \n     practice, but protected in law by the Supreme Court--then the \n     flag is already decaying as the symbol of our aspiration to \n     the unity underlying our freedom. The flag we fly in \n     response is no longer the same thing. We are told . . . \n     that someone can desecrate ``a'' flag but not ``the'' \n     flag. To that, I simply say: Untrue. This is precisely the \n     way that general symbols like general values are trashed, \n     particular step by particular step. This is the way, \n     imperceptibly, that commitments and ideals are lost.''\n\n  I think Professor Parker's comments are pretty apropos here.\n  Indeed, disrespectful physical treatment of the flag need not involve \nprotest. Just a short time ago, I saw a newsclip about a motorist at a \ngas station using an American flag to wipe the car's dipstick. A \nveteran called it to the police's attention but, of course, the \nindividual cannot be prosecuted today. He can keep using it as he has, \nor perhaps he will next use it to wash his car.\n  Moreover, as a simple matter of law and reality, the flag is not \nprotected from those who would burn, deface, trample, defile, or \notherwise physically desecrate it.\n  Further, whether the 45-plus flags which were publicly reported \ndesecrated between 1990 and 1994, and those which have occurred this \nyear, represent too small a problem does not turn on the sheer number \nof these desecrations alone. When a flag desecration is reported in \nlocal print, radio, and television media, potentially millions, and if \nreported in the national media, tens upon tens of millions of people, \nsee or read or learn of these desecrations. How do my colleagues think, \nRose Lee, for example, feels when she sees a flag desecration in \nCalifornia reported in the media? The impact is far greater than the \nnumber of flag desecrations.\n  One might also ask, even if espionage occurs rarely, should we have \nno statutes outlawing it? Arrests for treason are rare--but the crime \nis set out right there in the Constitution and in our statutes.\n\n\n                           No Slippery Slope\n\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no slippery slope here. The \namendment is limited to authorizing States and the Federal Government \nto prohibit physical desecration of only the American flag. It does not \nsuppress viewpoints, nor does it regulate any means of expression aside \nfrom physical desecration of the flag. It serves as no precedent for \nany other legislation or constitutional amendment on any other subject \nor mode of conduct, precisely because the flag is unique.\n  Some critics of the amendment ask, is our flag so fragile as to \nrequire legal protection? I have tried to explain why our national \nsymbol should be legally protected. The better question is this: is our \nability to express views so fragile in this country as to be unable to \nwithstand the withdrawal of the flag from physical desecration? Of \ncourse not.\n  Ideas have many avenues of expression, including the use of marches, \nrallies, picketing, leaflets, placards, bullhorns, and so very much \nmore.\n  Even one of the opponents of the amendment testifying at the \nsubcommittee hearing, Bruce Fein, the conservative analyst, described \nthe amendment as ``a submicroscopic encroachment on free expression . . \n.'' in response to written questions. A submicroscopic approach.\n\n  Pro. Cass M. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School, a \nvigorous opponent of the amendment, conceded:\n\n       There are reasons to think that as the basic symbol of \n     nationhood the flag is sui generis and legitimately stands \n     alone. Moreover, constitutional protection of the flag would \n     prohibit only one, relatively unusual form of protest. \n     Multiple other forms would remain available.\n\n  The administration's witness agreed with these remarks, in response \nto my written questions. Indeed, I think Professor Sunstein understated \nhis first point--there is no doubt the flag stands alone as a national \nsymbol.\n  Even if, contrary to my view, one agreed that the Johnson and Eichman \ncases were correctly decided under prior precedents, one could still \nsupport this amendment--if one believes protection of the flag from \nphysical desecration is an important enough value.\n\n\n                   Content-Neutral Amendment is Wrong\n\n  A few critics of the pending amendment believe that a constitutional \namendment either must make illegal \n\n[[Page S 18043]]\nall physical impairments of the integrity of the flag, such as by \nburning or mutilating, or that no physical desecration of the flag \nshould be illegal. This is the approach of my friend from Delaware, who \nwill offer such an amendment. This all-or-nothing approach to our \nfundamental governing document flies in the face of nearly a century of \nlegislative protection of the flag. It is also wholly impractical.\n  In order to be truly content neutral, such an amendment must have no \nexceptions, even for the respectful disposal of a worn or soiled flag. \nOnce such an exception is allowed, the veneer of content neutrality is \nstripped away. The Supreme Court in Johnson acknowledged this. A \ncontent-neutral amendment would forbid an American combat veteran from \ntaking an American flag flown in battle and having printed on it the \nname of his unit and location of specific battles, in honor of his \nunit, the service his fellow soldiers, and the memory of the lost.\n  Then Assistant Attorney General for Legal Counsel William P. Barr \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee August 1, 1989 and \nbrought a certain American flag with him. He said:\n\n       Now let me give you an example of . . . the kind of result \n     that we get under the [content-neutral approach]. This is the \n     actual flag carried in San Juan Hill. It was carried by the \n     lead unit, the 13th Regiment U.S. Infantry, and they proudly \n     emblazon their name right across the flag . . . 1,078 \n     Americans died following this flag up San Juan Hill . . . \n     Under [a content-neutral approach], you can't have regiments \n     put their name on the flag, that's defacement . . . \n     [Testimony, Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr, \n     August 1, 1989, at 68].\n\n  We do wish to empower Congress and the States to prohibit the \ncontemptuous or disrespectful physical treatment of the flag. We do not \nwish to compel Congress and the States to penalize respectful treatment \nof the flag. Such a so-called content-neutral amendment would place a \nstraitjacket on the American people and deny them the right to protect \nthe flag in the manner they have traditionally protected it.\n  A constitutional amendment which, in our fundamental law, would treat \nthe placing of the name of a military unit on a flag as the equivalent \nof placing the words ``Down with the fascist Federal Government'' or \nracist remarks on the flag is not what the popular movement for \nprotecting the flag is all about. I respectfully submit that such an \napproach ignores distinctions well understood by tens of millions of \nAmericans.\n  Moreover, never in the 204 years of the first amendment has the free \nspeech clause been construed as totally content neutral. For example, \nspeech criticizing official conduct of a public official may be legally \npenalized if it is known to be false, or made in utter, reckless \ndisregard for the truth, and damages the official's reputation. And \nthis is actual speech, not action or conduct as in the case of \ndesecrating the flag. Moreover, one can express views at city hall, but \nif one does so obscenely, one can be arrested. This is not content \nneutrality. Indeed, I think it is fair to liken flag desecration to \nobscenity.\n\n  Of course, any law enacted pursuant to the pending amendment cannot \nbar physical desecration of the flag by one political party and permit \nit by the other, or ban its physical desecration by those in opposition \nto a government policy, but not by those who support the policy. As \nwith other parts of the Constitution, the amendment will be interpreted \nin harmony with other provisions of the Constitution. Thus, a State \ncannot favor a flag desecrator who burns the flag protesting the \nGovernment's failure to topple Saddam Hussein over the flag desecrator \ncomplaining about American participation in the gulf war in the first \nplace. The first amendment's prohibition on viewpoint discrimination \nwill apply to statutes enacted under the pending amendment.\n\n\n                    Ridiculous, Overblown Arguments\n\n  One more thing about this debate, Mr. President. I have rarely heard \nmore overblown, ridiculous arguments made against a measure as I have \nheard regarding this amendment, which simply restores a power to the \npeople they had held for 200 years, and exercised for about 100 years.\n  There are colleagues of mine on the Judiciary Committee who actually \nmake the absurd suggestion that this amendment blurs the distinction \nbetween a free country and a tyranny. Tell that to the Gold Star Wives. \nTell that to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Forget about the fact that \nduring the nearly 100 years that 48 States and Congress were adopting \nflag desecration statutes, we seemed, somehow, to avoid the descent \ninto tyranny. Ironically, freedom of speech actually expanded in this \ncountry as I said. These colleagues actually make the ridiculous, \nnonsensical, thinly veiled suggestions that legal protection of the \nAmerican flag is somehow similar to the Chinese Communist \ndictatorship's execution of dissidents in 1989, and that legal \nprotection of the flag somehow makes us more like a Communist \ndictatorship. If you do not believe me, Mr. President, read their views \nin the committee report on page 74 and at footnote 11. Listening to \nsome of these critics, one would think enactment of the pending \namendment would curtail the ability of dissenters to be heard. One \nshudders to think about their lackadaisical attitude toward repression \nin America during all the years before the Supreme Court, in 1989, \nsaved America from its decline and fall into totalitarianism. After \nall, notwithstanding the solemn fears they express, I am unaware that \nthose colleagues in the Senate lifted one finger to plug this gaping \nhole in our freedom by trying to repeal the federal flag protection \nstatute before 1989.\n  Some of my colleagues actually raise the utterly groundless, \ninherently unbelievable claim that the pending amendment could \nauthorize a statute prohibiting the flying of the flag over a brothel. \nYou do not believe me, Mr. President? You'll find that little gem on \npage 77 of the committee report. The things some of our colleagues \nworry about.\n  It is a good thing my colleagues expressing these views were not \nMembers of the first Congress. Mr. President, given their concern about \nflags over brothels, I can only imagine the angst my colleagues would \nhave expressed about the scope of the proposed fourth amendment's \nprotections against unreasonable searches and seizures. I wonder how \nthe phrase due process of law in the fifth amendment would have fared. \nThe point is this, as we explain in the committee report: there is no \ncause to fear the terms of this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to apply a higher standard to an amendment \nprotecting the flag than the Framers themselves applied to the Bill of \nRights. The words of this amendment are at least as precise, if not \nmore so, than many terms in the Bill of Rights. And keep in mind what \nmy colleague Senator Heflin has repeatedly said: This amendment does \nnot prohibit any conduct. There will be implementing legislation. And \nsuch legislation will have to be sufficiently specific to withstand due \nprocess scrutiny. This amendment just says that the States and the \nCongress can determine that people cannot desecrate our flag.\n  Let me just end this by saying that some have wondered why we are \nputting forth this enormous effort to enact this amendment to protect \nthe flag, a so-called mere symbol. The answer is simple. The nearly \nmystical connection between the American people and Old Glory really is \nthat strong. That bond between our constituents and the flag is the \nbond on which our entire effort rests, the bond from which it draws its \nstrength. That bond will keep this movement alive until a flag \nprotection amendment is ratified, no mistake about it. We are fighting \nfor the very values that the vast majority of the American people fear \nwe are losing in this country.\n  This is an important amendment, as I think all constitutional \namendments must and should be. It is an amendment that has been simple \non its face. This is an amendment that we believe at least 66 Senators \nought to vote for. In fact, I believe all 99 of us currently sitting in \nthis body ought to vote for it.\n  Having said that, I am somewhat surprised that, needing only 34 votes \nto defeat this amendment, there would be those on the other side who \nwould filibuster even the bringing up of this amendment on the floor. \nIn fact, I would be surprised if they would filibuster the amendment \nitself once we defeat them on the motion to proceed. I cannot imagine \nwhy anybody, needing only 34 votes to defeat this, would \n\n[[Page S 18044]]\nfilibuster where you need 41 votes in order to stop the debate.\n  I really hope, with all my heart, that my friends on the other side \nwill realize how important this is to the people of this country and \nwill withdraw their filibuster and their efforts to stop the motion to \nproceed and will not filibuster the amendment itself, and will allow it \nto go to a constitutional vote, where all they have to get are 34 votes \nto defeat it. We have to get 66 votes on a constitutional amendment, \nand that is as it should be. Constitutional amendments should be very \ndifficult to enact.\n  Our basic document is not a piece of legislation that can be amended \nat will. It requires a very long, arduous, difficult process. I am \nhopeful that we will have 66 votes on this amendment, or more; but if \nwe do not, everybody here is going to be put on notice right here and \nnow that this will be brought back until we do.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for allowing me to make this \nlengthy but important statement on this issue.\n  I yield the floor back to him.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nAlabama, who is a cosponsor of the flag burning amendment, is somewhere \nnearby and wants to give a statement at some point here. Obviously, I \nwill be glad to defer to him when he wants to make that statement.\n  Let me just state again what I said at the beginning of this \ndiscussion. That is, my objection to proceeding with the amendment is \nnot because I think the Senate should not be able to vote on this \nissue. I do not support the amendment; I did not support it when it \ncame up before. But I do not object to us going ahead and getting a \nvote. But I do believe that before we move to amend the Constitution, \nas is proposed here, we need to tend to the business of carrying out \nour duties as they are set out in the Constitution. Those duties are \npretty clear, and we in the Senate have some very specific duties to \ncarry out. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says:\n\n       He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of \n     the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two-thirds of the \n     Senators present concur . . .\n\n  So we have a responsibility to pass on treaties.\n\n       . . . and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other \n     public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, \n     and all other Officers of the United States . . .\n\n  So my position is, Mr. President, we ought to go about doing that \nwhich the Constitution requires of us before we proceed to amend the \nConstitution. Or we should at least get agreement as to a date when we \nare going to do that which the Constitution requires of us; that is, \npassing on the President's nomination for these ambassadorial posts.\n  I have this list here. It is a long list, which I referred to \nearlier. I think it is one that clearly deserves our attention. As I \npointed out in my earlier statement, it represents the people in the \ncountries that these ambassadors will serve in, which represent about a \nthird of the world's population. Why should we in the Senate be able \nto, day after day, week after week, look the other way and say it is \nnot our responsibility, it is not our problem? It is our responsibility \nunder the Constitution, Mr. President; it is our problem, and we need \nto get about the business of dealing with it.\n  Mr. President, I think it is interesting that this is coming up in \nthis context. We are constantly hearing about the respect that we all \nhave for the Constitution. I do not doubt that respect. I think, \nclearly, anyone who devotes his life to public service is demonstrating \na real commitment to this country.\n  We all swear to an oath of office when we are sworn in here in the \nSenate, and it is an interesting oath, which I would like to read for \npeople, just to refresh people's memory. The question which the \nPresiding Officer asks each of us is:\n\n       Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the \n     Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \n     foreign and domestic, that you will bear true faith and \n     allegiance to the same, that you take this obligation freely \n     without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion . . .\n\n  Here is the important part, I think, for purposes of this discussion, \nMr. President.\n\n       . . . and that you will well and faithfully discharge the \n     duties of the office which you are about to enter, so help \n     you God.\n\n  Mr. President, well and faithfully discharging the duties of the \noffice of a U.S. Senator today includes voting on the Ambassadors that \nthe President has nominated to serve in these countries. Well and \nfaithfully discharging the duties of the office of a U.S. Senator today \nmeans voting on the START II treaty, which has been here languishing in \nthe Senate now for many months. So that is the point that I am trying \nto make.\n  Since the Senator from Alabama is not here wishing to speak, let me \ngo ahead and make a few other points about, first of all, the START II \ntreaty. START II is the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. It was \nsigned by President Bush on January 3, 1993, shortly before he left \noffice. It is a landmark agreement. It will reduce nuclear arsenals in \nboth the United States and the former Soviet Union by close to two-\nthirds.\n  This is not a minor item, Mr. President. This is not some detail that \nwe have not gotten around to dealing with. This will reduce the nuclear \narsenals in both the United States and the former Soviet Union by close \nto two-thirds.\n  START II is a vital successor to the first START Treaty, which was \nnegotiated by President Ronald Reagan. Not only does START II reduce \nnuclear stockpiles in both Russia and the United States to between \n3,000 to 3,500 warheads each, it also eliminates multiple independent \nreentry vehicles, MIRV's. Policymakers and military officials in both \nparties agree that START II is vital to U.S. strategic interests.\n  Mr. President, I know we are in a very major discussion and debate, \nnationally, about whether the United States should be involved in the \nNATO activity in Bosnia. I think that is important. I think it is a \nvery important military initiative, diplomatic initiative that this \nadministration is involved in. But I would say that at least as \nimportant is following through and ratifying START II and then seeing \nthat it is properly implemented.\n  When the history of this century is written, Mr. President, our \nability to move from the cold war down to a period where there is less \nthreat and to a situation where less nuclear threat is going to be a \ndetermining factor in whether or not we have carried out our \nstewardship properly, I think it is the height of folly for us to lose \nsight of that important need and constantly be focusing on other \nmatters here that are not time sensitive.\n  As I said earlier in the discussion, whether you believe that we \nought to have a flag burning amendment or whether you disagree about \nthe flag burning amendment, everyone has to concede that this is not an \nurgent matter.\n  We have been a nation now for 206 years. We have never had a flag \nburning amendment to the Constitution. There is not an epidemic of flag \nburning going on in this country, Mr. President.\n  I have scoured the newspapers to try to find examples of people out \nthere burning flags. In our history there have been some examples. \nClearly, it is not something that is urgent and that needs dealing with \nthis week here in the U.S. Senate.\n  These other matters in my opinion do have some urgency about them. I \nwill get into that in more detail later in the discussion.\n  Let me give some quotations about the START II treaty from various \nleaders in this country, former leaders, present leaders. President \nGeorge Bush made the statement, ``The START II treaty is clearly in the \ninterests of the United States and represents a watershed in our \nefforts to stabilize the nuclear balance further reduce strategic \noffensive arms.''\n  Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee \nsaid, on February 3 of this year, ``I am persuaded that the 3,000 to \n3,500 nuclear weapons allowed Russia and the United States in this \nSTART treaty does meet reasonable standards of safety.''\n  The Heritage Foundation has a briefing book they provide to new \nMembers \n\n[[Page S 18045]]\nof Congress. That briefing book for this 104th Congress had in it a \nstatement that said, ``The START II treaty should serve U.S. interests \nand should be approved for ratification.'' That is the Heritage \nFoundation, one of the more conservative think tanks here in our \nNation's Capital.\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, said, \n``With a U.S. force structure of about 3,500 nuclear weapons we have \nthe capability to deter any actor in the other capital no matter what \nhe has at his disposal.'' That was in July 1992.\n  The present Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who is testifying \nat this very moment in the Armed Services Committee, as the Presiding \nOfficer well knows, said on May 25 of this year, ``I strongly urge \nprompt Senate advice and consent on the ratification of START II.''\n  Senator Richard Lugar on October of 1992 said, ``If new unfriendly \nregimes come to power, we want those regimes to be legally obligated to \nobserve START limits.''\n  Senator John McCain, who serves with us here and with great \ndistinction on the Armed Services Committee, said on January 2, 1993, \n``With the conclusion of START II, the threat of nuclear war has been \ngreatly reduced and our relationship with the former Soviet Union \nreestablished on a more secure basis.''\n  Now, obviously, Senator McCain was assuming we would ratify that \ntreaty. If we fail to do so I think he may want to rethink that \nstatement.\n  The former Secretary of State, Lawrence Eagleburger, made the \nfollowing statement on June 17 of 1993:\n\n       No relationship is more important to the long-term security \n     of the United States than our strategic relationship with \n     Russia. Despite the new spirit of cooperation between us, \n     Russia remains the only nation on Earth with the capability \n     to devastate the United States. Any arms control agreement, \n     even one as sweeping at START II, represents only one element \n     of that relationship. While arms control is only one element \n     of our relationship it remains an important one. START II, \n     along with the initial START treaty remains overwhelmingly in \n     our interest as we move into the post-cold war era. It offers \n     enhanced stability, fosters transparency and openness and \n     sounds the death knell for the first-strike strategies of a \n     bygone era.\n\n  That is a quotation by former Secretary of State Lawrence \nEagleburger.\n  Finally, let me give a quotation by Lynton Brooks who was the chief \nnegotiator of START II. He said on May 18, 1993--and I point out that \nwas shortly after the first hearing on START II by the Senate Foreign \nAffairs Committee on this chronology. This is 1993 I am talking about, \n2\\1/2\\ years ago, Mr. President. Lynton Brooks, our chief negotiator of \nSTART II said:\n\n       START II completes the work begun by START I. Building on \n     the 9-year effort that led to the first START treaty, START \n     II drastically reduced strategic defensive arms and \n     restructures the remaining forces in a stabilizing manner \n     appropriate for the post-cold war world. Along with its \n     predecessor companion, START II represents a codification of \n     the new nonconfrontational relationship between the United \n     States and the Russian federation. In short, START II is \n     another major step toward a 21st century characterized by \n     reduced threat and increased stability.\n\n  That is an indication, Mr. President, that there is very strong \nbipartisan support for the ratification of this treaty. If this was an \nissue that there was great division on I would probably not be here \ntoday urging that we get a time certain to vote on START II.\n  Leaders on both sides of the aisle have indicated the importance of \nmoving ahead. I can see no justification for us continuing to deal with \nmatters that are less time sensitive such as the proposed \nconstitutional amendment while this matter and the confirmation of \nthese ambassadorial nominations continues to be delayed.\n  Let me also put a few more things in the Record or call then to the \nattention of my colleagues here, Mr. President. We have a letter here \nfrom Jennifer Weeks who is the Arms Control and International Security \nProgram Director of the Union of Concerned Scientists. This is a letter \ndated November 9 of this year to Senators.\n  I am sure that the Presiding Officer and each Senator received a \nsimilar letter. It says:\n\n       I am writing to bring to your attention the article by \n     Russian ambassador Yuri K. Nazarkin on the START II nuclear \n     reduction treaty which is printed on the reverse side of this \n     page. START II currently pending in the Senate Foreign \n     Affairs Committee and the Russian Duma would reduce Russia's \n     deployed strategic nuclear arsenal by 5,000 warheads. It also \n     would eliminate all of Russia's 10 warhead SS-18 missiles, a \n     longstanding U.S. policy goal.\n\n  But as Nazarkin points out, if the Senate does not act promptly to \nratify START II, there is little hope that Russia will approve the \ntreaty. START II was submitted to the Senate by President Bush. It has \nstrong bipartisan support and the Union of Concerned Scientists \nstrongly support START II and urges the Senate to move swiftly to \nratify this crucial treaty.\n  I will not read the full text of that article, Mr. President, but let \nme just quote from Ambassador Nazarkin a couple of statements he made:\n\n       START II represents a real opportunity to lower the nuclear \n     danger that plagued our sense of security during the cold \n     war. Once the agreement is ratified and enters into force \n     American and Russian strategic nuclear forces are to be \n     reduced by about 70 percent from their cold war peaks. It is \n     certain that further delay on the American side will be used \n     in Russia as an argument to defer ratification.\n\n  Now Ambassador Nazarkin headed the Soviet delegation to the \nconference on disarmament in 1987 through 1989 and the nuclear and \nspace talks including START from 1989 to 1991 and participated in the \npreparation of START II. He is the senior adviser to the Moscow Center \nof the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n  Mr. President, let me just be a little more precise about how we get \nthe reductions or what reductions are called for in START II. The START \nII treaty will eliminate, according to this information I have here--he \ncited a figure of 5,000. This information is that it will eliminate \naround 4,000 strategic nuclear weapons from the arsenal of the former \nSoviet Union. This includes the centerpiece of the Russian arsenal \nwhich is the SS-18. Any intercontinental ballistic missile which \ncarries more than a single warhead will be eliminated under the \ntreaty. The following is a list of delivery systems and their payloads, \nwhich are expected to be destroyed under the treaty. Let me go through \nthis list very briefly so people understand what we are discussing \nhere.\n\n  The SS-18. I think those who have followed defense issues and our \narms competition with Russia over the last several decades know the \nimportance of the SS-18 as part of the threat that we face. This treaty \nwould eliminate 188 launchers and 1,880 warheads of that type.\n  The SS-19. This treaty would eliminate 170 launchers and 1,020 \nwarheads of that type.\n  The SS-24, 46 launchers, 460 warheads.\n  SLBM's, sea-launched ballistic missiles. We would see 600 of those \neliminated.\n  Submarine-launched ballistic missiles. As I understand it, the limit \nthere is 1,750 submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The current \nRussian arsenal is estimated at about 2,350.\n  So, it is time, in my view, that we proceed to ratify this treaty. It \nis time, certainly, that we at least get a chance to vote on it. Some \nof my colleagues here, who are not on the floor at this moment, have \nspoken out recently in favor of action on START II. Let me just quote \nsome of them, because I have been quoting a great many others who are \nnot here in the Senate. Let me just quote some of those who are here \nand indicate my agreement with their statements.\n  Senator Lugar, on October 31 of this year, talked about both the \nChemical Weapons Convention and START II.\n  Senator Nunn, on October 31, said, ``We must also make maximum use of \narms control agreements such as START II and the international treaties \nand conventions such as the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Biological \nWeapons Convention, and the Chemical Weapons Convention.''\n  Mr. President, I should clarify, for anybody who is interested, that \nI am not here insisting that we get a time certain to vote on the \nChemical Weapons Convention. I do believe it would be advisable for us \nto move quickly to consider that, but there are some questions that \nhave been raised. I understand the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee wishes to have additional hearings and explore those \nquestions, and I certainly wish to defer to \n\n[[Page S 18046]]\nhis judgment on that and do not, at this time, believe it is essential \nthat the Senate try to get to this issue. My concern on START II is \nthat the hearings have concluded. They concluded 7 months ago and we \nstill have not been able to get the issue before the Senate for a vote.\n  On October 31 of this year, Senator Sarbanes made the following \nstatement. He said, referring to the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee:\n\n       The chairman is refusing to take action on a number of \n     other very important matters before the committee, a number \n     of very significant treaties. We have completed hearings on \n     the START II treaty. Agreement has been reached on all the \n     substantive issues related to that treaty. No business \n     meeting has been scheduled to consider it.\n\n  Senator Feinstein spoke on the 1st of November this last month and \nsaid:\n\n       The START II treaty, signed by the Bush administration and \n     not yet ratified by the Congress, is the farthest reaching \n     arms reduction treaty ever signed in the history of this \n     Nation. I know of no significant opposition to the \n     ratification of the START II treaty. Nonetheless, the \n     committee is unable to begin consideration of it. This is \n     wrong.\n\n  There is a group that calls themselves the U.S. START II Committee. \nThey have sent a letter, dated November 13, to all Senators. Let me \njust read that letter into the Record in case some Senators have not \nhad a chance to see that. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator: The United States Senate is about to adjourn \n     without addressing the single most important issue of \n     international affairs. Worse, a lost opportunity now may mean \n     that the chance for nuclear arms control could be postponed \n     for a decade.\n       The Senate needs to ratify START II. This is why what we \n     believe to be a distinguished group of citizens, experts in \n     arms control, with both military and foreign policy \n     experience, has joined together to urge Senate action yet \n     this fall.\n       We all know the history of START II and what it does: the \n     single most dramatic reduction in the nuclear arsenals of \n     both the United States and the Russian Federation. Another \n     significant step back from the history of the relations \n     between the two countries for the last forty-five years.\n       Equally important, potentially, the treaty serves as an \n     example to other countries seeking to acquire this nuclear \n     capability that there is an alternative to ownership of \n     weapons of mass destruction: disarmament.\n       Our conversations with Russian leaders have made it plain \n     that if we fail to ratify this year, there is a significant \n     reduction in the likelihood that Russia will act on this \n     treaty next year. Years of work that have spanned both \n     Republican and Democratic Administrations, years of a \n     genuinely bi-partisan effort, will be lost.\n       The last speech that then Prime Minister Winston Churchill \n     gave to the House of Commons foresaw this day. The Prime \n     Minister, confronting a cold and hostile Soviet Union, with \n     both worlds then confronting each other with missiles and \n     bombs, stated that ``someday we will be allowed to emerge \n     from the terrible era in which we are required to reside.''\n       We urge the Senate and you, individually, to take up START \n     II before adjournment and ratify the treaty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       U.S. Committee for START II\n\n     Dave Nagle,\n       Chair, Freedom Support Coalition.\n     Lindsay Mattison,\n       Director, International Center\n\n  Mr. President, one of the things we always look at here in the \nCongress, perhaps too much in my view, is to see what the public \nreaction is. So we do have some indication of what the public thinks \nabout the whole notion of START II. Mr. President, 68.4 percent of the \npublic that was polled by a national security news service poll of over \n1,000 Americans, which was conducted between April 21 and 25 of this \nyear--68 percent thought that the U.S. Senate should ratify START II, \n20.1 percent opposed ratification, another 11 percent expressed no \nopinion.\n  A similar question that was asked in that same poll showed that 82.3 \npercent of Americans believe that the United States and Russia should \nagree to negotiate deep reductions in their nuclear weapons. Only 11 \npercent opposed doing so, while 6 percent expressed no opinion on that \nsubject.\n  So this is not just a group of academics who think we should get on \nwith the business of reducing the nuclear arsenal in Russia as well as \nhere. I would say, the START II treaty is very well designed to bring \nabout major reductions on the Russian side. This is not a unilateral \ndisarmament kind of treaty. There is nobody, Republican or Democrat, \nthat I have heard, who argues that this treaty is unbalanced in that \nregard. This is a treaty that is very much in our interest and very \nmuch in the Soviet interest as well.\n  Mr. President, let me also just refer to some of the editorials that \nhave been written on this subject around the country in recent weeks. \nThere is an editorial in the Friday, November 3, edition of the Boston \nGlobe. It is entitled ``Two Treaties Held Hostage.'' I will just read \nportions of that for Members.\n\n       During their Presidential terms, Ronald Reagan and George \n     Bush had the good sense to negotiate two arms control \n     treaties crucial to U.S. national security--the Strategic \n     Arms Reduction Treaty, START II, and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention. Bush and Boris Yeltsin signed the treaty on \n     chemical weapons January 3, and Bush submitted it to the \n     Senate as one of his final acts of statesmanship. It is sad \n     to say that ratification of these two badly needed treaties \n     is being sabotaged by Republican Senators Jesse Helms of \n     North Carolina and Bob Dole of Kansas. Their deliberate \n     thwarting of the ratification process is perverse, not merely \n     because they are undoing the wise work of Republican \n     Commanders in Chief but because their motives seem to be \n     petty and personal and political.\n\n  That is a statement in the editorial, Mr. President, which I do not \nnecessarily subscribe to. But I do think it gives the flavor for the \neditorial comment which is out there.\n  The Washington Post wrote on the 16th of November ``Poison Gas and \nSen. Helms'' is the name of their editorial. It goes on with:\n\n       Nearly three years ago, under President Bush, the United \n     States signed a treaty banning chemical weapons, the most \n     powerful comprehensive arms control agreement ever \n     negotiated. It is making no progress toward ratification by \n     this country because the chairman of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee does not like it. Although it was written under \n     American and Republican leadership, there is now a real \n     chance that it could go into operation without American \n     participation.\n\n  They are talking about the Chemical Weapons Convention in that case.\n  There is a New York Times editorial dated the 8th of November \nentitled ``Jesse Helms' Hostages.''\n  It says:\n\n       Because of the obstinacy of Senator Helms of North \n     Carolina, the United States does not have an Ambassador in \n     Beijing at this time.\n\n  That is an issue I want to address in a few minutes.\n\n       * * * the United States does not have an Ambassador in \n     Beijing at this time and relations with China have reached \n     their most delicate and dangerous point in more than 20 \n     years.\n\n  I will at this point go ahead and talk some about the importance of \ngetting these ambassadors appointed, Mr. President.\n  I had the good fortune to travel to China, to Korea, and to Japan \nearlier this year. I did so on a trip under the auspices of the Armed \nServices Committee, and I did so at a time when relations between the \nUnited States and China were clearly strained. Some of that strain \nremains in that relationship, but some of it, hopefully, has been \nreduced. But one thing I was struck with on the trip to Beijing and to \nChina was that this Nation, which is, of course, the most populous \nNation in the world, has a very fast growing economy, has a tremendous \ninfluence over everything that happens in the Far East and, of course, \nmuch that happens in other parts of the world as well. We have no \nAmbassador. When you go to our Embassy there, the personnel there do \ntheir best to accommodate your needs, to keep the doors open, and to \nkeep business going as usual. But the simple fact is we have no \nspokesman there representing our administration, our Government, our \ncountry, our President. That is a detriment to us. It has been a \ndetriment to us for several months now.\n  I think it is particularly unfortunate myself--this is just a \npersonal view of mine--that we are not going ahead and voting on the \nambassadorship for China, because one of our former colleagues was \nnominated by the President to serve in that capacity. He has had \nhearings. I believe he has strong bipartisan support for serving in \nthat position, as he should have because he had a very distinguished \ncareer here in the Senate. But I can tell you that the issues that we \ntried to address there could much better be addressed if we had a \nPresidential appointee representing us in our Embassy in Beijing. This \nis too important a job and too important a position for us to just \nleave vacant month after month, week after \n\n[[Page S 18047]]\nweek, on the assumption that it does not really matter. It needs to \nmatter to us. It matters very much, I believe, to the executive branch \nof our Government. I believe it matters a great deal to the Government \nofficials that might be in Beijing.\n  I urged them to return their Ambassador. Relations in August when I \nwas in Beijing were strained to such an extent that the Chinese \nGovernment had withdrawn their American Ambassador, asked their \nAmbassador to come back to China for a period of time. My urging to the \nForeign Minister and to other Chinese officials I spoke to was that \nthey return their Ambassador to Washington and that they signal to our \nGovernment as quickly as possible that they would like us to move ahead \nwith the appointment and the confirmation of Jim Sasser as our \nGovernment's representative and Ambassador in Beijing.\n  I would say to their credit--I do not know; I am sure they had \nurgings from a great many other sources and a great many other \nindividuals--but to their credit, in response to whatever set of \ncircumstances, they went ahead and did exactly what I was urging them \nto do and what I am sure others were urging them to do; that is, they \nreturned their Ambassador to Washington in order to improve the lines \nof communication, and they signaled to our administration that they \nwould like the administration to go ahead and appoint Senator Sasser to \nthis important position.\n  The administration, of course, followed through quickly indicating \nthat Senator Sasser was their nominee. The hearings were held. We now \nwait. We now wait for some additional action presumably.\n  According to the chart which I have here, Mr. President, the \nnomination was sent to the Senate on the 25th of September. The reason \nI think it is important we raise this issue this morning is that the \nCongress is approaching the end of its actions in the first session of \nthe 104th Congress. When we do adjourn that first session of the 104th \nCongress, it will be clearly several weeks before we begin again in the \nnew year to transact business here in the Senate. If we do not get this \nmatter dealt with now, if we do not get a ratification of not only \nSenator Sasser as the nominee to serve in China, but if we do not get a \nratification of each of these, if we do not go ahead and approve the \nnominations for each of these important countries, it will clearly be \nnext spring before any action will be taken by the Senate.\n  I think that is in derogation of our duties, Mr. President. I think \nwe have a duty by virtue of our position as Senators to go ahead and \npass judgment on the nominees that the President sends forward. If \npeople want to vote no, I have no problem with that. Everyone gets \nelected to vote his or her conscience. If people want to come on the \nSenate floor and vote against any of these nominees, I think they \nshould clearly do that. My only point is we need to have an opportunity \nto express the will of the Senate and get on with it. If these nominees \nare acceptable to a majority of Senators, we should approve them. If \nthese nominees are not acceptable to a majority of Senators, we should \ndisapprove them and allow the administration to appoint an alternative \nto serve in these important positions.\n  Let me talk a little about this trip to Asia which I did take earlier \nthis year and which I felt was a very instructive and informative trip. \nWe had three major themes that we were trying to learn about. One was \nregional security issues. There has been great concern raised about \nnuclear tests, about possible missile technology exports from China, \nabout concerns about China's defense expenditures and weapons \nmodernization and potential threats to other countries in that region.\n  There were this summer live ammo military tests in the Taiwan \nStraits. There have been some aggressive behavior in the Spratly \nIslands in the South China Sea.\n  Those were all the very real national security issues, regional \nsecurity issues that we wanted to explore, and we did have a chance to \ndo that with several governmental officials.\n  We also wanted to explore trade because we have an enormous problem \nin our trade relations with China. Anyone who has not paid attention to \nour trade relations with China cannot be adequately informed about our \ntrade situation today in the world.\n  In 1994, the United States, according to our Government's figures, \nhad a trade deficit with China of $29 billion. The anticipated trade \ndeficit for this year, 1995, is $36 billion, and the expectation is \nthat in 1996, the trade deficit could rise to as high as $50 billion.\n  So what we see is that China is fast replacing Japan as the No. 1 \ntrade problem that the United States has. We had a $60 billion trade \ndeficit last year with Japan. Everyone recognizes that that is a \nserious problem. We have had various initiatives to try to deal with \nit. Unfortunately, in the case of China, we are just now beginning to \nawake to the fact that trade is a serious problem. So that was another \nissue we wanted to look at and did get a chance to look at very \nseriously.\n  Technology development, that is another area where the policies of \nthe Chinese Government I think are ones that we need to be aware of and \nconcerned about. Clearly, their Government policy is to target \nparticular technologies and develop those technologies, to trade market \naccess for technology transfer. That is, if a United States company \nwants access to the Chinese market, they are required to give up \ntechnology, their rights to technology to get that access.\n  Obviously, electro property rights are another major part of the \ntechnology development issue.\n  But let me just talk a little more about the trade problem, Mr. \nPresident, because I think that perhaps highlights it as much as \nanything.\n  I have a good friend who is a co-owner of a company in my home State \nwhich produces wallets, leather wallets, and they employ about 250 \npeople in the southern and west mesa side of Albuquerque to make these \nwallets. These jobs are decent paying jobs. They are primarily jobs \nheld by women and many of the employees, many of the employees of this \ncompany are single women who are trying to raise families at the same \ntime that they hold these jobs.\n  I received a press clipping about 2 or 3 weeks ago indicating that \nthat plant in Albuquerque employing those 250 people was about to \nclose, that they had announced they would close the plant and those 250 \npeople, primarily women, who work in that plant--I have visited the \nplant several times--would be out of work, those jobs would be gone.\n  So I called my friend and said, what is the problem? Why are we \nhaving to close the plant in Albuquerque and put 250 women out of work? \nThe answer was, we are no longer cost competitive, or part of the \nanswer at least was that we are no longer cost competitive with China. \nIn China, they will do the work much cheaper. There is no limitation on \ntheir ability to import into this country the finished products, and \nfrom just looking at the bottom line there are great incentives \nprovided by the Chinese Government for us to locate more and more \nmanufacturing there, and those manufacturing jobs there are displacing \nUnited States manufacturing jobs.\n  That is an old story. That is a story that many people have told in \none form or another around this Senate ever since I have been here over \nthe last decade or so.\n  We have to find some solutions to that. Part of the solution to that \nis to get serious about our trade deficit with China. We need to \nrecognize that this deficit cannot be allowed to grow from $29 to $36 \nto $50 billion year after year after year, indefinitely. At the rate of \ngrowth that is now involved, we are clearly by the end of this decade \ngoing to have a bigger trade deficit with China than we have with \nJapan. It is not a trade deficit that will go away quickly because they \nare manufacturing, they are displacing manufacturing that goes on today \nin this country. They are manufacturing and selling into this country. \nAnd we are not able to sell into that country to near the extent we \nshould.\n  That is a problem that needs to be on the front burner of our U.S. \nTrade Representative's office, on the front burner of the Department of \nCommerce. It is to some extent, but I believe very strongly that it \nwould be on the front burner to an even greater extent if we had an \nAmbassador in Beijing who could make the point that this issue is \nimportant to us, who could represent our Government in meetings in that \n\n\n[[Page S 18048]]\ncapital, and clearly we do ourselves a disservice by not going ahead \nand approving that nomination.\n  Mr. President, I have not visited the other countries on this list. I \nbelieve it is fair to say I visited none of the other countries on this \nlist. But there are some very important trading partners and very \nimportant allies that are also represented. Let me just point out some \nof those.\n\n  In Malaysia, we have a nominee there whose nomination was sent to the \nSenate on June 13. I know of no objection that has been raised to that \nnomination. Here it is nearly December 13, and yet no action. We have \nnot been given a chance to vote. If there is an objection, we should \nhear it; we should debate it; and we should vote our conscience one way \nor another. I have not heard of any.\n  In Cambodia, we have a nominee there which was sent to the Senate for \nconsideration again on June 13. Again, I know of no reason why that \nnominee is not an acceptable nominee. Everything I have heard would \nindicate to me that he is an acceptable nominee, but we have not been \ngiven a chance to vote.\n  In the case of Thailand, again on June 21, a nominee was sent to us \nfor the Ambassador to Thailand. I know of no objection that has been \nraised to that nominee being appointed, but we are not doing our duty \nand voting on the issue.\n  In the case of Indonesia, there I do want to just make a very short \nstatement about our nominee. The President's nominee is Stapleton Roy, \nwho I am sure is well known to many Members of this Senate. He was \nformerly the Ambassador representing our country in Beijing. He did a \nsuperb job. He is eminently respected by everybody in diplomatic \ncircles, and I think he is a superb appointment for that position.\n  Again, his nomination was sent up on June 28. No action. I have heard \nof no complaints about his appropriateness for the position. In fact, \neverything I have heard is praiseworthy. I had the good fortune to meet \nwith Stapleton Roy before we took our trip to China. I say to \ncolleagues, he was extremely helpful in pointing out issues that we \nneeded to explore with Chinese officials because of his great knowledge \nof United States-China policy and his great experience in that regard.\n  In the case of Pakistan, Pakistan is a very important country in the \nworld today. We have a great many sensitive issues that we are dealing \nwith. We have votes here on the Senate floor. In the case when the \ndefense bill was on the floor, I remember several votes about our \npolicy toward Pakistan. I think everyone recognizes the importance of \nhaving an ambassador representing this Government in Pakistan.\n  Oman. That is another very important ally of this country in the \nPersian Gulf area. And clearly we need to have an ambassador there. \nThat ambassadorial nomination, again, was sent on June 28.\n  Lebanon. Our country has a proud and longstanding relationship with \nLebanon. Many of the outstanding people in my State, leaders in the \nbusiness community, leaders in all the important communities in my \nState have great pride in their Lebanese heritage. We should clearly \nhave an ambassador to Lebanon. I have heard nobody suggest that this \nwas not the proper ambassador.\n  I could go on down the list. Many of these countries are in Africa. \nAgain, I have not visited them, but I believe that it is important for \nus to have ambassadors there. South Africa is a clear example. It is \nimportant enough that our Vice President is there this week on a trip. \nI have had the good fortune, as I know many Senators have, of hearing \nNelson Mandela speak to joint meetings of the Congress. I believe I \nhave heard him now twice on trips that he has taken to this country. \nThat relationship between the United States and South Africa is a very \nimportant relationship during these important years as that nation \nmoves out of and renounces apartheid, moves on to an open society. \nClearly we need to have someone there representing U.S. interests.\n  Mr. President, there are many other issues that I could go into, and \nI am glad to as the day proceeds, because I think these are important \nissues that we need to have before us. But at this point I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, today I rise to show my support for this \nresolution that is designed to prohibit the desecration of the American \nflag. It is clear that a constitutional amendment is necessary to \nensure the validity of any statute banning flag desecration. Forty-nine \nStates have passed memorializing resolutions calling on Congress to \ntake this action and forward this issue for consideration to the \nStates.\n  Earlier this session, this resolution was voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by a bipartisan vote. I expect the same bipartisan support \nwhen the whole Senate votes on this resolution.\n  The movement for this bill has been unfairly attributed to political \nparties using it for political gain. This is untrue. The impetus for \nthis amendment comes from over 85 grassroots organizations, such as the \nCitizens Flag Alliance and the American Legion. These groups have \nworked unceasingly to return to the protection of the flag by means of \na constitutional amendment. Their work has resulted in 49 State \nlegislatures passing resolutions petitioning Congress to act and decide \nthis issue through the ratification process.\n  There are those who feel that the first amendment rights ought to \nprevail, and they consider that this is a form of protest expression. \nIf you look at the Constitution, the first amendment talks about \nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press. Both are forms of \nexpression, and they make a distinction between speech and press.\n  However, regardless of whether there is some distinction in regard to \nvarious forms of expression, I think we have to look to the history of \nstaunch defenders of civil liberties and of the first amendment rights. \nThe two names that come to mind the most are Hugo Black and Earl \nWarren. These Supreme Court justices were very clear in their writings \nthat the first amendment did not apply to flag desecration. In fact, at \na Judiciary Committee hearing on this issue, we had the Assistant \nAttorney General for Legal Counsel, the Honorable Walter Dellinger, who \nserved as a professor of law at Duke University, testify against the \namendment.\n  He recited, when I raised the issue about Justice Black and Chief \nJustice Warren, how fervently they felt that prohibiting did not \nviolate the first amendment. Mr. Dellinger said at the time that he was \nthe law clerk for Justice Hugo Black, ``you know, law clerks always \nwant to know what goes on in conference.'' So they, therefore, will get \ntheir ears close to a keyhole and listen in to hear sounds of voices \nfrom within that sometimes quietly but effectively creep out. He said \nhe would put his ear to the keyhole and listen to what was going on in \nconference to try and hear what the Justices were saying in their \narguments. He recited that there was no question that Hugo Black and \nEarl Warren were fervent in their position, very strong in their \nposition that first amendment rights were not being violated by the \nfact that you had statutes which protected the flag.\n\n  They wrote in Street versus New York, a case that was not directly in \npoint, and expressed themselves very clearly in regard to this \nparticular issue.\n  Mr. Dellinger informed us at the hearing that flag desecration \nbrought these two eminent jurists together with the opinion that ``the \nStates and the Federal Government do have the power to protect the flag \nfrom acts of desecration and disgrace.''\n  The American flag is the symbol that unites us and symbolizes \neverything that we have fought for and died for over the years. \nHonoring the flag is an integral part of American life. The Pledge of \nAllegiance that is given is a pledge of allegiance to the flag. I think \nthis is very important to realize, because the flag is the unifier that \nbrings together our diverse, pluralistic views.\n  We sing the ``Star Spangled Banner,'' and the ``Star Spangled \nBanner'' speaks of the fact that it flies over \n\n[[Page S 18049]]\n``the land of the free and the home of the brave.'' So I think our flag \nis a great unifier. Respect for the flag begins at an early age, and is \nconstantly reinforced throughout our life. We sing the national anthem \nat special events, begin school days with the Pledge of Allegiance, and \nstand at attention at Veterans Day parades when our soldiers proudly \nmarch through the streets holding high the flag that they protect.\n  Few things stir more emotion and patriotism for us as the Iwo Jima \nMemorial which depicts the marines risking their lives to raise our \nflag. I served in the Pacific in World War II, so it is hard for me to \nconceive that we have reached a point in our history where there is \nsuch casual disregard for the flag that some citizens would desecrate \nit.\n  Opponents have raised several legitimate concerns over the amendment. \nOne of these is whether the amendment would carve out an exception to \nthe first amendment. This amendment would simply overturn two erroneous \ndecisions of the Supreme Court which misconstrued the first amendment. \nIn one of those cases, Justice John Paul Stevens' dissent summed up the \nsymbol of the flag best in the case of Texas versus Johnson decision, \nwhich was handed down in l989 and unfortunately, allowed flag \ndesecration. Justice Stevens said:\n\n       It is a symbol of equal opportunity, of religious \n     tolerance, of good will for other people who share our \n     aspirations. The symbol carries its message to dissidents \n     both at home and abroad who may have no interest at all in \n     our national unity or survival.\n\n  By protecting this one unique national symbol, we have not reduced \nour freedom of speech. The first amendment has been interpreted broadly \nby the courts over the years, but it has never been deemed absolute. It \ndoes not protect ``fighting words'' or yelling ``fire'' in a crowded \ntheater. Prior to 1989, Americans' right to express their views was not \ncurtailed by the laws of 48 States, which prohibited flag desecration. \nOther matters, such as obscenity, defamation, or other restrictions on \nfreedom of speech, such as the destruction of a draft card, have been \nheld by courts not to come within the purview of the first amendment.\n  Another concern which has been raised is that there is no need for an \namendment. The number of times the desecration of the flag is \ndocumented is not the point. The law should not turn simply on the \nnumber of cases; it should turn on what effect there is on the flag as \na symbol of the unity and freedom of our country each time it is \ndesecrated. This flag is devalued when there exists no legal means to \nprotect the flag from those who would desecrate it in order to express \ntheir views.\n  I believe this amendment will not deter flag desecration in all \ncases. In some cases, it may even spur a handful of people to burn \nflags in order to test its purpose. But by allowing the flag the \nprotection of a constitutional amendment, we reiterate our belief that \nwe ourselves value the flag as a symbol of what America stands for.\n  Our society is increasingly pluralistic, and being an American means \nmany different things. As we highlight our differences in this changing \nworld, we must remember what unites us. Without unity, there would be \nno America. The flag is a great unifier that brings together Democrats \nand Republicans, conservatives and liberals, and people from all walks \nof life and different persuasions. The flag crosses religious belief, \nrace, cultural heritage, geography, and age. To disregard the power and \nthe importance of our flag is to take us down a path that we would be \nwise not to follow.\n  I think we should support this constitutional amendment, and I feel \nthat it is important that we do so. I believe that the vast majority of \nthe American people support the amendment. In fact, a 1995 Gallup Poll \nwas taken, which asked whether the American people thought that we \nshould have the right to determine by vote whether or not the flag \nshould be protected from desecration. Eighty-one percent of the people \nsaid ``yes.'' Asked whether they thought such an amendment would \njeopardize their right to freedom of speech, 76 percent answered that \nit would not jeopardize their freedom of speech.\n\n  So I feel that there is great support for this effort across the \nland, and I hope my colleagues will join us in adopting this \nconstitutional amendment, which will give great importance to America \nand to the flag that unites us, because the flag that we pledge \nallegiance to is a pledge also to our Republic and to our belief in \nthis great country of ours.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Gramm addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I see that we have no other colleagues on \nthe floor ready to speak on this subject, so I would like to speak both \nabout Bosnia and about the budget negotiations that are going on here \nin the Capitol. I would like to talk about both because I think they \nare very important.\n  Mr. President, I am opposed to sending American troops to Bosnia. I \nhave not reached this conclusion quickly; I listened to President Bush \nand the Bush administration debate this issue at some length and \nfollowed that debate pretty closely. They reached the conclusion that \nsending ground troops to Bosnia was a mistake. My consistent position \nduring that debate was that I also opposed sending ground troops to \nBosnia.\n  I have now had 3 years, counting the Presidential campaign in 1992, \nto listen to President Clinton try to make the case that we should send \nAmerican ground troops into Bosnia. I am perfectly aware--and I say it \nwith no criticism intended--that the President is a very effective \nsalesman. I have concluded that his failure to convince me, and his \nfailure to convince the country, on the issue of sending ground troops \nto Bosnia is not the result of his lack of ability as a salesman. I \nthink it has resulted from the fact that this position cannot credibly \nbe sold.\n  I have always tried to use three tests in deciding whether to send \nAmericans into combat or into harm's way. I have applied those tests in \nthe past and I have applied them to sending ground troops to Bosnia:\n  First, do we have a vital national interest? In the Persian Gulf, we \nhad a military dictator who was working to build chemical and nuclear \nweapons, and who had invaded a neighboring country. His military \naggression threatened two vital allies of the United States--Israel and \nSaudi Arabia. And so, clearly, in the Persian Gulf we had a vital \nnational interest.\n  I have been to the region that we are discussing today. I have talked \nto our military at some length. Like virtually every other person in \nthe country who keeps up with what is happening in our country and \naround the world, I am aware of the terrible misery that has plagued \nall of what used to be Yugoslavia, and especially the misery in Bosnia. \nBut I have concluded that we do not have a vital national interest in \nthis region.\n  The second question that I tried to ask is: Can our intervention be \ndecisive in promoting our vital interests? It is one thing to have a \nvital national interest; it is another thing to be able to be decisive \nin promoting that interest.\n  In the Persian Gulf war, we had the military capacity to promote our \nvital national interest.\n  We also had a clearly defined objective: drive Saddam Hussein out of \nKuwait. We were able to put together an alliance and a plan that was as \ndetailed about how we were going to end the war and get out of the \nMiddle East, as it was about how we were going to intervene.\n  I concluded in the Persian Gulf that we did have the capacity through \nour intervention to promote our vital interests. Certainly history has \nproven that to have been the case.\n  I do not believe, however, that we have this capacity in Bosnia. I am \nvery concerned about putting young Americans into the line of fire as a \nbuffer force between two warring factions which have broken every \ncease-fire and have violated almost every treaty over the past 500 \nyears.\n  Now we have proposals, both from the administration and from the \nleadership of the Senate, which say that \nwe should not only serve as a buffer force between those warring \nfactions, but remarkably, in my humble opin- \nion, that at the same time we  \n\n[[Page S 18050]]\n\nshould be engaged in overtly arming and training one of the \nbelligerents in this conflict.\n  I have to say, Mr. President, I respectfully disagree with that \npolicy. I supported lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia. I thought \nit might make sense under some circumstances for Americans to provide \ntraining--not in Bosnia--but maybe somewhere else. It might make sense \nto train some of their senior officials in the United States, which is \nthe sort of thing we have done in the past.\n  I believe there is a conflict between the role of arming the Bosnians \nand serving as a neutral buffer force. I think that many even in our \nown Senate, and certainly some in the administration, have not \nreconciled how we could serve those two functions at the same time. It \nis not possible to be a neutral buffer force and, at the same time, be \ninvolved in the training and arming one side.\n  I know, from having discussed this with some of our colleagues, there \nis a belief that we, in essence, took sides when we bombed the Serbs. \nIf that is so, then this should disqualify us from serving in this \nintervention/peacekeeping role. I think it was a different situation. \nThe Serbs had been issued an order by the United Nations to stop the \nshelling and to withdraw their heavy weapons. They refused to do it.\n  NATO was asked to be the military arm of the U.N. forces in that \ncase, a terrible command structure--one I would never support under any \ncircumstance in the future and have not supported in the past.\n  The point is, in no way do I see how our intervention, in a period of \ntime of roughly 1 year as set by the President, how this is going to \nchange anything in Bosnia. There is no reason to believe that our \nintervention is going to be decisive.\n  Finally, let me say that in representing a big State with many people \nserving in the military, it has been my responsibility, after both \nSomalia and the Persian Gulf, to console parents and spouses of young \nTexans who have given their lives in the service of our country.\n\n  In talking to families, it has struck me that at least in my case \nthere ought to be one more test. That test ought to be this: I have two \ncollege age sons; if one of my sons was in the 82d Airborne Division, \nwould I be willing to send him into battle? It seems to me that if I \ncannot answer this question with a yes--no ifs ands or buts about it; \nand in the Persian Gulf I could answer it yes, no ifs ands or buts \nabout it--if I cannot answer this question with a yes, then I cannot \nfeel comfortable sending someone else's son or sending someone else's \ndaughter.\n  So I am opposed to sending American troops into Bosnia. I intend to \nvote against the President's resolution asking Congress to join him in \nendorsing this policy. I am concerned we are in the process of seeing a \nresolution put together that, quite frankly, is full of escape clauses \nand ejection seats so that politicians can be on both sides of the \nissue.\n  I want a clear-cut vote where we can vote ``yes'' we support the \nPresident's policy to send troops to Bosnia; or ``no,'' we do not. I \nintend to see that we get such a clear-cut, up or down vote.\n  I am working with roughly a dozen of our colleagues who want to have \nthat vote. I think it is very important that we say where we stand. I \nknow there will be those who will try to combine the issue of \nsupporting the troops with supporting the President. Quite frankly, I \ndo not buy into that logic and I do not think it serves our political \nsystem well to try to combine the two. There is not a Member of the \nSenate, nor has there ever been a Member, who would not support the \ntroops.\n  It is because I support the troops, because I am concerned about \ntheir well-being, that I am opposed to sending troops to Bosnia. I have \nno doubt that the Americans who serve in the Armed Forces of the United \nStates will go where their Commander in Chief sends them. They will \nserve proudly. They will do their job well. That is not the issue here.\n  Their performance is not in doubt; it is our performance that is in \ndoubt. Their ability to do their job is not being questioned. It is our \nability in the Senate to do our job that is being questioned.\n  I think it is important that there be no ifs, ands or buts about it, \nthat we ought to have a clear-cut vote as to who supports the \nPresident's policy in Bosnia, and who does not. I, for one, do not.\n  Let me add one other thing. This whole issue has nothing to do with \npolitics. It has nothing to do with Bill Clinton. It has nothing to do \nwith our distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole, who supports the \nPresident on this issue. It has everything to do with my obligation to \n18 million Texans who elected me.\n  I was against sending troops into Bosnia when George Bush was \nPresident. I am against sending troops into Bosnia now that Bill \nClinton is President, and I am going to be against sending troops into \nBosnia when someone else occupies the White House. This is an issue \nthat I think is vitally important and goes to the very heart of what \nthe role of Congress is. I believe that here we should say ``no.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18049-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18050-S18051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me, Mr. President, talk about the budget negotiations. \nI am concerned that if we let this budget impasse go past the first of \nthe year, that the financial markets in America are going to begin to \nreact to the fact that no deficit reduction has occurred.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the election which occurred in \n1994 is one of the clearest examples that I have ever seen of how \nelections can have tremendous economic consequences. If I were still \nserving in my role as a professor of economics at Texas A instead of \nserving in the role, as I often feel, of trying to teach economics here \nin Washington, DC--students at Texas A were a little more attentive--\nI would use the plotting of interest rates in America as a perfect \nexample of how elections have profound economic consequences, because I \nknow that the people who have looked at the data are as astounded as I \nam at the results we would see.\n  Interest rates were rising steadily until the day of the 1994 \nelections. When we had the most decisive election since 1934, interest \nrates suddenly started to decline. They have declined ever since, and \nas a result, the average annual mortgage payment on a 30-year mortgage \nin America has been reduced by about $1,200. That is a dramatic change.\n  Now, it seems to me that the logic of this change is based on the \nrational expectation that the 1994 election, which brought a Republican \nmajority in both Houses of Congress, was going to produce a dramatic \nchange in the spending patterns of our Government. As we all know, \nRepublicans had promised in the election that they would institute such \na change, that we would balance the budget, that we would let working \npeople keep more of what they earn, and that we would make some very \nmodest changes to try to promote economic growth.\n  Now we are on the verge of going into the new year without any of \nthose changes having occurred. We have passed a budget, but the \nPresident is going to veto it. That means we have to start the whole \nprocess over. I simply want to raise a warning and a red flag that if \nwe do not stand our ground on the 15th of December, if we simply give \nPresident Clinton another credit card without forcing him to sit down \nwith us--the way families sit down at their kitchen table with a pencil \nand piece of paper and write out a budget that everybody agrees they \nare going to stick with--if we simply give President Clinton another \ncredit card 10 days before Christmas and do not exact for that, some \nchange that begins to implement a balanced budget, I am concerned that \nafter the first of the year the markets that had changed their \ninvestment patterns on the belief that we would see a dramatic change \nin the fiscal policy of the country are no doubt going to reevaluate \ntheir position and interest rates are going to start going up.\n  I believe that if we do not do something about this deficit before \nthe first of the year, then we risk a rise in interest rates. I know it \nis very tempting to say, 10 days before Christmas, we do not want a \nconfrontation with the President. It is also fair to say that, 10 days \nbefore Christmas, the President does not want a confrontation with us \neither. I do not think this is the time to fold up our tent and go \nhome. I \n\n[[Page S 18051]]\nthink this is the time to stand our ground, demand that the President \nsign on to a budget in order to get this new credit card, and I am \ncommitted to the principle that we do just that.\n  I think we have written a budget which fulfills what we promised we \nwould do; I intend to stand with that budget. My proposal, which I have \nmade on several occasions in the past is this: we have set out what we \ncan spend over the next 7 years and still balance the Federal budget; \nwe should ask President Clinton to sit down with us and to try to reach \nagreement as to how that money is spent. I do not believe we ought to \ngo back and rewrite our budget and let the President spend tens of \nbillions of dollars we do not have on programs that we cannot afford.\n  I think the best Christmas present we could give America is a \nbalanced budget. Maybe my perspective is different because I am \nspending more time outside Washington than many of our colleagues, and \nI am in a mode where you tend to listen a little more intently than you \nmight otherwise. I believe that the American people are not so \nconcerned about the Government being disrupted as they are about the \nfact that a baby born in 1995, if the current trend in spending \ncontinues, is going to pay $187,000 in taxes, just to pay his or her \nshare of the interest on the public debt. This is not just economic \nsuicide, it is immoral, and I think we need to do something about it. I \nsubmit, that if we cannot do it now, how are we going to do it next \nyear when we have to turn right around and write another budget?\n  I simply raise these alarms because I believe we need to stand firm \non our commitments to the American people. After all, we did not say we \nwere going to balance the budget only if it was easy. We did not say we \nwere going to balance the budget only if Bill Clinton went along. We \nsaid we were going to balance the Federal budget. So I think the time \nhas come--in fact, in my opinion, it is long past--to say to the \nPresident, if you do not sign on to a budget, then we are not going to \ngive you another credit card. It seems to me, the last time we went \nthrough this exercise the President got the credit card and we got this \nvague language about how he was going to support balancing the budget \nin 7 years under all these circumstances and all these conditions. The \nPresident was doing a lot of nodding and winking and good gestures \nduring the negotiations, but once he got the credit card he said we \nhave either agreed on everything or we have agreed on nothing, and \nsince we have not agreed on everything, we have, therefore, agreed on \nnothing.\n\n  I think we need to stop debating statements of policy. I think if we \nare going to give Bill Clinton another credit card, we need to have \nwritten into law limits on how much he can spend. Finally, we need to \nrequire that, in return for getting another credit card, the President \njoin us in a budget which meets the spending levels we set out in the \noriginal seven year balanced budget resolution.\n  I see we have another colleague who is here to speak.

Mr. President, I was getting a bite of lunch and noting \non TV the continued hypocrisy. There is no better word for it. Some in \nthe Senate continue to come and blame President Clinton for the \ndeficit. They continue to say he does not want to do anything about the \ndeficit, which is totally out of the whole cloth. It is good pollster \npolitics to try to paint that image.\n  But the fact of the matter is, where I could be blamed for the \ndeficit because I have been up here for years and others could be, \nPresident Clinton was down in Arkansas balancing the budgets for 10 \nyears. He came to this town with a plan in 1993, and it was traumatic. \nIt said we are going to cut spending and get rid of Federal \nemployees. We are going to cut the deficit $500 billion. We are going \nto tax. We heard that word. We are going to increase taxes on beer and \nliquor and cigarettes and gasoline, and, yes, Mr. President, we are \ngoing to increase taxes on Social Security--one of the really \nsacrosanct, holy of holies. He insisted on that attempt to cut the \ndeficit, and there was not a single vote on the other side of the aisle \neither in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. But that other \nside of the aisle, having done nothing but cause deficits, comes now \nwith this pollster-driven message that is developed by a retinue of \nSenators coming to the floor, and now I have to listen to some kind of \nlockbox nonsense.\n\n  Who caused the deficit? I know one who balanced the budget: Lyndon \nBaines Johnson. President Johnson in 1968 and 1969 was very sensitive \nabout the charge of guns and butter and not paying for the war in \nVietnam and his Great Society. So he had a 10-percent surcharge on \ntaxes, and he came with spending cuts. At that particular time, the \nentire budget was $178 billion--$178 billion for Medicare, for defense, \nfor Medicaid, for welfare. All the things that everyone is talking \nabout cutting, President Johnson paid for and ended up with a $3.2 \nbillion surplus.\n  Now, where did the deficit start? Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter \nall worked at cutting spending. But it was President Ronald Reagan who \ncame to town with a promise of balancing the budget in 1 year. The \nothers had not made that promise. They had worked on it. But the actual \npromise in the campaign--and I can show you the document--was, ``We are \ngoing to balance the budget in 1 year.''\n  President Reagan, on coming to town, said, ``Heavens, I didn't \nrealize the fiscal dilemma we are in. It's going to take longer than 1 \nyear.'' And he submitted and we passed in 1981 a budget to be balanced \nin 3 years. In 1985, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, we promised a balance \nby 1990. And in 1990, this Congress here, before President Clinton came \nto town, promised not only a balanced budget by 1995 but a surplus of \n$20.5 billion.\n  Now, that goes to all of this posturing about the historic effort \nthat we are making in closing down the Government and the partisan \nattack that we are the only ones for a balanced budget and the other \ncrowd is not. The fact is that for 200 years of history and 38 \nPresidents, Republican and Democrat, up until 1981 we had yet to come \nto a national debt of $1 trillion. It was less than $1 trillion. Now \nthe deficit has grown over the 15 years of spending over $250 billion \nand the debt to almost $5 trillion.\n  The deficit for this year is considered by the Congressional Budget \nOffice to be $311 billion. Spending goes up, up, and away, and as we \nlook at defense, that has come from $300 billion down to $243, similar \ndomestic discretionary spending and others. But the one that has really \ntaken off, is interest cost on the national debt--$348 billion, or $1 \nbillion a day. We have spending on automatic pilot.\n  This land has fiscal cancer, and nobody wants to talk about it.\n  There was an old limerick, my children, on Saturday morning, on the \n``Big John and Sparky'' program on the radio:\n\n\n[[Page S 18052]]\n\n       All the way through life, make this your goal: Keep your \n     eye on the donut and not the hole.\n\n  Mr. President, we are looking right at the hole with tax cuts and \navoiding and evading the donut, which are tax increases, because we \nknow--and I am saying we in the budget process who have been working in \nthis discipline--and they know it on the other side of the aisle, too. \nI can quote Senator Domenici, who, all the way back in 1985--the \npresent chairman of the Budget Committee--said you cannot balance \nwithout an increase in taxes.\n  We tried budget freezes with then-majority leader Howard Baker of \nTennessee, the Republican leader. We worked in tandem; in those days \nyou could work together. We tried not only the freezes but the spending \ncuts across the board, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. And then, in 1986, \nwe got on our Finance Committee friends--and I see the distinguished \nchairman is present--and we said, look, we might be spending in \nappropriations, but you folks with loopholes are spending way more than \nthe Government.\n  And so, with the distinguished Finance Committee and its chair, Lloyd \nBentsen of Texas, we had tax reform in 1986, and we supposedly closed \nthe loopholes. And at that time, we had freezes, cuts, and the loophole \nclosings. Then in 1987, a studied group within the Budget Committee, \ncharged with the responsibility of balancing the budget, agreed that it \ncould not be done merely with cuts and freezes and loophole closings; \nthat we needed taxes.\n  In an informal vote on the Budget Committee, eight of us and two of \nour Republican colleagues, Senator Danforth of Missouri, Senator \nBoschwitz of Minnesota--he did not come up here with a lockbox gimmick. \nHe came with a solemn vote for a 5-percent value-added tax allocated to \neliminating the tax and the debt.\n  That was 8 years ago. Eight years ago, we were trying. But they do \nnot try now. They come with all the pollster nonsense, running around \nhere, getting on top of the message. That is why we are in session.\n  I can tell you, if people of common sense would look at the 65 \npercent of what has been agreed upon in both budgets, which would \nconstitute about another $600 billion in spending cuts, which this \nSenator could support, we could agree on cuts in Medicare--not no $270 \nbillion. That is out of the whole cloth. We could pare back some on \nMedicaid and the other particular programs. The President was asking \njust this time last week, on Thursday, he said, you have given me $7 \nbillion; you force-fed me $7 billion, never even asked for by the \nPentagon or by the administration, but you just heaped it on. Now, just \ngive me $1.5 billion so I can take care of technology and children's \nnutrition and health care, environment, education, so we do not have to \nwreck the Government, we can pay for the Government.\n\n  These programs save money, as well as lives, but they would not even \ncompromise. Every time they talk, they say, ``Here's our budget. Where \nis yours?''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would inform the Senator that his 10 \nminutes under the unanimous- consent request have expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, could I have 2 more minutes? Is there \nobjection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator is recognized for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I do appreciate the Chair and the indulgence of my \ncolleagues. I simply will end by saying that we can easily get together \non the 65 percent, $700 billion in savings right now. This Senator \nbelieves we need taxes. Others say, no, you need more spending cuts. I \nknow if you could do it in spending cuts, we would have long since done \nit.\n  The entire domestic discretionary spending is $273 billion. That is \nfor the President, the Congress, the courts, the departments, welfare, \nforeign aid. Just get rid of it all. But you are spending $348 billion \nautomatically for nothing in interest costs on the debt.\n  You can do away entirely with Medicare. That is only $200 billion. Do \naway entirely with the entire Defense and Pentagon budget of $243 \nbillion. You have still got a deficit. You cannot do it.\n  So you have to get together, men and women of good will, and work \ntogether to freeze, cut, close loopholes, and get some kind of a \nrevenue measure to get on top of this fiscal cancer. It is growing \nfaster than we can stop it. I look upon it as taxes because it cannot \nbe avoided. The truth of the matter is that we have to increase taxes \nto stop increasing taxes. Spending is on automatic pilot, and nobody \nwants to admit it, and no plan here comes near excising this cancer.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18051-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18052-S18053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE RECONCILIATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I noticed some earlier discussion on the \nSenate floor that prompted me to come and discuss the pending veto of \nthe reconciliation bill by President Clinton. Some wonder, because they \nextol the virtue of that reconciliation bill, why on Earth would the \nPresident veto it?\n  It occurred to me that often cartoonists are able to capture the \nequivalent of 1,000 words in one little picture. This cartoon out of \nthe Times Union, I think, describes pretty well why the President feels \nhe must veto this legislation. You look at the cartoon. He has the \nRepublican tax cut in the carriage, and the elderly woman on Medicare \nwith the walker pulling the carriage here. And he says, ``Giddyup ol' \ngal.'' That is a cartoonists' message of poking fun. Behind that \ncartoon is a message.\n  Those who say that the tax cuts, half of which goes to those whose \nincomes are over $100,000 or more, will have no impact or no \nrelationship to Medicare, that is hardly believable. That is not to me \nor to cartoonists or to people around the country. There is a \nrelationship.\n  The discussion about all this is not to balance the budget; we ought \nto. The question is, how do you do two things, balance the budget and \nstill retain the priorities that are necessary for this country?\n  I have said before--and I want to state again today--I give the \nRepublican Party credit, the Republicans in the Congress credit, \nbecause I believe they sincerely want to balance this budget. I think \ntheir initiative to push to do that makes sense, and I compliment them \nfor that. I think there are a lot of us who also want to balance the \nbudget but want to do it with a different sense of priorities.\n  I hope they will accord us the same respect and say, ``Yes, that \nmakes sense.'' And, ``We understand your priorities.'' And, ``Let's try \nto find a compromise.'' I hope that is the way we will be able to solve \nthis problem, to do two things, balance the Federal budget and at the \nsame time reach the kind of compromise on priorities that protects \ncertain things that many of us think are important.\n  I happen to think that we ought to have separated this job. First, \nbalance the budget, and then, second, when the budget is balanced and \nthe job is done, then turn to the issue of the Tax Code. But that was \nnot the case. The case was that you had to do a tax cut within the \ncontext of this reconciliation bill. The problem is that the \npriorities, in my judgment, are priorities that are not square with \nwhat the country's needs are.\n  A previous speaker talked about being a Senate pork buster. I guess I \nwas unaware that we have a caucus called pork busters, a rather \ninelegant name, but I understand what it means. A pork buster, I think, \nwould be to look at where is the pork, where is the spending that ought \nnot be spent? I would encourage those who are part of the pork busters \ncaucus to take a look at the defense bill, because I have talked before \nabout the issue of priorities in the context of balancing the budget, \nespecially as it relates to the defense bill.\n  I have a list here of additions to the defense bill that no one from \nthe Defense Department asked for, no one wanted, no one said we needed, \nno one requested. This is extra money stuck into the defense bill by \npeople in the Senate who said, ``By the way, Defense Department, you \ndon't want enough trucks. You didn't order enough trucks. We insist you \nbuy more \n\n[[Page S 18053]]\ntrucks.'' So the Congress says, ``We're going to order more trucks for \nyou. It is true you did not ask for them, but you need to be driving \nmore trucks. You did not ask for more B-2 bombers. We're going to order \nup some B-2 bombers for you. You didn't ask for amphibious ships.'' And \nthe major debate is which of the ships shall we buy? There is a $900 \nmillion one or a $1.2 billion one, so the Congress says, ``You didn't \norder either of them, so we insist you buy both of them. That's our \npriority. You didn't order enough F-15's. We're going to order some for \nyou. You didn't order enough F-16's. We're going to order some of those \nfor you. You didn't order enough Warrior helicopters, Longbow \nhelicopters, Black Hawk helicopters. We insist you get some of those as \nwell.''\n  This is from people who say they are conservatives. Probably some of \nthe pork busters are some of these people, I do not know. But if they \nare looking for pork to bust, boy, I tell you this is a slaughterhouse \nthat will keep them busy for a year. I can give you chapter and verse \non planes, ships, submarines, tanks, helicopters that were ordered that \nthe Secretary of Defense said he did not want.\n  So, you know, I say, look, if this is a question of priorities--and I \nthink it is--how do you balance the budget? What are the priorities? \nHow do you strengthen our priorities and reach from zero? There was $7 \nbillion added to the defense bill this year, $7 billion that the \nSecretary of Defense said he did not want. I have said before and I am \ngoing to state again, because I think it is descriptive of the priority \nproblem, a little program called star schools is cut 40 percent and a \nbig program called star wars is increased in funding by 100 percent. It \nis, I think, the script of the fundamental problem of priorities.\n\n  The priorities are wrong. That is why the President is going to veto \nthat today. The priorities in terms of what the bill, the \nreconciliation bill, says to the public, are these: In the same town, \ngoing to two different addresses with two different messages. The first \nletter to describe how this balanced budget plan affects you, we will \ngo to the top floor of the best office building in town. And on the \n18th floor they will knock on the CEO's door of a major corporation and \nsay, ``Well, we just passed this bill, this budget balancing bill, and \nhere is how it affects you. Your company gets some relief from what is \ncalled the `alternative minimum tax,' so you get $7 million in tax cuts \nbecause of a little provision called the AMT in this bill. So we want \nyou to smile here on the 18th floor with this big desk and big office, \nwith a $7 million tax cut we give you.''\n  And then you get back in the taxi and go to the other side of town to \na little one-room apartment occupied by a low-income person in their \nlate 70's with heart trouble and trying to struggle along and figure \nout how she stretches a very low income to eat and pay for more \nmedicine and pay for rent. We say to that person, ``Well, we just \ndropped off a $7 million tax cut downtown to the CEO of a big company, \nbut our message for you is not quite so good. We're going to tell you \nthat you are going to have to pay a little more for your health care \nand probably get a little less health care to boot. You are going to \npay more and get less. You have to tighten your belt more. You \nunderstand the message. You have to tighten your belt. Yes, you are in \nyour late seventies; I know you cannot compensate by getting a second \njob or first job, but you have to tighten your belt.''\n  See the different messages? One to the biggest office in town saying, \n``You get a big tax cut.'' The other to the person struggling out there \nbarely making it saying, ``By the way, we're going to add to your \nburden.'' That priority does not make any sense.\n  There is another little piece in here--I hope the chairman of the \nSenate Finance Committee will come and we can have a discussion about \nthis someday--a little piece in this tax cut bill, by the way, on the \nissue of deferral. It says, we are going to make it more generous for \nyou than under current law. If you move your plant overseas and close \nyour plant here we are going to make it more generous. We are going to \nincrease the little tax loophole that says to companies, ``Leave \nAmerica, put your jobs elsewhere, close your plant here.''\n\n  Boy, you talk about an insidious tax perversion that says we will \ngive you a tax break if you only leave our country. That is in this \nbill. It is not a big thing; it is a tiny, little thing. I bet there \nare not two or three Senators know it is there or why it is there or \nwho it is going to benefit. But that is the kind of thing that \nrepresents a fundamentally wrongheaded priority. And it is what the \nSenator from South Carolina talked about.\n  There is not any question, you will not get a debate in this Congress \nabout whether you should balance the budget. We ought to do it. The \nquestion is how, how do you balance the budget and at the same time \nhave a fair sense of priorities about what strengthens our country and \nwhat is important in our country.\n  I am one of those who will negotiate, a team of people sitting around \na table, Republicans and Democrats on a negotiating team. I very much \nwant this to succeed, very much want it to work. I believe the end \nstage of the President and the Democrats and the Republicans in \nCongress can agree on a goal of balancing the budget and agree on a \ngoal of preserving priorities that make sense for this country in \nhealth care, education, the environment, agriculture and a couple of \nother areas, that we can get this job done. The American people expect \nus to get it done, and we should.\n  But we have a circumstance where the budget reconciliation bill or \nthe balanced budget provisions were essentially written without any \nassistance from our side of the aisle. There was not a budget meeting. \nThe Senate Finance Committee met drafting this with the majority party, \nwhich is fine, but it does not make for a process in which you get the \nbest of what both parties have to offer. That is what I think the end \nstage of this process ought to be.\n  So, I echo many of the things said by the Senator from South \nCarolina. I believe the goal is very worthwhile. We ought to do it, we \nought to do it the right way, the real way, and when we get it done \nworking cooperatively with both sides of the aisle, I think the \nAmerican people would have reason to rejoice that we put this country \non sound footing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18052-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18053-S18054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I hope we might be able to move ahead here. \nI understood maybe by 1 o'clock we would be able to proceed to the \nconstitutional amendment on flag desecration. I do not know what the \nproblem is. I hope I am not part of it. I have been trying every day to \nget ambassadors confirmed, particularly our friend Senator Sasser. I am \nstill working on it.\n  But I must say, this does not encourage me very much to waste the \nwhole morning and part of the afternoon, at a time when we are trying \nnot only to do this but cooperate with the President on an item or two.\n  I hope the Senator from New Mexico will let us proceed. I can only \nsay to him, it is my intention before we leave here this year to have \nthe Executive Calendar cleared, START II completed, and I do not know \nwhat else may have been mentioned here this morning.\n  I also understand that they are very near an agreement that would \npermit us to do all this in 4 hours. It seems to me that is worth \npursuing. That is what I have been doing on a daily basis, and as \nrecently as yesterday, I spoke to the Democratic leader about it.\n  So I hope the Senator from New Mexico, with those assurances, will \nlet us proceed to Senate Joint Resolution 31, so we might complete \naction on it tomorrow and that we might complete action also tomorrow \non the partial-birth abortion bill and also perhaps a conference report \non State, Justice, Commerce. And that might be all we can accomplish \nthis week. But I hope we can proceed.\n  I do not disagree with the Senator at all. My view is every one of \nthese nominees have families. I have made this plea on the floor many \ntimes, regardless of who was holding up ambassadorships. I think in \nthis case it has been an effort on both sides--Senator Kerry \n\n[[Page S 18054]]\non one side and Senator Helms on the other--to come together with \nagreement, and I was told, as recently as 10 minutes ago, that they are \njust that far apart, which will certainly resolve all the questions \nthat have been raised, I think, by the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if I can respond to the majority \nleader's suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I certainly have no question about the \nmajority leader's good intentions with regard to these matters. I think \nhe has been trying to move ahead on them. But unfortunately, in order \nto get anything done around here, you need unanimous consent. We do not \nhave that as yet.\n  In fact, the ambassadorial nominations we have been discussing are \nstill not out of committee, and the START II treaty is still not out of \ncommittee. They are not on the Senate Calendar.\n  I feel if we could get a unanimous-consent agreement which provided \nfor a vote prior to adjournment this fall of this session on the \nAmbassadors and also provide for a time and some limited amount of \ndebate to get START II dealt with, I certainly would be willing to go \nwith that. I think what we do need is an agreement that Senator Helms \nand all the others who are involved in this will agree to.\n  I do not have any involvement in the negotiations that are taking \nplace with the State Department reorganization or any of that. I do not \nhave a dog in that fight, as the saying goes. I do want to see us deal \nwith these particular matters I have identified here. I would like \nagreement among all Senators to do that. If we can get that unanimous-\nconsent agreement, with Senator Helms agreeing to it, then obviously \nthat would resolve my concerns.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I have the agreement in my hand. I have been trying to get \nit for several weeks. We have come very close, I must say. This is not \njust Senator Helms. It involves the Senator on the other side. I do \nthink we are that close.\n  In this agreement, it also says we will take up the START II treaty. \nSTART II is part of it, along with all the nominations. I think it \ntakes care of those that might be pending in the committee, too, or \ndischarged. Even though they have not been reported out, they would be \ncovered, too, by our agreement.\n  We thought we might get this agreement yesterday. That is how close \nwe are. I have not given up on getting it yet today. I asked Senator \nHelms, the Senator from North Carolina--I thought it might take several \ndays on START II. He said he did not think so. He thought there would \nbe one or two amendments.\n  So, as I understand, once the logjam breaks, within 4 hours we can \ncomplete action on State Department reorganization and then all the \nnominees would be confirmed, and then START II--at least there would be \nan agreement to take up START II. I think we are getting very close to \nwhat the Senator from New Mexico would like to achieve. I just hope we \ncan work out something so that while we are trying to achieve this, \nwhich is the agreement, that we can also proceed on Senate Joint \nResolution 31.\n  I have just been advised that maybe one phone call away, we may be \nworking something out on this.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I compliment the majority leader for the \nprogress made. I am glad to hear all this. I was not aware of it. I do \nbelieve it is important we make that one additional phone call and get \nthis nailed down. If I go ahead and say fine, proceed--quite frankly, I \nhave been asking the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, about these \nmatters for about 3 weeks now, and he has consistently, and in good \nfaith, said we are just about to agree. We are very close. I know he is \nin good faith; I know the majority leader is in good faith; I certainly \nfeel I am in good faith. But I do want to see us get the agreement \nentered before we proceed to consider this constitutional amendment.\n  As I said, I have no objection to us voting on the constitutional \namendment, but I would like to have that put off until we have \nagreement to vote on these other matters that are agreed to by all \nSenators.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition \nto what I believe is a very destructive provision in H.R. 1530, the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  That provision would repeal the public laws that created and gave \nauthority to the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation in the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense.\n  What is at stake here are the lives of our men and women in uniform.\n  The OT was created by Congress over 10 years ago with strong \nbipartisan support. The purpose of this office is to ensure that our \nservicemen receive weapons that are tested in an independent manner and \nin an operationally realistic environment. This office was created to \nguarantee that the weapons our soldiers take into the battlefield are \nready for combat.\n  In this important way, the OT saves lives.\n  Mr. President, the OT is also the conscience of the acquisition \nprocess. Its work has helped to prevent waste and fraud. It is the \ncornerstone to Congress' and the Pentagon's fly-before-you-buy approach \nto new weapons platforms and other military equipment.\n  In this important way, the OT saves the taxpayer money.\n  I understand that the provisions eliminating the Director of the OT \noriginated out of an effort to streamline the already bloated Pentagon \nbureaucracy. I support that larger effort. Together with Congressman \nKasich, I have sponsored legislation that would streamline the \nPentagon's acquisition process.\n  However, eliminating an effective OT will not eliminate the need \nfor testing under realistic battlefield conditions. It does raise the \nquestion as to what office will be responsible for approving tests and \nrepresenting the troops through independent evaluations of new weapons.\n  Moreover, the OT has already been streamlined. Last year's Federal \nAcquisition Streamlining Act merged live-fire testing with the \noperational testing function. We should also recognize that the OT is \nalready one of the smallest directorates in the Pentagon.\n  Mr. President, the OT is an office that has earned the respect of \nothers in the Pentagon and in Congress. After Operation Desert Storm, \nformer Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney stated that the vigorous, \nindependent testing oversight put into place by Congress ``saved more \nlives'' than perhaps any other single initiative.\n  Just last year, the GAO testified before Congress stating that the \npriority we give to independent testing and evaluation should be \nincreased and not decreased. In its examination of operational testing, \nthe GAO concluded that any changes to legislation for the testing and \nevaluation of military equipment should preserve, if not strengthen, \nthe fly-before-buy principle.\n  Yes, Mr. President, the provisions in this year's Defense \nauthorization bill would weaken that legislation.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that this body, the U.S. Senate, \nunanimously passed a resolution just this last August expressing our \nbelief that the authorities and office of the OT must be preserved. \nIt is, thus, surprising if not shocking, that the conferees appear to \nhave overlooked this resolution.\n  Above all, Mr. President, the provisions that effectively decapitate \nthe OT constitute an issue of priorities. Do we care more about \nreducing the size of the Office of the Secretary of Defense or the \nsafety of our troops? I firmly believe that if this provision of the \nDefense Authorization Act is not removed, Congress will be putting \ncountless lives at risk in the name of reducing a handful of billets.\n  To do just that as we are sending our troops to Bosnia seems to me to \nbe all the more dangerous. Just yesterday, I read in the New York Times \nthat our forces deploying in the Balkans will be equipped with an array \nof new technologies that have never been tested in combat. Could we \nimagine sending our \n\n[[Page S 18055]]\ntroops to battle with equipment that we have not made the fullest \neffort to subject to operationally realistic testing?\n  Mr. President, I urge the conferees of the Defense Authorization Act \nto remove the provisions eliminating the Office of Operational Test and \nEvaluation. If they are unable to remove that provision, I will \nencourage my colleagues in the Senate to vote against the authorization \nbill. The safety of our servicemen and women requires our full support.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to make a brief statement \nabout Senator Kassebaum which I know she prefers I wouldn't, but which \nshe will have to endure as a price of her retirement. It is, of course, \na statement of tribute to her service in the U.S. Senate, and an \nexpression of deep personal regret that she has decided to retire.\n  Many of my colleagues and the major papers are rightfully \nhighlighting Senator Kassebaum's legislative accomplishments and her \nmany courageous, nonpartisan positions. But I want to focus my comments \non her role in United States-Africa relations. I have had the immense \npleasure of working with her in the past year as the ranking member on \nthe Subcommittee on African Affairs, of which she has been an active \nmember since 1981, and of course now chairs. For me, Senator \nKassebaum's deep commitment, genuine expertise, and tremendous \nleadership on Africa have been one of the most inspiring influences I \nhave had while in the Senate.\n  In many ways, the fact that she chose Africa as one of her \nspecializations says so much about what kind of legislator she is. As \nour colleague from Illinois, Senator Simon, often reminds us, though \nwell-known and admired in Africa, Senator Kassebaum surely got few \nvotes in Kansas for advocating Africa's interests. It certainly is not \nglamorous to travel to many of the places in Africa she has visited. \nAnd she certainly does not get the limelight often accorded foreign \npolicy experts as a leader on United States-Africa issues. However, she \nhas made a commitment to the region because it is the right thing to \ndo: because there are complex issues in Africa that call out for \nAmerican attention, and there have been too few voices in Congress that \nhave cared about the United States-Africa relationship. She has \ngrappled with the difficult issues, such as the genocide in Rwanda, the \nfailing transition to democracy in Nigeria, the small window of \nopportunity to consolidate peace in Liberia, the reconstruction of \nAngola, the tragedy in Sudan, and so much more. Senator Kassebaum can \nalways be counted on to address these issues, and then to work \npersistently to shape intelligent and active U.S. policies. This \ncommitment exemplifies the principle, integrity, and keen sense of \nresponsibility that have characterized her entire career.\n\n  But Senator Kassebaum also stands out for her bipartisan--even \nnonpartisan--approach. While working wonderfully as a team player, she \nalso has the strength to be independent when her principles are at \nstake. That is one of the reasons she has been so effective. For \nexample, in 1986 Senator Kassebaum broke with a Republican President \nand led the vote to impose sanctions on the racist apartheid regime of \nSouth Africa. This, of course, was the defining moment that changed \nUnited States policy from constructive engagement to isolation of the \nregime, which eventually brought down apartheid, and gave birth to \nmajority rule in South Africa.\n  She has presided over our subcommittee in the same nonpartisan \nmanner. While the Foreign Relations Committee may seem entangled in \nbitter partisan battles, the Subcommittee on African Affairs has \nfunctioned actively and smoothly under Senator Kassebaum's leadership, \ndemonstrating what bipartisanship can accomplish when reason prevails \nand pettiness and politics are set aside. For me, it has been a \nwonderful opportunity to learn about Africa, and I think it has also \nenabled the subcommittee to do its job as a policymaker. Senator \nKassebaum has given me faith that in spite of all the rancor and \npartisan bickering, it is still possible in the Senate to reach across \nthe aisle and work together.\n  These are some of the attributes that have made Senator Kassebaum a \ngreat Senator. But she is also a joy to work with because she is such a \ndelightful and gracious person. As much as I enjoy the subject matter, \nI think her kindness and dedication have helped sustain my active \ninterest in Africa, and make it an enjoyable experience.\n  It will certainly be a more lonely process without her. Mr. \nPresident, I will value the next several months, working with her and \nlearning from her. I will sorely miss her in the next session.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18054-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18055-S18056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today, I rise in the Senate to voice my \nvery strong opposition to the actions being considered by the House \nSenate conference committee on the Defense authorization bill.\n  Mr. President, I have been informed, with some of my colleagues, and \nI am very sorry I did not get to listen to all of the remarks of my \ngood friend and colleague and partner in this issue, Senator Roth of \nDelaware, we have been informed that the conference committee is now \nconsidering turning back the clock on 12 years of progress in the war \nagainst $600 hammers, $1,000 toilet seats, guns that do not shoot, \nbombs that do not explode, and planes that do not fly. I believe what \nis at stake are the lives of our men and women who serve this country \nin the Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking today of the very useful and most \ncritical role of the Office of the Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation in the Pentagon and the effort underway in the conference \ncommittee to totally annihilate and to eliminate this office.\n  As I address the Senate this afternoon, the conference committee on \nthe DOD authorization bill is now deliberating over whether to repeal \nthe bipartisan legislation written by myself, along in 1983 with \nSenator Roth, Senator Kassebaum, Senator Grassley, and others, that \ncreated the independent weapons testing office.\n  This legislation this is now known as section 139 of title X \nestablishes the Operational Testing Office that currently Mr. \nPresident, oversees, evaluates, and reports on the results of tests \nconducted on our new military hardware.\n  This Office was designed to report directly to the Secretary of \nDefense with this independent assessment of the weapons being tested, \nprocurement, and combat use. The job of this Office has been to help \nmake good weapons better and to help keep weapons that do not work out \nof the hands of our soldiers and sailors.\n  It has saved the taxpayers billions of dollars by exposing many \ntroubled systems before they become costly dinosaurs and disasters. The \nultimate contribution, I think, of the Operational Testing Office has \nbeen the lives it has saved by helping to ensure that our Armed Forces \nare not sent into combat with weapons that are faulty and do not work \nand will fail in an operational environment.\n\n  Support for this Office, Mr. President, has always been bipartisan. \nFor example, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that the \nindependent weapons testing ``saved more lives\" during Operation Desert \nStorm than perhaps any other single initiative. Current Defense \nSecretary William Perry has recently described this Office as ``The \nconscience of the acquisition process.''\n  Earlier this year, I was extremely shocked to learn that the House \nNational Security Committee recommended repealing section 139 of title \nX, thereby eliminating this Office.\n  Because of what we consider to be a very irresponsible initiative in \nthe House of Representatives, Senator Roth and myself sponsored a \nbipartisan sense-of-the-Senate resolution voicing the Senate's full \nsupport for the Testing Office and our strong objection to repealing \nits charter. This resolution passed the Senate unanimously during \nconsideration of the defense authorization bill in August in 1995.\n  We were recently notified that the conference committee apparently is \ndisregarding the sense-of-the-Senate \n\n[[Page S 18056]]\nresolution by refusing to remove from its conference report the \nlanguage that would kill operational weapons testing in the Pentagon.\n  This news is disheartening, indeed, Mr. President. Repealing the law \nthat established independent weapons testing would be an irresponsible, \nunthinkable course, and dangerously shortsighted. If this Office's \ncharter is revoked, countless American lives will be at risk. \nFurthermore, the entire system by which we acquire new weapons will be \npushed back to the dark ages. We will undoubtedly be bringing back the \nunthinkable conflict of interest of the students grading their own \nexams, when it comes to evaluating the results of critical weapons \ntesting.\n  Last Friday, after learning that the Testing Office was, indeed, in \njeopardy and in danger of being eliminated, Senator Roth, Senator \nGrassley and myself sent a letter to Chairman Thurmond and to Chairman \nSpence, expressing our outrage over the apparent desire to repeal \nsection 139 of title X. In this letter, Mr. President, we call on the \nconferees to maintain our legislation that created the Operational \nTesting Office.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter \nthat we sent to Chairman Thurmond and to Chairman Spence be printed in \nthe Record directly following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. PRYOR. I gladly join my good friends from the other side of the \naisle in voting our strong bipartisan support for independent weapons \ntesting. This Office has always enjoyed support from each side of the \naisle. I hope it always will. It was created in this spirit. I \ncertainly hope that it does not die under a cloud of partisanship.\n  I would like my views to be known clearly and publicly before the \nconferees conclude their deliberations on the Defense authorization \nbill. I know they will take heed of the remarks of my colleague and \ngood friend, Senator Roth, who just delivered his eloquent speech on \nthe floor of the Senate with regard to this issue.\n  If this conference report comes to the Senate, Mr. President, with \nlanguage that revokes the charter of our weapons testing office, I will \nstrongly oppose the conference report and I will ask it be rejected by \nthe entire U.S. Senate.\n  As we prepare to send American troops into Bosnia, it would be \nwrong--absolutely, totally wrong--to eliminate the most important \nchecks and balances in the military procurement chain that has proven \nto save time, money, and most importantly, the lives of our fighting \nforces. The American taxpayers, the American men and women in uniform, \ndeserve much better.\n  I thank the Chair for recognizing me. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 1, 1995.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, SR 228, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to voice our strenuous \n     objection to an action the defense authorization conference \n     committee is considering that would jeopardize independent \n     operational and live-fire weapons testing in the Department \n     of Defense. We believe that what is at stake are the lives of \n     our men and women who serve in the armed forces.\n       As you know, the conference committee is currently \n     discussing various measures to streamline the Office of the \n     Secretary of Defense (OSD). We are aware that the conference \n     committee is considering repealing section 139 of Title 10. \n     Repealing Section 139 would eliminate the authority of the \n     Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT) to oversee, \n     evaluate, and report on the operational worth of weapons \n     prior to their production and procurement by the U.S. \n     government.\n       The DOT office was created 12 years ago with strong \n     bipartisan support. Its existence has been critical to \n     Congressional and Pentagon efforts to promote a ``fly-before-\n     you-buy'' approach to the multi-billion dollar arena of \n     military acquisitions.\n       Section 139 of Title 10 is the foundation upon which this \n     important contribution to DOD procurement is based. Since its \n     enactment, this provision has saved time, money, and most \n     importantly, the lives of our soldiers and sailors who must \n     rely on tested, proven weapons. We truly believe that any \n     decision by the conference committee to repeal section 139 \n     would result in many unintended consequences.\n       Eliminating this office would not eliminate the requirement \n     to conduct testing under realistic operational conditions. \n     However, it would raise the question as to who would be \n     responsible for approving test plans and for providing \n     independent evaluations of testing. This uncertainty would be \n     costly indeed.\n       We appreciate the conferees' desire to streamline the \n     Office of the Secretary of Defense. However, the Federal \n     Acquisition Streamlining Act recently enacted by Congress \n     merged live-fire testing with the operational testing \n     function. Thus, independent testing oversight has already \n     been streamlined. Furthermore, the DOT office is already \n     one of the smallest in the Pentagon bureaucracy.\n       This directorate has proven itself as one of the most \n     important checks and balances in the DOD procurement system. \n     Its value has been lauded by our two most recent Secretaries \n     of Defense. After Operation Desert Storm, former Defense \n     Secretary Dick Cheney said that the vigorous, independent \n     testing oversight put in place by Congress ``saved more \n     lives'' than perhaps any other single initiative. Current \n     Defense Secretary Perry recently described the DOT as ``the \n     conscience of the acquisition process.''\n       In August, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a Sense of \n     the Senate resolution that stated clearly the Senate's \n     opposition to repealing section 139 of Title 10. We continue \n     to believe that repealing the law that guides independent \n     weapons testing is wrong and dangerously shortsighted.\n       Clearly the question facing Congress is do we care more \n     about reducing the size of OSD or protecting the lives of our \n     service men and women. We firmly believe that if the \n     provisions repealing section 139 are not removed, Congress \n     will be putting countless lives at risk in the name of \n     reducing a handful of billets.\n       We urge you to continue the bipartisan Congressional \n     support for independent testing by deleting from your \n     conference report any provisions that would repeal section \n     139 of Title 10.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     William V. Roth, Jr.\n     Charles E. Grassley.\n     David Pryor.\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18055-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18056-S18057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wanted to just add some information \nfor my colleagues about some of the ambassadors that I have been \ndiscussing this morning and so far today about the qualifications of \nthese people. These are individuals that have been nominated by the \nPresident. There are 18 of them that are presently pending in the \nForeign Relations Committee. They are an outstanding group of nominees.\n  I was just provided with more detailed information about what they \nhave been doing in their careers and why they are considered by the \nPresident to be qualified for these important positions. So I thought I \nwould go through some of that information so that any Senator who has a \ndoubt about the qualifications of any nominee would hopefully have that \ndoubt put to rest. I do not know many of these people myself, but I \nwould like to at least put in the Record the information about them.\n  Mr. President, going down the list, the President's nominee to Sri \nLanka is Mr. Peter Burleigh, who is presently the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for Personnel. He is a career appointee in the \nDepartment of State. He has been with the Department of State now for \nsome substantial period of time. He was a Peace Corps volunteer before \nthat. He has a very distinguished resume which we will include in the \nRecord.\n  The second of these nominees is the President's nominee for APEC, \nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation. This person, Sandra Kristoff, is now \nthe coordinator in that position, and she is being nominated by the \nPresident for the rank of Ambassador in that same position--again, a \nvery distinguished career of involvement in foreign policy and trade \nrelated issues.\n  The third on this list is John Malott, who has been nominated by the \nPresident as the Ambassador to Malaysia. \n\n[[Page S 18057]]\n He is presently the senior adviser to the Under Secretary of State for \nEconomic, Business and Agricultural Affairs. He is a career member of \nthe Senior Foreign Service at the class of minister-counsellor, clearly \na very distinguished and recognized public servant in our diplomatic \ncorps.\n  Next is Mr. Kenneth Quinn, Kenneth Michael Quinn, who has been \nnominated by the President to the position of Ambassador to Cambodia. \nHe is presently a special project officer for the Bureau of East Asian \nand Pacific Affairs in the Department of State--again, a career of \nforeign service, class of minister-counsellor.\n  I would just point out parenthetically here, Mr. President, that I \ncan remember years in which we had great debates on the Senate floor \nexpressing concerns about the political nature of the appointments \nbeing made by one or another President to some ambassadorial positions. \nIn this group of 18, all but 4 of the 18 are career Foreign Service \nofficers, have devoted their entire career to working in our diplomatic \ncorps, and the four who are not career Foreign Service officers I think \nare recognized by all to be well qualified to take important positions \nlike this.\n  After the Ambassador to Cambodia is Mr. William Itoh, the President's \nappointee as Ambassador to the Kingdom of Thailand, presently a student \nin the Capstone Program at the National Defense University--again, a \ncareer member of the Senior Foreign Service with the class of \ncounsellor.\n  Next is a gentleman I referred to in my statement this morning, Mr. \nStapleton Roy, who has been nominated by the President as Ambassador to \nthe Republic of Indonesia. He again is a career member of the Senior \nForeign Service, class of career minister. I would point out that he \nwas born in China. He has spent much of his life in the Far East and \nChina in particular. He is extremely well recognized as an expert on \nthat part of the world and has served our country extremely well in \nimportant positions including Ambassador to China. He now, of course, \nis being considered for this other very important position for which I \nhope we can confirm him.\n\n  The next after Mr. Roy is Thomas Simons, Jr., who is nominated by the \nPresident as the Ambassador to Pakistan. He is presently the \nCoordinator of U.S. Assistance for the New Independent States. His \nForeign Service grade is career member of the Senior Foreign Service, a \ncareer diplomat, as many of these nominees are, and somebody who \nclearly has earned the respect and confidence of the President.\n  Next is Frances Cook, who has been nominated by the President to be \nthe Ambassador to Oman, presently the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nState for Political Military Affairs--again, a career member of the \nSenior Foreign Service.\n  Next is Richard Henry Jones, who has been nominated by the President \nas Ambassador to Lebanon. And again we have a person who at the present \ntime serves as Director of the Office of Egyptian Affairs in the \nDepartment of State, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service with \na class of counsellor.\n  Next is James Collins. Mr. Collins has been nominated by the \nPresident as Ambassador-at-Large and Special Adviser to the Secretary \nof State for the New Independent States, and again a career member of \nthe Senior Foreign Service with the class of minister-counsellor, also \na very distinguished career which I think well equips him for that \nposition.\n  Next is Charles Twining, who has been nominated by the President as \nAmbassador to the Republic of Cameroon, presently the Ambassador to \nCambodia, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service with the class \nof minister-counsellor--again, a very distinguished public servant in \nour diplomatic corps.\n  Next is James Joseph. The President has nominated James Joseph as \nAmbassador to the Republic of South Africa. He presently is the \npresident of the Council on Foundations and has a very distinguished \ncareer in a great many different areas, but obviously has the \nPresident's confidence.\n  Next is Joan Plaisted. Joan Plaisted is the President's nominee as \nAmbassador to the Republic of the Marshall Islands, now presently \nserving as Director of the Office of Thailand and Burma Affairs in the \nDepartment of State, another career member in the Senior Foreign \nService with the class of counsellor.\n  Next is Don Gevirtz, who has been nominated as Ambassador to the \nRepublic of Fiji, to the Republic of Nauru, to the Kingdom of Tonga and \nTuvalu--again, a very distinguished individual whose present position \nis chairman of the board and chief executive officer the Foothill \nGroup, Inc., in California.\n  Next is our own former colleague, Senator Jim Sasser, who is \npresently an attorney here in the District of Columbia as well as in \nNashville, TN, earlier this year was a fellow of Harvard University and \nis now, of course, the President's nominee as Ambassador to Beijing. \nAnd I think all of us who have served with him would agree that he will \nperform in an exemplary fashion in that position as he would in any \nposition for which the President would nominate him.\n  Next is David Rawson, whom the President has nominated as Ambassador \nto the Republic of Mali, presently the Ambassador to the Republic of \nRwanda, a career member of the Senior Foreign Service, class of \ncounselor; again, a very distinguished career in our diplomatic \nservice.\n  Next is Robert Gribbon, who has been nominated by the President as \nAmbassador to the Republic of Rwanda. His present position is \nAmbassador to the Central African Republic, another career member of \nthe Senior Foreign Service, with the class of counselor; a very \ndistinguished career, formerly a Peace Corps volunteer in Kenya.\n  Finally, Gerald Wesley Scott, who has been nominated by the President \nas the Ambassador to the Republic of the Gambia. He is presently the \nDeputy Chief of Mission in Zaire and in the American Embassy in \nKinshasa, Zaire, another career member of the Senior Foreign Service \nwith the class of counselor.\n  Mr. President, I have gone through this list and given a little \ninformation about each of these individuals just to make the point that \nthis is not some kind of political effort on my part or on the \nPresident's part or anybody to get these people in these new positions.\n  These people have devoted their careers, their entire professional \nlives, to serving this country in often very difficult circumstances. \nThey have been chosen by the President to serve in these important \npositions, and we owe it to them as well as to those people we \nrepresent in our home States to get on with approving their nominations \nso that they can continue to represent this country in those important \npositions.\n  That is the list of ambassadors that are presently being held up in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. I hope very much that we will be able \nto get an agreement here today, or very soon, to have all of those \nnominees reported to the Senate floor and have a vote on those nominees \nas well as on START II before we adjourn this session of the Congress. \nI think that would be a very major accomplishment and something that \nwould allow us to feel we had done our duty under the Constitution, \nwhich I think is certainly what all of us are intending to do. So with \nthat, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about an issue that all of \nus are concerned about and all of us are thinking about, and that is \nthe President's policy to put United States troops on the ground in \nBosnia.\n  First, let me make it clear that I am opposed to that idea. I had an \nopportunity about 5 weeks ago to go to Sarajevo along with some other \nof my associates here. We went to Stuttgart in \n\n[[Page S 18058]]\nGermany and visited for a day with the supreme commander there. I was \nimpressed by the preparation, by the way, of our military, as always. I \nam sure they will be able to carry out whatever mission is assigned to \nthem.\n  We spent some time in Croatia talking particularly to the Defense \nMinister there in terms of the Croatians' activities and their \nconcerns. We spent a portion of our time in Sarajevo where we visited \nwith the President of Bosnia, had a chance to talk with the U.N. \ncommander there, and also spent some time coming back through Brussels \nin Belgium, and spent some time with the NATO commander and all 16 of \nthe Ambassadors that were there.\n  Certainly, I am not an expert in the field, having been there just a \nfew days, but I have to tell you that you do get a sense, you do get a \nsense from being there as to what the feelings are, a sense that, as \nyou would imagine, those people are tired of fighting and looking for \nsome resolution. You get a feeling, also, however, that there is not a \nwillingness to give up some of the positions that people have taken and \nwill maintain, antagonistic positions and conflicts that are very long \nlasting and have been there for hundreds of years.\n  So, Mr. President, I came back having not changed my opinion. I do \nthink we need to continue to be involved. I think we have had an \nexcellent representation there in terms of the negotiation. I \ncongratulate the negotiators. We met yesterday with Secretary \nHolbrooke. But I was no more convinced of the responsibility to have \n20,000 or 30,000 troops on the ground there and of our chances of \ncoming away in the period of time, as described by the President, of 1 \nyear, or that the solution is any better than it was before.\n\n  Let me say, however, that we are going to have differences of view \nhere. I hope we have an extended discussion of the issue here on the \nfloor. I think everyone who comes forward will honestly have their \nviews--and I do not impugn anyone's motives as to why they are where \nthey are.\n  Let me comment on a number of things that have concerned me. One is \nthe process and the process of involving American citizens, through \ntheir Congress, through their elected representatives, in this \ndecision. And I have to tell you that it is my observation that the \nCongress has essentially been co-opted in this decision.\n  It started some 2 years ago when the President, for whatever the \nreason, indicated that he would place 25,000 troops in Bosnia, at that \ntime mostly to remove the U.N. forces if that was necessary. So that \nwas the first indication why it was 25,000. Why it was not 20,000, why \nit was not 40,000, why it was not 10,000, I am not sure. No one has \never been able to tell us that.\n  So, then not much happened, and the Congress then passed resolutions \nsaying we ought to lift the arms embargo on the Moslems. However, that \nwas not pushed by the administration. That was not something that the \nadministration worked hard to encourage. But shortly thereafter, I \nthink it did cause some action. Shortly thereafter, the United States \nthen moved to get NATO to do some airstrikes, which tended to bring \ntogether then the Croatians and the Moslems to a federation that sort \nof equalized, began to equalize the forces there, and so we saw a \nchange, I think prompted, at least partially, by the action of this \nCongress to recommend that we lift the arms embargo.\n  So then we saw some effort to come to a peace agreement. When I was \nthere, there was just recently installed a cease-fire. I think it was \nthe 31st cease-fire, however. Nevertheless, it was an effort to do \nthat. Then we moved toward the peace agreement and a meeting in Dayton, \nOH, or wherever, to do that. So the administration said, gosh, we \ncannot really talk to you about what is in the wind here because we are \nhaving a peace conference and it would disrupt the peace conference.\n  We had a number of hearings, and we did not get too much information, \nbecause they said we cannot do that. So then, for whatever commitment \nthere is to it, there was a peace agreement initialed in Ohio. I am \nglad there was and I congratulate those who helped bring it about. No \none is certain what it means and how much commitment there is to it. \nThen we are told by the administration, ``Well, we have a peace \narrangement now. We can't really talk to you much because we can't \nchange that.''\n  The next thing we knew, the President was in Europe on a peace \nmission talking to a number of countries, including NATO and European \ncountries, saying, ``We are willing to bring these troops in.'' Of \ncourse, it was received with a great deal of enthusiasm. Who would not? \nIf we agreed to do most of the heavy lifting, you would imagine that.\n  So then following that comes the commitment for troops, and some \npreliminary troops are there now.\n  Mr. President--and I asked this question of the Secretary of State \nand the Secretary of Defense in a hearing last week--what is the role \nof Congress? I did not get an answer, other than provide the money. I \ndo not think that is appropriate.\n  I do not want to get into the great discussions of the \nconstitutionality of the President's authority. There is disagreement \nabout that. I do not happen to think the President has unlimited \nauthority because he is named Commander in Chief in the Constitution.\n  Nevertheless, there must be a role here for the Congress. I think it \nhas been handled very poorly, frankly, in terms of some involvement and \ncommitment.\n  It seems to me--and I am sorry for this--it seems to me the \nadministration is more in the posture of defending their decision and \nwinning the argument than really talking about the substance of why we \nshould, in fact, be in Bosnia. We can talk about details, and that is \nwhat we hear, all the details of how we are going to train, how we are \ngoing to move, all these things, but the real issue is not the details, \nas important as they may be. The real issue is, why are we there and \nwhat is the rationale and reason and the vital American interests for \nus to be there.\n  We hear some saying, ``Well, we're going to put troops in harm's \nway.'' Of course, no one wants to put troops in harm's way. On the \nother hand, that is what troops are for. The question is not are they \nin harm's way, the question is, is there a good reason and rationale \nfor them being in harm's way?\n  We hear, ``If they don't go, there will not be any peace.'' I am not \nsure that is true.\n\n  Until these warring parties are prepared, genuinely, to have peace, I \nsuspect there will not be peace. We are told, and I think sincerely, \nthat we are there to keep peace, not to make peace. There is a little \ndifferent term this time, it is called enforce peace, which is a bit \nhard to define. But when we asked the question, what do we do when \nthere is an organized military resistance to the U.S. forces that are \nthere, NATO forces, the answer was, ``Well, we're not there to fight a \nwar, we're not there to fight, we are there to keep and enforce the \npeace.'' We were led to believe we probably would withdraw.\n  So, Mr. President, it is awfully hard to know. Some say, ``Well, we \nhave to have leadership, we're isolationists.'' I do not believe for 1 \nsecond that anyone can think of this country, the things we are \ninvolved in both in security and trade, that would cause anyone to \nsuggest this country is isolationist. That is ridiculous.\n  Some say, ``Well, NATO will dissolve without us.'' I do not believe \nthat. NATO was designed, of course, to bring together the North \nAtlantic nations to resist the Soviet Union, and they still have a \nmission, certainly. Although I must tell you, having been there, I \nthink there is some search for a mission going on. NATO will continue \nto exist; NATO has a legitimate purpose. I do not know whether its \npurpose is to quell civil wars within Europe.\n  So, Mr. President, we are in a sticky wicket here, and I guess the \nstickiest thing--and I, frankly, did not get a chance to ask the \nSecretary yesterday--is, what is our policy in the future, what is our \nposition going to be with regard to our role in civil disturbances, our \nrole in civil wars, our role in ethnic disturbances throughout the \nworld, and there have been a number and there will continue to be.\n  Is our role to place troops and keep the peace, enforce the peace? I \ndo not know the answer. But we will have to make a decision with \nrespect to policy, so that we know where we are, what people can expect \nfrom us. We want to be a leader in the world; we will be, we \n\n[[Page S 18059]]\nshould be, we are the superpower. People should have, however, a reason \nto anticipate that our position will be based on policy.\n  Mr. President, I think we find ourselves in a very difficult \nposition, one in which honest people can disagree. I happen to believe \nit is a mistake for us to put U.S. troops on the ground there, a \nmistake in terms of policy, a mistake in terms of alternatives. There \nare alternatives. It is not that or nothing.\n  We can continue to be involved with diplomacy. We can continue to \nsupport NATO. We can give other kinds of support there. It is a \nquestion of what happens when we leave. What do we do to ensure that \nhaving spent whatever it is--I suspect even though the administration \nsays $1.5 billion, maybe plus $600 million in nation building, a little \nover $2 billion, I would be willing to bet you that is not right. We \nspent nearly that much in Haiti, and this place will be three times as \nexpensive.\n  So the question is, what is the basis, what is the rationale for that \nkind of commitment? I hope we have an opportunity to discuss it soon. I \nhad hoped we would this week. Apparently, it will be next week. We \nought to keep in mind the mass troop movement has not taken place. We \nhave some folks in there, some troops in there early to prepare, but \nthe troops are not there. We still need to make a decision. We still \nneed to say to the President, if that is what we believe, that we think \nthis is the wrong decision. No one here, however, will resist \nsupporting troops once they are there. We are not talking about that at \nthis point; we are talking about the decision to be there. It is a \ntough one. We should face up to it, come to the snubbing post and make \ndecisions. I am sorry we have not made them before now. We shall. It is \nour responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to address the Senate for just \nmaybe 3 or 4 minutes, 5 or 6 at the most, on something that Senator \nPryor and Senator Roth have already addressed, something that we three \nhave worked on over quite a few years. It deals with a matter of \ndefense and an operation within defense that is going to make sure that \nwe get the most money for our defense dollar and to make sure that a \nweapon system that we are producing is effective and safe.\n  Mr. President, I am amazed that I have to stand before you to say \nwhat I am about to say. I never thought I would have to rise to speak \nout to defend this program. But, then again, I continue to be \nastonished by the shortsighted and misguided actions of so many people \nin this town.\n  Nearly 12 years ago, there was a bipartisan effort to create the \nOffice of Operational Test and Evaluation [OT] at the Department of \nDefense. OT was created in response to a very simple idea: We should \nnot spend billions of dollars of the taxpayers money before we know \nthat a weapons works and will be safe and effective for our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  The OT Office has been an unqualified success. It has saved the \ntaxpayers billions. The cancellation of that boondoggle, the Sgt. York \n[DIVAD] antiaircraft weapon, was due in part to the work of OT \nCancelling the DIVAD saved the taxpayers billions. More important, it \nensured we didn't give our soldiers poor, unsafe equipment.\n  But far more important, OT has saved lives. There is no question \nthat the modifications made to the Bradley fighting vehicle to enhance \nits survivability ensured that many young soldiers came home from the \nPersian Gulf.\n  Former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that the vigorous, \nindependent testing oversight put in place with the creation of OT by \nCongress saved more lives than perhaps any other single initiative.\n  Now, what is our response to these accolades? To these successes? Why \nof course, we get rid of it. Incredibly this is actually being proposed \nright now by the DOD authorization conferees.\n  OT asks the tough questions on weapons effectiveness, and it looks \nclosely at the answers. It does this independent of the services and \nthe procurement bureaucracy at the Pentagon. So why would we want to \neliminate this important check and balance?\n  Simply put, OT is a vital check in ensuring that the taxpayers get \nthe best bang for the buck and that the safety of our troops is the top \npriority.\n  The people who are clamoring to get rid of OT are upset because \nOT is a roadblock to their top priority: ripping the money sacks open \nat both ends, and pitchforking dollars to defense contractors as \nquickly as possible.\n  These are people who must believe DOD exists merely as an expressway \nto pad the coffers of contractors. And they want to get rid of this \nsmall speed bump, the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, \nbecause it slows down the flow of money.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly saddened that this is happening \nunder a Republican Congress. I have been assured by Republican House \nleaders that Pentagon reform is around the corner, even though in the \nDOD authorization bill we are throwing more money at the Pentagon. But \nI must say, if this is their idea of reform, they'll have an unexpected \nbattle on their flank. And I'll be leading the charge once again, just \nas I did in the mid-1980's. And we will win again.\n  House Republicans say they want to reform the Pentagon so much that \nit will become a triangle. This action undermines any claims by \nRepublicans in the Congress that they are for reforming the Pentagon.\n  I am very fearful that this Congress has badly confused its \nprinciples. Being for a strong defense means ensuring that our troops \nget the safest and most effective weapons for our troops. It does not \nmean ensuring only a steady and increasing cash flow for defense \ncontractors.\n  And let me say, while the actions of the Congress are inexcusable, \nthe administration's actions are no better.\n  We have heard not a word from the administration about the \nelimination of OT How the administration, in the middle of sending \nour troops into Bosnia, can sit idly by and say and do nothing while \nOT is being eliminated is beyond comprehension. What kind of signal \ndoes that send to our troops?\n  Mr. President, as I said at the beginning of my speech, I am \nastonished that I am standing on the Senate floor having to debate this \nissue. This is a sad day for the taxpayers and even a sadder day for \nour troops.\n  I strongly hope the conferees will reconsider this disastrous \nproposal and not bring the DOD authorization bill to the floor until it \nis resolved.\n  I also wish to commend my colleagues, Senator Roth and Senator Pryor, \nfor their staunch support for this office, both at its creation, and \nespecially now. Their eloquent speeches on this floor earlier today \nspeak to their leadership on this issue. And I would like to add my \nsupport to their effort to give our troops the very best equipment for \ntheir safety.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Democrats \nwill not let us get beyond the motion to proceed on Senate Joint \nResolution 31, the proposed constitutional amendment to grant power to \nthe Congress and the States, the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States. This is an important \nissue which should be submitted to the American people in the form of a \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, today we begin consideration of Senate Joint \nResolution 31, a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing the \nCongress and the States to prohibit the physical desecration of the \nAmerican flag. I am pleased \n\n[[Page S 18060]]\nto be an original cosponsor of this proposal.\n  In June of 1989, the Supreme Court issued a ruling in Texas versus \nJohnson which allows the contemptuous burning of the American flag. \nImmediately after that ruling, I drafted and introduced a proposed \nconstitutional amendment to overturn the unfortunate decision.\n  After bipartisan discussions with Members of the Senate and President \nBush, the Senate voted on a similar proposal which I cosponsored. \nDuring this time, the Supreme Court ruled in United States versus \nEichman that a Federal statute designed to protect the flag from \nphysical desecration was unconstitutional. The Texas decision had \ninvolved a State statute designed to protect the flag.\n  On June 26, 1990, the Senate voted 58-42 for the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, nine votes short of the two-thirds needed for \ncongressional approval.\n  Opponents of this proposed amendment claimed it was an infringement \non the free speech clause of the first amendment. However, the first \namendment has never been construed as protecting any and all means of \nexpressive conduct. Just as we are not allowed to falsely shout fire in \na crowded theater or obscenities on a street corner as a means of \nexpression, I firmly believe that physically desecrating the American \nflag is highly offensive conduct and should not be allowed.\n  The opponents of our proposal to protect the American flag have \nmisinterpreted its application to the right of free speech. Former \nChief Justice Warren, Justices Black and Fortas are known for their \ntenacious defense of first amendment principles. Yet, they all \nunequivocally stated that the first amendment did not protect the \nphysical desecration of the American flag. In Street versus New York, \nChief Justice Warren stated, ``I believe that the States and the \nFederal Government do have the power to protect the flag from acts of \ndesecration and disgrace.''\n  In this same case, Justice Black, who described himself as a first \namendment ``absolutist'' stated, ``It passes my belief that anything in \nthe Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of the \nAmerican flag an offense.''\n  Mr. President, the American people treasure the free speech \nprotections afforded under the first amendment and are very tolerant of \ndiffering opinions and expressions. Yet, there are certain acts of \npublic behavior which are so offensive that they fall outside the \nprotection of the first amendment. I firmly believe that flag burning \nfalls in this category and should not be protected as a form of speech. \nThe American people should be allowed to prohibit this objectionable \nand offensive conduct.\n  It is our intention with this proposed constitutional amendment to \nestablish a national policy to protect the American flag from \ncontemptuous desecration. The American people look upon the flag as our \nmost recognizable and revered symbol of democracy which has endured \nthroughout our history.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the sponsors and cosponsors of this \nproposed constitutional amendment to protect our most cherished symbol \nof democracy. By adopting this proposal, we can submit this important \nquestion to the American people to decide if they believe that the flag \nis worthy of constitutional protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator seek recognition?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first let me commend my distinguished \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for objecting to the \nmotion to proceed to the constitutional amendment on flag desecration \nuntil roughly 18 ambassadors' nominations which are being held up are \nreleased. We all, around here, do what we feel we have to do to make a \npoint. But we have extremely important ambassadorial posts going \nunfilled because of a dispute over a totally different item.\n  I suppose it is that old saw ``the wheel that squeaks the loudest \ngets greased,'' is true, and I am not criticizing the Senator from \nNorth Carolina personally. He has a right to do whatever he wants to \ndo. All I am saying is I do not believe the country's interests are \nbeing well served when someone like our distinguished former colleague, \nSenator Sasser, is prohibited from taking his post in China where we so \ndesperately need representation, at this time especially.\n  So, I hope the Senator from New Mexico will stand fast on it. I will \ndo my best to help him with it. That is one logjam that needs to be \nbroken.\n  Mr. President, what I came to the floor to speak about is the \nproposed constitutional amendment dealing with flag desecration. I have \nvoted on that a number of times since I have been in the Senate, have \nsteadfastly opposed it every time it has been offered, and I will \noppose it again today.\n  When I think of the real problems of this Nation right now, and find \nthis body dealing with this particular issue at this time, I am \nappalled. Motorola wants to build a big new facility and hire lots of \npeople. They have elected to stay in this country and not go to \nMalaysia, and the only criterion they ask is that the applicants have a \nseventh grade knowledge of math, a fifth grade knowledge of English, \nand 50 percent of the applicants cannot meet that standard. The \nPresident of IBM says they spend $3 billion a year on remedial \neducation. And you only need to look at the annual survey of high \nschool seniors' heroes in this country to understand what they are \nlearning about history, particularly the history of this country.\n  So what are we doing? We are doing two things. No. 1, we are cutting \neducation dramatically. Somewhere between 500,000 and a million \nyoungsters will not get a college education under the budget \nreconciliation bill as it now stands. Those programs are going to be \nsavaged.\n  I saw a bumper strip yesterday. I told my wife about it last night. \nShe said she had seen it years ago. It said,\n\n       I will be glad when the schools of this country and our \n     children get the money they need, and the Pentagon has to \n     hold a bake sale to buy a bomber.\n\n  I have said many times, as I did during the debate on the space \nstation, if you take the money you are putting in the space station and \nput it in education, I promise you the dividends will be 10 times \ngreater. You take the $7 billion in the defense bill in excess of what \nthe Pentagon asked for and put it in education, and I promise you your \nchances for peace are exponentially better.\n  So here we are, as the Atlanta Constitution said, with a resolution \nsearching for a problem. We are not here to deal with the real or even \nan imagined problem. Everybody here in this body knows that this is \npure, sheer politics, with four flag burnings last year, and none this \nyear. And we are going to tinker with the first amendment, with our \ncherished Bill of Rights, a document which we in good common sense have \nnot seen fit to change one letter in 206 years?\n  Where does this stuff come from? Why do people forever want to tinker \nwith the most sacred document we know next to the Holy Bible? The \npeople of the country show a great deal more common sense and respect \nfor the Constitution than the Members of Congress do. In 206 years we \nhave amended the Constitution only 27 times, 25 times when we consider \nthe passage and repeal of Prohibition.\n  Would you like to take a guess, Mr. President, at how many \nresolutions have been introduced in the Congress to amend the \nConstitution? More than 10,000. You think of it. So, thank God for the \nAmerican people in their infinite wisdom. Otherwise, we would have \n10,000 changes in the Constitution of the United States. Happily, most \npeople who offer resolutions here to amend the Constitution will issue \na press release, beat themselves on the chest about how patriotic they \nare and how representative they are of the people back home, and that \nis the last you ever hear of it.\n  At the risk of sounding slightly arrogant, the most neglected duty \nthat a legislator is to be an educator. If you are not capable of going \nbefore a town \n\n[[Page S 18061]]\nhall meeting and saying, yes, I voted against that bill and here is \nwhy, if you cannot stand for reelection and let the people decide if \nyou really represent their views and the best interests of the Nation, \nif you are not willing to let them ask, ``Does the fact that he voted \nagainst the flag amendment mean he is not patriotic?,'' then you \nshouldn't be here. Does that apply to our distinguished colleague from \nNebraska, Bob Kerrey, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, who lost a \nleg in Vietnam, who has said the revulsion we feel for somebody who \nwould desecrate our flag is all we need to protect the flag? As long as \n99.9 percent of the people of this country are repulsed and find flag \ndesecration repugnant, why do you want to change the first amendment?\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President. The Bill of Rights is the most \nimportant part of the Constitution of the United States and the first \namendment is first for a reason. That is what gives us our freedom of \nreligion, freedom of speech, and freedom of press. And, Lord knows, I \nhave trouble with that sometimes, but I wouldn't change it.\n  I will tell you what the problem is. The problem is going home and \nfacing our constituents. Who wants to go home and say, ``Yes, I voted \nagainst the defense budget?,'' knowing his next opponent will have a \n30-second spot saying he is soft on defense, or he is not patriotic? It \ntakes a little courage around here. Courage is in very short supply.\n  I know of one Senator, I will not name him, who is laying his \npolitical future on the line because he comes from a very conservative \nState, who has taken a stand against this amendment. Is that sort of \ncourage not, after all, what the American people want? When somebody \ncomes up to me on the streets of the towns and cities of my State and \nsays, ``Why don't you guys screw up your nerve and do something \ncourageous for a change?'', do you know how that translates? I will \ntell you exactly. What they are saying is, ``Why are you afraid to do \nsomething that is unpopular?'' It does not take courage to always do \nthe popular thing.\n  I do not denigrate the people of this country. But I know precisely \nhow to vote, if I do not want to catch any flak when I go home. I would \nvote for that thing in a New York minute. But I just happen to believe \nin the Constitution. I consider it the document that is the glue that \nholds the fabric of this Nation together. And every time somebody says, \nwell, I do not think you ought to spit on the flag, or burn the flag, \nor something else, I'm not ready to say, ``Let us amend the \nConstitution.'' I have said hundreds of times on the floor of this body \nin my 21 years here that when you start tinkering with the \nConstitution, I belong to the Wait Just a Minute Club.\n  Down in Arkansas in 1919 the legislature passed a law saying you \ncannot do this and that and the other to the flag. Essentially, you \ncannot show disrespect for the flag. In 1941, 6 months before Pearl \nHarbor, old Joe Johnson, who lived out in Saint Joe up in the Ozark \nMountains, ran afoul of that law. I guess Saint Joe has maybe 300 \npeople. The county seat was Marshall, AR. The woman who dispensed \ncommodities to poor people at the courthouse had heard that there were \na bunch of those Jehovah's Witnesses out at Saint Joe. Not only did \nthey not believe like most good Christians, the Bible and their \nreligious training was more important to them than the flag of the \nUnited States. Joe had a wife and eight children. And he goes into \nMarshall as he does on the first day of each month to get his \ncommodities to feed his children.\n\n  Now, you have to understand Saint Joe in that era of 1941, you have \nto understand the unspeakable poverty the people of the mountains lived \nin. So Mrs. Who Shall Remain Nameless, even though it was 1941--I am \nsure she is long since departed--says to Joe Johnson, ``We hear you \nhave been drawing commodities for kids you ain't got.'' Joe says, \n``That's not true. I've got eight children. You're welcome to come out \nand see.'' She accepts that, and she says, ``We also understand that \nyou belong to a sect called Jehovah's Witnesses.'' He said, ``That's \ncorrect.'' ``And we understand that you Jehovah's Witnesses don't \nrespect our flag. And if you are going to draw commodities, I want you \nto stand up there and salute that flag.'' Joe says, ``I ain't going to \ndo it. The Bible tells me that I don't salute any earthly thing except \nthe Bible. That's my religious teaching.''\n  There were quite a few people in that office, and Joe went ahead to \nmake a speech. And during the course of his speech somebody testified \nat his trial that he had touched the flag. That was enough to find him \nguilty of disrespecting Old Glory. So they fined Joe $50 and gave him \n24 hours in jail. Then Joe took it to the Arkansas Supreme Court, and \nwhile it was on appeal, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. So Joe's \nconviction was upheld on a vote of 6 to 1.\n  I remember well the Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court--his \nson was a very dear friend of mine--dissented. He dissented, saying you \ncannot have a law like this. You cannot say that Joe has to choose a \nflag over his religion. He cited Oliver Wendell Holmes that the country \nmust fight every effort to check the expression of loathsome opinions, \nunless they so threaten the country they had to be stopped to save it.\n  ``The fact remains,'' Justice Smith wrote, ``that we're engaged in a \nwar not only of men, machines and materials but in a contest wherein \nliberty may be lost if we succumb to the ideologies of those who \nenforce obedience through fear and who would write loyalty with a \nbayonet. If ignorance were a legal crime, this judgment would be \njust,'' he said. ``The suspicions and hatreds of Salem have ceased. \nNeighbor no longer inveighs against neighbor through the fear of the \nevil eye.''\n  And the writer of this column says, ``The reasons for the misguided \nfears of 1942 are gone, but ignorance and intolerance are still with \nus.''\n  I do not know what happened to me last night. I woke up at 2 o'clock, \nand I could not go back to sleep. I could see it was a futile thing to \ntry, so I went downstairs where there were three small books I had \nchecked out of the Library of Congress on the Salem witchcraft trials \nand on witchcraft in general. I read until 4:30, and I am tired right \nnow because I did not get enough sleep last night.\n  I started reading through the charges that used to be leveled long \nbefore Salem, back in the Middle Ages, and one thing I had not really \nthought about is that witchcraft trials were sexist. It was always the \nwoman who was the witch. And a woman who lived to be 60 are 70 years \nold, might develop a haggard look. As we crossword puzzle junkies would \nsay, she was a ``crone,'' and so the first thing you know, anybody who \ndeveloped that sort of look was called a witch, riding a broom across \nthe skies, if a child had a seizure in the community, she was very \nlikely to be the first one accused of being a witch. In this little \ncommunity of Salem Village in Massachusetts, in a 2-month period, 134 \npeople are accused of being witches.\n  One of the books I was looking at last night had transcripts of the \ntrial, believe it or not. Thirty-two were convicted, 19 either burned \nat the stake or hung. On what grounds? The testimony of 10-, 12-, 13-\nyear-old children. We have not had witchcraft trials in this country \nsince. This comes close.\n  I revere the flag. When I first came to the Senate, I went up in the \nNortheastern part of the country to one of the most prestigious \nuniversities in the country, and the rostrum was full. I guess they \nwanted to see what a new moderate Senator from the South looked like. \nThe emcee got up and said, ``Let's all stand and say the Pledge of \nAllegiance.'' I would say that at least half of those kids refused to \nstand.\n  I was pretty shocked, Mr. President. But I got to reflecting on how I \nfirst went off to college and how anxious I was to prove my \nindependence. My father and mother could not tell me what to do any \nmore. If I did not want to get up and say the Pledge of Allegiance, \nthat was my privilege.\n  I was insulted by it, and I did not like it. But I did not see \nanybody there I wanted to send to prison. Is that a legal crime? Why, \nof course, it is not. But I can tell you, I was offended by that, as I \nwould be if somebody had walked out in front and spit on the flag.\n  Is this desecration anyway? Desecration comes from the Latin root, I \nguess, which means sacred. \n\n[[Page S 18062]]\n\n  So what is sacred? To some people the Bible is the only thing that is \nsacred. It was the only thing that was sacred to Joe Johnson. So people \nwill come in here who do not any more believe in this amendment than a \ngoon. And I hate to say this. There are a lot of Senators who will take \nyou aside and deplore this amendment, and they will vote ``aye'' \nbecause they do not want to have to go home and talk to their \nconstituents.\n  That is the risk you take. When I voted for the Panama Canal \ntreaties, I was getting 3,000 calls a day against my position, and it \nhas cost me dearly ever since. I do not mind telling you, if I had had \na tough opponent in 1980, I would have probably been defeated. It was a \nvery volatile issue. My pollster said in 1992 I still lost 3 percent of \nthe vote because I voted for the Panama Canal treaties. It would have \nbeen so nice to have said no to that treaty.\n  I am not saying that history has vindicated that vote, but I will say \nthis: I think Panama would be in absolute chaos right now if we had not \ndone it. But there was also something called the Golden Rule involved \nin my vote on that.\n  So around here we vote for the flag amendment, we vote for an \namendment to require prayer in school. I have noticed the Republicans, \nwho thought term limits was the greatest thing since night baseball, \nthey do not much like it anymore. I knew if they ever got control, term \nlimits would die a fast death.\n  The line-item veto: I have never been for it; I will never be for it. \nWe finally got it this year. What happens? Bill Clinton is in the White \nHouse, so we cannot even get the conferees appointed. Boy, if there \never was a time I might support the line-item veto, it would be right \nnow. But I am not going to support it. I never have and I never will, \nbecause it is a bad idea. The Republicans do not like it either when \nBill Clinton is in the White House.\n  Everybody runs on family values. Who wants to face a 30-second spot \nsaying, ``He says he's for family values, but look how he voted on \nprayer in school, look how he voted on this, look how he voted on \nthat.'' Everybody around here jumps under their desk every time one of \nthese controversial issues comes up. Who wants to say, ``I'm not for \nthat new star wars program''? And people come by and say, ``He doesn't \neven want to defend the people of this country against a missile \nattack.'' Oh, would that that were all there is to the issue.\n  Mr. President, if this amendment were adopted and we chose for the \nfirst time in 206 years to, in my opinion, sully the Constitution of \nthe United States and the most sacred part of the Bill of Rights, it \nwould not increase my patriotism any. I would not get goose bumps any \nmore than I did at the Kennedy Center Sunday night. This magnificent \norchestra played ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' I cannot stand the way I \nhear it sung most of the time. I am an old band man and marine, and I \nlove the way the Marine Band plays ``The Star Spangled Banner.'' I wish \neverybody would play it that way and sing it that way.\n  At the Kennedy Center, this orchestra played ``The Star Spangled \nBanner,'' and one of the honorees was Marilyn Horne. There were a lot \nof other opera singers there, and they sang ``The Star Spangled \nBanner,'' and it just took the roof off. I promise you, all the people \nthere had goose bumps. It was exhilarating and thrilling and exciting.\n  So if you had this flag amendment, do you think people there would \nhave gotten any more goose bumps? You know what we do when we adopt \nthis? We take a freedom away from people and create a class of \npolitical prisoners. We will imprison people.\n  You know what the amendment says. The amendment says the States and \nCongress may prohibit desecration of the flag. They will determine what \ndesecration is. One State will charge you with a $15 misdemeanor fine; \nanother State will give you the death penalty; another State pins a \nmedal on you for it. What kind of nonsense are we into here? Every \nState would decide for itself a constitutional issue: what constitutes \ndesecration of the flag?\n  Coming back from Arkansas last weekend, I counted three people, two \nmen and a woman, whose shirts were made out of the American flag. What \nare you going to do with them, Mr. President? Are you going to haul \nthem off like Joe Johnson, put them in jail? Well, maybe one State says \nyou put them in jail, another State says you cannot do that. You go \ninto a bar and you get a drink and there is a swizzle stick to mix your \ndrink with a flag on the end of it. What are you going to do with that \nbartender, the owner of that bar? On the Fourth of July, the entire \nfront page of the paper is the American flag, every one of them going \ninto the trash before sundown. What are you going to do about that, Mr. \nPresident?\n  How about the used-car lot that has an American flag sticking up on \nevery antenna? Do you ever suspect for a moment, Mr. President, that \nthese car lots with these massive displays of flags are designed to \nconvince you that the owner of that place is a patriot? Some people \nwould see it as the opposite: commercialization of the flag.\n  While we are covering desecration, why do we not also cover \ncommercialization of the flag or using the flag for commercial \npurposes? And then, what is physical desecration? Does that mean you \nhave to spit on it, tear it, burn it? What is physical desecration?\n  I tell you what it is, Mr. President. It is whatever each one of the \n50 States say it is. You will have 50 different definitions of what \nused to be a precious, protected freedom of political speech in the \nConstitution of the United States, and then Congress will also weigh in \nso you will have 51.\n  We already have protection of the flag. The Supreme Court has already \nsaid fighting words, acts calculated to create a violence can be \nconsidered to be illegal.\n  Mr. President, let me ask you, what kind of company are we going to \nbe in? I have two grandchildren. And like we did with our own children, \nBetty and I put them on our laps, and we go through Highlights looking \nfor hidden pictures, all those other little games. One of the \nHighlights games is always, ``What is out of place in this picture?'' \nIt will have 8 or 10 things. One obviously does not fit, it is out of \nplace, out of character.\n  Here is a chart. And taken from Highlights magazine is ``One of these \nthings is not like the others.'' Look at it. I ask you, which one is \nnot like the others? Here you have Germany which in 1932 passed a law \nsaying:\n\n       Whoever publicly profanes the Reich or one of the states \n     incorporated into it, its constitution, colors or flag or the \n     German Armed Forces, or maliciously and with premeditation \n     exposes them to contempt, shall be punished by imprisonment. \n     Nazi Germany. You cannot say anything about it, you cannot \n     talk about it, you cannot desecrate the flag, the \n     constitution or much of anything else.\n\n  The Soviet Union, 2 years in the gulag. The Soviet Union, 2 years in \nthe gulag for desecration of the flag.\n  China, 3 years.\n  Iraq, 7 years.\n  And not to be outdone, Iran, 10 years.\n  South Africa, 5 years and a fine during apartheid.\n  Cuba, old Fidel is not as tough as these other guys; only 3 months \nand a fine in Cuba.\n  Syria, 6 years.\n  There they all are. And in the center is Old Glory. Is this the crowd \nwe want to join? We are going to wind up giving up a lot more freedom \nthan we are going to get.\n  Mr. President, I have been amazed at where a lot of conservative \nwriters are on this issue. Charles Krauthammer--I do not read him. I do \nnot care for his articles, and I never read him. He thinks this is pap \nnonsense.\n  George Will, Cal Thomas, and other conservatives.\n  Senator Mitch McConnell, from Kentucky, had a column in yesterday's \nPost, and I thought it was absolutely superb. He quoted a veteran, a \nman named Jim Warner, an American patriot who fought in Vietnam and \nsurvived more than 5 years of torture and brutality as a prisoner of \nthe North Vietnamese. Here is what he said:\n\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America, and they're afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom. Spread \n     freedom.\n\n  When a flag in Dallas was burned to protest the nomination of Ronald \nReagan, he told us how to spread the idea of freedom when he said:\n\n       We should turn America into a city shining on the hill, a \n     light to all nations. Don't be \n\n[[Page S 18063]]\n     afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  You do not hear me quote Ronald Reagan very often, but that was \nbeautiful.\n  And finally, to quote our old friend Will Rogers, and I will close \nwith this:\n\n       When Congress gets the Constitution all fixed up, they're \n     going to start on the Ten Commandments, just as soon as they \n     can find somebody in Washington that's read them.\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nsupport of Senate Joint Resolution 31. I did not come to the floor to \ncite case law or precedent or to dispute the predictions and the \npronouncements of the constitutional scholars. I will leave that to the \nlawyers in this Chamber. But I came here to tell you what I believe in \nmy heart as an average American, the son of a veteran, the kind of \nperson who puts his hand across his chest during the national anthem \nand gets a lump in his throat during parades when the Stars and Stripes \ngo by.\n  What is it about this multicolored piece of cloth that inspires such \nemotion? Perhaps it is the high price this Nation has paid for the \nhonor of flying it.\n  Fifty-three thousand Americans gave their lives defending this piece \nof cloth in World War I; 292,000 Americans in the Second World War; \n33,000 Americans in Korea; 47,000 Americans in Vietnam; most recently, \n138 Americans gave their lives defending this piece of cloth in the \nPersian Gulf war.\n  And when the bodies of those defenders of freedom were returned home, \nit was this piece of cloth atop their caskets that caught and cradled \nthe tears of their loved ones.\n  In my heart, I know that the men and women who sacrificed everything \nthey had to give on behalf of this flag and the ideals it represents \nwould be heartsick to see it spit upon, trampled over, burned, \ndesecrated.\n  This is so much more than just another piece of cloth.\n  Mr. President, in a nation like ours that celebrates diversity, there \nis little that ties us together as a people. We come from different \nnationalities. We practice different religions. We belong to different \nraces. We live in different corners of this immense Nation, speak \ndifferent languages, eat different foods. There is so much that should \nseemingly divide us. But under this flag, we are united.\n  Far from being just a piece of cloth, the flag of the United States \nof America is a true, national treasure. Because of everything it \nsymbolizes, we have always held our flag with the greatest esteem, with \nreverence. That is why we fly it so high above us. When the flag is \naloft, it stands above political division, above partisanship.\n  Under this flag, we are united. And Americans are united in calling \nfor a constitutional amendment allowing them to protect their flag.\n  When you ask them if burning the U.S. flag is an appropriate \nexpression of freedom of speech, nearly four out of every five \nAmericans say no, it is not. In my home State of Minnesota, nearly 70 \npercent of my neighbors support Senate Joint Resolution 31, and have \ncalled on Congress to pass it this year.\n  Mr. President, there is no Minnesotan who has been more vocal in this \nfight than Daniel Ludwig of Red Wing, and I am so proud of his efforts. \nJust this summer, Mr. Ludwig had the great honor of being elected \nNational Commander of the American Legion during the organization's \n77th annual national convention.\n  Mr. Ludwig knows what the flag means to the soldiers and veterans of \nthe American Legion. He is a Vietnam-era veteran of the U.S. Navy who \nspent 8 years in the military, and he told me that passage of the \namendment we debate today remains the American Legion's No. 1 priority.\n  ``We are so close to victory,'' he said. ``Protecting the American \nflag from desecration can be our greatest victory.''\n  It has been too long in coming.\n  Since 1989, the year the U.S. Supreme Court struck down state laws \nbanning desecration of the flag, 49 of our 50 States have passed \nresolutions directing Congress and their State legislators to support a \nflag protection amendment.\n  Our legislation restores to the States the right snatched away from \nthem by the court to enact flag-protection laws. It does not force the \nStates into action. It does not set punishments. It says simply that \n``the Congress and the States shall have power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the flag of the United States.''\n  This amendment returns to the people the power to pass the flag-\nprotection laws they feel are appropriate for their communities.\n  Of course, there are those who are opposed to this amendment, \nindividuals who do not believe the people can be entrusted with the \nresponsibility of amending the Constitution. They think Congress should \nplay the role of protector, a guardian body that exists to save the \npeople from their own foolishness.\n  It is not something we enter into recklessly, but it is the right of \nthe people to amend their own Constitution. Our Founding Fathers were \nwise enough to understand that times and circumstances change, and a \nConstitution too rigid to bend with the times was likely to break. They \ncreated the amendment process for that very purpose. We amend the \nConstitution when circumstances tell us we must.\n  Mr. President, we need this amendment because the soul of our society \nseems to have been overtaken by the tennis-shoe theology of ``just do \nit.''\n  If it feels good, just do it. Forget about obligation to society. \nForget about personal responsibility. Forget about duty, honor, \ncountry. ``If it feels good, just do it,'' they say.\n  If it makes you feel good to burn a flag, just do it. After all, it \nis just a piece of cloth.\n  Just a piece of cloth? Tell that to the men, women, and children who \neach day stand before the black granite walls of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial, tearfully tracing with their finger the name of a loved one \nchiseled deep into the stone.\n  Tell that to the veterans of the Korean war, who have come by the \nthousands to their new memorial just across the reflecting pool. They \nsee the statues of the soldiers, poised in a battle march, the horror \nof war forever frozen in the hardened steel, and they remember those \nwho did not come back.\n  Tell it to the veterans of World War I and World War II, who each \nyear don their uniforms for the annual Veteran's Day parades. Time may \nhave slowed their march and stiffened their salute, but it has not \ndiminished their passion for the flag.\n  To say that our flag is just a piece of cloth--a rag that can be \ndefiled and trampled upon and even burnt into ashes--is to dishonor \nevery soldier who ever fought to protect it. Every star, every stripe \non this flag was bought through their sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, as I walked to the Capitol this morning and saw the \nflags on either side of the great dome flapping in a gentle breeze, I \nknew I could not stand here today, cold and analytical, and pretend I \ndid not have a stake in this emotional debate.\n  It is average Americans like me who cannot understand why anyone \nwould burn a flag. It is Americans like me who cannot understand why \nthe Senate would not act decisively, overwhelmingly, to pass an \namendment affording our flag the protection it deserves.\n  I know in my heart that this simple piece of cloth is worthy of \nconstitutional protection, and I urge my colleagues to search their own \nhearts and support Senate Joint Resolution 31.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. THOMPSON). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18059-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18063-S18071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOUSING FOR OLDER PERSONS ACT\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \n\n[[Page S 18064]]\n  now turn to consideration of Calendar No. 231, H.R. 660.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 660) to amend the Fair Housing Act to modify \n     the exemption from certain familial status discrimination \n     prohibitions granted to housing for older persons.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from Committee on the Judiciary, with an \namendment to strike all after the enacting clause and inserting in lieu \nthereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Housing for Older Persons \n     Act of 1995''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF HOUSING FOR OLDER PERSONS.\n\n       Section 807(b)(2)(C) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. \n     3607(b)(2)(C) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(C) intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 \n     years of age or older, and--\n       ``(i) at least 80 percent of the occupied units are \n     occupied by at least one person who is 55 years of age or \n     older;\n       ``(ii) the housing facility or community publishes and \n     adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the \n     intent required under this subparagraph; and\n       ``(iii) the housing facility or community complies with \n     rules issued by the Secretary for verification of occupancy, \n     which shall--\n       ``(I) provide for verification by reliable surveys and \n     affidavits; and\n       ``(II) include examples of the types of policies and \n     procedures relevant to a determination of compliance with the \n     requirement of clause (ii). Such surveys and affidavits shall \n     be admissible in administrative and judicial proceedings for \n     the purposes of such verification.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. GOOD FAITH ATTEMPT AT COMPLIANCE; DEFENSE AGAINST \n                   CIVIL MONEY DAMAGES.\n\n       Section 807(b) of the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3607(b)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5)(A) A person shall not be held personally liable for \n     monetary damages for a violation of this title if such person \n     reasonably relied, in good faith, on the application of the \n     exemption under this subsection relating to housing for older \n     persons.\n       ``(B) For the purposes of this paragraph, a person may only \n     show good faith reliance on the application of the exemption \n     by showing that--\n       ``(i) such person has no actual knowledge that the facility \n     or community is not, or will not be, eligible for such \n     exemption; and\n       ``(ii) the facility or community has stated formally, in \n     writing, that the facility or community complies with the \n     requirements for such exemption.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. I further ask unanimous consent the bill be considered \nunder the following limitation: 1 hour for debate on the bill to be \nequally divided between Senator Brown and Senator Biden, that no \namendments be in order to the bill with the exception of one amendment, \nand that following the expiration or yielding back of debate time, the \ncommittee amendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill with no intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, for clarification, I ought to note the \namendment that is referenced is the committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the Civil Rights Act of 1968 was passed \nspecifically to prohibit discrimination on the basis of race. Title \nVIII of the act was the Fair Housing Act. It prohibited discrimination \non the basis of ``race, color, religion or national origin'' for any \nsale of housing, rental of housing, financing of housing, or provision \nof brokerage services.\n  The housing practices in which discrimination is prohibited include \nthe following: Sale or rental of a dwelling, provision of services or \nfacilities in connection with a sale or rental of a dwelling, steering \nany person to or away from a dwelling, misrepresenting availability of \ndwellings, discriminatory advertisements, and charging different fees \nprovided and different benefits.\n  The 1974 Fair Housing Act, or title VIII of the Civil Rights Act, was \namended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex. In 1988, the \nFair Housing Act was amended again to prohibit discrimination on the \nbasis of being handicapped or familial status, which means living with \nchildren under 18. That is, the 1988 Fair Housing Act prohibition of \ndiscrimination on the basis of living with children under 18 included \nan exemption ``for housing for older persons.'' In other words, H.R. \n660, which enables housing for older persons, is not a new idea. This \ndebate is really about refining the original one.\n  To meet the definition for housing for older persons under current \nlaw, the housing must be intended for occupancy by persons 55 years or \nolder, where there are ``significant facilities and services'' designed \nto meet the physical or social needs of older persons.\n  Interpreting and implementing the ``significant facilities and \nservices'' standard has been very troublesome. In other words, it has \nbeen a pain in the neck because it has been vague, it has been \ndifficult, it has spawned litigation and created confusion. For the \nlast 7 years, it has been unclear what ``significant facilities and \nservices'' means. There have been so many lawsuits that the exemption \nCongress intended is fast being revoked in fact.\n  Mr. President, the way bureaucrats have administered this provision \nwould make the people who came up with the Mississippi literacy test \nproud. It acts as a bar to the reasonable provisions of the law that \nwere intended to make housing available for families with children \nwhile continuing to allow housing for older persons. The fact is, some \nolder people do prefer not to have the noise and the trauma that go \nalong with having children. Frankly, families with children sometimes \nprefer not to have the complaints about their activity as well.\n\n  H.R. 660 is intended to clear up this problem. It is intended to make \nthe law clear and workable, and to stabilize the original exemption \nCongress created for senior housing.\n  In other words, what we are dealing with here is making the law \nclearer and more workable for seniors. This bill aims to protect \nseniors so that they can, if they wish to, move into housing where they \nare protected in their safety and their privacy.\n  H.R. 660 will clarify the law and put in place a bright line test for \nsenior housing. The test is: First, the housing is intended and \noperated for seniors; second, there is an actual 80 percent occupancy \nrate of the occupied units; third, the intent is manifested by \npublished policies of the housing community; and fourth, the housing \ncommunity complies with HUD rules. If that is met, then senior housing \nis safe from lawsuit.\n  This revision, this clarification, passed in the House of \nRepresentatives 424 to 5. It was overwhelming. It is the least we can \ndo to give senior citizens the help they both desire and merit. \nFrankly, this kind of abuse that senior citizens have been subject to \nfrom the bureaucracy with regulations ought to end. We ought to have \nrules that a reasonable person can understand and deal with. What we \nhave been subjected to in the existing regulations that have come down \nis flatly an effort to thwart the will of Congress, not an effort to \ndeal reasonably with the problem.\n  The reality is, we would not have this bill before us today if we had \nnot had some Federal regulators that had simply tried to thwart the \noriginal intent of Congress. We would not have this bill before us if \nthe bureaucrats had simply tried to deal with this problem in a way \nthat was less cumbersome and less difficult.\n  I should point out that not only is this bill something that passed \nthe House by 424 to 5, but reasonable efforts have been made in this \nChamber to modify the bill to further obtain consensus. We have \naccepted suggestions made by Senator Simon and others which address \ntheir concerns. What comes out of committee and what is available for \nthe Senate to consider, therefore, is a bill that I think Members will \nbe comfortable in voting for and will feel they can report to their \nconstituents: We have cleaned up the law, we have clarified the law, we \nhave ended some unnecessary and unreasonable regulatory burdens and \ngiven a reasonable, clear definition to protect the interests of senior \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time of the \nquorum call be charged equally to myself and the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. \n  \n[[Page S 18065]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on H.R. 660.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time under the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the point of this bill is to deal with a \nproblem in seniors housing communities that is created up by the \nludicrous HUD regulations which this Congress directed but which had \nearlier been rejected and the new ones which I think strain the \nimagination.\n  The problem that the seniors housing exemption could only be allowed \nfor facilities that were designed for the very wealthy. So we have a \ncircumstance where, if you followed the existing HUD regulations, the \nrich could enjoy the exemption but the normal seniors could not.\n  Let me, for those Members who find that hard to believe--and I must \nsay I find it hard to believe--mention some of the standards that HUD \nput forward in regulations that they suggested seniors must have in \norder to qualify for the exemption:\n  T'ai chi classes, swim therapy, macrame classes, fashion shows, \nregularly offered CPR classes, and vacation house watch.\n  How many normal seniors do you know who have a need for that?\n  Pet therapy services.\n  Are these things that you ought to have in a program to qualify for a \nnormal exemption?\n  Ping-pong, pool table, shuffleboard, horseshoe pits, golf courses.\n  These are things the average senior would find extravagant.\n  Lawyers' offices, lifeguards, swimming or water aerobic instructors, \ndance and exercise instructors, craft instructors.\n  I mention these because they are in the HUD guidelines. I mention \nthem also to make this point: HUD designed guidelines that, for the \nnormal seniors in this country, became exorbitantly expensive, and it \nwas part of an effort by HUD, I believe, to simply do away with the \nseniors exemption that would extend this housing privilege to normal \nseniors in this country.\n  At this point, I yield 8 minutes of my time to the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I certainly have been privileged to work with the \nSenator from Colorado in supporting this very important piece of \nlegislation and would like to reiterate at the very outset precisely \nwhat we do here and why. This bill, as the Senator from Colorado has \nnoted, eliminates many of the problems that senior communities have \nexperienced over the last decade, and I think everyone recognizes that \nmy State of Arizona was really a pioneer in the creation of these \nsenior communities. They know who they are, and they do not need the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development designing a set of criteria \nsuch that the Senator from Colorado has just provided us with to define \nthem as a senior community.\n  Believe me, if you go to Arizona and you are in one of these \ncommunities, you are fully aware that that is where you are. But under \ncurrent law, these communities must follow these HUD guidelines or \nregulations in order to qualify for the exemption. The bill repeals \nthis so-called significant facilities requirement, simplifying the \nprocess by which legitimate seniors-only facilities will gain the \nexemption.\n  To obtain the exemption, the bill only requires that 80 percent of \nthe households in a community have in residence at least one person \nover the age of 55. That is the requirement.\n  If the community publicly states and can prove that 80 percent of its \nunits have one or more occupants age 55 or older, then it would pass \nthe adults-only housing test and qualify for an exemption from the Fair \nHousing Act's antifamily discrimination rule even if it lacked the \nsignificant facilities as defined by HUD.\n  In addition, to reduce abusive litigation, the bill allows that \nrealtors and developers may show good-faith reliance on the seniors-\nonly exemption if such person has no actual knowledge that the facility \nor community is not or will not be eligible for such an exemption, and \nthe facility or community has stated formally in writing that the \nfacility or community complies with the requirement for such exemption.\n  Now, who supports this legislation? Fortunately, just about \neverybody. I have received literally hundreds of letters of support \nfrom seniors living in these communities. Many of the community \ncoordinators have expressed support to us. Due to HUD's stringent \n``significant facilities'' regulations, it is the fact that a few of \nthese communities have actually lost their seniors exemption.\n  Constituents from Mesa, Tucson, Golden Valley, Green Valley, \nScottsdale, Sun City, Yuma, Dreamland Villa Community, and Phoenix have \nall communicated with me. Groups like the Arizona Association of \nManufactured Homeowners and their 25,000 homeowners, Adult Action of \nArizona and their 42,000 homeowners, Fountain of the Sun Homeowners, \nArizona Manufactured Housing Institute, Sun Lakes Homeowners, Yuma East \nOwners Association, Ellenburg Capital Corp., and Fountains Retirement \nProperties, these and others have contacted me in support of this.\n  Real estate agents--the National Association of Realtors--and housing \ndevelopment firms all favor this bill. AARP has written a letter to the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Hatch.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of the AARP in support of \nthis legislation be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Many of these constituents argue that the rule defining \n``significant facilities and services'' increases the costs to their \nhousing and tells them how to live. And that is the objection I think \nin addition to the complexity of complying with these HUD regulations.\n  These individuals have complained that some senior housing complexes \nare being hit with unfair discrimination lawsuits because of confusion \nabout which housing qualifies for the exemption from the \nantidiscrimination housing statute.\n  Why is this bill important?\n  Although the ``significant facilities and services'' provision was \nwell intended--it was designed to protect families with children from \ndiscrimination in housing, which we all support, of course--the \nexemption has made the lives of seniors unnecessarily difficult.\n  Fewer regulations and restrictions would allow senior communities to \noperate more efficiently and freely. Is it too much to ask that the \nseniors of our country be allowed to live without intrusion into their \nlives by the Federal Government?\n\n  Most senior citizens I know are independent and highly capable. They \ndo not want to pay extra to have somebody read to them. They do not \nwant or need to be told by the Federal Government how often they have \nto have bingo made available to them in their housing complex.\n  By increasing the price of rent in senior facilities, these \nregulations in effect discriminate against low-income seniors, as the \nSenator from Colorado has pointed out.\n  There is one other thing that I would like to say because there is an \nargument that the Housing and Urban Development Department recognized \nthe problems with its regulations and therefore sought to relieve some \nof the burden by revising and imposing a new set of regulations.\n  I almost did not use the word ``imposing,'' but that is what it is. \nAnd I think the point of this legislation is to \n\n[[Page S 18066]]\nsay, ``Nice try, but you still have not solved the problem.''\n  This most recent rule of HUD revising the ``significant facilities \nand services'' regulation really does not answer the problem.\n  One of my constituents, Susan Brenton, for the 25,000 Member Arizona \nAssociation of Manufactured Homeowners Group, stated, ``The new rule is \nstill very nebulous and leaves a lot of areas open to court decisions \nand each court case costs the residents of the community thousands of \ndollars.''\n  The new regulations state that communities that provide at least 2 \nservices each from 5 of 12 categories all defined by HUD qualify for \nthe exemption. But these services are really quite frivolous, and they \nraise the costs to residents. This is what the Senator from Colorado \nwas just quoting from, Mr. President.\n  These so-called easier regulations are really at the end of the day \nnot much of an improvement. HUD's attempt at revising its statistics \nhave only trivialized what qualifies as a ``significant service.'' \nClearly, HUD needs some help in fixing the problem that it fully \nacknowledges exists--regulatory overreach in senior housing--but we \nthink the way to solve the problem is to eliminate the ``significant \nfacilities and services'' requirement altogether, and that is what H.R. \n660 does.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this legislation has received not only \nwide support from States like mine which have a lot of senior \ncommunities, but as you know, it has wide support around the country. \nIt has significant support in the Senate. It passed out of our \nJudiciary Committee with virtual unanimity, and I am sure it will be \nadopted by this body in very short order, again, with virtual \nunanimity.\n  What we will be saying to the senior communities of our country is \nthat we heard you when you let us know that these regulations were too \ncostly, too burdensome and really in a sense too frivolous, and \ntherefore the Congress is not incapable of acting to correct a problem \nlike this in order to make your lives a little easier. That is what we \nwill have done when we pass this important legislation.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from the State of Colorado for bringing \nthe legislation forth and for getting it to the floor so that we can \nsee this job through and get it done before the end of the year.\n  I thank the Chair very much and reserve the remainder of whatever \ntime I did not use.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 23, 1995.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Senate Dirksen Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to express our \n     continuing support for the Housing for Older Persons Act of \n     1995 (H.R. 660) and to urge its immediate consideration and \n     passage.\n       AARP believes that age-specific housing should be preserved \n     as an important service to many older persons. Congress \n     recognized at the time the Fair Housing Amendments Act was \n     passed that the standards established to meet the statute's \n     exemption for housing for older persons would have to be \n     clear, workable, and flexible enough to be applicable to the \n     wide array of housing, residents, and abilities to pay in the \n     elderly housing market. Unfortunately, promulgating and \n     enforcing clear and workable standards has proven to be \n     nearly impossible. Efforts to clarify the statute's \n     requirement of ``significant facilities and services'' have \n     been undertaken in three rulemakings under two \n     Administrations.\n       While AARP applauds HUD's most recently issued rule--a \n     significant improvement over its proposed rule of July 1994--\n     the Association has come to the conclusion that the complex \n     and seemingly contradictory statutory provisions defining \n     housing for older persons have made equitable enforcement \n     very difficult, if not impossible. Our Legal Counsel for the \n     Elderly office was unable to find any successful defense of a \n     claim of exemption for housing for older persons among cases \n     receiving judicial review. When coupled with significant \n     anecdotal evidence of rather arbitrary decisions by fair \n     housing investigators, the conclusion is inescapable that \n     implementation of the law has not been consistent with the \n     flexibility intended by Congress. Indeed, widespread \n     dissatisfaction with the statute's enforcement threatens the \n     very viability of the important new protections provided in \n     the Act.\n       AARP appreciates the leadership of your Committee and the \n     work of Senators Gorton and Kyl in addressing this issue. If \n     we can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to have your staff contact Don Redfoot of our Federal Affairs \n     staff at 434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Martin Corry,\n                                        Director, Federal Affairs.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 660, the Housing \nfor Older Persons Act of 1995. This legislation recognizes that elderly \nhousing is special housing for seniors, that the elderly are a special \npopulation that deserve to live in housing reserved for the elderly, \nand that this legislation does not constitute discrimination against \nfamilies.\n  HUD recently published regulations to clarify what constitutes \nelderly housing. HUD published these regulations because the Congress \nin the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 required HUD to \nclarify what constitutes elderly housing. I remind my colleagues that \nHUD has failed for years to provide the proper guidance and leadership \non what constitutes elderly housing, despite confusion and costly \nlitigation over this issue. Moreover, the new HUD regulations remain \nsorely lacking. It is time that we provide clear guidance on what \nconstitutes elderly housing and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n660.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 660, \nthe Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995. The main thrust of this \nlegislation is to remove the requirement for significant facilities at \n55-and-over communities.\n  This has been a major issue in California, particularly in the Inland \nEmpire area including Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, which have \ntraditionally been retirement communities catering to all income levels \nof seniors--from low-income mobile home parks to lavishly planned, full \nservice retirement communities. One only has to drive along Interstate \n10, from Los Angeles to Phoenix, to see the many billboards advertising \nthese retirement communities.\n  Previously, these 55-and-over communities have been known as adults \nonly communities. However, during consideration of the Fair Housing \nAmendments of 1988, in an attempt to combat discrimination against \nfamilies with children, adults only communities were called into \nquestion.\n  In turn, Congress decided to preserve adults only communities, which \npreviously housed seniors, with the new designation of ``55-and-over.'' \nOne of the requirements for this designation was that communities must \nhave ``significant facilities'' in order to qualify. The Department of \nHousing and Urban Development did not develop rules for ``significant \nfacilities,'' however, until 1991. Unfortunately, these rules proved to \nbe very controversial and resulted in several expensive law suits being \nbrought by HUD against the very communities Congress had intended to \nprotect.\n  The most controversial point had to do with the definition and \ndiffering interpretations by the courts and HUD as to what constituted \n``significant facilities.'' Did it mean that there had to be a 24-hour, \non-site medical facility, for example, or, could shuffleboard or other \nplanned activities suffice?\n  Last year, due partially to concerns expressed by my office, former \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development Assistant Secretary for \nFair Housing and Equal Opportunity Roberta Achtenberg conducted \nhearings around the country, including one in San Bernardino County. \nFrom what I understand, communities were pleased with the outcomes of \nthe hearings, and eventually, HUD developed new rules which lessened \nthe definition of ``significant facilities.''\n  Still, cities have been anxious for Congress to adopt H.R. 660, to \npermanently eliminate the ``significant facilities'' requirement. Take \nfor example, in my state of California, the city of Hemet.\n  In the city of Hemet, 50 percent of its housing is 55-and-over \ncommunities. Removing the seniors-only status and requiring these \ncommunities to absorb families with children will result in a dramatic \nshortage of classroom space, and the tax-base. Demographics are such \nthat the financing of new school construction, in a city that was \nplanned as a retirement community, would not be possible.\n  Adoption of H.R. 660 will preserve existing 55-and-over communities, \nand will clarify, once and for all, congressional intent with respect \nto protecting senior housing in retirement communities. \n\n[[Page S 18067]]\n\n  Although discrimination against families with children should not be \ntolerated, when a community has been planned specifically as a \nretirement community, and at least 80 percent of its residences house \nsenior citizens, as this bill requires, then I believe those \ncommunities should have a right to be preserved as senior housing.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I strongly support H.R. 660. This \nlegislation will eliminate many of the problems that senior communities \nhave faced over the last several years, particularly from HUD's \nexcessive rules interpreting the Fair Housing Act.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, this is not the only problem that \narises from interpretations of the Fair Housing Act. In August of this \nyear, I introduced legislation, S. 1132, to address two significant \nproblems.\n  First, S. 1132, would prevent HUD from investigating and even suing \npeople who protest the establishment of group homes in their \ncommunities.\n  S. 1132 would also overturn a recent Supreme Court ruling in City of \nEdmonds versus Oxford House, by allowing localities to zone limits on \nthe number of unrelated persons living together if the zoning scheme is \ndesigned to preserve a single family neighborhood.\n  In that case, a home for 10 to 12 recovering drug addicts and \nalcoholics was located in a single family neighborhood. The city tried \nto have the house removed because it violated the city's local zoning \ncode that placed limits on the number of unrelated persons living \ntogether. The Supreme Court ruled that the Fair Housing Act was \nviolated by this zoning law.\n  I think the Supreme Court ruled incorrectly in this case. The \nCongress clearly intended an exemption from the Fair Housing Act \nregarding the number of unrelated occupants living together. My bill \nwould clarify that localities can continue to zone certain areas as \nsingle family neighborhoods, by limiting the number of unrelated \noccupants living together. I think families should be able to live in \nneighborhoods without the threat that certain types of group homes--\nwhich may be unsuitable for single family neighborhoods--can move in \nnext door and receive the protection of the Fair Housing Act.\n  But the most important point is this one: Decisions about zoning \nshould be made at the local level and not in Washington. If a locality \nwants to permit group homes in a certain area--it can do so without HUD \ninterfering in the decision using the Fair Housing Act as cover.\n  Mr. President, my bill would also correct the abuses of the Fair \nHousing Act by the Clinton administration. In the past 2 years, HUD has \ntaken to investigating people under the Fair Housing Act who have \nprotested group homes coming into their neighborhoods. The most well \nknown of these cases was the incident involving three residents in \nBerkeley, CA. HUD's actions were a blatant violation of their right to \nfreedom of speech. HUD's abuse was so bad that they dropped the suit \nand promised they wouldn't do it again. HUD even issued new guidelines \non the subject so it couldn't happen again.\n  But, not long ago, HUD has done it again. HUD is investigating five \nCalifornians who went to court to get a restraining order against a \ngroup home for the developmentally disabled that was planned for their \nneighborhood.\n  Mr. President, the issue is not whether the location for this group \nhome is proper, that issue can be decided by the courts. The issue is \nfreedom of speech. I believe anybody has the right to speak their mind \nand to take legal action against what they think is an injustice. HUD \nhas taken the opposite view in this debate. I think this is wrong and \nneeds to be clarified in law by amending the Fair Housing Act.\n  Mr. President, I offer strong support for H.R. 660, but would hope \nthat in the near future, the Senate would consider other changes to the \nFair Housing Act, particularly those in S. 1132. I hope that we can \nmake these reforms to the Fair Housing Act because we need to preserve \nthis act to prevent real discrimination, but we do not need to use the \nact to pursue a far, far left agenda that defies common sense, and \nsilences free speech.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today we passed a significant bill which \nwill remove the burdensome bureaucracy of the Federal Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Agency off the backs of American seniors. In this bill, \nwhich I originally introduced in the Senate during the 103d Congress, \nwe take significant steps to provide fair, safe, and independent \nhousing for Americans over the age of 55. I have received thousands of \nletters from concerned residents of ``55 and over'' communities in \nWashington.\n  Today, law provides for people over the age of 62 to be provided with \nspecial housing arrangements. The qualifications for a senior housing \ndevelopment are simple: A community for persons age 62 and older is \nrequired to have all residents age 62 or older. In 1988, Congress also \nlegislated that communities with citizens 55 or older would qualify as \n``housing for older persons,'' provided those communities met three \nrequirements: 80 percent of the housing units must be occupied by at \nleast one person age 55 or older; a community must show in its \nadvertising, rules, regulations and leases that it intends to serve \npeople over the age of 55; and the community must provide ``significant \nfacilities and services'' to its residents.\n  It's those words: ``Significant facilities and services'' which have \nproven to be so problematic. HUD tried to tell us what ``Significant \nfacilities and services'' meant--it received over 15,000 comments, all \nexpressing continued confusing and puzzlement over the Department's \nattempt at clarification. This is an area of law that is crying for \nlegislative relief. I believe, as do my constituents, that the \nDepartment's rules go too far in mandating that all ``55 and over'' \ncommunities provide expensive facilities and services and make these \nservices accessible to older persons. Clearly, Mr. President, privately \nowned and operated ``55 and over'' communities catering to low- and \nmoderate-income seniors cannot be expected to have the same facilities \nand services as federally funded housing projects.\n  Seniors of all incomes deserve protection. As noted in the Senate \nreport to H.R. 660, ``poorly drafted regulations have discouraged or \noutright denied seniors housing.'' With the overwhelming passage of \nH.R. 660, the U.S. Senate has stopped this practice. The U.S. Senate \ntook a stand on behalf of our seniors, and their right to fair, safe, \nand equitable housing.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, let me repeat what is at issue.\n  The way the HUD rules operate is that senior citizens are not allowed \nto have a community by themselves unless they had some facilities that \nwere laid out by HUD, and they were things like access to swimming \npools, accessible club house, private fishing pond, a hair salon, a \ngolf course, lawyer's office, a vacation house watch, pet therapy \nservices, tool loan services, regularly offered CPR classes, fashion \nshows, craft classes in making jewelry, a variety of classes including \nt'ai chi or swimming therapy.\n  What they came up with in the HUD rules was a flat rule that said if \nyou are not rich and cannot afford these extraordinary services, we are \nnot going to let you live together.\n  Mr. President, that is not right. Seniors in this country deserve an \nopportunity to have reasonable rules. That is what this bill does. It \nhas reasonable regulations, and it is a reasonable guideline that \nrepeals some very unreasonable regulations. It has the overwhelming \nsupport of seniors around this country, the overwhelming support of the \nHouse. And I strongly urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, we are now at a point where the proponents of the bill \nhave used much of their time. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time that is consumed in the quorum call be equally divided, \nexcept that at least 5 minutes remain usable at the end of the debate \nfor the proponents of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I wish to speak in \n\n[[Page S 18068]]\n  opposition to this bill. Is there time for me to do that? And under \nwhose control is the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 23 minutes in his own \nright.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. President, this bill, in my view, retreats from the commitment we \nmade to families with children. In 1988, Congress said that America's \nhousing providers should not be able to discriminate against families \nwith children. We did this in the face of widespread evidence that such \ndiscrimination against families with children existed.\n  We spent a lot of time on this floor--and I participated and have for \nthe years I have been here--talking about discrimination against \nminorities, talking about discrimination against the elderly, talking \nabout all forms of discrimination, as we should, as we should. But in \nmy view, we spent precious little time on this floor talking about what \nis a mounting form of discrimination, discrimination against children, \nbecause some people find them inconvenient, inconvenient to be around.\n  In 1988, Congress said that America's housing providers should not be \nable to discriminate against children as well as against blacks or \nHispanics or people based on their religion or based on their gender. \nWe took this action because we wanted to prohibit all-adult housing \ncommunities just as we had prohibited all-white housing communities in \n1968 with the passage of the Fair Housing Act in the first place.\n\n  Even as we said no discriminating against families, we also carved \nout an exception for legitimate retirement communities which catered to \nthe special needs--not just desires, needs--and requirements of the \nelderly. The distinction we made then, and which I stand by now, is \nthis: You cannot just keep children out because you do not like them, \nyou cannot just keep children out because you do not want tricycles \naround, you cannot just keep children out and families with children \nout because it is inconvenient and you do not like it.\n  If you are going to exclude children, we said, you must be an \norganized community providing ``significant facilities and services'' \ndesigned to meet the physical and social needs of the elderly. Or put \nanother way, a lot of old folks like me--I am 53 now--get together and \nsay, ``We're tired of having kids around and we're going to have this \ngated community that X percent of us are over the age of 50, and we can \nprevent someone from moving in who has kids.''\n  Well, I tell you what, I think that--and by the way, there was ample \nevidence in the hearings we held then that that is just what was being \ndone. What we were not concerned about is a community for the elderly \nwith special needs where they needed ramps, where they needed special \ndining facilities, where there was some type of extended care, where it \nwas in fact designed for elderly persons who in fact physically needed \nthis special circumstance or emotionally needed this special \ncircumstance, but not just because all of a sudden we have become \ntrendy and decided that kids are kind of in the way.\n  If we are going to exclude children, we said, you have to be an \norganized community providing significant facilities and services. This \n``significant facilities and service'' requirement was put into law \nfor, as I have said, a very good reason, put there to distinguish \nbetween true senior communities and those that just think children are \na pain in the neck. We recognized that something other than an animus \nagainst children must set these communities apart in order to meet an \nexemption from the Fair Housing Act.\n  I understand that what constitutes significant facilities and \nservices has been a matter of a great deal of controversy and \nuncertainty over the years, and I have not been satisfied, because I \nhave not believed that we set down stringent enough requirements to \nexclude--exclude--families with children.\n  Heck, there are communities who let dogs in, let people have dogs, \nbut will not let people have children. And so, significant facilities \nand services, as I indicated, have been a matter of much controversy.\n  Also understand, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has \ntaken many different stabs at the definition which has led to confusion \nand has made it difficult for those trying to comply with the law.\n  Mr. President, none of that, in my view, should lead us to abandon \nthe basic principle: If you are going to be able to discriminate \nagainst families, you should be special, you should be serving the \nspecial needs of seniors. This principle should remain our guidepost \nmore now than ever, especially since the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development has just recently promulgated completely revised \nregulations which resolve the confusion and make it much easier and \nclearer for senior housing communities to take advantage of the \nexemption.\n  The Department, many now agree, has finally gotten it right. Under \nthe new regulations, which went into effect September 18 of this year, \na housing facility can self-certify. It is amazing, we do not let many \nother folks self-certify that it falls under the Fair Housing Act \nexemption by simply filling out a straightforward, easy-to-understand \nchecklist of facilities and services designed for older folks, which, I \nadd, I do think is too lenient, not too strong. My staff does not like \nme to say that, but that is what I think. I think it should be more \nstringent, if you are a senior community meeting the exemption.\n  But the checklist contains a menu of some 114 facilities and services \nin 11 categories. If a facility provides a mere 10 of them, like \nwheelchair accessibility, communal recreation facilities, periodic \nvision or hearing tests or fellowship meetings, it qualifies as a \nsenior housing project and may exclude families with children.\n  I want to make it clear to seniors who are not happy with me about \nthis, I do not even think that is stringent enough, but at least it \nattempts to make the distinction.\n  If a facility's status is challenged, it need only show that the \ncertification was accurate at the time of the alleged violation. The \nlist of facilities and services included in the new rule was drawn from \namenities actually provided by a wide cross-section of senior housing \ndevelopments across the country, large and small, affluent and less \nwell off, manufactured housing communities, condominiums and single-\nfamily communities.\n\n  In testimony before Senator Brown's subcommittee, a representative \nfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development testified to the \nextreme flexibility and cost consciousness built into the new \nguidelines. Here is what he said, and I quote:\n\n       The rule does not assume that people living in housing for \n     older persons are frail, disabled or require nursing home \n     care. It does not require congregate dining or on-site \n     medical care. The facility and services may be provided on or \n     off the premises of the housing.\n\n  Let me add, I think it should require those things. But they may be \nprovided by staff, volunteers, including residents and neighbors, or by \nthird parties, such as civic groups or existing organizations in the \ncommunity.\n  The new regulation does not require lavish services, nor do the \nmandated facilities, affordable only by the well-heeled; rather, they \nsimply embody what is already being offered by bona fide senior \ncommunities of all sorts across the map. If a facility is providing at \nleast 10 of the 114 facilities or services on the list, it qualifies \nfor an exemption, a self-designated exemption.\n  The bill's supporters say the bill will make it easier and surer for \na housing community to determine whether it qualifies for a fair \nhousing exemption, and they are absolutely right about that. It makes \nit a lot easier. They do not have to be a senior facility. They can \njust not like kids. They can just not like kids around.\n  What kind of message are we sending to families with children, most \nof whom are breaking their necks just making it? What are we saying? We \nwant to make it easier for you to have a rationale to keep me out of \nthat community with my 14-year-old daughter?\n  I think it is outrageous--I acknowledge, I am the only one who seems \nupset about this; no one else is here to speak against it, that I am \naware of--unless they want to make it even easier and just say it is \nnot in vogue to have kids: ``If you have kids, go off and \n\n[[Page S 18069]]\nlive by yourself.'' The other folks should go off and live by \nthemselves, and if the kids want to follow, so be it. Think about it \nfor a minute.\n  Let us say that a complex contains 100 units; that all of these are \noccupied by two people; and that 80 percent are occupied by at least \none person over the age of 55. In this hypothetical community, it will \nbe able to lawfully discriminate against families with children under \nthis bill if as few as 80 residents of the 200 of them are over the age \nof 55, while 120 could be under the age of 55, and we could put up a \nsign: ``No children allowed.''\n\n  They probably all call themselves great Americans, too, by the way. \nThey all talk about how they care about families, and they may even go \nvisit their grandchildren and pat them on the head on their birthdays \nand Christmas. What does that say, if you can build a community where \n80 out of 200 people living in the community are over 55 and you can \nsay ``no kids''? If we want population control, this may be one of the \nindirect ways of going at it.\n  To my mind, the math just does not add up to fairness for families \nand children. I believe this bill will open the door to the very kind \nof discrimination we sought to outlaw in 1988, and I think it will make \nit just too easy for folks to hang a sign on the door that just says, \n``No children allowed.''\n  I cannot support this bill. I urge my colleagues not to support this \nbill. I realize that I am going to hear an awful lot from senior \ncitizens about their rights. I do not think there is anybody on this \nfloor who votes to protect the rights of seniors any more than I do, \nbut no senior, unless they have a physical or emotional problem and \nneed, has a right to tell a kid they cannot live next door. It is just \ntoo darn bad, and we are allowing it here.\n  I might add--well, I will not add anything else, because I will just \nget myself in trouble if I keep thinking about it and keep talking \nabout it. I do not think this is the right thing to do.\n  I am sure to most, because we are so busy, this is just a \nclarification of an existing piece of legislation. That is how it is \nadvertised. I respect my colleague from Colorado. He is joined in \nsupport for this by many of the strongest allies in the area of civil \nrights, many of the colleagues on this floor, my colleagues who I tried \nrally a little bit about this. They seem to think I am kind of off. One \nof them even said, ``Biden, that's because you come from a big Catholic \nfamily, you keep talking about the size of families.''\n  I do not like people who discriminate against kids. Period. I think \nit is well-intended what is being done here, but I want to tell you, if \nyou are 55 years old, ambulatory, still working, have no problem, live \nat home, have a wife or have a husband, you are hanging around the \nhouse, and you are fine and you do not have any special needs, you \nshould not be able to say a kid cannot move next door to you. Period. \nPeriod.\n\n  I just think this is wrong. I think it is dead wrong. But I am going \nto lose. I just want to make sure when my children and grandchildren \nread this, they will know their old man and their grandfather meant \nwhat he said.\n  The only important thing--the only important thing--in this whole \noutfit is kids. That is the only important thing. All the rest is \ninsignificant. And when we allow people to say, ``No kids here,'' it is \nlike we say, ``No dogs here,'' it is like we say, ``No blacks here.'' \nThat is just wrong, unless there is a real good and compelling reason \nfor it. The fact you are over 55 and 80 out of 200 people in a \ncommunity over 55, that ``ain't'' good enough for me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. I want to pay \ntribute to my very thoughtful colleague from Delaware. His comments are \nheartfelt, and I know he is very sincere. I know his concerns come from \na genuine interest in seeing that the irrationality of discrimination \ndoes not pervade our society, and that we evaluate and work with each \nother on the basis of reasonableness, thoughtfulness and caring. I want \nto pay tribute to him because I have a great deal of respect for him \nand what brings him to his position.\n  I am persuaded that this is a good bill for a couple of reasons. One, \nI believe seniors, who have reached that stage in life where they need \nto be in a safe, supportive environment, should be allowed that \nopportunity. That is what the bill does.\n  Second, Mr. President, I am persuaded that the guidelines that HUD \ncame up with are simply an attempt to make it impossible to make this \nexemption for seniors housing work, not reasonable attempts at \nregulation. After two administrations, three attempts at regulations, \nfour Congresses, specific Federal legislation directing HUD to fix \nthis, countless lawsuits, numerous hearings and policy decisions, a \nrecord number of constituent letters to agencies, the fact is that we \nought to act and make it possible for seniors to have units by \nthemselves, if they wish it.\n  Mr. President, let me make two observations. One, nobody who wants to \nbe around kids, by this measure, is precluded from being around kids. \nIt does not do that. It also ought to be noted, Mr. President, that \nwhen you have senior housing and seniors sell their home and move into \nthe senior housing, it makes available additional units to families who \nhave children. We ought to ask ourselves: where did the senior who \nmoves into a seniors community come from? Certainly they are vacating \nother housing. So the process of senior housing is one that adds units \nfor family units, not subtracts from it.\n  Last, Mr. President, I think any objective observer would look at the \nguidelines that have come out from HUD and understand they have simply \nnot served the American people. To suggest that to have senior housing \nunits, you have to have to have access to swimming pools or hair \nsalons, or access to a clubhouse, or life guards, or exercise \ninstructors, or crafts instructors, or golf courses, or a lawyer's \noffice, or polka and ballroom dancing instructors, or fashion shows, is \nsimply to recognize what they have done with these regulations. They \nhave said that you have to be rich to qualify for senior housing.\n  Mr. President, the reality is this: The majority of Americans who \nretire do not have a lot of extra money and a lot of them cannot afford \nthese things. What we have done is come up with HUD regulations that \nare reserved for the very rich, and that is silly and wrong, and it \nought to be corrected. This bill does that. This bill is about \nexpanding freedom, about giving seniors choices. I think it is a wise \nmeasure. It is why the House passed it by such an overwhelming margin.\n  A concern that has been raised about H.R. 660 is whether it requires \na seniors community to be intended for 100 percent occupancy by people \nover the age of 55. Section 807 (b)(2)(C) states that the housing is \n``intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or \nolder.'' The congressional intent of this provision is simply that the \nmain purpose behind creating the community is to provide housing for \nolder persons. Any suggestion that this requires the community to \nintend that 100 percent of the units be occupied by those 55 and older \nis a grave misconception. the true meaning behind this general \nstatement is evident in the bill's language, the legislative history, \nthe subcommittee report, and current Federal regulations.\n  This legislation will not require all units in a seniors community to \nbe intended for use by persons over the age of 55. The bill language \nmakes it obvious exactly when counting occupancy is critical. The \nbright-line standard it creates clears up any confusion in determining \nwhat constitutes seniors housing: At least 80 percent of the occupied \nunits are occupied by at least 1 person who is 55 years of age or \nolder--not 100 percent and not total units--80 percent of occupied \nunits.\n  But the general purpose of the community, as outlined by the section \nin question, is to provide housing for older persons--and the \ndefinition of what constitutes housing for older persons is that 80 \npercent of the occupied units are occupied by persons 55 years of age \nand older.\n  The language of the bill is clear on this point, and so is the \nlegislative history. In 1988, Congress extended the Fair Housing Act to \nprohibit discrimination in housing against families with children. At \nthe same time, however, Congress provided for the exemption of three \ndifferent types of seniors housing, including the one we are examining \ntoday; that is, housing ``intended or operated for occupancy by at \nleast one \n\n[[Page S 18070]]\nperson 55 years of age or older per unit.''\n  The fact that H.R. 660 does not require 100 percent occupancy for \nhousing of persons 55 and older becomes even more evident when one \ncompares this category of seniors housing with another one of the three \noriginal exemptions. The second category is ``housing intended for, and \nsolely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or older.'' Note the \nstriking difference, besides age, between these two categories: The one \nwe are concerned with today no where states that housing is to be \nsolely occupied by persons 55 years of age and older. Yet if this was \nthe congressional intent, certainly it would have been delineated in \n1988 when the three categories were first introduced.\n  The subcommittee report also promotes this interpretation. In the \nsection-by-section analysis, the provision in question is interpreted \nso that ``the housing provider can demonstrate its intent to providing \nhousing for persons 55 years or older, even if it allows persons under \nage 55 to continue to occupy dwelling units or move into the housing \nfacility and occupy dwelling units, as long as the housing facility \nmaintains the 80 percent occupancy threshold.''\n  The congressional intent voiced throughout the legislative history \nand subcommittee report is to make it easier for seniors communities to \nqualify as housing for older persons, thereby making seniors housing, \nparticularly lower income seniors housing, more affordable. Requiring \n100 percent of the units in a community, occupied or not, to be \nintended only for persons age 55 and older does not accomplish this \ngoal--in fact, it makes qualifying as seniors housing more burdensome \nand would further restrict the availability of affordable seniors \nhousing.\n  What Congress does intend is to create a 20-percent buffer zone for \nseniors communities so that they can more easily qualify, and remain \nqualified, as housing for older persons. It is easy to predict several \nsituations that could arise making this buffer zone a necessary and \nvital protection for seniors housing.\n  Suppose an elderly woman owns a condominium in a seniors housing \ncommunity. When this woman passes away, she wants to leave the home to \nher middle-aged son. Inheritance and transfer of property are \nan everyday occurrence in our democratic society, and the 20-percent \nbuffer zone outlined in H.R. 660 would accommodate such a bequest.\n\n  Or consider the widow of a senior citizen who has passed away. If the \nsurviving spouse is younger than 62 or 55, then, without H.R. 660, they \nface not losing a loved one, but also having to move out of their own \nhome. This is not the role of the Federal Government. H.R. 660 corrects \nthis.\n  The possible scenarios that affect seniors housing go even further--\nto potentially threatening the very existence of seniors communities. \nIf a seniors apartment complex has 100 rooms available but can only \nfind enough interested seniors to occupy 90 of them, this bill would \npermit the remaining 10 rooms to be occupied by families or other \npeople under age 55. Forcing the communities to leave these 10 \napartments vacant because seniors were not available could threaten the \neconomic viability of running a seniors community. H.R. 660 protects \nseniors from that risk.\n  Current Federal regulations also support the fact that housing \n``intended and operated for occupancy by persons age 55 and older'' \ndoes not mean 100 percent occupancy is required. Current regulations \nrequire similar intent as what is proposed in H.R. 660. In regard to \nhousing for persons 55 and over, it states that the owner or manager of \na seniors community must ``publish and adhere to policies and \nprocedures which demonstrate an intent to provide housing for persons \n55 years of age or older.'' Not at any time has HUD interpreted this to \nmean 100 percent occupancy by seniors. This is a general statement \nrequiring that the main purpose behind the housing facility is to \nprovide housing for seniors. No specific or numerical requirements are \nprescribed, just that the goal of their venture is to make seniors \nhousing available.\n  A specific, numerical requirement is prescribed in this bill, but you \nwon't find it before the bright-line test in section 807(b)(2)(C)(i). \nThis bright-line standard is the force of H.R. 660, replacing the \nambiguous ``significant facilities and services'' requirement that \ncurrently exists. But nothing else in this language prescribes any \noccupancy requirements beyond the bright-line standard of 80 percent \nactual occupancy.\n  Nothing in the legislative history, congressional intent, current \nCFR's, or language of this bill requires seniors communities to have \nthe intent to occupy 100 percent of their housing units with persons 55 \nyears of age and older. There is a well-thought and intentional 20 \npercent buffer zone to protect seniors communities and ensure they are \neffective, not unduly burdened, and able to provide the best services \nto our most valued citizens at the most affordable cost. The bright-\nline standard and everything surrounding this bill make that clear. Do \nnot be misguided by inaccurate and hasty fears. H.R. 660 does not \nrequire the intention of 100 percent occupancy, but rather the clear, \nunderstandable condition that to be considered housing for older \npersons, 80 percent of the occupied units must be occupied by persons \nage 55 and older.\n  Mr. President, I believe this completes all the arguments. I ask \nunanimous consent that all time be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendment to be \nproposed, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \ncommittee amendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to read the \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Brown] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3085:\n       On page 2, line 14, strike ``(c)(1) The father,'' and \n     insert the following: ``(c)(1) The father, if married to the \n     mother at the time she receives a partial-birth abortion \n     procedure,''.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, as drafted, the bill now extends the right \nto sue a physician and others involved in the partial-birth abortion \nprocess, to the father and other parties.\n  It is this Senator's belief that extending the right to sue under the \nbill to a father, who has assumed the responsibilities of fatherhood, \nis appropriate, but it is also my belief that to extend the privilege \nof standing and the potential enrichment it could convey to someone who \nhas not assumed the real responsibilities of fatherhood would be a \ntragic mistake. To allow someone a financial windfall when they have \nnot married the mother, when they have not lived up to their \nresponsibilities in our society, would send exactly the wrong message. \nIt would have the effect of granting possibly substantial financial \nremuneration to someone who has not been willing to meet his commitment \nto society or to meet the commitments of fatherhood. It would reward a \ndeadbeat dad, something I believe is simply wrong. So this amendment \nmakes it clear that someone who has not married the mother does not \nhave the right to be enriched.\n  Mr. President, I think that sums up the amendment, and I hope the \nSenate will favorably consider it after it has had an opportunity to \nconsider and dispose of the Dole and Boxer amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I just want to say to the Senator from \nColorado that we support his amendment. We think it is a good amendment \nand \n\n[[Page S 18072]]\nenhances the bill, and we are pleased to support it. I appreciate the \nfact that the Senator has offered it.\n  Mr. President, is the pending business the Smith-Dole amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3081\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Dole amendment, which is a second-\ndegree amendment to the Smith amendment, amendment 3081, I believe.\n  Mr. SMITH. I thank the Chair. That being the case, at this time I \nrise in very strong support of this pending amendment, Dole-Smith or \nSmith-Dole, life-of-the-mother exception amendment.\n  In addition, I also, in the course of my remarks, would be addressing \nanother amendment that the Senate will be considering later this \nevening, which is the Boxer amendment, Senator Boxer's partial-birth \nabortion-on-demand amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, the underlying bill, H.R. 1833, which came to us from \nthe House, bans what I have described as the brutal and inhumane \npartial-birth-abortion procedure. That is the only abortion procedure \nthat it bans. Testimony to the contrary notwithstanding, this is the \nonly abortion technique, the only abortion method that is banned under \n1833. It includes an affirmative defense exception under which a \nphysician would be subject to no penalty if that physician is able to \ndemonstrate that he or she reasonably believed that the mother's life \nwas in danger and no other medical procedure would suffice to save her \nlife.\n  Obviously, Mr. President, a two-thirds majority of the House of \nRepresentatives believed that the affirmative defense provision of H.R. \n1833 fully protected the life of the mother. It was an overwhelming \nvote in the House, and, of course, as we indicated yesterday, there \nwere pro-choice Republicans, pro-choice Democrats, and pro-life \nDemocrats and Republicans who supported overwhelmingly this \nlegislation. So in spite of the fact that it has been called extremist, \nthe truth of the matter is many people on all sides of the issue \nsupported H.R. 1833 in the House.\n  In addition, as I have noted previously, the American Medical \nAssociation's Council on Legislation voted unanimously to endorse H.R. \n1833 with the affirmative defense provision in it.\n  It is clear then, based on that decision, that the AMA Council also \nbelieved that the affirmative defense provision would fully protect any \ndoctor who performed a partial-birth abortion if it was performed to \nsave the mother's life when no other procedure was available to save \nthe mother's life, even though, as we have indicated over and over in \nthe testimony and debate in the Chamber of the Senate, we have not seen \nany witnesses who have come forth in the hearing who said that the \nmother's life was threatened. But, nevertheless, to be fair, we have \nput in this exception.\n  In spite of all that, a number of Senators have argued on the floor \nand have made the same point to me in private, frankly, that the \naffirmative defense approach may not give doctors who encounter an \nexceedingly life-endangering condition of the mother the sufficient \nlatitude that they need. There is no medical evidence in the record \nproduced as a result of the hearing on November 17 before the Judiciary \nCommittee that the partial-birth-abortion procedure is ever necessary \nto save the life of the mother. As I said, there simply was no \ntestimony. But Senators have expressed discomfort, as I said, in \nprivate to me, some wanting to vote for this but felt that they were \nnot comfortable with the affirmative defense approach. In a good-faith \neffort to accommodate these concerns, last night Senator Dole and I \noffered a life-of-the-mother exception amendment, and the new language \nwhich would be added immediately at the end of subsection (a) of the \npending bill reads as follows:\n\n       This paragraph shall not apply to a partial-birth abortion \n     that is necessary to save the life of the mother whose life \n     is endangered by a physical disorder, illness or injury, \n     provided that no other medical procedure would suffice for \n     that purpose.\n\n  Now, we heard some debate here last night from some as if to say a \nphysical disorder would not cover the complications that may arise from \na pregnancy where a partial-birth abortion would be performed.\n  Of course, that would be covered. We are playing semantic games. The \nintent is to cover this if, in fact, there is a need to protect the \nlife of the mother, which at this point we have never seen any \ntestimony before any of our committees.\n  The language of this Smith-Dole life-of-the-mother exception \namendment is very clear. It could not be clearer. The first part of the \namendment is designed to make certain that the exception only applies \nto cases in which the mother's life is genuinely, physically threatened \nby some physical disorder, physical illness, or physical injury.\n  Mr. SMITH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 90 \nminutes equally divided between myself and Senator Boxer for debate on \nthe Dole amendment No. 3081 and the Boxer amendment No. 3082, and that \nfollowing the conclusion or yielding back of time, the amendments be \nlaid aside, and the votes occur first on the Dole amendment, to be \nfollowed immediately by a vote on the Boxer amendment on Thursday, \nDecember 7, with the time to be determined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I also ask unanimous consent that immediately following \nthe disposition of the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations conference \nreport, that there be 60 minutes to be equally divided in the usual \nform for closing debate on the two amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I further ask unanimous consent that if the Dole amendment \nNo. 3081 is adopted, the Smith amendment No. 3080, as amended, be \ndeemed agreed to without further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the two back-to-back votes tomorrow, that Senator Smith or \nhis designee be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. In light of this agreement, Mr. President, the leader has \nasked me to announce there will be no further votes this evening.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3081\n\n  The second part of the Smith-Dole amendment is intended to ensure \nthat in such dire emergency cases that we talked about, a partial-birth \nabortion could only be performed if it were the only medical procedure \navailable to save the life of the mother. After all, as we all know \nnow, the partial-birth abortion procedure is, first, brutal, and \nsecond, inhumane. It cannot possibly be justified except in a case of \ntrue self-defense when there is no other way--no other way--for a \ndoctor to save the mother's life. In that case, self-defense is \ncertainly legitimate and, of course, I would be supportive.\n  In sum, Mr. President, both Senator Dole and I believe that this \ncarefully drafted life-of-the-mother exception amendment is fully \nadequate. You will hear words to the contrary, but it is fully adequate \nto address the good-faith concerns of those Senators who are not \nsatisfied with the affirmative defense provision in the underlying \nbill.\n\n  As I indicated, I am satisfied with it. But others are not, and I \nrespect the fact that others are not and am willing therefore and have \nbeen willing, and Senator Dole and others have been willing, to change \nit to clarify it more, to make sure there is no doubt that we support \nthe life-of-the-mother exception.\n  We are satisfied that our language assures that this exception will \nnot be abused by doctors who are not acting in good faith to save \nmothers' lives. We feel we have taken care of that in the amendment. \nLet me be very clear, Mr. President, as clear as I can be. Under the \nSmith-Dole amendment, no doctor could be convicted of violating the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995 unless the Government proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the doctor had performed a partial-birth \nabortion that was not covered--not covered--by this life-of-the-mother \nexception.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, this Smith-Dole life-of-the-mother \nexception amendment fully satisfies--fully--any legitimate concerns \nthat the affirmative defense provision of H.R. 1833 \n\n[[Page S 18073]]\ndoes not adequately protect any doctor that might act to protect the \nlife of the mother where no other procedure is available. We have gone \nthe extra mile by doing this, even though--even though--those of us \nthat have put this amendment forth believe that the affirmative defense \nprovision does, in fact, protect such doctors.\n  Mr. President, one of the Senators who has consistently made the \nargument that the affirmative defense provision does not protect \ndoctors in life-saving situations is my colleague on the other side of \nthe issue, the other side of the management here this evening, Senator \nBoxer. Last night after Senator Dole and I offered our life-of-the-\nmother exception amendment, Senator Boxer responded by saying--I want \nto quote from the Congressional Record. ``Here we have it, an exception \nnow for life of the mother. I think that is progress. I think that is \nprogress, * * *.''\n  And in the spirit of comity, c-o-m-i-t-y, as opposed to comedy, I \nwelcome Senator Boxer's positive remarks. Senator Dole and I acted in \ngood faith. We were pleased when she responded in good faith. But later \nin that same debate there was an about-face by the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I say this with the utmost respect. There was an abrupt change in \ntune. Here is what Senator Boxer had to say about the Smith-Dole life-\nof-the-mother exception amendment in the same debate a few minutes \nafter the statement that I just read:\n\n       This so-called life-of-the-mother exception that has been \n     offered by my friend from New Hampshire, with Senator Dole, \n     is not--let me repeat--is not in any way a life-of-the-mother \n     exception.\n\n  I am going to repeat those two lines. First, early in the debate, a \nquote from Senator Boxer:\n\n       Here we have it, an exception now for the life of the \n     mother. I think that is progress. I think that is progress.\n\n  And I welcome those remarks.\n  Then, later in the same debate, the same evening, quoting Senator \nBoxer:\n\n       This so-called life-of-the-mother exception that has been \n     offered by my friend from New Hampshire, with Senator Dole, \n     is not--let me repeat--is not in any way a life-of-the-mother \n     exception.\n\n  So, if there is confusion on the part those who are trying to figure \nout what Senator Boxer's view is on this, then I certainly understand \nthat confusion.\n  It is rather curious, is it not, that throughout the Senate's debate \non this bill, the other side has repeatedly demanded a life-of-the-\nmother exception--repeatedly demanded a life-of-the-mother exception. \nYet, when we offer one, we get praised for it, then the gears are \nswitched and we are denounced.\n  I do not know what a flip-flop is, but if that is not one, I do not \nknow what is.\n  Mr. President, after abruptly changing the position, we then get into \nrationalization. Then we hear the quote from Senator Boxer:\n\n       So, yes, if a woman had diabetes or some other disease, \n     there would be an exception. But if, in fact, the birth \n     endangered her life, there would be no exception.\n\n  That just simply is not true. It simply is not true, and any \nreasonable person who looks at this amendment will see that it is not \ntrue, because it specifically provides for a life-of-the-mother \nexception.\n  This is bizarre. I mean it really is bizarre. I have been involved in \na lot of debates. I have served in the Congress for 11 years--I served \nin the Senate for 5 and the House for 6--and I have been involved in \ndebates on everything. You name it, I think I have debated it here \nsomewhere. But I do not think I have ever heard a statement that was as \nquick a turnaround in the same debate as that.\n\n  And I guess my question is, what is the position of the Senator from \nCalifornia? What is the position of the spokesman on the other side of \nthis issue? Is it that we have a life-of-the-mother exception or we do \nnot? She said both. I am curious what the position is. Maybe we will \nhear it. I do not know.\n  I said last night if a complication resulting from a pregnancy is not \na physical disorder, what is it? I am not a physician. I do not pretend \nto be a physician. I have never advocated being a physician. I have \nnever said I was a physician, but if a physical disorder, a \ncomplication resulting from a pregnancy is not a physical disorder, I \ndo not know what it is.\n  (Ms. SNOWE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SMITH. Let me reiterate that we can play games with words, we can \nplay semantics and obfuscate and distort the issue, and that is exactly \nwhat is occurring here, but the truth of the matter is, this is a life-\nof-the-mother exception. The other side knows it, but that is not the \nagenda.\n  A perfectly normal pregnancy is not a disorder. That is what the \nagenda is. That is the agenda. They want the right to have an \nelective--elective--abortion, whether there is a life-of-the-mother \nexception or not. That is the agenda.\n  A perfectly normal pregnancy is not a disorder in the sense that some \ncomplications arise. It is not an illness, and it is not an injury. It \nis rather a perfectly normal and natural condition in which millions of \nwomen all over the country, all over the world, find themselves in at a \ngiven time. Sometimes, however, a woman develops a physical condition \nor a preexisting condition worsens as a result of the pregnancy and \nthat physical condition poses a grave physical threat to her life.\n  That situation which I just described, where there is a threat to her \nlife, clearly, in the words of the Smith-Dole amendment, is a physical \ndisorder, and it is covered. To put it more simply, Madam President, \nnormal pregnancy is a natural physical order. It is not a disorder, it \nis an order, a natural physical order, and a life-threatening pregnancy \nis a physical disorder.\n  In short, our amendment could not be clearer. This is a fully \nadequate, genuine life-of-the-mother exception. Period. And not only \nthat, it is exactly what Senator Boxer repeatedly--over and over and \nover and over and over again--on the floor of this Senate prior to the \nhearing said that she wanted. ``I want the life-of-the-mother \nexception,'' she said. She said it again in the debate last night. We \nhave it. Then she said we do not have it. First she said we have it, \nthen we do not have it.\n\n  Let me say what I think is really going on here. I think that those \non the other side, the Senator from California and others, know what \nthis amendment is. They know, in fact, that it is a fully adequate, \ngood-faith life-of-the-mother exception. That is what it is.\n  What I suspect that they might be afraid of is that the Senate's \nadoption of the Smith-Dole amendment will make it much more difficult \nto achieve the real objective. Let us talk about that real objective.\n  Do you know what the real objective is? To gut this bill. To gut the \nbill. To kill this bill with a life or health exception, which opens up \nbig doors. The keyword is ``health.'' Everyone really knows in the \nabortion context what that really means. It means abortion on demand, \nbut we are not talking, I say to my colleagues, about abortion on \ndemand under any circumstances at all in this bill, except the partial-\nbirth abortion. That is the only issue before us today. Nothing else.\n  Whether or not you support, some time between the 5th and 9th month \nof gestation, the opportunity for any woman to say--let us just use, \nfor example, at 8\\1/2\\ months gestation, that this is a female child \nand ``I don't want it. Therefore, because I don't want it, because it \nis a female, I am going to abort it in the following manner: I'm going \nto allow a doctor to enhance, induce the delivery of everything except \nthe head.'' So all parts of the child come out of the birth canal with \nthe exception of the head. It is then restrained by the doctor. It is \nheld. Delivery stops because the doctor forcefully stops the child from \nbeing born, and then the child is killed by using scissors to the back \nof the head, with no anesthesia, and a catheter to suck out the child's \nbrains. That is what happens. That is the type of abortion we are \ntalking about here. It is the only type of abortion that we are talking \nabout here. I say to my colleagues, let us not talk about these issues \nnow, such as deformities. We will talk about those later. Let us talk \nabout a healthy female child that somebody decides they do not want \nonly because it is a little girl--no other reason--and they abort it in \nthe manner that I described. That is what the agenda is for those who \noppose this amendment.\n\n  The Senate will consider, later this evening, this killer amendment. \nIt is an amendment that is designed, again, \n\n[[Page S 18074]]\nto gut the bill. You may as well call it the partial-birth abortion-\nupon-demand amendment. That is what it is. I know my colleagues in the \nHouse--good colleagues, who have strong views on this issue, pro-choice \nviews, like Susan Molinari and Patrick Kennedy, a moderate Republican \nand a liberal Democrat--voted for this ban, because they were so \nincensed, outraged, horrified, and sickened by a process that would \ntake the life of a child in this manner.\n  We have seen testimony, Madam President, of people who aborted \nchildren in this manner. This is what we are talking about. Let us not \nforget the manner, because that is what we are talking about--in this \nmanner: by scissors and a catheter in the back of the neck, because \nthey had Down's syndrome. We had testimony on that. My colleagues will \nrecognize and I am sure many of us know that people with Down's \nsyndrome are very productive people. It is very interesting that some \nof those same people who were staunch advocates for the Americans With \nDisabilities Act would not want to protect an innocent child who may be \nborn with a disability. That is the height of hypocrisy. It just does \nnot get any worse than that.\n  When one seriously examines the Boxer amendment, it becomes clear \nthat the ``partial-birth abortion-on-demand amendment'' is what it is. \nIt totally and completely removes all of the protections of the \nunderlying bill from any baby who is not, in the sole judgment of the \nabortionist, viable. In other words, under the Boxer amendment, any \nabortionist who wants to use this brutal and inhumane partial-birth \nabortion procedure to kill an unborn child who is not yet viable--and \nviability occurs somewhere around 24 weeks--can do so with total \nimpunity.\n  The amendment denies previable babies any protection at all. I have \nno doubt that Martin Haskell, the Nation's foremost partial-birth \nabortionist, would be very pleased, indeed, if this amendment were \nadopted. Do you know why he would be pleased? Because Dr. Haskell, by \nhis own admission in statements--he refused to come and speak to the \nSenate--said he performed a thousand of these abortions like I just \ndescribed--a thousand of them. Guess what, Madam President? Twenty \npercent--in other words, 200--were because the child had some medical \ndeformity--Down's syndrome, or who knows--and 80 percent, or 800, by \nhis testimony, were perfectly normal children, who were aborted \nselectively and electively by someone other than that child, that is \nfor sure. That is what is going on in America. That is all I am trying \nto stop. That is all I am trying to do here.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, as I have said before, and to anybody \nlistening, if you had a pet that you had to euthanize, put to sleep, \nwould you do it by using scissors to insert a hole in the back of the \nhead and suck the brains out of your puppy or your dog without \nanesthesia? Would you do that? You would be horrified if the local SPCA \ndid that and that was in the paper tomorrow. You would be down there \nclosing the place down, trying to adopt all the pets to get them away \nfrom there. That is what you would do. But this goes on. Every day a \nbaby dies like this--in America, at least. We cannot stand here and \nstop it, with all of the problems we face in America today, such as \nbalancing the budget, keeping the Government from closing down so \npeople do not lose their jobs and are out of work for Christmas, \ndeciding whether or not troops should go to Bosnia? We have to stand \nhere and try to stop something as brutal as this, which should not even \nbe happening? My God.\n  This amendment that the Senator from California has offered allows \nany partial-birth abortion on any viable baby. If you do not believe \nthat, I would urge Senator Boxer, when she speaks, to say I will make \nan exception if it is a little girl, I will make an exception if it is \nhealthy, I will make an exception if it has blue eyes, I will make an \nexception if it is a little boy, I will make an exception--let me hear \nit. You will not hear it. You will not hear it because that is not the \nagenda, because we use it in this cloudy term called the ``right to \nchoose.''\n  We are going to see pictures of happy families from the Senator from \nCalifornia. But one picture that is not going to be in that happy \nfamily is that little baby who, yes, may have had Down's syndrome, who \ncould be productive, or maybe a normal little girl. You will not see \ntheir picture in the happy family, because they did not get a chance to \nbe a part of that happy family.\n  The post-viability language in the Senator's bill, like her pre-\nviability language, effectively removes all babies from the protection \nof this underlying bill. I want my colleagues to understand--and they \nall know my position on abortion. I believe life begins at conception \nand that life is sacred and should be protected. But that is not what \nwe are debating today. We are debating one specific type of abortion, \nan abortion in which labor is induced and the child comes into the \nbirth canal and it is executed with scissors and catheters, brutally, \nin late-term pregnancies. That is what we are talking about, nothing \nelse. Do not be confused by the debate on something else because that \nis not what we are talking about.\n\n  So the Boxer amendment would essentially leave the judgment of \nwhether a post-viability partial-birth abortion is necessary to protect \nthe mother's health to the totally wide-open discretion of the abortion \ndoctor. That, Madam President, is a prescription--to use a medical \nterm--for abortion on demand.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 24 minutes, 5 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, to show more precisely why this amendment \nwould gut the bill, let me focus on the legal meaning of the term \n``health'' in the abortion context. The U.S. Supreme Court addressed \nthat very question in the 1973 decision of Doe versus Bolton. ``Whether \nthe health of the mother requires an abortion is a judgment,'' the \nCourt said, ``to be made in the light of all factors--physical, \nemotional, psychological, the woman's age, and relevant to her well-\nbeing.''\n  That is very clearly stated. In other words, the Court has given the \nbroadest, most liberal terms imaginable to the term ``health'' in the \nabortion context. As U.S. Court of Appeals Judge John Noonan said, ``. \n. . it would be a rare case where a doctor willing to perform an \nabortion would not be convinced that his patient's well-being required \nthe abortion she asked for.''\n  I am not trying to get into the debate about when a woman's health is \nat risk. We have had testimony, and we have called for witnesses to \ncome before the committee of the Senate. We have heard testimony in the \nHouse. We sought to find people who would come in here, physicians, \nfrom anywhere in America, to come in and testify and tell us, the \nSenate or the House, where there is a case where you would need to do \nthis type of abortion to save the life of a woman. No one testified to \nthat effect.\n  No one. They could not produce one. They could not even produce \nsomebody that had a partial-birth abortion at the hearing we had, \nalthough they asked for the hearing.\n  The Senate, in recent votes, has rejected this massive health \nloophole when it decisively defeated the Mikulski medical necessity \namendment with respect to abortion coverage under the federal employees \nhealth benefit plan a few weeks ago.\n  The Senate was not fooled then. The Senate will not be fooled now. \nThis Boxer amendment would preserve the status quo, under which \nbarbaric, cruel, and partial-birth abortion procedures are available on \ndemand, a status quo under which a partial-birth abortionist like Dr. \nHaskell can freely take the lives of babies, like the Down's syndrome \nlittle boy that nurse Brenda Shafer saw him destroy.\n  Brenda Shafer, for those that missed the debate, was a nurse who \nwitnessed a partial-birth abortion, a little boy who had Down's \nsyndrome. She was horrified. She called his little face an angelic \nface. She said, ``I looked into that face and I walked out of that \nclinic.'' She was a pro-choice woman who believed in abortion, taught \nher daughters that, but not this type of abortion. She was horrified, \nas any ordinary, normal person would be.\n  My colleagues, all I am asking, in spite of my own personal feelings \nabout this issue, all I am asking my colleagues to do today, all I am \nasking them to do is to vote to stop this single \n\n[[Page S 18075]]\nhorrible, disgusting type of abortion which is unnecessary.\n  The only circumstance under which such a hideous and cruel procedure \ncould possibly be justified would be in a true, absolute case of self-\ndefense where the doctor had no other way to save the mother's life.\n  That situation--were it ever to happen in a most extreme case anyone \ncan imagine--is provided for under the life-of-the-mother exception \namendment that I believe the Senate will adopt.\n  Stabbing an innocent, tiny baby through the skull and sucking her \nbrains out--how can you justify that, in order to safeguard some \nvaguely defined expansive notion of the mother's health? How does it \nhelp the mother's health to do that?\n  If it is hydrocephalic, you can drain off the fluid. In the 1 out of \n100 that Dr. Haskell performed that was hydrocephalic--the rest were \nsomething also, 80 percent elective.\n  I urge my colleagues, before you vote on this amendment, look at the \nSupreme Court's decision of health in the context as set forth in Doe \nversus Bolton. Health involves all factors: physical, emotional, \npsychological, and the woman's age relevant to her well-being.\n\n  In light of that definition, a vote for this is a vote for partial-\nbirth abortion on demand because there just is not any reason why you \ncould not have one under that definition. A health exception to this \nbill's ban on partial-birth abortions is, quite literally, an exception \nthat would consume the rule.\n  In other words, in the abortion context, the word ``health'' in an \nexception, is a legal term of art, translated into plain English means \nabortion on demand.\n  I say, if that is not the case, then I ask my colleagues on the other \nside, including the Senator from California, to simply stand up and \nsay, ``I would not support aborting a child by the partial-birth \nabortion method.''\n  If a woman came in and said, ``I am 8 months pregnant, Dr. Haskell. I \nhave a single baby and I do not want it.'' I say she should not have \nthat abortion. If the Senator from California should stand up and say \nthat, we will have made progress. I hope she says it, but do not hold \nyour breath. If she does not say it, we know what the real agenda is--\nabortion on demand, not just regular abortion.\n  This kind of abortion, scissors, catheter, something you would not do \nto your dog or your cat. You know you would not. You know you would not \ndo it. There is no way that you would do it. Why would you do it to a \nchild? Why would you allow it to be done to a child?\n  To be sure, Senator Boxer made a cosmetic attempt to narrow the \ndefinition of health by saying, ``Serious adverse health consequences \nto the woman.'' But the fact remains that under Senator Boxer's \namendment, whether there is a serious adverse health consequence to the \nmother is left solely to the judgment of the attending physician. In \nother words, the sole medical judgment of the abortionist, the sole \nmedical judgment of Dr. Haskell and his fellow birth abortionists.\n  The interesting point, all this talk of life of the mother, if it is \nyour daughter and she is in that situation, or your wife, would you \ntake her to an abortion clinic if her life was threatened or would you \ntake her to a hospital? These are performed in abortion clinics. That \nis interesting, is it not?\n  In short, Madam President, this narrowing language does not narrow \nher health exception one iota. The words ``serious and adverse'' are so \nclearly subjective, vague and broad as to be utterly meaningless and \nprovides no meaning. Senator Boxer's amendment remains the partial-\nbirth abortion on demand amendment.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues, I plead, plead, plead with my \ncolleagues one time, let us end this one, horrible, disgusting type of \nabortion. Let us have the courage to do it. These little kids cannot \nstand up here on the floor of the Senate. They do not have anybody. \nThey cannot stand here. The ones that are killed never get a chance to \nstand here. They are not going to be the first woman President. They \nare not going to be the first minority President. They will not be \nPresident of anything.\n  Do you know what their sin is? They happen to be in the womb of \nsomebody who does not want them. That is their sin. If they were in the \nwomb of somebody who wanted them after 8\\1/2\\ months, they would be \nallowed to be free and be born and live under the Constitution of the \nUnited States. That is their sin. That is their sin. We can do better \nthan that in this country. We have more important things to do than \nthat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. First of all, Mr. President, I think all of us who \nunderstand this issue are grateful to the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his courage and his tenacity in standing up for the unborn, \nparticularly those who have been and otherwise may be destroyed in the \nmost gruesome and horrible way--a partial-birth abortion. I personally \nam indebted to Senator Smith, and I admire him very much.\n  Mr. President, about a month ago, the Senate decided to send H.R. \n1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, to the Judiciary Committee \nwith instructions that Senator Hatch and his committee hold at least \none hearing and then return the bill to the Senate calendar within 19 \ndays.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held that hearing and despite the \nrehashed charges of opponents of this bill, the U.S. Senate can no \nlonger shirk its responsibility. Senator Dole, by offering a life-of-\nthe-mother exemption to H.R. 1833, has offered a provision that \npreserves the innocent lives of babies but also answers charges that \nthe original bill did nothing to preserve the lives of the mothers.\n  Mr. President, Senators have no more excuses. Senators must decide, \nand should decide soon, whether they will approve a gruesome procedure \nthat is both inhuman and heartless. Senators have heard the partial-\nbirth abortion procedure described. They have seen the graphic \ndepictions. It can easily and factually be said, as Senator Smith and I \ndiscussed when the bill first came to the Senate on November 7, that \nthese innocent, tiny babies are just 3 inches from the protection of \nthe law, only to be mercilessly deprived of their right to live and to \nlove and to be loved.\n  Senators should also decide whether they will disregard the medical \nfacts and enlightening testimony presented to the Judiciary Committee \nwhich confirmed what proponents of the original bill have argued in the \nHouse of Representatives and in the Senate--that the voices of tiny \nbabies are being silenced so that a woman can continue to choose to \nhave an abortion in the third trimester.\n  Let me add, if Senators miss this opportunity to criminalize partial-\nbirth abortions, they will be thumbing their noses at the American \npublic whose outcry against partial-birth abortions is overwhelming.\n  Mr. President, I was pleased as the House of Representatives listened \nto the American people and overwhelmingly passed the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act by a vote of 288-139 on November 1. If the Senate now \nfollows, as it should, the House's example--and I sincerely hope that \nthe Senate will--the burden then will shift to President Clinton who is \nmore than ready, he says, to use his veto pen in order to appease the \npro-abortion lobby unless weighty restrictions are added to the bill.\n  And that is where we stand today as the Senate has heard from the \nchorus of Senators, many of whom have taken their marching orders from \nthe powerful abortion lobby. Opponents of the bill have done their best \nto explain the medical necessity of a procedure that legally allows a \ndoctor to partially deliver a baby, feet-first from the womb, only to \nhave his or her brains brutally removed via the doctor's instruments.\n  However, Mr. President, these objections by the bill's opponents are \nhollow attempts to whitewash a hideous wrong. For instance, they \ncontinue to persuade Senators that partial-birth abortions are \nmedically necessary in order to preserve the health of pregnant women.\n  Of course, ask NARAL and the other proabortion groups to define a \n``medically necessary'' situation and you'll hear a variety of answers \nincluding ``emotional stress,'' ``depression,'' or ``psychological \nindecision.'' NARAL even defined ``medically necessary'' abortions as \n``a term which generally \n\n[[Page S 18076]]\nincludes the broadest range of situations for which a state will fund \nabortion.''--``Who Decides? A Reproductive Rights Issues Manual--\n1990''.\n  Mr. President, I suggest we ask the American people who are ringing \nthe phones off the hooks of Senate offices whether they see eye to eye \nwith NARAL and other pro-abortion groups. They are not fooled. They \nrecognize these semantic games as a smokescreen to demand abortion at \nany time, for any reason.\n  More importantly, the medical evidence declares that this procedure \nis not needed to protect the health of the mother in a late-term crisis \npregnancy. Don't take it from me. Take it from Dr. Pamela E. Smith, \nDirector of Medical Education in the Department of Obstetrics and \nGynecology at Chicago's Mount Sinai Hospital.\n  Dr. Smith, in her November 4 letter to me, states that assertions \nimplying that a partial-birth abortion is needed to protect the health \nof a woman in a late-term complicated pregnancy is ``deceptive and \npatently untrue.'' Dr. Smith even goes as far to explain in her October \n28 letter to Congressman Charles Canady that such a procedure, in fact, \npresents medical risks to the patient.\n  In her testimony before the Judiciary Committee on November 17, Dr. \nSmith asks an important question that I wish every opponent of this \nbill would attempt to answer, and it is this:\n\n       Why would a procedure considered to impose a significant \n     risk to maternal health when it is used to deliver a baby \n     alive, suddenly become the ``safe method of choice'' when the \n     goal is to kill the baby?\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Smith's letter from \nNovember 4, 1995, her letter from October 28, 1995, and her November 17 \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Even Dr. Warren Hern--author of ``Abortion Practice,'' \nconsidered by the American Medical Association as the Nation's most \nwidely used textbook on abortion standards and procedures--boldly \ndisputes the safety of this late-term abortion, calling it \n``potentially dangerous.''\n  Ask Dr. Hern what he thinks about partial-birth abortions as a safe \noption for late-term abortions. Let me repeat Dr. Hern's comments from \na November 20 article in the American Medical News. He says, ``You \nreally can't defend it,'' referring to a partial-birth abortion. He \ncontinues, ``I'm not going to tell somebody else that they should not \ndo this procedure. But I'm not going to do it.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the November 20, 1995, \nAmerican Medical News article titled, ``Outlawing Abortion Method,'' be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, allow me to address one more objection \nraised by opponents of this bill. In fact, the National Abortion \nFederation raised it with me in a November 3 letter, complete with \npictures of severely abnormal babies. The NAF claims that it is the \ntragedy of deformed and abnormal babies that has produced a need for \npartial-birth abortions. Without this procedure, they portend, a \npregnant woman's health will be threatened--Dr. Smith and other doctors \nhave already refuted this point--and such abnormalities are \n``incompatible with life.''\n  Now, Mr. President, nobody, in their right mind, would ever wish for \na mother and father to face the heartbreaking experience of their \nnewborn being delivered with a severe abnormality. Nobody would ever \nwant a child to endure the physical and emotional scars of a physical \ndeformity. Yet, for these reasons, they claim partial-birth abortions \nshould remain legal.\n  Again, I disagree and ask opponents of the bill to consider the \nreasons given by Dr. Martin Haskell, a noted proponent and practitioner \nof partial-birth abortions, as to why this procedure is conducted. Dr. \nHaskell, in a 1993 interview with American Medical News, states that 20 \npercent are conducted for genetic reasons, and the other 80 percent are \npurely elective--purely to get rid of the child.\n  And according to materials presented to a House Judiciary \nsubcommittee, the non-elective reasons given for a partial-birth \nabortion conducted by the late Dr. James McMahon included such \n``flaws'' as a cleft palate. Are these the type of genetic reasons \nthese babies suffer painful deaths?\n  Mr. President, the facts are in and I will not belabor them further. \nBut they clearly prove that partial-birth abortions are unnecessary to \npreserve the health of a woman in a late-term complicated pregnancy. \nSimply put, a partial-birth abortion is another means for a woman to \nterminate her unwanted child very late in pregnancy.\n  I urge my colleagues, do not be deceived by the pro-abortion rhetoric \nwhich would have you believe that this cruel procedure is needed. \nInstead, listen to the advice of medical experts. Consider the outcry \nof the American people who recognize partial-birth abortions as inhuman \nand stand up for the most helpless and innocent human beings \nimaginable.\n  I thank the distunguished Senator from New Hampshire, and I admire \nhim and the great work he has done. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 November 4, 1995.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am a medical doctor, board certified in the \n     specialty of obstetrics and gynecology. I am also in the \n     process of completing a master's in public health with \n     enhanced analytical skills in maternal and child health at \n     the University of Illinois at Chicago. For the past 15 years \n     I have practiced in the inner city of Chicago and currently I \n     am the Director of Medical Education in the Department of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt. Sinai Hospital; a member of \n     the Association of Professors in Gynecology and Obstetrics; \n     and the President Elect of the American Association of \n     Profile Obstetricians and Gynecologists. It has recently been \n     brought to my attention that on November 7th the Senate will \n     consider the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. As a fellow citizen \n     I urge you to support this legislation.\n       As you are probably aware the partial birth abortion \n     procedure involves delivering a human fetus by breach \n     extraction until only the head remains inside the birth \n     canal. The practitioner then kills the baby by inserting a \n     pair of scissors into the base of the skull and removing the \n     baby's brains with a vacuum. This is the procedure the \n     proposed bill seeks to ban.\n       Last week, despite a tremendous amount of medical \n     misinformation given by the opponents of H.R. 1833, the \n     Partial Birth Abortion Ban received strong support in its \n     passage in the House. As this measure is now being presented \n     for Senate consideration please be aware of the following \n     medical facts:\n       1. Opponents insinuated that aborting a living human fetus \n     is sometimes necessary to preserve the reproductive potential \n     and/or life of the mother. Such an assertion is deceptive and \n     patently untrue. Even if the fetus is grotesquely malformed, \n     a living intrauterine pregnancy is not a health risk to its \n     mother unless the woman suffers from extremely rare medical \n     problems that would preclude pregnancy under any \n     circumstances.\n       2. Partial birth abortion is a surgical technique devised \n     by secluded abortionists in the unregulated abortion industry \n     to save them the trouble of ``counting the body parts'' that \n     are produced in dismemberment procedures. It is not a \n     ``standard of care'' for anything. Equally important is the \n     fact that the risks involved in dismemberment procedures and \n     partial birth abortion include istrogenically produced \n     cervical incompetence and uterine rupture. Medical \n     alternatives (like prostaglendine) do not pose these risks \n     but have the undesirable ``side effect'' of sometimes \n     producing a living child. Women who were ``counseled'' by \n     abortionists that they were submitting themselves to a \n     procedure that was ``safe'' and that would insure their \n     future reproductive potential were deceived and lied to. \n     These women actually risked losing their uterus or their \n     lives by submitting to these dangerous intrauterine \n     extractions.\n       3. In breach extractions frequently the baby's head ``slips \n     out.'' Since the practitioners of this procedure (who by \n     their own reports up until 1993 had performed at least 3,000 \n     of these procedures) have never reported a survivor you can \n     be assured that some of these fetuses were constitutional \n     persons who were murdered.\n       4. The baby is alive throughout the entire procedure until \n     the scissors are jammed into the base of the skull.\n       5. There are absolutely no obstetrical situations \n     encountered in this country which require a partially \n     delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health \n     of the mother.\n       Additionally, given the recent attempts by the ACGME to \n     coerce OBGYN residents into becoming abortion providers, many \n     profile and prochoice physicians in training are concerned \n     that they will be forced to witness and/or participate in \n     gruesome abortion \n\n[[Page S 18077]]\n     techniques. Most of these individuals support the decriminalization of \n     abortion . . . but are extremely uncomfortable with \n     procedures that destroy a life that is undeniably human.\n       I therefore urge you to consider these factors during the \n     deliberations on this bill. The health status of women and \n     children in this country can only be enhanced by banning \n     partial birth abortions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pamela E. Smith, M.D., FACOG.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 October 28, 1995.\n     Hon. Charles Canady,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on the Constitution, House Committee \n         on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Canady: It has recently been brought to my \n     attention that opponents of HR 1833 have stated that this \n     particular abortion technique should maintain its legality \n     because it is sometimes employed by physicians in the \n     interest of maternal health. Such an assertion not only runs \n     contrary to facts but ignores the reality of the risks to \n     maternal health that are associated with this procedure which \n     include the following:\n       1. Since the procedure entails 3 days of forceful \n     dilatation of the cervix, the mother could develop cervical \n     incompetence in subsequent pregnancies resulting in \n     spontaneous second trimester pregnancy losses and \n     necessitating the placement of a cerclage (stitch around the \n     cervix) to enable her to carry a fetus to term.\n       2. Uterine rupture is a well known complication associated \n     with this procedure. In fact, partial birth abortion is a \n     ``variant'' of internal podalic version . . . a technique \n     sometimes used by obstetricians in this country with the \n     intent of delivering a live child. However, internal podalic \n     version, in this country, has been gradually replaced by \n     Cesarean section in the interest of maternal as well as fetal \n     well being (see excerpts from the standard text Williams \n     Obstetrics pages 520, 521, 865 and 866).\n       Furthermore, obstetrical emergencies (such as entrapment of \n     the head of a hydrocephalic fetus or of a footling breech \n     that has partially delivered on its own) are never handled by \n     employing this abortion technique. Cephalocentesis, (drainage \n     of fluid from the head of a hydrocephalic fetus) frequently \n     results in the birth of a living child. Relaxing the uterus \n     with anesthesia, cutting the cervix (Duhrssen's incision) and \n     Cesarean section are the standard of care for a normal, head \n     entrapped breech fetus.\n       There are absolutely no obstetrical situations encountered \n     in this country which require a partially delivered human \n     fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of the mother. \n     Partial birth abortion is a technique devised by abortionists \n     for their own convenience . . . ignoring the known health \n     risks to the mother. The health status of women in this \n     country will thereby only be enhanced by the banning of this \n     procedure.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Pamela E. Smith, M.D.,\n\n                                    Director of Medical Education,\n     Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Testimony of Pamela Smith, M.D. on H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth \n  Abortion Ban Act, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC, \n                           November 17, 1995\n\n       Mr. Chairman, honorable members of the Judiciary Committee, \n     my name is Pamela Eleashia Smith. I am a medical doctor, \n     board-certified in the specialty of obstetrics and \n     gynecology, having received my training at Cornell \n     University, Yale University, the University of Chicago, and \n     Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago.\n       For the past 15 years I have practiced in the inner city of \n     Chicago. I am currently the Director of Medical Education in \n     the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt. Sinai \n     Hospital; an Assistant Professor at the Finch University/\n     Chicago Medical School; a member of the American College of \n     Obstetrics and Gynecologists; and the President-elect of the \n     American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists.\n       Honorable senators, before I testified on this legislation \n     on June 15, before the House Judiciary Committee's \n     Subcommittee on the Constitution, I went around and described \n     the procedure of partial-birth abortion to a number of \n     physicians and laypersons who I knew to be pro-choice. They \n     were horrified to learn that such a procedure was even legal.\n       I believe that it is safe to say that until the recent \n     publicity occasioned by the movement of this legislation, \n     most physicians, including obstetrician-gynecologists, knew \n     nothing of this technique as an abortion method. But the \n     partial-birth abortion method is strikingly similar to the \n     technique of internal podalic version, or fetal breech \n     extraction. Breech extraction is a procedure that is utilized \n     by many obstetricians with the intent of delivering a live \n     infant in the management of twin pregnancies, or single-\n     infant pregnancies complicated by abnormal positions of the \n     pre-born infant.\n       I would invite the members of the subcommittee to review \n     the drawings of the fetal breech extraction method that I \n     have attached to my written testimony, reproduced from \n     Williams Obstetrics, a standard textbook. Compare this with \n     the partial-birth abortion procedure, as laid out step-by-\n     step by Dr. Martin Haskell in his instructional paper, \n     ``Dilation and Extraction for Late Second Trimester \n     Abortion.'' (In that paper, Dr. Haskell says that he \n     ``coined'' the term ``dilation and extraction.'' Neither that \n     term nor the term now favored by opponents of H.R. 1833, \n     ``intact dilation and evacuation,'' can be found in any \n     standard medical literature. There is nothing whatever \n     misleading about the term utilized in the bill, ``partial-\n     birth abortion.'')\n       In a total breech extraction, the physician--frequently \n     with the aid of ultrasound--grasps the lower extremities of \n     the baby. With the bag of waters serving as a buffer and \n     cervical wedge, the physician pulls the infant towards the \n     cervix and vagina. To facilitate the delivery of the head by \n     flexion, care is taken to maintain the baby's spine in a \n     position that points towards the mother's bladder.\n       Depending upon the size of the infant, an attempt may be \n     made to delivery the baby without rupturing the bag of \n     waters. In such a case, the bag of waters facilitates \n     delivery of the head by mechanically maintaining cervical \n     dilation. Should the bag of waters rupture and the head \n     become entrapped, it can be released by cutting the \n     cervix, or a Cesarean section can be performed to deliver \n     the baby abdominally.\n       Partial-birth abortions, which according to the physicians \n     who perform them have been done on babies from the ages of 19 \n     weeks to full term, represent a perversion of the above \n     technique. In these procedures, one basically relies on \n     cervical entrapment of the head, along with a firm grip, to \n     help keep the baby in place while the practitioner plunges a \n     pair of scissors into the base of the baby's skull. The \n     scissors also creates an opening for the insertion of a \n     suction curette to remove the baby's brains.\n       If, my chance, the cervix is floppy or loose and the \n     abortionist does not keep a good grip, he may encounter the \n     dreadful ``complication'' of delivering a live baby--\n     undoubtedly, a constitutional ``person'' with an inalienable \n     right to life. Thus, the practitioner must take great care to \n     insure that the baby does not move those additional few \n     inches that would transform its status from one of an abortus \n     to that of a living human child.\n       Another brazen attempt to mislead the American public as to \n     the reality of the pain experienced by the victims of this \n     procedure is the assertion that the anesthesia kills the \n     baby. Such a statement runs contrary to published reports \n     made by abortion practitioners, is not consistent with basic \n     principles of the pharmacology of drug distribution in the \n     pregnant female, and violates common sense. Twenty-five \n     percent of all pregnancies in this country are delivered by \n     Cesarean section and many women receive potent narcotics to \n     relieve their pain during labor. Yet it is essentially \n     unheard of that a human fetus in labor dies secondary to \n     anesthesia given to its mother.\n       I note that the American Society of Anesthesiologists \n     issued the following statement recently:\n       Recent debate in the U.S. House of Representatives and \n     Senate regarding late-term abortions has resulted in the \n     distribution of misleading and potentially dangerous \n     information to the public. The procedure, described in the \n     media and during congressional debate, was developed by the \n     late Dr. James T. McMahon. In testimony before Congress last \n     June, Dr. McMahon incorrectly stated that the fetus dies from \n     the anesthesia administered to the mother.\n       According to the president of the American Society of \n     Anesthesiologists (ASA), Dr. Norig Ellison, the anesthesia \n     administered to the mother in connection with such a \n     procedure does not kill the fetus. Very little anesthesia \n     crosses the placenta when general anesthesia is administered \n     to the mother, and many pregnant women are safely \n     anesthetized every day without ill effects to the fetus.\n       ASA is concerned that because of publicity given to Dr. \n     McMahon's erroneous testimony, pregnant women may delay \n     necessary and perhaps lifesaving medical procedures due to \n     misinformation regarding the effect of anesthetics on the \n     fetus.\n       Of course, if a baby really were dead, H.R. 1833 would not \n     apply, since the definition of ``partial-birth abortion'' is \n     ``an abortion in which the person performing the abortion \n     partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before killing \n     the fetus * * *''\n       The cruelty of this treatment of the human fetus is quite \n     evident to those who do not avert their gaze or close their \n     minds. But these abortion procedures also carry with them \n     significant risks to maternal health.\n       Partial-birth abortion is not a standard of care for \n     anything. In fact, partial-birth abortion is a perversion of \n     a well-known technique used by obstetricians to delivery \n     breech babies when the intent is to delivery the child \n     alive. However, as the enclosed references in Williams \n     ``Obstetrics'' readily document, this technique is rarely \n     used in this country because of the well known associated \n     risk of maternal hemorrhage and uterine rupture. The 19th \n     edition of Williams ``Obstetrics'' states the following in \n     regards to the safety of this method of breech delivery:\n       ``Despite numerous attempts to defend or condemn this \n     procedure, there is presently insufficient evidence to \n     document its safety . . . There are few, if any indications \n     for internal podalic version other than the delivery of a \n     second twin. The possibility of serious trauma to the fetus \n     and the mother during internal podalic version of a cephalic \n     presentation is apparent . . .''\n       Why would a procedure that is considered to impose a \n     significant risk to maternal \n\n[[Page S 18078]]\n     health when it is used to delivery a baby alive, suddenly become the \n     ``safe method of choice'' when the goal is to kill the baby? \n     And if abortion providers wanted to demonstrate that somehow \n     this procedure would be safe in late-pregnancy abortions, \n     even though its use has routinely been discouraged in modern \n     obstetrics, why didn't they go before institutional review \n     boards, obtain consent to perform what amounts to human \n     experimentation, and conduct adequately controlled, \n     appropriately supervised studies that would insure accurate, \n     informed consent of patients and the production of valid \n     scientific information for the medical community?\n       It is also noteworthy that even leading authorities on \n     late-term abortion methodology have expressed the gravest \n     reservations regarding this technique. Consider, for example, \n     this excerpt from an article in the November 20 edition of \n     American Medical News, the official newspaper of the American \n     Medical Association.\n       ``I have very serious reservations about this procedure,'' \n     said Colorado physician Warren Hern, MD, the author of \n     ``Abortion Practice,'' the nation's most widely used textbook \n     on abortion standards and procedures. Dr. Hern specializes in \n     late-term procedures . . . [O]f the procedure in question he \n     says, ``You really can't defend it. I'm not going to tell \n     somebody else that they should not do this procedure. But I'm \n     not going to do it.''\n       Dr. Hern's concerns center on claims that the procedure in \n     late-term pregnancy can be safest for the pregnant woman and \n     that without this procedure women would have died. ``I would \n     dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to \n     use,'' he said.\n       Turning the fetus to a breech position is ``potentially \n     dangerous,'' he added. ``You have to be concerned about \n     causing amniotic fluid embolism or placental abruption if you \n     do that.''\n       Dr. Hern said he could not imagine a circumstance in which \n     this procedure would be safest. He did acknowledge that some \n     doctors use skull-decompression techniques, but he added that \n     in those cases fetal death has been induced and the fetus \n     would not purposely be rotated into a breech position.\n       The behavior of the abortion industry in regards to this \n     current controversy is chillingly reminiscent of the Tuskegee \n     syphilis experiment conducted by medical and public health \n     personnel over two decades ago. In this infamous study, poor \n     black men were deceived and lied to and a known lifesaving \n     treatment option was withheld so that the researchers could \n     follow the ``natural course'' of the disease. Apparently some \n     individuals in our country failed to learn a valuable lesson \n     from this tragic chapter in our nation's recent history. \n     Pregnant women should not be experimented upon under the \n     guise of a deceptive rubric called ``choice.''\n       Furthermore, since the partial-birth abortion procedure \n     requires three days of forceful dilation of the cervix, the \n     mother could develop cervical incompetence in subsequent \n     pregnancies, resulting in spontaneous second-trimester \n     pregnancy losses and necessitating the placement of a \n     cerclage (stitch around the bottom of the womb) to enable \n     her to carry a baby to term. It is therefore a fact that \n     this procedure represents a risk to future fertility of \n     the patient. It does not represent the safest way for the \n     patient to maintain her fertility, as abortion advocates \n     proclaim.\n       Opponents of HR 1833 have also argued that ``decreasing the \n     size of the fetal head to allow delivery'' is done to save \n     the mother the risk of ``ripping and tearing'' the bottom of \n     the womb. But in fact, the standard of care for handling a \n     baby who is breech with an entrapped head at the cervix is \n     not partial-birth abortion. Caphalocentesis (drainage of \n     fluid from the head of a hydrocephalic fetus) frequently \n     results in the birth of a living child. Relaxing the uterus \n     with anesthesia, cutting the cervic (Duhrssen's incision), \n     and Cesarean section are the recognized options in the \n     medical community to deal with this obstetrical problem.\n       In short, there are absolutely no obstetrical situations \n     encountered in this country which require a partially \n     delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the life or \n     health of the mother.\n       Opponents of HR 1833 have similarly erroneously declared \n     that the partial-birth abortion method is necessary to \n     protect the ``emotional health'' of the mother. Certainly, I \n     do not lightly dismiss the accounts of women and families who \n     have experienced the anguish of learning, late in pregnancy, \n     that their babies have serious or even lethal disorders. In \n     my own years of practice and training, I have taken care of \n     many women who were carrying babies with fatal fetal \n     anomalies. My most recent such patient was a 19-year-old \n     female who was pregnant for the third time. Her previous two \n     pregnancies were remarkable for severe nausea and vomiting, \n     and she delivered two children who died before they were two \n     months old secondary to heart abnormalities. With her current \n     pregnancy the patient was weak, dehydrated, and emotionally \n     torn between the desire to bear a child and the horrible \n     prospect of attending another funeral. Our clinic staff, all \n     of whom are pro-life, counseled her on her options, supported \n     her medically in the hospital, and respected her initial \n     decision to terminate her pregnancy. However, the next day, \n     the patient's nausea and vomiting receded, she changed her \n     mind, and now intends to carry the baby to term.\n       Which brings to mind another erroneous insinuation \n     presented by opponents of HR 1833: the assertion that as soon \n     as a patient is discovered to have a fetus with an anomaly, \n     the pregnancy must be aborted immediately because the baby \n     has a high chance of dying before labor begins, representing \n     a threat to the life of the mother. Such a claim is \n     deceptive. It is often intended to sell the patient on the \n     abortion option.\n       First of all, it is not the standard of care to immediately \n     terminate the life of a living fetus just because that baby \n     has abnormalities. What is appropriate is to inform the \n     patient of your clinical suspicions, discuss with her all of \n     the options, as well as the risks associated with terminating \n     her pregnancy prematurely, and then develop a plan of \n     management that respects the patient's values and emotional \n     needs. Many women opt to continue such pregnancies.\n       Although it is highly unlikely that the partial-birth \n     abortion procedure would ever be needed to save a woman's \n     life, HR 1833 specifically states that the procedure would be \n     allowed if the doctor ``reasonably believed'' that it was \n     necessary to save the mother's life, and that no other \n     procedure would suffice. Abortion providers, however, are \n     fully aware that a lot of other procedures would suffice--\n     but they are primarily interested in making sure that \n     their job of terminating human life can be done according \n     to their own convenience. With the partial-birth method of \n     abortion, the provider is saved the trouble of assembling \n     ``baby parts'' to make sure that nothing was left inside.\n       Earlier this year, the late Dr. James McMahon provided to \n     the House Judiciary subcommittee a list of a self-selected \n     sample of 175 cases in which he utilized the partial-birth \n     procedure for so-called ``maternal indications.'' Of this \n     list, one-third (33%) of the time the partial-birth procedure \n     would be more appropriately classified as a contraindication, \n     because the mother already had medical problems that are \n     associated with excessive bleeding, infection or a need to be \n     delivered quickly. These conditions include eclampsia, \n     abruptio placenta, amnionitis, premature rupture of \n     membranes, incompetent cervix, and blood clotting \n     abnormalities.\n       In addition, another 22% (39 cases) were for maternal \n     ``depression,'' and 16% for conditions consistent with the \n     birth of a normal child (e.g., sickle cell trait, prolapsed \n     uterus, small pelvis).\n       Opponents of HR 1833 have also asserted that the term \n     ``elective'' means that the doctor elects to do this \n     procedure rather than to do some other one. I would invite \n     any individual in this country to ask their doctor what the \n     term ``elective surgery'' means. Or look the word up in the \n     dictionary. It refers to procedures that are optional. In a \n     tape-recorded 1993 interview with American Medical News, Dr. \n     Martin Haskell explicitly distinguished between the 20 \n     percent of his ``extraction'' procedures (as he calls them) \n     that he said involved fetuses with genetic problems, and the \n     80 percent that are, in his words, ``purely elective.''\n       HR 1833 has already been immensely useful in educating the \n     American public as to the need to keep a watchful eye, in the \n     interest of maternal well being, on the activities of the \n     abortion industry. Enactment of this legislation is needed \n     both to protect human offspring from being subjected to a \n     brutal procedure, and to safeguard the health of pregnant \n     women in America.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n            [From the American Medical News, Nov. 20, 1995]\n\n                       Outlawing Abortion Method\n\n                         (By Diane M. Gianelli)\n\n       Washington.--His strategy was simple: Find an abortion \n     procedure that almost anyone would describe as ``gruesome,'' \n     and force the opposition to defend it.\n       When Rep. Charles T. Canady (R, Fla.) learned about \n     ``partial birth'' abortions, he was set.\n       He and other anti-abortion lawmakers launched a \n     congressional campaign to outlaw the procedure.\n       Following a contentious and emotional debate, the bill \n     passed by an overwhelming--and veto-proof--margin: 288-139. \n     It marks the first time the House of Representatives has \n     voted to forbid a method of abortion. And although the \n     November elections yielded a ``pro-life'' infusion in both \n     the House and the Senate, massive crossover voting occurred, \n     with a significant number of ``pro-choice'' representatives \n     voting to pass the measure.\n       The controversial procedure, done in second- and third-\n     trimester pregnancies, involves an abortion in which the \n     provider, according to the bill, ``partially vaginally \n     delivers a living fetus before killing the fetus and \n     completing the delivery.''\n       ``Partial birth'' abortions, also called ``intact D'' \n     (for dilation and evacuation), or ``D'' (dilation and \n     extraction) are done by only a handful of U.S. physicians, \n     including Martin Haskell, MD, of Dayton, Ohio, and, until his \n     recent death, James T. McMahon, MD, of the Los Angeles area. \n     Dr. McMahon said in a 1993 AMNews interview that he had \n     trained about a half-dozen physicians to do the procedure.\n       The procedure usually involves the extraction of an intact \n     fetus, feet first, through the birth canal, with all but the \n     head delivered. The surgeon forces scissors into the base of \n     the skull, spreads them to enlarge the opening, and uses \n     suction to remove the brain.\n       The procedure gained notoriety two years ago, when abortion \n     opponents started running newspaper ads that described and \n     illustrated the method. Their goal was to defeat \n\n[[Page S 18079]]\n     an abortion rights bill then before Congress on grounds it was so \n     extreme that states would have no ability to restrict even \n     late-term abortions on viable fetuses. The bill went nowhere, \n     but strong reaction to the campaign prompted anti-abortion \n     activities to use it again.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                       Mixed feelings in medicine\n\n       The procedure is controversial in the medical community. On \n     the one hand, organized medicine bristles at the notion of \n     Congress attempting to ban or regulate any procedures or \n     practices. On the other hand, even some in the abortion \n     provider community find the procedure difficult to defend.\n       ``I have very serious reservations about this procedure,'' \n     said Colorado physician Warren Hern, MD. The author of \n     Abortion Practice, the nation's most widely used text-book on \n     abortion standards and procedures, Dr. Hern specializes in \n     late-term procedures.\n       He opposes the bill, he said, because he thinks Congress \n     has no business dabbling in the practice of medicine and \n     because he thinks this signifies just the beginning of a \n     series of legislative attempts to chip away at abortion \n     rights. But of the procedure in question he says. ``You \n     really can't defend it. I'm not going to tell somebody else \n     that they should not do this procedure. But I'm not going to \n     do it.''\n       Dr. Hern's concerns center on claims that the procedure in \n     late-term pregnancy can be safest for the pregnant women, and \n     that without this procedure women would have died. ``I would \n     dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to \n     use,'' he said.\n       Turning the fetus to a breech position is ``potentially \n     dangerous,'' he added. ``You have to be concerned about \n     causing amniotic fluid embolism or placental abruption if you \n     do that.''\n       Pamela Smith, MD, director of medical education, Dept. of \n     Ob-Gyn at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago, added two more \n     concerns: cervical incompetence in subsequent pregnancies \n     caused by three days of forceful dilation of the cervix and \n     uterine rupture caused by rotating the fetus within the womb.\n       ``There are absolutely no obstetrical situations \n     encountered in the country which require a partially \n     delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the life of \n     the mother,'' Dr. Smith wrote in a letter to Canady.\n       The procedure also has its defenders. The procedure is a \n     ``well-recognized and safe technique by those who provide \n     abortion care.'' Lewis H. Koplik, MD, an Albuquerque, N.M., \n     abortion provider, said in a statement that appeared in the \n     Congressional Record.\n       ``The risk of severe cervical laceration and the \n     possibility of damage to the uterine artery by a sharp \n     fragment of calvarium is virtually eliminated. Without the \n     release of thromboplastic material from the fetal central \n     nervous system into the maternal circulation, the risk of \n     coagulation problems, DIC [disseminated intravascular \n     coagulation], does not occur. In skilled hands, uterine \n     preformation is almost unknown,'' Dr. Koplik said.\n       Bruce Ferguson, MD, another Albuquerque abortion provider, \n     said in a letter released to Congress that the ban could \n     impact physicians performing late-term abortions by other \n     techniques. He noted that there were ``many abortions in \n     which a portion of the fetus may pass into the vaginal canal \n     and there is no clarification of what is meant by `a living \n     fetus.' Does the doctor have to do some kind of \n     electrocardiogram and brain wave test to be able to prove \n     their fetus was not living before he allows a foot or hand to \n     pass through the cervix?''\n       Apart from medical and legal concerns, the bill's focus on \n     late-term abortion also raises troubling ethical issues. In \n     fact, the whole strategy, according to Rep. Chris Smith (R, \n     N.J.), is to force citizens and elected officials to move \n     beyond a philosophical discussion of ``a woman's right to \n     choose,'' and focus on the reality of abortion. And, he said, \n     to expose those who support ``abortion on demand'' as ``the \n     real extremists.''\n       Another point of contention is the reason the procedure is \n     performed. During the Nov. 1 debate before the House, \n     opponents of the bill repeatedly stated that the procedure \n     was used only to save the life of the mother or when the \n     fetus had serious anomalies.\n       Rep. Vic Fazio (D. Calif.) said, ``Despite the other side's \n     spin doctors--real doctors know that the late-term abortions \n     this bill seeks to ban are rare and they're done only when \n     there is no better alternative to save the woman, and, if \n     possible, preserve her ability to have children.''\n       Dr. Hern said he could not imagine a circumstance in which \n     this procedure would be safest. He did acknowledge that some \n     doctors use skull-decompression techniques, but he added that \n     in those cases fetal death has been induced and the fetus \n     would not purposely be rotated into a breech position.\n       Even some physicians who specialize in this procedure do \n     not claim the majority are performed to save the life of the \n     pregnant woman.\n       In his 1993 interview with AMNews, Dr. Haskell conceded \n     that 80% of his late-term abortions were elective. Dr. \n     McMahon said he would not do an elective abortion after 26 \n     weeks. But in a chart he released to the House Judiciary \n     Committee, ``depression'' was listed most often as the reason \n     for late-term nonelective abortions with maternal \n     indications. ``Cleft lip'' was listed nine times under fetal \n     indications.\n       The accuracy of the article was challenged, two years after \n     publication, by Dr. Haskell and the National Abortion \n     Federation, who told Congress the doctors were quoted ``out \n     of context.'' AMNews Editor Barbara Bolsen defended the \n     article, saying AMNews ``had full documentation of the \n     interviews, including tape recordings and transcripts.''\n       Bolsen gave the committee a transcript of the contested \n     quotes, including the following, in which Dr. Haskell was \n     asked if the fetus was dead before the end of the procedure.\n       ``No it's not. No, it's really not. A percentage are for \n     various numbers of reasons. Some just because of the stress--\n     intrauterine stress during, you know, the two days that the \n     cervix is being dilated. Sometimes the membranes rupture and \n     it takes a very small superficial infection to kill a fetus \n     in utero when the membranes are broken.\n       ``So in my case, I would say probably about a third of \n     those are definitely dead before I actually start to remove \n     the fetus. And probably the other two-thirds are not,'' said \n     Dr. Haskell.\n       In a letter to Congress before his death, Dr. McMahon \n     stated that medications given to the mother induce ``a \n     medical coma'' in the fetus, and ``there is neurological \n     fetal demise.''\n       But Watson Bowes, MD, a maternal-fetal specialist at \n     University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said in a letter \n     to Canday that Dr. McMahon's statement ``suggests a lack \n     of understanding of maternal-fetal pharmacology. . . \n     Having cared for pregnant women who for one reason or \n     another required surgical procedures in the second \n     trimester, I know they were often heavily sedated or \n     anesthetized for the procedures, and the fetuses did not \n     die.''\n\n\n                        Next move in the Senate\n\n       At AMNews press time, the Senate was scheduled to debate \n     the bill. Opponents were lining up to tack on amendments, \n     hoping to gut the measure or send it back to a committee \n     where it could be watered down or rejected.\n       In a statement about the bill, President Clinton did not \n     use the word ``veto.'' But he said he ``cannot support'' a \n     bill that did not provide an exception to protect the life \n     and health of the mother. Senate opponents of the bill say \n     they will focus on the fact that it does not provide such an \n     exception.\n       The bill does provide an affirmative defense to a physician \n     who provides this type of abortion if he or she reasonably \n     believes the procedure was necessary to save the life of the \n     mother and no other method would suffice.\n       But Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D, Colo.) says that's not \n     sufficient. ``This means that it is available to the doctor \n     after the handcuffs have snapped around his or her wrists, \n     bond has been posted, and the criminal trial is under way,'' \n     she said during the House debate.\n       Canady disagrees. ``No physician is going to be prosecuted \n     and convicted under this law if he or she reasonably believes \n     the procedure is necessary to save the life of the mother.''\n\n\n                   Organized medicine positions vary\n\n       The physician community is split on the bill. The \n     California Medical Assn., which says it does not advocate \n     elective abortions in later pregnancy, opposes it as ``an \n     unwarranted intrusion into the physician-patient \n     relationship.'' The American College of Obstetricians and \n     Gynecologists also opposes it on grounds it would ``supersede \n     the medical judgment of trained physicians and . . . would \n     criminalize medical procedures that may be necessary to save \n     the life of a woman,'' said spokeswoman Alice Kirkman.\n       The AMA has chosen to take no position on the bill, \n     although its Council on Legislation unanimously recommended \n     support. AMA Trustee Nancy W. Dickey, MD, noted that although \n     the board considered seriously the council's recommendations, \n     it ultimately decided to take no position, because it had \n     concerns about some of the bill's language and about Congress \n     legislating medical procedures.\n       Meanwhile, each side in the abortion debate is calling news \n     conferences to announce how necessary or how ominous the bill \n     is. Opponents highlight poignant stories of women who have \n     elected to terminate wanted pregnancies because of major \n     fetal anomalies.\n       Rep. Nita Lowey (D. N.Y.) told the story of Claudia Ames, a \n     Santa Monica woman who said the procedure had saved her life \n     and saved her family.\n       Ames told Lowey that six months into her pregnancy, she \n     discovered the child suffered from severe anomalies that made \n     its survival impossible and placed Ames' life at risk.\n       The bill's backers were ``attempting to exploit one of the \n     greatest tragedies any family can ever face by using graphic \n     pictures and sensationalized language and distortions,'' Ames \n     said.\n       Proponents focus on the procedure's cruelty. Frequently \n     quoted is testimony of a nurse, Brenda Shafer, RN, who \n     witnessed three of these procedures in Dr. Haskell's clinic \n     and called it ``the most horrifying experience of my life.\n       ``The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were \n     clasping together. He was kicking his feet.'' Afterwards, she \n     said, ``he threw the baby in a pan.'' She said she saw the \n     baby move. ``I still have nightmares about what I saw.''\n       Dr. Hern says if the bill becomes law, he expects it to \n     have ``virtually no significance'' clinically. But on a \n     political level, ``it is very, very significant.''\n     \n[[Page S 18080]]\n\n       ``This bill's about politics,'' he said, ``it's not about \n     medicine.''\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from California for sharing \ntime and I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of her \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I continue to be astounded when I \nconsider the extent to which a woman's constitutional right to choice \nhas been taken away in this, the 104th Congress.\n  First came the Hyde amendment limiting a poor woman's reproductive \nchoice because Government contributed to the payment of her health \ncare. Then came the battle of parental notification, limiting very \nyoung women in their reproductive choices because of their age--not \ntheir condition. Then came the battle over military hospitals, limiting \nmilitary women in their reproductive choices because they or their \nspouse chose to serve their country. Then came the battle over Federal \nhealth insurance, limiting Federal employees and their reproductive \nchoices because they work for the Government.\n  Now, Madam President, the battle is over this legislation to fine or \njail doctors who perform safe, legal, medical procedures, abortions for \nwomen who need them late in their pregnancy.\n  Madam President, today as it has been since the landmark 1973 Supreme \nCourt decision of Roe v. Wade, the concept of reproductive freedom is \nunder assault. Choice is a matter of freedom. Choice is a fundamental \nissue of the relationship of female citizens to their Government. \nChoice is a barometer of equality and a measure of fairness. Choice is \ncentral to our liberty.\n  While, Madam President, I do not believe in abortion personally, I do \nbelieve very strongly and fundamentally in the right to choose.\n  Today, the assault on reproductive choice has taken on a new \nferocity. The procedure that has become the focus of this newest \nassault on choice is a very rare--which you have heard many times--a \nrare medical procedure used to terminate pregnancies late in the term \nwhen the life or health of the mother is at risk and/or when the fetus \nhas severe--severe--abnormalities.\n  Only one or two doctors in the entire country perform this procedure, \nthe procedure you have heard described. Yes; it is gruesome. But so is \nthe circumstance. This procedure, however, although rare and even \nthough it is gruesome, can be the most medically sound option for \npreserving the health and life of the woman whose life is at stake, the \ncitizen whose life and liberty is at stake.\n  Madam President, H.R. 1833, the bill that this amendment relates to, \nis an unconstitutional, vague ban on the procedure that we have \ndiscussed here on the floor and is the vehicle for the newest assault \non choice.\n  A doctor who performed an abortion, one of these late-term abortions, \nwould face up to 2 years in prison and fines. The doctor and the house \nor the clinic where he or she worked would also be liable for civil \naction brought by the father of a fetus or the maternal parents of the \nwoman, if she was under 18 years old.\n  As I said, this bill is vague. The definition of abortion as covered \nunder this legislation is ``partial birth,'' a term used for its shock \nvalue, Madam President, not for its medical accuracy. There is no such \nmedical term as partial birth.\n  Because doctors cannot agree on what this legislation is intended to \nban, they are going to be frightened from performing legal abortions \nand medically necessary abortions because of the threat of civil or \ncriminal prosecution.\n  This bill further provides no exception in cases where the banned \nprocedure is used to save the life of the mother. Instead, a doctor \nwould be required after being criminally charged to provide affirmative \ndefense. We flip the whole presumption of innocence on its head and \nmake a doctor provide an affirmative defense that he or she reasonably \nbelieved that no other method would save a woman's life.\n  Madam President, this is foolish and dangerous for us to do. The \naffirmative defense will result in doctors going to court and maybe \neven to jail for their efforts to save a citizen's life.\n  Madam President, even if a true life exception is substituted, there \nis no exception in this bill in cases where the health of the mother is \nendangered. It does not allow a doctor to do everything he or she can \nto protect the health and fertility of his or her patient.\n  Madam President, this bill is also the first time, to my knowledge, \nthat Congress has attempted to tell a doctor what specific medical \nprocedures he or she cannot perform. By choosing to arbitrarily \nprohibit one type of procedure and not others--and there are other \noptions as has been discussed--by choosing just one type of procedure \nregardless of the effect on the life and health and the future \nreproduction options of the woman involved, this Congress will be \nmicromanaging decisions that are best made in a physician's office.\n  If a doctor wants to perform an abortion that is covered by this \nbill, it is because he or she considers the procedure to be the most \nmedically sound for the woman who is involved. Women are going to face \nlife and health risks as well as the loss of fertility as they are \nforced--forced--to undergo even more hazardous procedures when their \nown life may be at stake.\n  Madam President, a couple weeks ago the Senate sent this bill to the \nJudiciary Committee for a hearing. At that hearing we were able to \nactually see firsthand some women and talk with some women who had made \nthe hardest choice that any woman can make. Two of the women had the \nprocedure that is referenced in this bill and one woman actually gave \nbirth. All the women had agonized over the decision. It is, after all, \nthe most intimate and most personal decision.\n  Before I talk about the constitutional policy implications of the \nlegislation, I would like to retell the story of one of the women, \nViki, from Naperville, IL. She was at that hearing a few weeks ago but \ndid not have a chance to tell her story. I think it is important that \nher story be told, because I think she is a very brave person to come \nin this present environment and tell the story of what was a \nhorrendous, heart-wrenching episode in her life.\n  Viki and her husband were expecting their third child. At 20 weeks \nshe went for a sonogram and was told by her doctor that she and her \nbaby were completely healthy. She named the baby boy Anthony. At 32 \nweeks, Viki took her two daughters with her to watch their brother on \nthe sonogram. The technician did not say a word during the sonogram and \nasked Viki to come upstairs and talk with the doctor. She thought maybe \nit was because the baby was breech or there was another complication. \nShe is a diabetic and any complication could be serious.\n  This is a picture of Viki and her family. It is a shame she did not \nget a chance to testify 2 weeks ago. The doctor at the time was too \nbusy to see her, but called at 7 o'clock in the morning to say that the \nfemurs, the leg bones, seemed a little short, but assured her there was \na 99-percent chance that nothing was seriously wrong, but asked her to \ncome in for a level 2 ultrasound.\n  Viki and her husband found out after the second ultrasound was \nperformed that their child had no brain--no brain. There were eight \nabnormalities in all. Viki had to make the hardest decision of her \nlife. This is how she explained it: ``I had to remove my son from life \nsupport--that was me.'' For Viki, the hardest thing for her as a \nparent, for any parent, to do is to watch a child be hurt. It is hard \nenough watching a child get teased at the bus station, much less make a \ndecision such as she and her husband had to make.\n  The procedure that she underwent took four visits to the doctor. She \nreceived anesthesia on the first visit. Her son stopped moving on the \nfirst night. She knew at that point that he was gone. This was before \nthe procedure to remove the actual fetus took place.\n  Having a D procedure was particularly important because Viki wanted \nto know if this was something she would pass to her two daughters. With \na D an autopsy can be performed. It was an isolated situation, \nalthough tragic, and her girls will be able to have children of their \nown and not have the abnormalities that Viki faced with her son. Her \nD was the closest thing for her body to natural birth. She was able \nto preserve her fertility, and happily she is now, again, 30 weeks \npregnant and \n\n[[Page S 18081]]\nthe baby that she is carrying looks fine.\n  This procedure, Madam President, that this Congress is talking about \nmicromanaging to make illegal, saved this woman's ability to have other \nchildren, saved this family from having a child with no brain, born \nonly to die moments after he came into this world.\n  Madam President, this is a true story about a real woman and a family \nhandling an awful, horrible situation in the best way that it can. I \nknow we have heard other stories. I think it is important that we put a \nreal face on these stories because this is not some matter of abstract \nlanguage. We have to talk about it in constitutional terms, and we have \nto talk about it in legal terms. We have to talk about it in medical \nterms. But the reality is this Congress is moving into the territory \nthat we have no business in. I think it is important that we put a \nhuman face on it beyond the personal and constitutional implications.\n  I ask the Senator from California how much longer may I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 34 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Under H.R. 1833 women will lose a constitutionally \nbased right. Under Roe versus Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey, \nthe Supreme Court standard is that a State may not prohibit post-\nviability abortions necessary to preserve the life or health of a \nwoman. Under H.R. 1833/S. 939, the only recourse is an affirmative \ndefense and even then, this is only for life.\n  In other words, if you wind up unable to have other children, if you \nwind up ruined for life, that is OK under this bill.\n  While H.R. 1833/S. 939 is focused on late-term abortions, doctors who \nperform early-term abortions by the loosely defined means covered by \nthe bill are subject to the same liability. Choosing to have an \nabortion when the fetus is not yet viable is clearly a constitutionally \nprotected right under Roe versus Wade. This bill changes that.\n  This assault on a woman's constitutional rights and this Congress' \nrelentless attack on a woman's right to choose remind me of a famous \npoem by Martin Niemoller, a Protestant minister held in a German \nconcentration camp for 7 years. I would like to again give you my own, \nmore contemporary version of his parable. I call it ``The Assault on \nReproductive Rights.''\n\n     First they came for poor women and I did not speak out--\n           because I was not a poor woman\n     Then they came for the teenagers and I did not speak out--\n           because I was no longer a teenager.\n     Then they came or women in the military and I did not speak \n           out--because I was not in the military.\n     Then they came for women in the Federal Government and I did \n           not speak out--because I did not work for the \n           Government.\n     Then they came for the doctors and I did not speak out--\n           because I was not a doctor.\n     Then they came for me--and there was no one left to speak out \n           for me.\n  Madam President, the fight on this issue is a quintessential fight \nfor freedom. The issue here is whether or not women who are living, \nbreathing citizens of this United States will enjoy the constitutional \nprotection to make the most personal of all decisions--the decision \nwhether or not to reproduce, and whether or not to sacrifice their \nlives in cases such as that Viki and her family had to go through. That \nis what is at issue here.\n  I am not prepared--and I do not believe that it is appropriate--for \nus to substitute the judgment of the Government, the judgment of the \nMembers of this body, for the judgment of these women, of their \nfamilies, of their doctors, of their priests, of their pastors. I do \nnot think that it is our business to get that involved in an intimate \ndecision such as this--to tell a woman, no, you may not save your life, \nor protect your future fertility because some Congressman had an idea \nthat he wanted to pass a law that restrains you in decisions about your \nown body and your own health. When Viki made the decision to remove her \nchild from life support--her body, and that is what it was--she made a \ndecision with the help of her husband and her doctor that only she \ncould make. The Government has no right to intervene in this \nrelationship between a woman and her body, her doctor, and her God.\n  It is for that reason that I oppose this legislation, and I support \nthe Boxer amendment.\n  I would like to also clarify for the Record, to make clear that there \nis right now in this bill no exception, no exception for life of the \nmother, and that is why the Boxer amendment is so important.\n  Again, we have no right, I believe, to intervene in the relationship \nbetween a woman and her own body, a citizen, in behalf of the fetus \nthat is not yet a citizen. Obviously, we would all want to see life. We \nall support the idea of a right to life. Of course someone has a right \nto life. But do not living have rights also? And is not this \nConstitution written for them? And if it is written for them, is it not \ninappropriate for this Congress to intervene in areas in which we are \nnot expert and we do not have the capability? I mean, we have no right \nat all to legislate.\n  And with that, Madam President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before my colleague from Illinois leaves the floor, I \nthank her especially for the updated version of that very famous poem \nthat came out of the Nazi era. Of course, the point is that we need to \nspeak up when people are losing their rights, and sometimes it is a \nlonely battle and sometimes we may lose it. But I believe deeply that \nAmerica has a heart and soul and that men and women of goodwill, if \nthey truly listen to this debate, recognize what it is about, and that \nis what we do trust each other to make tragic, personal, private \ndecisions? Or do we want to hand it over to Senators and \nCongresspeople?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is what the Senator pointed out. And I come down, \nand the Senator from Illinois comes down, and I know my colleague \npresiding tonight comes down on the side of allowing families, families \nlike this, families like Vikki Stella's from Illinois to make those \nawfully difficult decisions.\n  I also wish to thank my colleague for really reviewing for us all of \nthe things that have happened to women in this Congress. Many people do \nnot realize that. When she gave us that updated version of the poem, \nshe pointed out the poor women on Medicaid who do not have really have \nthe right to choose anymore because they cannot afford it. This \nCongress will not allow them to use their Medicaid insurance to cover \ntheir right to choose; women in the District of Columbia who happen to \nhave the misfortune of having Senators and Congressmen tell them what \nto do; Federal employees, women who pay for their own health insurance, \na great part of it, no longer can use that insurance; and now any woman \nin America, any woman in America of any income level in any \ncircumstance is being hit in her heart by the Smith-Dole bill, and it \nis very hurtful.\n  I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  I never cease to find it a little amusing--I know this gets on some \ndifficult ground in these debates, but most of this debate takes place \nwith people who themselves have never been pregnant.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Quite frankly, having been there--and as the \nSenator knows, everyone in this Chamber knows, there is nothing more \nimportant in my entire life than my son Matthew, but I can tell you I \ngained 40 pounds, my teeth started to rot, I wound up hospitalized \nthree times. I mean, who has not been through this, who has not been \nthrough this who has actually been through a pregnancy? So who can \nrelate to the tragedy and to the emotion and to the physical demand of \nbeing in Viki's shoes, being here, pregnant out to here. Remember what \nit was like when you were pregnant out to here? I was like that in \nJune. It was miserable. Pregnant out to here, only to discover the \nchild that you are carrying, that you have an identification with has \nno brain, and this legislation would force that child to be born?\n  I thank the Senator from California for yielding, but I say to you \nthat I think it is also very important that \n\n[[Page S 18082]]\nthose who cannot be pregnant really should think twice before they talk \nabout this issue.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, she makes a very good point, because \nwe hear men in this Chamber talk about the joys of birth and the travel \nthrough the birth canal, and, yes, we hope every pregnancy is a joyous, \nwonderful, problem-free moment for every single woman in this country, \nregardless of her status in the country.\n  Unfortunately, we know also that is not the case and sometimes the \nbaby is not safe in the womb and sometimes the mother could contract a \nterrible disease such as cancer and is faced with a choice where, if \nshe carries through with the pregnancy, she could lose her life. And to \nhave people in this Chamber stand up and say they want to be in that \nliving room, in that hospital room, in that family conversation, \nfrankly, makes me feel sick because we were not elected to be part of \nthis family or any other family. We have our own families. Let us take \ncare of our own families. And let us take care of the larger American \nfamily. But do not get into the private lives of these people. You have \nno right to do that. Nobody voted for you to do that. And that is what \nthis is about.\n  Coreen Costello, the woman I have talked about over these last couple \nof days, said it best. When she found out this tragic news, she fell to \nher knees and prayed. She is very religious, very religious. She is a \nconservative Republican. She does not believe in abortion. And she said \nthe last thing I wanted at that moment was a politician telling me what \nto do. And yet this bill would deny the Coreen Costellos and the Viki \nWilsons an option to save their life, to protect their fertility, and \ntheir health because a majority of men in this Senate decided they know \nbetter than Viki and Viki's husband and Viki's doctors. What arrogance \nof power. That is what this debate is all about.\n  Madam President, I would like to be told when I have 10 minutes \nremaining on my side.\n  I am proud to add as original cosponsors to the Boxer amendment \nSenator Brown, Senator Specter, Senator Murray, Senator Lautenberg, and \nSenator Snowe. I ask unanimous consent that that be made part of the \nRecord. And of course, Senator Moseley-Braun, whom we have already \nadded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will open up this debate by saying I do not appreciate \nwhen my comments are taken out of context. When I heard about the so-\ncalled life-of-the-mother exception, which is absolutely not a life-of-\nthe-mother exception, I was elated that the Senator from New Hampshire \nwas admitting that those of us who said there was no life exception in \nhis bill were right, he finally agreed with us.\n  When I looked at the amendment, it was entitled ``Life-of-the-Mother \nException.'' I thought it was going to read like all of the life-of-\nthe-mother exceptions which are very straightforward and simply say \nnotwithstanding anything in this bill, there is an exception for the \nlife of the mother. But, no, when I finally read it, I realized, if you \nwill, it is a partial life exception. And this is what I said on the \nsame night.\n\n       I have now had an opportunity to read it.\n\n  Meaning the amendment.\n\n       I want everyone to know that it is really not an exception \n     for the life of the mother because what it says is, \n     essentially, that this procedure will be banned except it \n     will not apply to a partial-birth abortion that is necessary \n     to save the life of the mother whose life is endangered by a \n     physical disorder, illness, or injury.\n       I say to my friend, this is not a life-of-the-mother \n     exception. That is a pre-existing situation. So, yes, if a \n     woman had diabetes or some other disease, there would be an \n     exception, but if, in fact, the birth itself endangered her \n     life there would be no exception.\n\n  That is what I said after I saw the amendment. So let us get that \nclear, folks. Let us argue about what the differences are here and not \ntry to trap each other into putting a spin on what we are doing.\n  Now, of course, I say to my colleagues, vote for the Smith-Dole \namendment because at least it will help save the life of three or four \nwomen out of the couple of hundred a year that find themselves in this \ncircumstance. No problem--vote for it. But then vote for the Boxer-\nBrown-Specter-Murray-Lautenberg-Snowe-Moseley-Braun amendment because \nthat addresses a true exception for the life of the mother and an \nexception when serious adverse health risks to the mother exist.\n  Madam President, as I have said since this debate started, ``partial-\nbirth abortion'' is not a medical term. There is no such thing as a \n``partial-birth abortion.'' No medical text defines ``partial-birth \nabortion.'' None of the doctors who gave testimony at the Judiciary \nCommittee could define it. It is a made-up term. It is made up by the \nantichoice forces so that people will get their emotions going.\n  What is the picture that emerges when you say partial-birth abortion? \nIt sounds like a baby is being born and all of a sudden the mother \nsays, I change my mind. How ridiculous that is. The fact of the matter \nis, there is no such thing. It is a late-term abortion that is done in \nan emergency procedure in a tragic situation. And that is what they are \ngoing about banning here, a procedure that is used, that is the safest, \ndoctors say, many doctors say, to save the life of the mother or \nprotect her health, her future futility.\n  Now, another thing that has happened over the past few nights--I say \nto my friend from New Hampshire, he and I have done this now running, I \nthink it is 3 nights running, plus we did it before when this first \ncame up, plus we have been on national television debating each other \non this--he uses the term ``abortionist.'' He uses the term \n``abortionist.''\n  I again want to say as we debate this emotional issue, a doctor who \nperforms an abortion is a doctor. A doctor who performs a legal medical \nprocedure is a doctor, not an abortionist. That doctor also delivers \nmany, many babies. That doctor is an ob-gyn and deserves respect. If \nyou want to make abortion illegal, that is your right. That is your \nright. I applaud that right. But do not do it through the backdoor like \nthis, and do not call a doctor who performs a legal procedure an \nabortionist.\n  Then there is mention this one doctor did not come to the hearing. He \nwas invited. That is right. I put in the Record a letter from his \nlawyer. This doctor, his life has been threatened. He has been \nharassed. And we stand up on this floor and call a doctor an \nabortionist when we are having such an emotional debate.\n  I applaud Chairman Hatch of the Judiciary Committee who came down and \nmade a speech on this and said, ``I endorse this bill. I support it. \nBut I abhor violence.'' We have to resolve this as human beings with \ndisagreements.\n  It does not help to raise emotion and attack a physician or a group \nof people who have chosen to be ob-gyn's who, by the way, vehemently \noppose this bill, their organization, the American College of \nObstetricians & Gynecologists. And, yes, we heard from one nurse who \nserved 3 days in a clinic who was disputed by her supervisor, but who \nsaid this was a terrible procedure. And that is her right to believe \nthat and to say that. But the American Nurses Association--and how many \nare in that association? Many thousands, and we will have that number \ntomorrow; many thousands--they absolutely oppose this legislation. \nThese are nurses who want to help people live. They want to help people \nlive.\n  Why on Earth would we ban a procedure that doctors have testified is \nnecessary to save the life of the mother? Why would we do it? And who \nare we to do this? This is not a medical school. This is not an ethics \npanel of a medical school. This is not a board of doctors who sit \naround and discuss these issues and understand them. I repeat Senator \nKennedy's comment that he made in the Judiciary Committee: ``Some \nSenators are practicing medicine without a license.''\n  We are over our heads if we think we can sit here and because \nsomebody got a drawing explaining the consequences of a procedure, a \nmedical procedure. That is not our job. I do not know anyone who ran \nfor the U.S. Senate who said, ``I'm an expert in medical procedures. \nVote for me.''\n  We have heard the women's stories. We know how important this \nprocedure was to real women and to their families. We then hear time \nand time again that many of these abortions were elective--elective. \nThat is a medical term. That is a medical term. It refers to anything \nother than a life-saving abortion. So we bandy about words like \n\n[[Page S 18083]]\n``elective'' without knowing what they mean. We talk about medical \nprocedures as if we are physicians.\n  I have just learned that the American Nurses Association, they do not \nrepresent thousands of members; they represent 2.2 million nurses. So, \nyes, we had one nurse who served 3 days who came out against this \nprocedure; and the American Nurses Association, who represents 2.2 \nmillion nurses, says, ``Please vote down this ill-conceived bill.''\n  This is not about sex selection or eye-color preferences. I resent \nthe fact that the Senator from New Hampshire would attempt to make a \nstatement that Senators who believe there ought to be a life and health \nexception for the mother support those kinds of abortions. I guess he \ndoes not understand the law of the land, Roe versus Wade, which says \nthat subsequent to viability the State has an interest in protecting \nfetal life, and as long as it takes into consideration the life and \nhealth of the mother, the State can pass laws that certainly prohibit \nabortions for eye color or sex selection.\n  This debate is not about unwanted pregnancy. This is about wanted and \nloved babies, children planned and desired by their families, but \nsomething horrible happened in the end of the pregnancy, either to the \nwoman in her health or to the fetus, anomalies incompatible with life.\n  I knew one woman who was diagnosed with cancer in the beginning of \nthe last trimester of her pregnancy and was told if she carried the \nbaby to term, she would die. She had to face that with her husband. \nThey had other children. But she desperately wanted this child. In the \nend, they decided to save her life.\n  Who is this Senate to tell her she did the wrong thing? Who is this \nSenate to tell her doctor he cannot use a procedure that might save her \nlife?\n  Viki Wilson has two other children. This is Viki Wilson. She is 39. \nHer husband is Bill. Do you know what he does? He is an emergency room \nphysician. Do you know what she does? She is a registered nurse. These \nare their two children. John is 10 and Katie is 8. They happen to live \nin Fresno, CA. He saves lives in the emergency room. He exposes himself \nto great danger working there. She is a nurse. She saves lives. And \nSenators on this floor think they have a right to interfere with their \npersonal decisions? What an outrage.\n  Their third child, Abigail--they gave her a name--was their baby. Her \nbrain had formed two-thirds outside the head. I want to talk about her \nstory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Chair advises the Senator \nshe has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is a story that will move you. It is a \nstory that was told to the Judiciary Committee, and while you are going \nto see posters of part of a woman's body drawn like a cartoon, as if a \nwoman is simply a vessel, we are putting a face on this. We are putting \na face on this.\n  We know that Viki's testimony moved the people who heard it.\n  Tammy Watt's daughter, McKenzie, had no eyes, six fingers, six toes \nand large kidneys which were failing. The baby had a mass growing \noutside of her stomach involving her bowel and bladder and affecting \nher heart and other major organs, and the doctor said they had to use \nthe procedure that this bill will outlaw.\n  Because we are looking for Viki's story, we may tell it tomorrow. I \nam going to keep her face up here, and I am going to go on.\n  This bill criminalizes the late-term abortion procedure by placing \nthe burden on the physician to persuade the judge or jury that ``no \nother medical procedure would suffice to save the life of the woman.''\n  That means a doctor using this procedure can be hauled into court, \nand I will tell you, the chamber of horrors begins.\n  Mr. President, I am going to close debate tonight, after my friend \nfrom New Hampshire has concluded his presentation, by reading Viki \nWilson's story. But at this time, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield myself 11 minutes.\n  This is really an interesting debate, and I said last night, Viki \nWilson's story is truly a tragedy and my heart goes out to Viki Wilson. \nI understand the difficulty and horrible situation that she went \nthrough.\n  But let me read a paragraph from Viki Wilson's testimony. Viki \nWilson, before the Senate Judiciary Committee just recently:\n\n       My daughter died with dignity inside my womb. She was not \n     stabbed in the back of the head with scissors. No one dragged \n     her out half alive and killed her. We would never have \n     allowed that.\n\n  My bill, the bill that is on the floor before us, or the amendments, \nwould not have precluded Viki Wilson from that procedure. Viki Wilson \nherself just admitted she would not have done that procedure.\n  I also want to respond to Senator Boxer on a couple of other points. \nShe made much of the term ``elective procedure,'' as if somebody made \nit up on the floor when talking about abortion.\n  This is Dr. Harlan Giles' testimony in court where he says as \nfollows:\n\n       An elective abortion is a procedure carried out for a \n     patient for whom there is no identifiable maternal or fetal \n     indication; that is to say, the patient feels it would be in \n     her best interest to terminate the pregnancy either on \n     social, emotional, financial grounds, et cetera. If there are \n     no medical indications from either a fetal or maternal \n     standpoint, we refer to the termination as elective.\n\n  So I think that is pretty clear that I did not make it up and that it \nis accepted.\n\n  I am also looking at the Standard College Dictionary, published by \nHarcourt Brace. I do not know whether that is acceptable to the Senator \nfrom California or not. But the definition of an abortionist is one who \ncauses abortion. That is pretty clear. I do not know why anybody would \nobject to the term ``abortionist'' when someone being called an \nabortionist causes an abortion. It seems to be awfully defensive to me.\n  I want to respond to the Senator from Illinois, and I am sorry she is \nnot here on the floor, in regard to her remarks. The Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, a few minutes ago said that this bill \nis unconstitutional. Even in Roe versus Wade --I want to point out, she \nsaid it was unconstitutional, but even in Roe versus Wade, the decision \nthat is thrown around here all the time by the pro-choice people, \nobviously, the Supreme Court said that the born child, that is the \nexact terminology, ``the born child'' is a ``person'' entitled to ``the \nequal protection of the law.''\n  Let me repeat that, because the Senator from Illinois said this bill \nis unconstitutional. Even in Roe versus. Wade, the Supreme Court said \nthat the born child is a person entitled to the equal protection of the \nlaw.\n  Now, I ask any reasonable person, if there is anybody left on the \nface of the Earth who is undecided--hopefully somebody may be in the \nSenate because we are the ones who have to vote; hopefully, I pray, \nthere might be somebody out there listening and trying to make up their \nmind--how can anyone reasonably say that a child, feet, legs, toes, \nlittle soft rear end, torso, shoulders, arms, hands, part of the neck \nout of the birth canal, born is not a child or a person because the \nhead still remains inside the birth canal? How can anyone say that? \nWhat is not child or not person about what the doctor is holding in his \nhands?\n  Suppose it was reversed, Mr. President, and the child's head came \nfirst and he began to breathe, is he then born? You bet he is. You bet \nhe is, because that abortionist cannot do a thing to that child when \nthe head comes out first and that child is breathing. He cannot do \nanything to it, and my colleagues know that.\n  So what do we do? We reverse the position in the womb, so that the \nfeet come first, with forceps. We reverse the position in the womb. It \nis a deliberate act, the most horrible act against an innocent child. \nThat is what we are talking about here. That is what we are talking \nabout here.\n\n  That is not a ``partial birth.'' What is that? That is a child. How \ncan anyone say that does not deserve protection under the Constitution \nof the United States? With the greatest respect for the Senator from \nIllinois, I sure do not read that in the Constitution. I sure do not \nread that in Roe versus Wade. A born child. Now, if the Senator from \nIllinois, or any other Senator, wants to take the floor and say here \nand now that that is not a child, 90 percent of \n\n[[Page S 18084]]\nwhich is in the hands of that person--call him a doctor, an \nabortionist, call him what you want--and is wiggling, moving, and you \ncan feel the heartbeat, of course, and you can feel the movement of the \nchild--it is wiggling. That is not a child? What is it? My God, what is \nit? Let us be serious. Of course it is a child. And you deliberately \nreverse the position in the uterus to make that child come out feet \nfirst.\n  A ``chamber of horrors,'' my colleague said. You bet it is. It is a \nchamber of horrors in the United States of America. And I have to stand \nhere with some of my colleagues and try to stop something that should \nnot be happening. I heard a lot about doctors and OB-GYN's. No one \ntestified in that hearing who performed one of these, and no one--no \none--including Viki Wilson and others, and including the young woman \nthat Senator Moseley-Braun spoke about, had a partial-birth abortion, \nbecause a partial-birth abortion involves killing a child by inserting \na catheter and scissors in the back of the head, in the canal. That is \na partial-birth abortion. That is what I am stopping. We are not \nstopping anything else.\n  I do not know if the Senator from California knows Mary Davenport, \nOB-GYN, Oakland, CA. She wrote to me on December 1, 1995:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: I am writing to you in support of the \n     partial-birth abortion bill. There is no medical indication \n     for this procedure, and the performance of this operation is \n     totally in opposition to 2,000 years of Hippocratic medical \n     ethics. Please do your best to eliminate this procedure. It \n     is not done in any other nation of the world.\n\n  If you think I solicited that letter, I have 250 more of them from \nOB-GYN's all over America who are outraged and disgusted and horrified \nthat we would do this to our children. What kind of a country are we?\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining on my \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to retain 2 minutes of my \ntime, if the Chair will let me know when I have used 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have just heard a very loud and angry voice. I do \nnot know who that anger is aimed at. I do not know if it is aimed at \nthe Senators who disagree. I do not know who it is aimed at.\n  We live in a world where we do not know what lies ahead and down the \nroad. We pray to God that every birth experience that we will have in \nour own personal families and everyone's will be a good one, and that \nthe babies will be healthy.\n  I want to say that the anger that you just saw here displayed on this \nfloor, in reality, is aimed at families like this in the picture. That \nis who it is aimed at. These are the families that are the losers. \nThese are the families who will lose a mom if this bill goes forward. \nWhy do I say that? Because doctors have testified that it is the safest \nprocedure to use in the late term.\n  I am going to read you Viki Wilson's statement, and then I am going \nto ask you whether you believe Viki Wilson deserves that kind of anger \nthat we just heard on this floor.\n  This is Viki here in the photo. She is a nurse. This is her husband, \nwho is a doctor in an emergency room.\n\n       At 36 weeks of pregnancy, all of our dreams and happy \n     expectations came crashing down around us. My doctor ordered \n     an ultrasound at that time and detected what all my previous \n     prenatal testing failed to detect, an encephalocele. That is \n     a brain growing outside the head. Approximately two-thirds of \n     my baby's brain had formed on the outside of her skull and, \n     literally, I fell to my knees from shock because, being in \n     pediatrics, I realized that she would not survive outside my \n     womb.\n       My doctor desperately tried to figure out a way to save \n     this pregnancy. All my medical rationality went out the \n     window. I thought there's got to be a way. Let's do a brain \n     transplant. That is how irrational I was. I wanted this baby. \n     My husband and I were praying that there would be a new \n     surgical way, but all the experts concurred that Abigail \n     could not survive outside my womb, could not survive the \n     birthing process because of size of her anomaly. Basically, \n     her head would have been crushed and she would have \n     suffocated, and that would have been her demise, coming \n     through my birth canal. Because of her anomaly, it was also \n     feared that had she come through the birth canal, my cervix \n     would have ruptured.\n       The doctor explained to me that even if I had gone into \n     spontaneous labor--\n\n  Which, by the way, my colleagues say is an alternative.\n\n     More than likely my uterus would have ruptured, rendering me \n     sterile, and that was not an acceptable option. It was also \n     discovered during one of my exams. I kept crying on the \n     examining table, saying, ``How could this be? You know, there \n     are such strong baby movements.'' And they said, ``I am \n     sorry, Viki, those are seizures.'' My immediate response was, \n     ``Do a C-section and get her out.'' ``Viki, we do C-sections \n     to save babies. We can't save her, and a C-section in your \n     condition is too dangerous, and I can't justify those \n     risks.''\n       The biggest question then became for my husband and I. A \n     high power had already decided that my baby was going to die. \n     The question was, how is she going to die?\n       We wanted to help her leave this world as painlessly and \n     peacefully as possible and in a way that protected my life \n     and my health, to allow us to have more children. We agonized \n     and we prayed for a miracle.\n       During our drive to Los Angeles to see the specialist we \n     chose our daughter's name. We named her Abigail, the name \n     that my grandmother has always wanted for a grandchild. We \n     decided if she were to be named Abigail, her great \n     grandmother would be able to recognize her in Heaven. You \n     think of those things when you are going through a crises \n     like this.\n       Losing Abigail was the hardest thing that ever happened to \n     us in our lives. After we went home, I went into the nursery, \n     held her clothes, crying and thinking I will never be able to \n     tell her that I love her. I have often wondered why this \n     happened to us. What did we do to deserve this pain?\n       I am a practicing Catholic and I could not help but believe \n     God had some reason for giving me such a burden. Then I found \n     out about this legislation and I knew then and there that \n     Abigail's life had special meaning.\n       I think God knew I would be strong enough to come here and \n     tell you my story, to stop this legislation from passing and \n     causing incredible devastation for other families like ours \n     because there will be other families in our situation, \n     because prenatal testing is not infallible, and I urge you, \n     please, do not take away the safest method known.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n\n       I told my Monsignor at my parish that I was coming here to \n     Washington, and he supported me and he said, ``Viki, what \n     happened to you was not about choice. You did not have a \n     choice. What you did was about preserving your life.'' I was \n     grateful for his words and I agree, this is not about choice. \n     This is a medical necessity. It is about life and health.\n       My kids attend a Catholic school where a playground was \n     named in Abigail's honor. I believe that God gave me the \n     intelligence to make my own decisions, knowing that I am the \n     one who has to live with the consequences.\n       My husband said to me, as I was getting on the plane coming \n     here to Washington, ``Viki, please make sure this Congress \n     realizes this would truly, truly be the Cruelty to Families \n     Act.''\n       So, again, for us, for future families, and for more and \n     more families. We are all sitting at home thinking, this is \n     1995, no way in a rational situation are they going to see \n     the necessity of this legislation. They are going to realize \n     that when they hear our stories.\n\n  Mr. President, why are we getting angry at women like this? Why are \nwe getting angry at husbands like this? Why are we getting angry at \nfamilies like this? What right do we have to get angry at decent, \nreligious, family-loving people like this? To stand on this floor and \nwave our arms at people like this, because that is what this is about.\n  The Smith-Dole exception for life of the woman is not an exception. \nIt only deals with women who come in with a preexisting condition or \ninjury. I pray--I pray--that the Senate will be courageous--because it \nis very difficult to explain this in 5 minutes to my colleagues--that \nthey will support the Boxer - Brown - Specter - Lautenberg - Moseley - \nBraun - Murray - Snowe amendment. It is bipartisan, it is the right \nthing to do.\n  We have come together as family, loving Members of this U.S. Senate. \nWe \n\n[[Page S 18085]]\nhave reached across the aisle that divides us, Mr. President. We are \nstanding for these families.\n  I hope we will lower our voices, because there should not be room for \nthat kind of anger, in my humble opinion. We are trying to reach a \nrational decision on a heart-wrenching issue here. We should not be \nangry at each other. We should not be angry at families like this or to \nthe doctors these families turn to in the most difficult circumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 5 minutes \n18 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield myself 18 seconds and the remainder of the time to \nthe Senator from Ohio.\n  I say in response to the Senator from California, if the 800 children \nwho were perfectly normal electively aborted could speak here on the \nfloor today, they would be angry, too.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I think all the arguments have been made. \nThat usually does not stop us. We continue to make them and will \nprobably make some more tomorrow.\n  Let me try to be very, very brief in closing. I think it is \nimportant, as I said 2 days ago on this floor, we keep our eye on the \nball, we keep our eye on what this debate is about, what is relevant \nand what is not relevant.\n  The horrible tragedy that the Senator from Illinois described a few \nminutes ago, the horrible tragedies that my friend from California \ncontinues to describe are horrible. They are tragic. Everyone was moved \nin the committee. I had tears in my eyes before I left the room \nlistening to those horrible tragedies. Our heart goes out to these \nfamilies. But the fact is these horrible cases are not relevant to what \nwe are talking about. Viki Wilson did not have this procedure.\n  Let me repeat for my friends on the floor and my friends who may be \nwatching this on TV that Viki Wilson did not have this procedure. I do \nnot know how many times we have to say it. That is what the facts are. \nNone of the three women did. It is simply not true.\n  Let me read from the proposed statute. ``As used in this section, the \nterm `partial-birth abortion' means an abortion in which the person \nperforming the abortion partially vaginally delivers a living fetus \nbefore killing the fetus and completing the delivery.'' That is not \nwhat happened in these particular cases, however sad they say they are.\n  Let us keep our eye on the ball. Let us keep our eye on the ball and \nhave relevant debate in regard to saving the life of the mother.\n  The bill, as Senator Smith introduced it, had an affirmative defense. \nThe amendment that Senator Dole has proposed should take any doubt away \nthat it is covered because it puts it right in the statute itself--puts \nthat exception, the life-of-the-mother exception. But even, in a sense, \nof more significance is we will not get to this situation because there \nhas been no credible evidence at all in the hearings--none--that this \nprocedure would ever be used to save the life of the mother. That \nevidence was just to the contrary. The evidence was that there were \nother procedures that would be used. This would not be used. You would \nnot use the procedure. The evidence was it would take 3 days, which \nthis procedure does.\n  Dr. Smith of Chicago, IL, and Mt. Sinai Hospital, a very credible \nwitness, testified this is simply not the standard of care. Let me \nquote a portion of the testimony from the hearing. If anyone has the \ndoubt about the relevancy, look at this on page 78 of the hearing by \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n       Now, this insinuates that this is a standard of care to \n     take care of a trapped fetal head on a breech deliver. This \n     is totally untrue, and I have provided for you from Williams \n     Obstetrics the techniques that are used by obstetricians to \n     deal with this problem. Those techniques include relaxing the \n     womb with halifane or with anesthesia, cutting the cervix, in \n     limited circumstances if you are going to do a Cesarean \n     section to save a term baby, you can do that. And if the baby \n     has what we call hydrocephalus, or water on the brain, you \n     insert a needle and drain that fluid.\n\n  The testimony is very, very clear. Of the other procedures that you \nuse, this is simply not one of them at all.\n  Again, Mr. President, let us keep our eye on the ball. Let us talk \nabout this in a rationale way. Let us talk about what is relevant and \nwhat is not relevant.\n  Time and time again on this floor the argument has been made that if \nyou support this bill, it is an attack on Roe versus Wade. I would \nsubmit that flies in the face of any rational discussion about what Roe \nversus Wade really means and a correct interpretation of it.\n  Pro-choice individuals in the House of Representatives, such as \nRepresentatives Kennedy, Molinari, Gephardt, Traficant, each one voted \nin favor of this. I do not want to put words in their mouths, but I \nwill simply say that a person who is pro-choice could very well support \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, a person who is pro-choice could very \nconsistently support this bill as these pro-choice Representatives in \nthe House of Representatives clearly did. A pro-choice person can \nsupport this simply by believing, by saying, by arguing that there is \nsome limit to what we will permit; there is some limit to what a \ncivilized people tolerate.\n  Again, I do not want to put words in their mouths. But I think that \nclearly is a consistent position with being pro-choice.\n  So this is not an attack on Roe versus Wade. You simplistically could \nargue that. But I think it is very, very incorrect.\n  My friend from California talked about the fact that ``America does \nhave a heart and soul.'' Yes, we have a heart and soul. That is why we \nare on the floor. That is why Senator Smith introduced this bill. This \nis why people across this country--once they learned about the facts of \nthis procedure--are simply saying, ``No, it is wrong. We cannot \ntolerate it. We cannot permit it.''\n  My friend talked about the arrogance of power, that we are somehow \narrogant to be making this argument. It is not arrogance. I think it \nwould be, quite frankly, not arrogance but indifference for us to turn \nour back on this horrible, horrible procedure.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my friend from California talked about the \nanger. Who is this directed at, this anger? This anger is not directed \nat anybody, not a person. It is directed at a procedure that a \ncivilized society simply should not permit.\n  Mr. President, we will surely continue this debate tomorrow.\n  At this point, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, this has been a very tough debate, and I have 4 \nminutes left. I am not going to use it. I know the majority leader is \nready to say good-night to all of us for the evening. So maybe we can \nhave some semblance of some sort of dinner.\n  Mr. President, this has been probably the harshest debate we have had \nto date on this topic. I think it is so important that when we debate \neach other, we do it right on the mark, that we get to our differences. \nI have told some heart-wrenching stories, and these stories were told \nbefore the Judiciary Committee by people like Viki Wilson, a nurse, a \npracticing Catholic. Her husband is an emergency room doctor.\n  We have here Coreen Costello, whose story I have told a number of \ntimes, a conservative Republican, who had been completely against \nabortion until she faced this tragedy. And she came and told her story.\n  Then my friends on the other side said: Wait a minute. They made a \nmistake, these women. They did not have the kind of procedure that we \nare trying to outlaw.\n  My friends, that is an interesting debating topic, but do not tell \nthese people what procedure they went through. They read the definition \nin your bill. Viki Wilson is a nurse. Her husband is \n\n[[Page S 18086]]\na doctor. They read the bill--the doctor that performed this, a doctor \nthat you have attacked over and over again, Dr. James McMahon, who was \nsummoned by Representative Canady to testify because he performed the \nvery procedure you wish to outlaw.\n  So if you want to speak out against the Boxer-Brown-Specter-Moseley-\nBraun-Snowe amendment, et al., you should. You should speak out against \nour amendment. You should say there should be no exception for the life \nand serious health consequences to a woman. But do not say that these \nwomen do not know what they are talking about and their families do not \nknow what they are talking about, when, in fact, your side has named \nthe very doctor that they used for this late-term abortion, your side \nhas named him and paraded his name around because he used that very \nprocedure you wish to outlaw.\n  So, Mr. President, this has been a tough night. We have heard raised \nvoices. It has not been pleasant. As a matter of fact, this has been \nthe most unpleasant week that I can remember here in a long time for me \npersonally, because, yes, I think it is arrogant to insert a politician \ninto this woman's life, into this man's life, and into these children's \nlives. I do not think that we have the wisdom to know better how they \nshould handle a tragedy such as the tragedy they had to handle.\n  And I hope and I pray that the bipartisan amendment that I have \noffered, and which we have reached across the aisle to work together to \nprotect families like this, passes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18071-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18086-S18087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FLAG DESECRATION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Senate Joint \nResolution 31 regarding the desecration of the flag.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S.J. Res. 31, a joint resolution proposing an \n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States to grant \n     Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States:\n         Bob Dole, Orrin Hatch, Conrad Burns, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, Slade Gorton, Craig Thomas, Alan Simpson, \n           Larry Craig, Trent Lott, Connie Mack, Don Nickles, \n           Spencer Abraham, John Ashcroft, John Warner, Chuck \n           Grassley, and Strom Thurmond.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we have \nbeen attempting--and have wasted the whole day--to bring up the flag \namendment. We were precluded from doing that by the efforts of the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. He has every right to do \nthat. I know he is not for the flag amendment, but he indicates he does \nnot mind if we vote on it.\n  But I wanted to point out that tomorrow is Pearl Harbor day. Tomorrow \nis December 7. On a Sunday morning 54 years ago, more than 2,300 brave \nAmericans lost their lives during the raid on the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \nAs a testament to their valor, some of the dead are permanently \nentombed in the U.S.S. Arizona, one of the ships sunk during the \nattack.\n\n  As World War II raged on, thousands of other brave American soldiers \nfollowed their country's flag into battle. The great sacrifices made by \nour fighting men and women during this war and in subsequent \nconflicts--Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Somalia--reflect the \ncourage and strength of character of the American people.\n  Our flag is the unique and beloved symbol of these qualities. \nRepresenting Americans of every race, creed, and social background, the \nflag is also the one symbol that brings to life the phrase ``E Pluribus \nUnum''--Out of many, one.\n  So it would seem to me that as we look back over the history of \nAmerica, one of our most enduring national images is the famous picture \nof six courageous Americans--Sgt. Michael Trank, Cpl. Harlan Block, \nPfc. Hamilton Hayes, Pfc. Rene Arthur Gagnon, Pfc. Franklin Runyon, and \nPharmacist's Mate John Henry Bradley--who risked their lives to raise \nOld Glory at the top of Iwo Jima's Mount Suribachi.\n  These men were not constitutional scholars. They were not legal \nexperts. They were young enlisted men, like so many of the 6,000 \nAmerican soldiers who gave their lives to their country during the \ndeadly ascent up that hill.\n  Because of the sacrifices of these men and countless thousands like \nthem, I support this amendment. Because of the flag's unique status as \nthe symbol of the American spirit and experience, I believe it deserves \nconstitutional protection.\n\n\n                      amending the bill of rights\n\n  Now, there are those who charge the supporters of the flag amendment \nwith attempting to amend the Bill of Rights. I strongly disagree with \nthis characterization.\n  It is the Supreme Court--and more precisely five Justices on the \ncourt--who amended the bill rights when they concluded in the Texas \nversus Johnson decision that the Act of flag-burning was \nconstitutionally-protected speech. This misguided ruling effectively \noverturned 48 State statutes and a Federal law proscribing flag \ndesecration. Most of these statutes had been on the books for decades, \nwithout threatening any of our freedoms, including our freedom of \nspeech guaranteed by the first amendment.\n\n  And, after all, the first amendment is not absolute. One cannot use \nlibel to convey an opinion and claim first amendment protection. \nObscenity, and fighting words, and yelling fire in a crowded theater, \nall fall outside the first amendment's free-speech guarantee.\n  In fact, even some of the strongest supporters of the first amendment \nnever imagined that the act--the act--of flag-burning would merit \nconstitutional protection.\n  As Justice Hugo Black, considered by many legal experts to be a \nfirst-amendment absolutist, once put it: ``It passes my belief that \nanything in the Federal Constitution bars a State from making the \ndeliberate burning of the American flag an offense.'' Or as former \nChief Justice Earl Warren explained: ``I believe that the States and \nthe Federal Government do have the power to protect the flag from acts \nof desecration and disgrace * * *''\n  So, Mr. President, it's time for a little reality check: We can pass \nlaws making it illegal to destroy U.S. currency, or deface your own \nmailbox, or even rip the warranty label off your own bedroom mattress. \nBut, according to the Supreme Court, if you want to burn our Nation's \nmost cherished symbol, the flag, just go right ahead.\n  And that is why we need a flag amendment: not to amend the Bill of \nRights, not to change the first amendment, but to correct the Supreme \nCourt's own red-white-and-blue blunder.\n  Let me make another point: The Framers of the Constitution \nintentionally made the amendment process a difficult one, requiring the \nassent of two-thirds of each House of Congress and three-fourths of the \nState legislatures before an amendment's ratification. These sensible \nhurdles were designed to protect the Constitution from ill-conceived \nand frivolous changes. But once an amendment has been ratified, \nclearing the high hurdles built into the amendment process itself, the \nAmerican people have spoken.\n\n\n                        opening a pandora's box\n\n  Some of those who oppose the flag amendment also claim that ratifying \nit will open a Pandora's Box--that supporters of other national \nsymbols, no different from the flag, will clamor for similar protection \nfrom desecration.\n\n  I reject this argument because the flag is unique.\n  Do we pledge allegiance to the Constitution, or to the Presidential \nseal, or to any other national symbol? No.\n  Flag Day, June 14, is a national holiday, but do we have a national \nholiday honoring the Constitution, or the Presidential seal, or any \nother national symbol? No.\n  The ``Star Spangled Banner,'' our national anthem, honors the \nresiliency of Old Glory. But does our national anthem honor the \nConstitution, or the Presidential seal, or any other national symbol? \nNo, it does not.\n\n[[Page S 18087]]\n\n  And 48 States and the United States have enacted statutes prohibiting \nthe desecration of the flag. Have the States and Congress passed laws \nprohibiting the desecration of the Constitution, or the Presidential \nseal, or any other national symbol? The answer, of course, is ``no.''\n  So, as you can see, the flag stands alone. It stands alone as the \nunique symbol of our ideals, our hopes, our aspirations as a Nation. \nAnd that is why I am proud to join today with the citizens flag \nalliance, the American Legion, and 113 other civic and patriotic \norganizations representing millions of Americans across this country \nwho support this amendment.\n\n\n                          ``banner yet waves''\n\n  Mr. President, I will conclude now with a few words from an article \nentitled, ``The Banner Yet Waves,'' written by the editors of the \nReader's Digest.\n  I read these words during the last debate on the flag amendment, back \nin 1989, and I want to share them once again with my colleagues. The \nwords continue to ring true today. I quote:\n\n       While Americans know that behind this rectangle of cloth \n     there is blood and great sacrifice, there is also behind it \n     an idea that redefined once and forever the meaning of hope \n     and freedom. Lawyers and justices may debate the act of flag-\n     burning as freedom of expression. But a larger point is \n     inarguable: When someone dishonors or desecrates the banner, \n     it deeply offends, because the flag says all that needs to be \n     said about things worth preserving, loving defending, dying \n     for.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this debate is all about. It is not about \nmaking fine legal distinctions or trying to prove who is the best \nconstitutional scholar. It is about protecting that which is sacred to \nus as citizens of this great country.\n  Amidst the rich diversity that is America, we must cherish the \nprinciples and ideals that bind us together as one people, one Nation, \nand for which thousands of brave Americans have given their lives. As \nthe unique symbol of these principles and ideals, the flag must receive \nthe constitutional protection it so richly deserves.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we are now in a position of having to \nobtain cloture before we can even consider this amendment. I hope that \nthe Senator from New Mexico, who, as I understand, opposes the flag \namendment, would find some other way to distract us from what I think \nis a very important amendment. I know he is concerned about \nambassadors. I know he is concerned about treaties. But I can tell him, \nas I indicated this morning, this Senator is, too. I have tried almost \nevery day to bring this matter to some resolution. We think we are \nvery, very close. And I see no reason to hold up this particular \nconstitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 31, in an effort to \nbecome involved in a process that has been going on for weeks and in \nwhich the Senator from New Mexico, as far as I know, has not been \ninvolved at all. So I have no other course than to hold up other \nnominations. If he wants to play this game--we cannot bring up bills; \nwe cannot determine what the legislative agenda is going to be--if any \nSenator can stand up and say I will determine what we will bring up to \nthe floor, if the leaders are powerless, then we have to resort to \nwhatever means we have. In this case, all we can do is file cloture, \nand we will obtain cloture on Friday morning because I know more than \n60 Members will support cloture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18086-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the \nchampions of the 1995 South Dakota High School Football Playoffs. The \nplayoffs were held at the ``Dakota Dome'' on the campus of the \nUniversity of South Dakota in Vermillion on Friday, November 3, and \nSaturday, November 4.\n  In class 11AA, the Yankton Bucks won the championship for the second \nyear in a row and the fourth time in school history. First year coach \nJim Miner led the Bucks. Quarterback Mason Mehrman was named the game's \nMost Valuable Player (MVP).\n  The Vermillion Tanagers capped an undefeated season by claiming the \nclass 11A crown. The Tanagers, who also won a State title for the \nfourth time in school history, are coached by Gary Culver. Running back \nVince Roche was named the game's MVP.\n  The Cavaliers of Bon Homme County High School, located in Tyndall, \nSouth Dakota, won the class 11B championship for the second year in a \nrow. The Cavaliers extended their consecutive winning streak to an \nimpressive 21 games. The Cavaliers are coached by Russ Morrell. Running \nback Josh Ranek was named the game's MVP.\n  In class 9A, the Wakonda-Gayville-Volin Panthers won their first \nState title. The Panthers, who finished the season undefeated, are \ncoached by Glen Ekeren. Quarterback Dan Freng was named the game's MVP.\n  The Wildcats of Grant-Deuel County High School, located in Revillo, \nSD, captured their first ever class 9B championship. Coach Chad Gusso \nled the Panthers. Running back Heath Boe was named the game's MVP.\n  I congratulate all the coaches, the players, and the parents of these \nfive schools, as well as all the South Dakota schools that competed in \nthis year's playoffs. In the spirit of competition, they have \ndemonstrated the hard work, commitment, and teamwork that it takes to \nbe champions. They all are to be commended for continuing such a great \nfootball tradition in South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the rosters of each \nchampionship team be included in the Congressional Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the rosters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        YANKTON ``BUCKS'' (11-0)                        \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Pos.

Mr. President, last week, President Clinton became the \nfirst United States President to visit Northern Ireland. The \nextraordinarily enthusiastic welcome he received from the people was an \nimpressive demonstration of their desire for peace and their gratitude \nfor President Clinton's and America's commitment to that great goal.\n  Large crowds of both Protestants and Catholics welcomed the President \non the Peace Line in Belfast and again at the City Hall for the \nlighting of the Christmas tree. In addition, the President was also \ncheered by a large crowd in Dublin when he spoke at College Green \nduring his visit the next day to Ireland.\n  Just before the President left for his trip, the Irish Prime \nMinister, John Bruton and the British Prime Minister, John Major, \nannounced the launching of the twin-track process of an international \ncommission on arms, to be led by our former colleague Senator George \nMitchell, and talks leading to all-party negotiations by the end of \nFebruary. The two Prime Ministers credited President Clinton with \nhelping to bring about this significant development. President \nClinton's commitment to peace in Northern Ireland has had a profound \nand positive impact on the efforts of all sides to achieve a lasting \npeace.\n  President Kennedy always remembered his 1963 trip to Ireland as among \nthe happiest days of his presidency. I have no doubt that President \nClinton will remember his trip with the same fondness.\n  President Clinton spoke eloquently throughout his visit to England, \nNorthern Ireland, and Ireland and I congratulate him on the remarkable \nsuccess of his visit. I know several of my colleagues would like to \njoin me in placing the President's statements in the Record. I \ntherefore will begin with his first speech which was given to the \nBritish Parliament in London. I ask unanimous consent that it may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nRemarks by the President to the Houses of Parliament, Royal Gallery of \n     the Palace of Westminster, London, England, November 29, 1995\n\n       My Lord Chancellor, Madam Speaker, Lord Privy Seal, the \n     Lord President of the Council, Mr. Prime Minister, my lords \n     and members of the House of Commons: To the Lord Chancellor, \n     the longer I hear you talk the more I wish we had an \n     institution like this in American government. I look out and \n     see so many of your distinguished leaders in the House of \n     Lords, and I think it might not be a bad place to be after a \n     long and troublesome political career. (Laughter.) My wife \n\n[[Page S 18089]]\n     and I are honored to be here today, and I thank you for inviting me to \n     address you.\n       I have been here to Westminster many times before. As a \n     student, I visited often, and over the last 20 years I have \n     often returned. Always I have felt the power of this place, \n     where the voices of free people who love liberty, believe in \n     reason, and struggle for truth have for centuries kept your \n     great nation a beacon of hope for all the world, and a very \n     special model for your former colonies which became the \n     United States of America.\n       Here, where the voices of Pitt and Burke, Disraeli and \n     Gladstone rang out; here where the rights of English men and \n     women were secured and enlarged; here where the British \n     people's determination to stand against the tyrannies of this \n     century were shouted to the entire world, here is a monument \n     to liberty to which every free person owes honor and \n     gratitude.\n       As one whose ancestors came from these isles, I cherish \n     this opportunity. Since I entered public life I have often \n     thought of the words of Prime Minister Churchill when he \n     spoke to our Congress in 1941. He said that if his father had \n     been American and his mother British, instead of the other \n     way around, he might have gotten there on his own. \n     (Laughter.) Well, for a long time I thought that if my \n     forebears had not left this country perhaps I might have \n     gotten here on my own--at least to the House of Commons.\n       But I have to tell you, now our American television carries \n     your Question Time. And I have seen Prime Minister Major and \n     Mr. Blair and the other members slicing each other up, face-\n     to-face--(Laughter)--with such great wit and skill, against \n     the din of cheers and jeers. I am now convinced my forebears \n     did me a great favor by coming to America. (Laughter.)\n       Today the United States and the United Kingdom glory in an \n     extraordinary relationship that unites us in a way never \n     before seen in the ties between two such great nations. It is \n     perhaps all the more remarkable because of our history.\n       First, the war we waged for our independence; and then \n     barely three decades later, another war we waged in which \n     your able forces laid siege to our Capitol. Indeed, the White \n     House still bears the burn marks of that earlier stage in our \n     relationship. And now, whenever we have even the most minor \n     disagreement I walk out on the Truman Balcony and I look at \n     those burn marks, just to remind myself that I dare not let \n     this relationship get out of hand again. (Laughter.)\n       In this century we overcame the legacy of our differences. \n     We discovered our common heritage again, and even more \n     important, we rediscovered our shared values. This November, \n     we are reminded of how exactly the bonds that now join us \n     grew--of the three great trials our nations have faced \n     together in this century.\n       A few weeks ago we marked the anniversary of that day in \n     1918 when the guns fell silent in World War I, a war we \n     fought side by side to defend democracy against militarism \n     and reaction. On this Veterans Day for us and Remembrance Day \n     for you, we both paid special tribute to the British and \n     American generation that, 50 years ago now, in the skies over \n     the Channel, on the craggy hills of Italy, in the jungles of \n     Burma, in the flights over the Hump did not fail or falter. \n     In the greatest struggle for freedom in all of history, they \n     saved the world.\n       Our nations emerged from that war with the resolve to \n     prevent another like it. We bound ourselves together with \n     other democracies in the West and with Japan, and we stood \n     firm throughout the long twilight struggle of the Cold War--\n     from the Berlin Airlift of 1948, to the fall of the Berlin \n     Wall on another November day just six years ago.\n       In the years since, we have also stood together--fighting \n     together for victory in the Persian Gulf, standing together \n     against terrorism, working together to remove the nuclear \n     cloud from our children's bright future; and together, \n     preparing the way for peace in Bosnia, where your \n     peacekeepers have performed heroically and saved the lives of \n     so many innocent people. I thank the British nation for its \n     strength and its sacrifice through all these struggles. And I \n     am proud to stand here on behalf of the American people to \n     salute you.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, in this century, democracy has not \n     merely endured, it has prevailed. Now it falls to us to \n     advance the cause that so many fought and sacrificed and died \n     for. In this new era, we must rise not in a call to arms, but \n     in a call to peace.\n       The great American philosopher, John Dewey, once said, \n     ``The only way to abolish war is to make peace heroic.'' \n     Well, we know we will never abolish war or all the forces \n     that cause it because we cannot abolish human nature or the \n     certainty of human error. But we can make peace heroic. And \n     in so doing, we can create a future even more true to our \n     ideals than all our glorious past. To do so, we must maintain \n     the resolve and peace we shared in war when everything was at \n     stake.\n       In this new world our lives are not so very much at risk, \n     but much of what makes life worth living is still very much \n     at stake. We have fought our wars. Now let us wage our peace.\n       This time is full of possibility. The chasm of ideology has \n     disappeared. Around the world, the ideals we defended and \n     advanced are now shared by more people than ever before. In \n     Europe and many other nations long-suffering peoples at last \n     control their own destinies. And as the Cold War gives way to \n     the global village, economic freedom is spreading alongside \n     political freedom, bringing with it renewed hope for a better \n     life, rooted in the honorable and healthy competition of \n     effort and ideas.\n       America is determined to maintain our alliance for freedom \n     and peace with you, and determined to seek the partnership of \n     all like-minded nations to confront the threats still before \n     us. We know the way. Together we have seen how we succeed \n     when we work together.\n       When President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill first \n     met on the Deck of the HMS Prince of Wales in 1941 at one of \n     the loneliest moments in your nation's history , they joined \n     in prayer, and the Prime Minister was filled with hope. \n     Afterwards, he said, ``The same language, the same hymns, \n     more or less the same ideals. Something big may be happening, \n     something very big.''\n       Well, once again, he was right. Something really big \n     happened. On the basis of those ideals, Churchill and \n     Roosevelt and all of their successors built an enduring \n     alliance and a genuine friendship between our nations. Other \n     times in other places are littered with the vows of \n     friendship sworn during battle and then abandoned in \n     peacetime. This one stands alone, unbroken, above all the \n     rest; a model for the ties that should bind all democracies.\n       To honor that alliance and the Prime Minister who worked so \n     mightily to create it, I am pleased to announce here, in the \n     home of British freedom, that the United States will name one \n     of the newest and most powerful of its surface ships, a \n     guided missile destroyer, the United States Ship Winston \n     Churchill. (Applause.)\n       When that ship slips down the ways in the final year of \n     this century, its name will ride the seas as a reminder for \n     the coming century of an indomitable man who shaped our age, \n     who stood always for freedom, who showed anew the glorious \n     strength of the human spirit.\n       I thank the members of the Churchill family who are here \n     today with us--Lady Soames, Nicholas Soames, Winston \n     Churchill--and I thank the British people for their \n     friendship and their strength over these many years.\n       After so much success together we know that our \n     relationship with the United Kingdom must be at the heart of \n     our striving in this new era. Because of the history we have \n     lived, because of the power and prosperity we enjoy, because \n     of the accepted truth that you and we have no dark motives in \n     our dealings with other nations, we still bear a burden of \n     special responsibility.\n       In these few years since the Cold War we have met that \n     burden by making gains for peace and security that ordinary \n     people feel every day. We have stepped back from the nuclear \n     precipice with the indefinite extension of the nuclear \n     Nonproliferation Treaty, and we hope next year a \n     comprehensive test ban treaty.\n       For the first time in a generation parents in Los Angeles \n     and Manchester and, yes, in Moscow, can now turn out the \n     lights at night knowing there are no nuclear weapons pointed \n     at their children. Our nations are working together to lay \n     the foundation for lasting prosperity. We are bringing down \n     economic barriers between nations with the historic GATT \n     Agreement and other actions that are creating millions of \n     good jobs for our own people and for people throughout the \n     world. The United States and the United Kingdom are \n     supporting men and women who embrace freedom and democracy \n     the world over with good results, from South Africa to \n     Central Europe, from Haiti to the Middle East.\n       In the United States, we feel a special gratitude for your \n     efforts in Northern Ireland. With every passing month, more \n     people walk the streets and live their lives safely--people \n     who otherwise would have been added to the toll of The \n     Troubles.\n       Tomorrow I will have the privilege of being the first \n     American President to visit Northern Ireland--a Northern \n     Ireland where the guns are quiet and the children play \n     without fear. I applaud the efforts of Prime Minister Major \n     and Irish Prime Minister Bruton who announced yesterday their \n     new twin-track initiative to advance the peace process, an \n     initiative that provides an opportunity to begin a dialogue \n     in which all views are represented and all views can be \n     heard.\n       This is a bold step forward for peace. I applaud the Prime \n     Minister for taking this risk for peace. It is always a hard \n     choice, the choice for peace, for success is far from \n     guaranteed, and even if you fail, there will be those who \n     resent you for trying. But it is the right thing to do. And \n     in the end, the right will win. (Applause.)\n       Despite all of the progress we have made in all these \n     areas, and despite the problems clearly still out there, \n     there are those who say at this moment of hope we can afford \n     to relax now behind our secure borders. Now is the time, they \n     say, to let others worry about the world's troubles. These \n     are the siren songs of myth. They once lured the United \n     States into isolationism after World War I. They counseled \n     appeasement to Britain on the very brink of World War II. We \n     have gone down that road before. We must never go down that \n     road again. We will never go down that road again. \n     (Applause.)\n       Though the Cold War is over, the forces of destruction \n     challenge us still. Today, they are armed with a full array \n     of threats, not just the single weapon of frontal war. We see \n     them at work in the spread of weapons of mass destruction, \n     from nuclear smuggling in Europe to a vial of sarin gas being \n     broken open in the Tokyo subway, to the bombing of the World \n     Trade Center in New York. \n     \n[[Page S 18090]]\n\n       We see it in the growth of ethnic hatred, extreme \n     nationalism and religious fanaticism, which most recently \n     took the life of one of the greatest champions of peace in \n     the entire world, the Prime Minister of Israel.\n       We see it in the terrorism that just in recent months has \n     murdered innocent people from Islamabad to Paris, from Riyadh \n     to Oklahoma City. And we see it in the international \n     organized crime and drug trade that poisons our children and \n     our communities.\n       In their variety these forces of disintegration are waging \n     guerrilla wars against humanity. Like communism and fascism, \n     they spread darkness over light, barbarism over civilization. \n     And like communism and fascism, they will be defeated only \n     because free nations join against them in common cause.\n       We will prevail again if, and only if, our people support \n     the mission. We are, after all, democracies. And they are the \n     ultimate bosses of our fate. I believe the people will \n     support this. I believe free people, given the information, \n     will make the decisions that will make it possible for their \n     leaders to stand against the new threat to security and \n     freedom, to peace and prosperity.\n       I believe they will see that this hopeful moment cannot be \n     lost without grave consequences to the future. We must go out \n     to meet the challenges before they come to threaten us. \n     Today, for the United States and for Great Britain, that \n     means we must make the difference between peace and war in \n     Bosnia.\n       For nearly four years a terrible war has torn Bosnia apart, \n     bringing horrors we prayed had vanished from the face of \n     Europe forever--the mass killings, the endless columns of \n     refugees, the campaigns of deliberate rape, the skeletal \n     persons imprisoned in concentration camps.\n       These crimes did violence to the conscience of Britons and \n     Americans. Now we have a chance to make sure they don't \n     return. And we must seize it.\n       We must help peace to take hold in Bosnia because so long \n     as that fire rages at the heart of the European Continent, so \n     long as the emerging democracies and our allies are \n     threatened by fighting in Bosnia there will be no stable, \n     undivided, free Europe. There will be no realization of our \n     greatest hopes for Europe. But most important of all, \n     innocent people will continue to suffer and die.\n       America fought two world wars and stood with you in the \n     Cold War because of our vital stake in a Europe that is \n     stable, strong and free. With the end of the Cold War all of \n     Europe has a chance to be stable, strong and free for the \n     very first time since nation states appeared on the European \n     Continent.\n       Now the warring parties in Bosnia have committed themselves \n     to peace, and they have asked us to help them make it hold--\n     not by fighting a war, but by implementing their own peace \n     agreement. Our nations have a responsibility to answer the \n     request of those people to secure their peace. Without our \n     leadership and without the presence of NATO there will be no \n     peace in Bosnia.\n       I thank the United Kingdom that has already sacrificed so \n     much for its swift agreement to play a central role in the \n     peace implementation. With this act, Britain holds true to \n     its history and to its values. And I pledge to you that \n     America will live up to its history and its ideals as well.\n       We know that if we do not participate in Bosnia our \n     leadership will be questioned and our partnerships will be \n     weakened--partnerships we must have if we are to help each \n     other in the fight against the common threats we face. We can \n     help the people of Bosnia as they seek a way back from \n     savagery to civility. And we can build a peaceful, undivided \n     Europe.\n       Today I reaffirm to you that the United States, as it did \n     during the defense of democracy during the Cold War, will \n     help lead in building this Europe by working for a broader \n     and more lasting peace, and by supporting a Europe bound \n     together in a woven fabric of vital democracies, market \n     economies and security cooperation.\n       Our cooperation with you through NATO, the sword and shield \n     of democracy, can help the nations that once lay behind the \n     Iron Curtain to become a part of the new Europe. In the Cold \n     War the alliance kept our nation secure, and bound the \n     Western democracies together in common cause. It brought \n     former adversaries together and gave them the confidence to \n     look past ancient enmities. Now, NATO will grow and expand \n     the circle of common purpose, first through its Partnership \n     for Peace, which is already having a remarkable impact on the \n     member countries; and then, as we agree, with the admissions \n     of new democratic members. It will threaten no one. But it \n     will give its new allies the confidence they need to \n     consolidate their freedoms, build their economies, strengthen \n     peace and become your partners for tomorrow.\n       Members of the House of Commons and Noble Lords, long \n     before there was a United States, one of your most powerful \n     champions of liberty and one of the greatest poets of our \n     shared language wrote: ``Peace hath her victories, no less \n     renowned then war.'' In our time, at last, we can prove the \n     truth of John Milton's words.\n       As this month of remembrance passes and the holidays \n     approach, I leave you with the words Winston Churchill spoke \n     to America during America's darkest holiday season of the \n     century. As he lit the White House Christmas Tree in 1941, he \n     said, ``Let the children have their night of fun and \n     laughter. Let us share to the full in their unstinted \n     pleasure before we turn again to the stern tasks in the year \n     that lies before us. But now, by our sacrifice and bearing, \n     these same children shall not be robbed of their inheritance \n     or denied their right to live in a free and decent world.''\n       My friends, we have stood together in the darkest moments \n     of our century. Let us now resolve to stand together for the \n     bright and shining prospect of the next century. It can be \n     the age of possibility and the age of peace. Our forebears \n     won the war. Let us now win the peace.\n       May God bless the United Kingdom, the United States and our \n     solemn alliance. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18088-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18090-S18092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT TO ENGLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IRELAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I join Senator Kennedy in congratulating \nPresident Clinton on his successful trip to the United Kingdom and \nIreland. Although I was not able to accept the President's invitation \nto accompany him on that historic visit due to other commitments I had \nin Vermont, like millions of Americans I followed his travels closely \nin the press. One of the most memorable events was the President's \nspeech to the workers at the Mackie Metal Plant in Belfast.\n  Mackie's is located on the Peace Line which has historically divided \nCatholics from Protestants. People from both communities come together \nat Mackie's to an integrated work force where they work side by side. \nAt Mackie's, President Clinton spoke of those who helped bring about \nthe peace process--the political leaders, and more importantly, the \npeople of Northern Ireland ``who have shown the world in concrete ways \nthat here the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons for \nwar.''\n  The President called for an end to punishment beatings as well as for \nthe full participation in the democratic process of those who have \nrenounced violence. He said that the United States will stand with \nthose who take risks for peace. The President spoke for all of us that \nday and I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nRemarks by the President to Employees and Community of the Mackie Metal \n                                 Plant\n\n               [Belfast, Northern Ireland, Nov. 30, 1995]\n\n       This is one of those occasions where I really feel that all \n     that needs to be said has already been said. I thank \n     Catherine and David for introducing me, for all the school \n     children of Northern Ireland who are here today, and for all \n     whom they represent. A big part of peace is children growing \n     up safely, learning together and growing together.\n       I thank Patrick Dougan and Ronnie Lewis for their remarks, \n     for their work here, for all the members of the Mackie team \n     who are with us today in welcoming us to this factory. I was \n     hoping we could have an event like this in Northern Ireland \n     at a place where people work and reach out to the rest of the \n     world in a positive way, because a big part of peace is \n     working together for family and community and for the welfare \n     of the common enterprise.\n       It is good to be among the people of Northern Ireland who \n     have given so much to America and the world, and good to be \n     here with such a large delegation of my fellow Americans, \n     including, of course, my wife, and I see the Secretary of \n     Commerce here and the Ambassador to Great Britain, and a \n     number of others. But we have quite a large delegation from \n     both parties in the United States Congress, so we've sort of \n     got a truce of our own going on here today. (Laughter.)\n       And I'd like to ask the members of Congress who have come \n     all the way from Washington, D.C. to stand up and be \n     recognized. Would you all stand? (Applause.)\n       Many of you perhaps know that one in four of America's \n     Presidents trace their roots to Ireland's shores, beginning \n     with Andrew Jackson, the son of immigrants from \n     Carrickfergus, to John Fitzgerald Kennedy whose forebears \n     came from County Wexford. I know I am only the latest in this \n     time-honored tradition, but I'm proud to be the first sitting \n     American President to make it back to Belfast. (Applause.)\n       At this holiday season all around the world, the promise of \n     peace is in the air. The barriers of the Cold War are giving \n     way to a global village where communication and cooperation \n     are the order of the day. From South Africa to the Middle \n     East, and now to troubled Bosnia, conflicts long thought \n     impossible to solve are moving along the road to resolution. \n     Once-bitter foes are clasping hands and changing history. And \n     long-suffering people are moving closer to normal lives.\n       Here in Northern Ireland, you are making a miracle--a \n     miracle symbolized by those two children who held hands and \n     told us what this whole thing is all about. In the land of \n     the harp and the fiddle, the fife and the lambeg drum, two \n     proud traditions are coming together in the harmonies of \n     peace. The cease-fire and negotiations have sparked a \n     powerful transformation. \n     \n[[Page S 18091]]\n\n       Mackie's Plant is a symbol of Northern Ireland's rebirth. \n     It has long been a symbol of world-class engineering. The \n     textile machines you make permit people to weave disparate \n     threads into remarkable fabrics. That is now what you must do \n     here with the people of Northern Ireland.\n       Here we lie along the peace line, the wall of steel and \n     stone separating Protestant from Catholic. But today, under \n     the leadership of Pat Dougan, you are bridging the divide, \n     overcoming a legacy of discrimination where fair employment \n     and integration are the watchwords of the future.\n       On this shop floor men and women of both traditions are \n     working together to achieve common goals. Peace, once a \n     distant dream, is now making a difference in everyday life in \n     this land. Soldiers have left the streets of Belfast; many \n     have gone home. People can go to the pub or the store without \n     the burden of the search or the threat of a bomb. As barriers \n     disappear along the border, families and communities divided \n     for decades are becoming whole once more.\n       This year in Armagh on St. Patrick's Day, Protestant and \n     Catholic children led the parade together for the first time \n     since The Troubles began. A bystander's words marked the \n     wonder of the occasion when he said, ``Even the normal is \n     beginning to seem normal.''\n       The economic rewards of peace are evident as well. \n     Unemployment has fallen here to its lowest level in 14 years, \n     while retail sales and investment are surging. Far from the \n     gleaming city center, to the new shop fronts of Belfast, to \n     the Enterprise Center in East Belfast, business is thriving \n     and opportunities are expanding. With every extra day that \n     the guns are still, business confidence grows stronger and \n     the promise of prosperity grows as well.\n       As the shroud of terror melts away, Northern Ireland's \n     beauty has been revealed again to all the world--the castles \n     and coasts, the Giants Causeway, the lush green hills, the \n     high white cliffs--a magical backdrop to your greatest asset \n     which I saw all along the way from the airport here today, \n     the warmth and good feeling of your people. Visitors are now \n     coming in record numbers. Indeed, today, the air route \n     between Belfast and London is the second busiest in all of \n     Europe.\n       I want to honor those whose courage and vision have brought \n     us to this point: Prime Minister Major, Prime Minister \n     Bruton, and before him, Prime Minister Reynolds, laid the \n     background and the basis for this era of reconciliation. From \n     the Downing Street Declaration to the joint framework \n     document, they altered the course of history. Now, just in \n     the last few days, by launching the twin-track initiative, \n     they have opened a promising new gateway to a just and \n     lasting peace. Foreign Minister Spring, Sir Patrick Mayhew, \n     David Trimble and John Hume all have labored to realize the \n     promise of peace. And Gerry Adams, along with Loyalist \n     leaders such as David Irvine and Gary McMichael, helped to \n     silence the guns on the streets and to bring about the first \n     peace in a generation.\n       But most of all, America salutes all the people of Northern \n     Ireland who have shown the world in concrete ways that here \n     the will for peace is now stronger than the weapons of war. \n     With mixed sporting events encouraging competition on the \n     playing field, not the battlefield; with women's support \n     groups, literacy programs, job training centers that served \n     both communities--these and countless other initiatives \n     bolster the foundations of peace as well.\n       Last year's cease-fire of the Irish Republican Army, joined \n     by the combined Loyalist Military Command, marked a turning \n     point in the history of Northern Ireland. Now is the time to \n     sustain that momentum and lock in the gains of peace. Neither \n     community wants to go back to the violence of the past. The \n     children told of that today. Both parties must do their part \n     to move this process forward now.\n       Let me begin by saying that the search for common ground \n     demands the courage of an open mind. This twin-track \n     initiative gives the parties a chance to begin preliminary \n     talks in ways in which all views will be represented and all \n     voices will be heard. It also establishes an international \n     body to address the issue of arms decommissioning. I hope the \n     parties will seize this opportunity. Engaging in honest \n     dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength \n     and common sense. (Applause.)\n       Moving from cease-fire to peace requires dialogue. For 25 \n     years now the history of Northern Ireland has been written in \n     the blood of its children and their parents. The cease-fire \n     turned the page on that history; it must not be allowed to \n     turn back. (Applause.)\n       There must also be progress away from the negotiating \n     table. Violence has lessened, but it has not disappeared. The \n     leaders of the four main churches recently condemned the so-\n     called punishment beatings and called for an end to such \n     attacks. I add my voice to theirs. (Applause.)\n       As the church leaders said, this is a time when the utmost \n     efforts on all sides are needed to build a peaceful and \n     confident community in the future. But true peace requires \n     more than a treaty, even more than the absence of violence. \n     Those who have suffered most in the fighting must share \n     fairly in the fruits of renewal. The frustration that gave \n     rise to violence must give way to faith in the future.\n       The United States will help to secure the tangible benefits \n     of peace. Ours is the first American administration ever to \n     support in the Congress the International Fund for Ireland, \n     which has become an engine for economic development and for \n     reconciliation. We will continue to encourage trade and \n     investment and to help end the cycle of unemployment.\n       We are proud to support Northern Ireland. You have given \n     America a very great deal. Irish Protestant and Irish \n     Catholic together have added to America's strength. From our \n     battle for independence down to the present day, the Irish \n     have not only fought in our wars, they have built our nation, \n     and we owe you a very great debt. (Applause.)\n       Let me say that of all the gifts we can offer in return, \n     perhaps the most enduring and the most precious is the \n     example of what is possible when people find unity and \n     strength in their diversity. We know from our own experience \n     even today how hard that is to do. After all, we fought a \n     great Civil War over the issue of race and slavery in which \n     hundreds of thousands of our people were killed.\n       Today, in one of our counties alone, in Los Angeles, there \n     are over 150 different ethnic and racial groups represented. \n     We know we can become stronger if we bridge our differences. \n     But we learned in our own Civil War that that has to begin \n     with a change of the heart.\n       I grew up in the American South, in one of the states that \n     tried to break from the American Union. My forebears on my \n     father's side were soldiers in the Confederate Army. I was \n     reading the other day a book about our first governor after \n     the Civil War who fought for the Union Army, and who lost \n     members of his own family. They lived the experience so many \n     of you have lived. When this governor took office and looked \n     out over a sea of his fellow citizens who fought on the other \n     side, he said these words: ``We have all done wrong. No one \n     can say his heart is altogether clean and his hands \n     altogether pure. Thus, as we wish to be forgiven, let us \n     forgive those who have sinned against us and ours.'' That was \n     the beginning of America's reconciliation, and it must be the \n     beginning of Northern Ireland's reconciliation. (Applause.)\n       It is so much easier to believe that our differences matter \n     more than what we have in common. It is easier, but it is \n     wrong. We all cherish family and faith, work and community. \n     We all strive to live lives that are free and honest and \n     responsible. We all want our children to grow up in a world \n     where their talents are matched by their opportunities. And I \n     believe those values are just as strong in County Londonderry \n     as they are in Londonderry, New Hampshire; in Belfast, \n     Northern Ireland as in Belfast, Maine.\n       I am proud to be of Ulster Scots stock. I am proud to be, \n     also, of Irish stock. I share these roots with millions and \n     millions of Americans, now over 40 million Americans. And we \n     rejoice at things being various, as Louis MacNeice once \n     wrote. It is one of the things that makes America special.\n       Because our greatness flows from the wealth of our \n     diversity as well as the strength of the ideals we share in \n     common, we feel bound to support others around the world who \n     seek to bridge their own divides. This is an important part \n     of our country's mission on the eve of the 21st century, \n     because we know that the chain of peace that protects us \n     grows stronger with every new link that is forged.\n       For the first time in half a century now, we can put our \n     children to bed at night knowing that the nuclear weapons of \n     the former Soviet Union are no longer pointed at those \n     children. In South Africa, the long night of apartheid has \n     given way to a new freedom for all peoples. In the Middle \n     East, Arabs and Israelis are stepping beyond war to peace in \n     an area where many believed peace would never come. In Haiti, \n     a brutal dictatorship has given way to a fragile new \n     democracy. In Europe, the dream of a stable, undivided free \n     continent seems finally within reach as the people of Bosnia \n     have the first real hope for peace since the terrible \n     fighting began there nearly four years ago.\n       The United States looks forward to working with our allies \n     here in Europe and others to help the people in Bosnia--the \n     Muslims, the Croats, the Serbs--to move beyond their \n     divisions and their destructions to make the peace agreement \n     they have made a reality in the lives of their people.\n       Those who work for peace have got to support one another. \n     We know that when leaders stand up for peace, they place \n     their forces on the line, and sometimes their very lives on \n     the line, as we learned so recently in the tragic murder of \n     the brave Prime Minister of Israel. For, just as peace has \n     its pioneers, peace will always have its rivals. Even when \n     children stand up and say what these children said today, \n     there will always be people who, deep down inside, will never \n     be able to give up the past.\n       Over the last three years I have had the privilege of \n     meeting with and closely listening to both Nationalists and \n     Unionists from Northern Ireland, and I believe that the \n     greatest struggle you face now is not between opposing ideas \n     or opposing interests. The greatest struggle you face is \n     between those who, deep down inside, are inclined to be \n     peacemakers, and those who, deep down inside, cannot yet \n     embrace the cause of peace. Between those who are in the ship \n     of peace and those who are trying to sink it, old habits die \n     hard. There will always be those who define the worth of \n     their lives not by who they are, but by who they aren't; not \n\n[[Page S 18092]]\n     by what they're for, but by what they are against. They will never \n     escape the dead-end street of violence. But you, the vast \n     majority, Protestant and Catholic alike, must not allow the \n     ship of peace to sink on the rocks of old habits and hard \n     grudges. (Applause.)\n       You must stand firm against terror. You must say to those \n     who still would use violence for political objectives--you \n     are the past; your day is over. Violence has no place at the \n     table of democracy, and no role in the future of this land. \n     By the same token, you must also be willing to say to those \n     who renounce violence and who do take their own risks for \n     peace that they are entitled to be full participants in the \n     democratic process. Those who show the courage--(applause)--\n     those who do show the courage to break with the past are \n     entitled to their stake in the future.\n       As leaders for peace become invested in the process, as \n     leaders make compromises and risk the backlash, people begin \n     more and more--I have seen this all over the world--they \n     begin more and more to develop a common interest in each \n     other's success; in standing together rather than standing \n     apart. They realize that the sooner they get to true peace, \n     with all the rewards it brings, the sooner it will be easy to \n     discredit and destroy the forces of destruction.\n       We will stand with those who take risks for peace, in \n     Northern Ireland and around the world. I pledge that we will \n     do all we can, through the International Fund for Ireland and \n     in many other ways, to ease your load. If you walk down this \n     path continually, you will not walk alone. We are entering an \n     era of possibility unparalleled in all of human history. If \n     you enter that era determined to build a new age of peace, \n     the United States of America will proudly stand with you. \n     (Applause.)\n       But at the end of the day, as with all free people, your \n     future is for you to decide. Your destiny is for you to \n     determine. Only you can decide between division and unity, \n     between hard lives and high hopes. Only you can create a \n     lasting peace. It takes courage to let go of familiar \n     divisions. It takes faith to walk down a new road. But when \n     we see the bright gaze of these children, we know the risk is \n     worth the reward.\n       I have been so touched by the thousands of letters I have \n     received from schoolchildren here, telling me what peace \n     means to them. One young girl from Ballymena wrote--and I \n     quote--``It is not easy to forgive and forget, especially for \n     those who have lost a family member or a close friend. \n     However, if people could look to the future with hope instead \n     of the past with fear, we can only be moving in the right \n     direction.'' I couldn't have said it nearly as well.\n       I believe you can summon the strength to keep moving \n     forward. After all, you have come so far already. You have \n     braved so many dangers, you have endured so many sacrifices. \n     Surely, there can be no turning back. But peace must be waged \n     with a warrior's resolve--bravely, proudly, and \n     relentlessly--secure in the knowledge of the single, greatest \n     difference between war and peace: In peace, everybody can \n     win. (Applause.)\n       I was overcome today when I landed in my plane and I drove \n     with Hillary up the highway to come here by the phenomenal \n     beauty of the place and the spirit and the goodwill of the \n     people. Northern Ireland has a chance not only to begin anew, \n     but to be a real inspiration to the rest of the world, a \n     model of progress through tolerance.\n       Let us join our efforts together as never before to make \n     that dream a reality. Let us join our prayers in this season \n     of peace for a future of peace in this good land.\n       Thank you very much.

Mr. President, I join in commending President Clinton for \nhis historic visit to Ireland, Northern Ireland, and England.\n  Those of us who support peace in Northern Ireland watched as the \nPresident and First Lady lit the Christmas tree--sent from Tennessee \nwith the help of the Vice President--in front of Belfast's City Hall \nlast Thursday night. Thousands of people--Catholic and Protestant--\nturned out to celebrate the beginning of the Christmas season and, more \nimportantly, the peace that Northern Ireland has known for more than 15 \nmonths.\n  In his remarks, the President spoke of the historic ties between the \npeople of Northern Ireland and the United States and the bonds we \ncontinue to build. Mostly, he and the First Lady spoke of the children \nof Northern Ireland and their hopes and dreams for a lasting peace. I \nask unanimous consent that the remarks of the President and the First \nLady may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Belfast City Hall, Belfast, Northern Ireland, November 30, 1995\n\n       Mrs. Clinton. Thank you very much, Lord Mayor. And thank \n     all of you. (Applause.) Tonight is a night filled with hope \n     and peace. And for those of us gathered here throughout \n     Northern Ireland and around the world, often it is our \n     children who offer us the clearest and purest reasons why \n     peace and why this peace process is so important.\n       In a national competition, asking students to share their \n     hopes for a peaceful Northern Ireland in letters to my \n     husband, two students whom you see here tonight, Cathy Harte \n     and Mark Lennox won the top prize. We will be privileged to \n     have them in America at summer camp this coming summer. \n     Tonight it is my privilege to read excerpts from their \n     letters.\n       This is what Cathy said: ``My name is Cathy Harte and I am \n     a 12-year-old Catholic girl. I live in Belfast in Northern \n     Ireland, and I love it here. It's green, it's beautiful, and, \n     well, it's Ireland.'' (Applause.) ``All my life, I have only \n     known guns and bombs with people fighting. Now, it is \n     different. There are no guns and bombs.''\n       Cathy continues: ``My dream's for the future, well, I have \n     a lot of them. Hopefully, the peace will be permanent; that \n     one day Catholics and Protestants will be able to walk hand-\n     in-hand and will be able to live in the same areas.'' \n     (Applause.) ``Catholics, Protestants, black or white, it is \n     the person inside that counts.'' (Applause.) ``What I hope,'' \n     said Cathy, ``is that when I have my own children that there \n     will still be peace and that Belfast will be a peaceful place \n     from now on.''\n       Thank you, Cathy. (Applause.)\n       Mark Lennox is the same age as our daughter, 15. And he \n     explains in his letter the simple hows of achieving peace. \n     And this is what he says: ``I am a 15-year-old schoolboy from \n     Glengormley High School. I am very pleased about the chance \n     of permanent peace in Northern Ireland and the chances of \n     living in a secure atmosphere.\n       ``If Northern Ireland is to have a future, then we must all \n     learn to live with each other in a more tolerant way. Also, \n     we must all work hard for peace and make a real effort. We \n     will have to change our ideas and work for change. Change \n     must mean changing our own understanding of each other. We \n     must learn together and know more about our different \n     traditions.\n       Some people want to destroy peace and the peace process in \n     Northern Ireland.'' And Mark says, ``We must not allow this \n     to happen.'' (Applause.)\n       As the Lord Mayor said, in a moment the Christmas tree will \n     be lit as Christmas trees will be lit all over the world in \n     the days to come. This Christmas let us remember the reason \n     behind why we light Christmas trees. Let us remember the \n     reason for this great holiday celebration. And let us \n     remember that we seek peace most of all for our children. May \n     this be one of many, many happy and peaceful Christmases in \n     Northern Ireland this year and for many years to come. \n     (Applause.) And may God keep you and bless you and hold all \n     of you in the palm of His hand. Thank you and God bless you.\n       (Applause.)\n       Lord Mayor. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a duty to do \n     tonight. And that is we're going to ask the President to turn \n     the lights on. But you and I have something to do. We have to \n     count down, 10 down to zero. So we want the count, 10, 9--\n     slowly please, so that when the President gets ready I'll \n     give you the okay and then we will have the countdown.\n       (The Christmas tree is lit.)\n       The President. Thank you very much. (Applause.) To the Lord \n     Mayor and Lady Mayoress, let me begin by saying to all of \n     you, Hillary and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts \n     for making us feel so very, very welcome in Belfast and \n     Northern Ireland. (Applause.) We thank you, Lord Mayor, for \n     your cooperation and your help in making this trip so \n     successful, and we trust that, for all of you, we haven't \n     inconvenienced you too much. But this has been a wonderful \n     way for us to begin the Christmas holidays. (Applause.)\n       Let me also say I understood just what an honor it was to \n     be able to turn on this Christmas tree when I realized the \n     competition. (Laughter.) Now, to become President of the \n     United States you have to undertake some considerable \n     competition. But I have never confronted challengers with the \n     name recognition, the understanding of the media and the \n     ability in the martial arts of the Mighty Morphin Power \n     Rangers. (Applause.)\n       To all of you whose support enabled me to join you tonight \n     and turn the Christmas tree on, I give you my heartfelt \n     thanks. (Applause.) I know here in Belfast you've been \n     lighting the Christmas tree for more than 20 years. But this \n     year must be especially joyous to you, for you are entering \n     your second Christmas of peace. (Applause.)\n       As I look down these beautiful streets, I think how \n     wonderful it will be for people to do their holiday shopping \n     without worry of searches or bombs; to visit loved ones on \n     the other side of the border without the burden of \n     checkpoints or roadblocks; to enjoy these magnificent \n     Christmas lights without any fear of violence. Peace has \n     brought real change to your lives.\n       Across the ocean, the American people are rejoicing with \n     you. We are joined to you by strong ties of community and \n     commerce and culture. Over the years men and women of both \n     traditions have flourished in our country and helped America \n     to flourish.\n       And today, of course, we are forging new and special bonds. \n     Belfast's sister city in the United States, Nashville, \n     Tennessee, was proud to send this Christmas tree to friends \n     across the Atlantic. I want to thank the most prominent \n     present resident of Nashville, Tennessee, Vice President Al \n     Gore, the \n\n[[Page S 18093]]\n     Mayor, Phil Bredesen, and the United States Air Force for getting this \n     big tree all the way across the Atlantic to be here with you \n     tonight. (Applause.)\n       In this 50th anniversary year of the end of World War II, \n     many Americans still remember the warmth the people of \n     Northern Ireland showed them when the army was stationed here \n     under General Eisenhower. The people of Belfast named General \n     Eisenhower an honorary burgess of the city. He viewed that \n     honor, and I quote, ``as a token of our common purpose to \n     work together for a better world.'' That mission endures \n     today. We remain Americans and as people of Northern Ireland, \n     partners for security, partners for prosperity and, most \n     important, partners for peace. (Applause.)\n       Two years ago, at this very spot, tens of thousands of you \n     took part in a day for peace, as a response to some of the \n     worst violence Northern Ireland had known in recent years. \n     The two morning papers, representing both traditions, \n     sponsored a telephone poll for peace that generated almost \n     160,000 calls. In the United States, for my fellow Americans \n     who are here, that would be the equivalent of 25 million \n     calls.\n       The response left no doubt that all across Northern Ireland \n     the desire for peace was becoming a demand. I am honored to \n     announce today that those same two newspapers, the Newsletter \n     and the Irish News, have established the President's Prize, \n     an annual award to those at the grass-roots level who have \n     contributed most to peace and reconciliation. The honorees \n     will travel to the United States to exchange experiences on \n     the issues we share, including community relations and \n     conflict resolution. We have a lot to learn from on another. \n     The President's Prize will underscore that Northern Ireland's \n     two traditions have a common interest in peace.\n       As you know--and as the First Lady said--I have received \n     thousands of letters from school children all over your \n     remarkable land telling me what peace means to them. They \n     poured in from villages and cities, from Catholic and \n     Protestant communities, from mixed schools, primary schools, \n     from schools for children with special needs. All the letters \n     in their own way were truly wonderful for their honesty, \n     their simple wisdom and their passion. Many of the children \n     showed tremendous pride in their homeland, in its beauty and \n     its true nature. I congratulate the winners. They were \n     wonderful and I loved hearing their letters.\n       But let me tell you about another couple I received. \n     Eleven-year-old Keith from Carrickfergus wrote: ``Please tell \n     everyone in America that we're not always fighting here, and \n     that it's only a small number of people who make the \n     trouble.'' Like many of the children, Keith did not identify \n     himself as Protestant or Catholic, and did not distinguish \n     between the sources of the violence.\n       So many children told me of loved ones they have lost, of \n     lives disrupted and opportunities forsaken and families \n     forced to move. Yet, they showed remarkable courage and \n     strength and a commitment to overcome the past. As 14-year-\n     old Sharon of County Armagh wrote: ``Both sides have been \n     hurt. Both sides must forgive.''\n       Despite the extraordinary hardships so many of these \n     children have faced, their letters were full of hope and love \n     and humor. To all of you who took the time to write me, \n     you've brightened my holiday season with your words of faith \n     and courage, and I thank you. To all of you who asked me to \n     do what I could to help peace take root, I pledge you \n     America's support. We will stand with you as you take risks \n     for peace. (Applause.)\n       And to all of you who have not lost your sense of humor, I \n     say thank you. I got a letter from 13-year-old Ryan from \n     Belfast. Now, Ryan, if you're out in the crowd tonight, \n     here's the answer to your question. No, as far as I know, an \n     alien spacecraft did not crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in \n     1947. (Laughter.) And, Ryan, if the United States Air Force \n     did recover alien bodies, they didn't tell me about it, \n     either, and I want to know. (Applause.)\n       Ladies and gentlemen, this day that Hillary and I have had \n     here in Belfast and in Derry and Londonderry County will long \n     be with us--(applause)--as one of the most remarkable days of \n     our lives. I leave you with these thoughts. May the Christmas \n     spirit of peace and goodwill flourish and grow in you. May \n     you remember the words of the Lord Mayor: ``This is \n     Christmas. We celebrate the world in a new way because of the \n     birth of Emmanuel; God with us.'' And when God was with us, \n     he said no words more important than these: ``Blessed are the \n     peacemakers, for they shall inherit the Earth.'' (Applause.)\n       Merry Christmas, and God bless you all. (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18092-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18093-S18095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT TO ENGLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IRELAND\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I too would like to congratulate \nPresident Clinton on his visit to Ireland and the United Kingdom. His \nvisit reminds us all of the important role that the United States can \nplay, and is playing, in bringing peace around the world.\n  During his visit, the President visited Derry where he spoke to \nthousands of people who gathered at the Guild Hall. He also joined the \nAmerican Ireland Fund and the family of the late Speaker of the House \nof Representatives in inaugurating the Thomas P. O'Neill Chair for the \nStudy of Peace and Conflict Resolution at Ulster University.\n  The President also paid tribute to ``Ireland's most tireless champion \nfor civil rights and its most eloquent voice of non-violence, John \nHume.'' And he spoke of reconciliation and hope. I am sure he was right \nwhen he said that Tip was smiling down on Derry that day.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the President's addresses \nin Derry may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the addresses were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Mr. Mayor, Mrs. \n     Kerr, Mr. and Mrs. Hume, Sir Patrick and Lady Mayhew, and to \n     this remarkable crowd. Let me say--(applause)--there have \n     been many Presidents of the United States who had their roots \n     in this soil. I can see today how lucky I am to be the first \n     President of the United States to come back to this city to \n     say thank you very much. (Applause.)\n       Hillary and I are proud to be here in the home of Ireland's \n     most tireless champion for civil rights and its most eloquent \n     voice of non-violence, John Hume. (Applause.) I know that at \n     least twice already I have had the honor of hosting John and \n     Pat in Washington. And the last time I saw him I said, you \n     can't come back to Washington one more time until you let me \n     come to Derry. And here I am. (Applause.)\n       I am delighted to be joined here today by a large number of \n     Americans, including a distinguished delegation of members of \n     our United States Congress who have supported peace and \n     reconciliation here and who have supported economic \n     development through the International Fund for Ireland.\n       I am also joined today by members of the O'Neill family. \n     (Applause.) Among the last great chieftains of Ireland were \n     the O'Neills of Ulster. But in America, we still have \n     chieftains who are the O'Neills of Boston. They came all the \n     way over here to inaugurate the Tip O'Neill Chair and Peace \n     Studies here at the University of Ulster. (Applause.) This \n     chair will honor the great Irish American and late Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives by furthering his dream of peace \n     in Northern Ireland. And I am honored to be here with his \n     family members today.\n       All of you know that this city is a very different place \n     from what a visitor like me would have seen just a year and a \n     half ago, before the cease-fire. Crossing the border now is \n     as easy as crossing a speed bump. The soldiers are off the \n     streets. The city walls are open to civilians. There are no \n     more shakedowns as you walk into a store. Daily life has \n     become more ordinary. But this will never be an ordinary \n     city. (Applause.)\n       I came here because you are making a home for peace to \n     flourish and endure--a local climate responsible this week \n     for the announcement of new business operations that offer \n     significant new opportunities to you, as well as new hope. \n     Let me applaud also the success of the Inner City Trust and \n     Patty Dogherty who have put people to work rebuilding bombed-\n     out buildings, building new ones, and building up confidence \n     and civic pride. (Applause.)\n       America's connections to this place go back a long, long \n     time. One of our greatest cities, Philadelphia, was mapped \n     out three centuries ago by a man who was inspired by the \n     layout of the streets behind these walls. His name was \n     William Penn. He was raised a Protestant in Ireland in a \n     military family. He became a warrior and he fought in Ulster. \n     But he turned away from warfare, traded in his armor, \n     converted to the Quaker faith and became a champion of peace.\n       Imprisoned for his religious views, William Penn wrote one \n     of the greatest defenses of religious tolerance in history. \n     Released from prison, he went to America in the 1680s, a \n     divisive decade here, and founded Pennsylvania, a colony \n     unique in the new world because it was based on the principle \n     of religious tolerance.\n       Philadelphia quickly became the main port of entry for \n     immigrants from the north of Ireland who made the Protestant \n     and Catholic traditions valuable parts of our treasured \n     traditions in America. Today when he travels to the States, \n     John Hume is fond of reminding us about the phrase that \n     Americans established in Philadelphia as the motto of our \n     nation, ``E pluribus unum''--Out of many, one--the belief \n     that back then Quakers and Catholics, Anglicans and \n     Presbyterians could practice 0their religion, celebrate their \n     culture, honor their traditions and live as neighbors in \n     peace.\n       In the United States today in just one county, Los Angeles, \n     there are representatives of over 150 different racial, \n     ethnic and religious groups. We are struggling to live out \n     William Penn's vision, and we pray that you will be able to \n     live out that vision as well. (Applause.)\n       Over the last three years since I have had the privilege to \n     be the President of the United States I have had occasion to \n     meet with Nationalists and to meet with Unionists, and to \n     listen to their sides of the story. I have come to the \n     conclusion that here, as in so many other places in the \n     world--from the Middle East to Bosnia--the divisions that are \n     most important here are not the divisions between opposing \n     views or opposing interests. Those divisions can be \n     reconciled. \n\n[[Page S 18094]]\n      The deep divisions, the most important ones, are those between the \n     peacemakers and the enemies of peace--those who, deep, deep \n     down inside want peace more than anything, and those who, \n     deep down inside can't bring themselves to reach out for \n     peace. Those who are in the ship of peace and those who would \n     sink it. Those who bravely meet on the bridge of \n     reconciliation, and those who would blow it up.\n       My friends, everyone in life at some point has to decide \n     what kind of person he or she is going to be. Are you going \n     to be someone who defines yourself in terms of what you are \n     against, or what you are for? Will you be someone who defines \n     yourself in terms of who you aren't, or who you are? The time \n     has come for the peacemakers to triumph in Northern Ireland, \n     and the United States will support them as they do. \n     (Applause.)\n       The world-renowned playwright from this city, Brian Friel, \n     wrote a play called ``Philadelphia, Here I Come.'' And in a \n     character who is about to immigrate from Ireland thinks back \n     on his past life and says to himself, it's all over. But his \n     alter ego reminds him of his future and replies, and it's \n     about to begin. It's all over and it's about to begin. If \n     only change were that easy.\n       To leave one way of life behind in search of another takes \n     a strong amount of faith and courage. But the world has seen \n     here over the last 15 months that people from Londonderry \n     County to County Down, from Antrim to Armagh, have made the \n     transition from a time of ever-present fear to a time of \n     fragile peace. The United States applauds the efforts of \n     Prime Minister Major and Prime Minister Bruton who have \n     launched the new twin-track initiative and have opened a \n     process that gives the parties to begin a dialogue in which \n     all views are representative, and all can be heard.\n       Not far from this spot stands a statue of reconciliation--\n     two figures, ten feet tall, each reaching out a hand toward \n     the other, but neither quite making it across the divide. It \n     is a beautiful and powerful symbol of where many people stand \n     today in this great land. Let it now point people to the \n     handshake of reconciliation. Life cannot be lived with the \n     stillness of statues. Life must go on. The hands must come \n     closer together or drift further apart.\n       Your great Nobel Prize winning poet, Seamus Heaney, wrote \n     the following words--(applause)--wrote the following words \n     that some of you must know already, but that for me capture \n     this moment. He said: ``History says don't hope on this side \n     of the grave, but then, once in a lifetime the longed-for \n     tidal wave of justice can rise up. And hope and history \n     rhyme. So hope for a great sea change on the far side of \n     revenge. Believe that a further shore is reachable from here. \n     Believe in miracles and cures and healing wells.''\n       Well, my friends, I believe. I believe we live in a time of \n     hope and history rhyming. Standing here in front of the Guild \n     Hall, looking out over these historic walls, I see a peaceful \n     city, a safe city, a hopeful city, full of young people that \n     should have a peaceful and prosperous future here where their \n     roots and families are. That is what I see today with you. \n     (Applause.)\n       And so I ask you to build on the opportunity you have \n     before you; to believe that the future can be better than the \n     past; to work together because you have so much more to gain \n     by working together than by drifting apart. Have the patience \n     to work for a just and lasting peace. Reach for it. The \n     United States will reach with you. The further shore of that \n     peace is within your reach.\n       Thank you, and God bless you all. (Applause.)\n       Mayor and Mrs. Kerr, Sir Patrick and Mrs. Mayhew, Mr. and \n     Mrs. Hume; to the community and religious leaders who are \n     here and to my fellow Americans who are here, Congressman \n     Walsh and the congressional delegation; Senator Dodd, Senator \n     Mack and others. Let me thank you all for the wonderful \n     reception you have given to Hillary and to me today and, \n     through us, to the people of the United States. And let me \n     thank Tom O'Neill for his incredibly generous remarks. I am \n     honored to be here with him and with his family and with \n     Loretta Brennan Glucksman and the other members of the \n     American Ireland Fund to help inaugurate this Tip O'Neill \n     Chair in Peace Studies.\n       And thank you, Vice Chancellor Smith, for the degree. You \n     know, I wonder how far it is from a degree to a \n     professorship. (Laughter.) See, I have this job without a lot \n     of tenure, and I'm looking for one with more tenure. \n     (Applause.)\n       Tip O'Neill was a model for many people he never knew. The \n     model of public service. He proved that a person could be a \n     national leader without losing the common touch, without ever \n     forgetting that all these high-flown speeches we give and all \n     these complex issues we talk about in the end have a real, \n     tangible impact on the lives of ordinary people. And that in \n     any free land, in the end all that really counts are the \n     lives of ordinary people.\n       He said he was a man of the House, but he was far more. He \n     was fundamentally a man of the people. A bricklayer's son who \n     became the most powerful person in Congress and our nation's \n     most prominent, most loyal champion of ordinary working \n     families.\n       He loved politics because he loved people, but also because \n     he knew it could make a difference in people's lives. And you \n     have proved here that political decisions by brave people can \n     make a difference in people's lives. Along with Senators \n     Kennedy and Moynihan and former Governor Hugh Carey of New \n     York, he was among the first Irish American politicians to \n     oppose violence in Northern Ireland. And though we miss him \n     sorely, he will long be remembered in the United States and \n     now in Ireland with this O'Neill Chair. It is a fitting \n     tribute to his life and legacy, for he knew that peace had to \n     be nurtured by a deeper understanding among people and \n     greater opportunity for all.\n       Tip O'Neill was old enough to remember a time when Irish \n     Catholics were actually discriminated against in the United \n     States, and he had the last laugh when they wound up running \n     the place. (Laughter.) In my lifetime--(applause)--I was just \n     thinking that in my conscious political lifetime we've had \n     three Irish Speakers of the House of Representatives: John \n     McCormick and Tip O'Neill of Boston and Tom Foley of \n     Washington State; and, goodness knows how many more we're \n     destined to have.\n       I am very proud to be here to inaugurate this chair in \n     peace studies. I have been privileged to come here at an \n     important time in your history. I have been privileged to be \n     President at an important time in your history and to do what \n     I could on behalf of the United States to help the peace \n     process go forward.\n       But the work of peace is really the work of a lifetime. \n     First, you have to put the violence behind you; you have done \n     that. Then, you have to make an agreement that recognizes the \n     differences and the commonalities among you. And this twin-\n     tracks process, I believe is a way at least to begin that \n     process where everyone can be heard.\n       Then, you have to change the spirit of the people until it \n     is as normal as getting up in the morning and having \n     breakfast, to feel a real affinity for the people who share \n     this land with you without regard to their religion or their \n     politics.\n       This chair of peace studies can help you to do that. It can \n     be a symbol of the lifetime work of building a peaceful \n     spirit and heart in every citizen of this land.\n       Our administration has been a strong supporter of the \n     International Fund for Ireland. We will continue to do so \n     because of projects like this one and because of the work \n     still to be done. We were eager to sponsor the conference we \n     had last May, aided by the diligent efforts of our friend, \n     former Senator and Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell who \n     now embarks for you on another historic mission of peace.\n       I hope very much that Senator Mitchell will succeed. I \n     think the voices I have heard on this trip indicate to me \n     that you want him to succeed, and that you want to succeed.\n       A lot of incredibly moving things have happened to us \n     today, but I think to me, the most moving were the two \n     children who stood and introduced me this morning in the \n     Mackie Plant in Belfast. They represented all those other \n     children, including children here from Derry who have written \n     me about what peace means to them over the last few weeks.\n       One young boy said--the young boy who introduced me said \n     that he studied with and played with people who were both \n     Protestant and Catholic and he'd almost gotten to the point \n     where he couldn't tell the difference. (Laughter.) The \n     beautiful young girl who introduced me, that beautiful child, \n     started off by saying what her Daddy did for a living, and \n     then she said she lost her first Daddy in The Troubles. And \n     she thought about it every day, it was the worst day of her \n     life. And she couldn't stand another loss.\n       The up side and the down side. And those children joined \n     hands to introduce me. I felt almost as if my speech were \n     superfluous. But I know one thing: Tip O'Neill was smiling \n     down on the whole thing today. (Applause.)\n       The other night I had a chance to go with Hillary to the \n     Ford Theater in Washington, D.C., a wonderful, historic \n     place; it's been there since before our Civil War, and where \n     President Lincoln was assassinated. And I told the people \n     there who come once a year to raise money for it so we can \n     keep it going that we always thought of it as a sad and \n     tragic place, but it was really a place where he came to \n     laugh and escape the cares of our great Civil War. And there, \n     I was thinking that America has always been about three great \n     things, our country: love of liberty, belief in progress, and \n     the struggle for unity.\n       And the last is in so many ways by far the most difficult. \n     It is a continuing challenge for us to deal with the \n     differences among us, to honestly respect our differences, to \n     stand up where we feel differently about certain things, and \n     still to find that core of common humanity across all the sea \n     of differences which permit us to preserve liberty; to make \n     progress possible and to live up to the deepest truths of our \n     shared human nature.\n       In the end, that is what this chair is all about. And \n     believe me, we need it everywhere. We need it in the streets \n     of our toughest cities in the United States, where we are \n     attempting to teach our children when they have conflicts, \n     they shouldn't go home and pick up a gun or a knife and hurt \n     each other, they should figure out a way to work through to \n     mutual respect.\n       We need it in the Middle East, where the Prime Minister of \n     Israel just gave his life to a religious fanatic of his own \n     faith because he dared to make peace and give the children of \n     his country a better future.\n       We need it in Bosnia, where the leaders have agreed to make \n     peace, but where the people must now purge their heart of the \n     hatred borne of four years of merciless slaughter. We need \n     this everywhere.\n       So, my friends, I pray not only for your success in making \n     peace, but I pray that \n\n[[Page S 18095]]\n     through this Chair and through your example, you will become a model \n     for the rest of the world because the world will always need \n     models for peace.\n       Thank you, and God bless you all. (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18093-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18095-S18097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PRESIDENT CLINTON'S VISIT TO ENGLAND, NORTHERN IRELAND, AND IRELAND\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \nPresident Clinton on his trip to Northern Ireland, Ireland, and England \nand I commend him for his continuing contributions to the peace process \nwhich have helped silence the guns for more than 15 months.\n  I was honored to travel with the President on that trip. Not since \nPresident Kennedy's visit to Ireland in 1963 have the people of that \nisland so warmly welcomed an American President. It was also the first \ntime that an American President visited Northern Ireland.\n  On a sunny day in Dublin, a huge crowd turned out to hear the \nPresident's address in front of the Bank of Ireland at College Green \nwhere he was awarded the Freedom of the City. And later that day he \naddressed Ireland's Parliament, the Dail.\n  Among other things, the President spoke eloquently about the tragedy \nof the famine 150 years ago and the most bittersweet of blessings which \ncame from it--the arrival in America of Irish immigrants who would help \nbuild our country. Today, 44 million Americans claim Irish descent. \nThey are Protestants and Catholics. Many came during the famine and \nmany came before. All want peace in Northern Ireland. As one of those \n44 million Irish Americans, I am grateful for the leadership the \nPresident has shown in helping to bring peace to that island which \nmeans so much to so many of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the President's remarks in Dublin be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by the President in Address to the People of Ireland, Bank of \n      Ireland at College Green, Dublin, Ireland, December 1, 1995\n\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.) First, let me say to all \n     of you Dubliners and all Ireland, Hillary and I have loved \n     our trip to your wonderful country. (Applause.) To the \n     Taoiseach and Mrs. Bruton; Lord Mayor Loftus and Lady Loftus; \n     City Manager Frank Feely; to all the aldermen who conferred \n     this great honor on me.\n       To the Americans in the audience, welcome to all of you. \n     (Applause.) Are there any Irish in the audience? (Applause.) \n     I want to say also how pleased I am to be here with a number \n     of Irish American members of the United States Congress; and \n     the Irish American Director of the Peace Corps, Mark Gearan; \n     the Irish American Secretary of Education Richard Riley; and \n     the Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, who wishes today he were \n     Irish American. Thank you all for being here. (Applause.)\n       I was on this college green once before. Yes. In 1968, when \n     I was almost as young as some of the young students over \n     there. (Applause.) Lord Mayor, I never dreamed I would be \n     back here on this college green in this capacity, but I am \n     delighted to be here. And I thank you. (Applause.)\n       I am told that in earlier times the honor I have just \n     received, being awarded the Freedom of the City, meant you no \n     longer had to pay tolls to the Vikings. I'm going to try that \n     on the Internal Revenue Service when I get home. I hope it \n     will work. (Laughter.) Whether it does or not, I am proud to \n     say that I am now a free man of Dublin. (Applause.)\n       To look out into this wonderful sea of Irish faces on this \n     beautiful Irish day I feel like a real ``Dub'' today--is that \n     what I'm supposed to say? (Applause.) Not only that, I know \n     we have a handy football team. (Laughter.)\n       Let me say that, as a lot of you know, because of events \n     developing in Bosnia and the prospect of peace there, I had \n     to cut short my trip. But there are a few signs out there I \n     want to respond to. I will return to Ballybunion for my golf \n     game. (Laughter and applause.)\n       I am also pleased to announce that President Robinson has \n     accepted my invitation to come to the United States next June \n     to continue our friendship. (Applause.)\n       There's another special Irish-American I want to mention \n     today and that is our distinguished Ambassador to Ireland, \n     Jean Kennedy Smith--(applause)--who came here with her \n     brother, President Kennedy, 32 years ago and who has worked \n     very hard also for the cause of peace in Northern Ireland. \n     (Applause.)\n       Years ago, Americans learned about Dublin from the stories \n     of James Joyce and Sean O'Casey. Today, America and the world \n     still learn about Dublin and Ireland through the words of \n     Sebastian Barry, Paula Meehin, Roddy Doyle--(applause)--\n     through the films of Jim Sheridan, Neil Jordan; through the \n     voices of Mary Black and the Delores Keane--(applause)--and \n     yes, through the Cranberries and U-2. (Applause.) I hear all \n     about how America's global--the world's global culture is \n     becoming more American, but I believe if you want to grasp \n     the global culture you need to come to Ireland. (Applause.)\n       All of you know that I have family ties here. My mother was \n     a Cassidy, and how I wish she were alive to be here with me \n     today. She would have loved the small towns and she would \n     have loved Dublin. Most of all, she would have loved the fact \n     that in Ireland, you have nearly 300 racing days a year. \n     (Laughter.) She loved the horses.\n       I understand that there are some Cassidys out in the \n     audience today. And if they are, I want to say in my best \n     Arkansas accent, cead mile failte--(applause)--beatha saol \n     agus slainte. (Applause.)\n       One hundred and fifty years ago, the crops of this gorgeous \n     island turned black in the ground and one-fourth of your \n     people either starved from the hunger or were lost to \n     emigration. That famine was the greatest tragedy in Irish \n     history. But out of that horrible curse came the most \n     bittersweet of blessings--the arrival in my country of \n     millions of new Americans who built the United States and \n     climbed to the top of its best works. For every person here \n     in Ireland today, 12 more in the United States have proud \n     roots in Irish soil. (Applause.)\n       Perhaps the memory of the famine explains in part the \n     extraordinary generosity of the Irish people, not just to \n     needy neighbors in the local parish, but to strangers all \n     around the globe. You do not forget those who still go hungry \n     in the world today; who yearn simply to put food on the table \n     and clothes on their backs. In places as far away as the Holy \n     Land, Asia and Africa, the Irish are helping people to build \n     a future of hope.\n       Your sons and daughters in the Gardai and the defense \n     forces take part in some of the most demanding missions of \n     goodwill, keeping the peace, helping people in war-torn lands \n     turn from conflict to cooperation. Whenever the troubled \n     places of the earth call out for help, from Haiti to Lebanon, \n     the Irish are always among the very first to answer the call.\n       Your commitment to peace helps conquer foes that threaten \n     us all. And on behalf of the people of the United States, I \n     say to the people of Ireland: We thank you for that from the \n     bottom of our hearts. (Applause.)\n       Ireland is helping beat back the forces of hatred and \n     destruction all around the world--the spread of weapons of \n     mass destruction, terrorism, ethnic hatreds, religious \n     fanaticism, the international drug trade. Ireland is helping \n     to beat back these forces that wage war against all humanity. \n     You are an inspiration to people around the world. You have \n     made peace heroic. Nowhere are the people of Ireland more \n     important in the cause of peace today than right here at \n     home.\n       Tuesday night, before I left the United States to come \n     here, I received the happy word that the Taoiseach and Prime \n     Minister Major had opened a gateway to a just and lasting \n     peace, a peace that will lift the lives of your neighbors in \n     Northern Ireland and their neighbors in the towns and \n     counties that share the Northern border. That was the \n     greatest welcome anyone could have asked for. I applaud the \n     Taoiseach for his courage, but I know that the courage and \n     the heart of the Irish people made it possible. And I thank \n     you for what you did. (Applause.)\n       Waging peace is risky. It takes courage and strength that \n     is a hard road. It is easier, as I said yesterday, to stay \n     with the old grudges and the old habits. But the right thing \n     to do is to reach for a new future of peace--not because \n     peace is a document on paper, or even a handshake among \n     leaders, but because it changes people's lives in fundamental \n     and good ways.\n       Yesterday in Northern Ireland I saw that for myself. I saw \n     it on the floor of the Mackie Plant in Belfast, with \n     Catholics and Protestants working side by side to build a \n     better future for their families. I heard it in the voices of \n     the two extraordinary children you may have seen on your \n     television, one a Catholic girl, the other a Protestant boy, \n     who introduced me to the people of Belfast with their hands \n     joined, telling the world of their hopes for the future, a \n     future without bullets or bombs, in which the only barriers \n     they face are the limits to their dreams.\n       As I look out on this sea of people today I tell you that \n     the thing that moved me most in that extraordinary day in \n     Northern Ireland yesterday was that the young people, \n     Catholic and Protestant alike, made it clear to me not only \n     with their words, but by the expressions on their faces that \n     they want peace and decency among all people. (Applause.)\n       I know well that the immigration from your country to the \n     shores of mine helped to make America great. But I want more \n     than anything for the young people of Ireland, wherever they \n     live on this island, to be able to grow up and live out their \n     dreams close to their roots in peace and honor and freedom \n     and equality. (Applause.)\n       I could not say it better than your Nobel Prize-winning \n     poet, Seamus Heany, has said: ``We are living in a moment \n     where hope and history rhyme.'' In Dublin, if there is peace \n     in Northern Ireland, it is your victory, too. And I ask all \n     of you to think about the next steps we must take. \n     \n[[Page S 18096]]\n\n       Stand with the Taoiseach as he takes risks for peace. \n     Realize how difficult it is for them, having been in their \n     patterns of opposition for so long to the north of you. And \n     realize that those of you who have more emotional and \n     physical space must reach out and help them to take those \n     next hard steps. It is worth doing.\n       And to you, this vast, wonderful throng of people here, and \n     all of the people of Ireland, I say: America will be with you \n     as you walk the road of peace. We know from our own \n     experience that making peace among people of different \n     cultures is the work of a lifetime. It is a constant \n     challenge to find strength amid diversity, to learn to \n     respect differences instead of run from them. Every one of us \n     must fight the struggle within our own spirit. We have to \n     decide whether we will define our lives primarily based on \n     who we are, or who we are not; based on what we are for, or \n     what we are against. There are always things to be against in \n     life, and we have to stand against the bad things we should \n     stand against.\n       But the most important thing is that we have more in common \n     with people who appear on the surface to be different from us \n     than most of us know. And we have more to gain by reaching \n     out in the spirit of brotherhood and sisterhood to those \n     people than we can possibly know. That is the challenge the \n     young people of this generation face. (Applause.)\n       When President Kennedy came here a generation ago and spoke \n     in this city he said that he sincerely believed--and I \n     quote--``that your future is as promising as your past is \n     proud; that your destiny lies not as a peaceful island in a \n     sea of troubles, but as a maker and shaper of world peace.''\n       A generation later Ireland has claimed that destiny. Yours \n     is a more peaceful land in a world that is ever more peaceful \n     in significant measure because of the efforts of the citizens \n     of Ireland. For touching the hearts and minds of peace-loving \n     people in every corner of the world; for the risk you must \n     now continue to take for peace; for inspiring the nations of \n     the world by your example; and for giving so much to make \n     America great, America says, thank you.\n       Thank you, Ireland, and God bless you all. (Applause.)\n\n   Remarks by the President in Address to the Irish Parliament, Dail \n      Chamber at Leinster House, Dublin, Ireland, December 1, 1995\n\n       Mr. Speaker Comhaile, you appear to be someone who can be \n     trusted with the budget. (Laughter and applause.) Such are \n     the vagaries of faith which confront us all. (Laughter and \n     applause.)\n       To the Taoiseach, the Tanaiste, members of the Dail and the \n     Seanad, head of the Senate: I'm honored to be joined here, as \n     all of you know, by my wife, members of our Cabinet and \n     members of the United States Congress of both parties--the \n     congressional congregation chaired by Congressman Walsh--they \n     are up there. They got an enormous laugh out of the comments \n     of the Comhaile. (Laughter.) For different reasons they were \n     laughing. (Laughter.)\n       I thank you for the honor of inviting me here, and I am \n     especially pleased to be here at this moment in your \n     history--before the elected representatives of a strong, \n     confident, democratic Ireland; a nation today playing a \n     greater role in world affairs than ever before.\n       We live in a time of immense hope and immense possibility; \n     a time captured, I believe, in the wonderful lines of your \n     poet, Seamus Heaney, when he talked of the ``longed-for tidal \n     wave of justice can rise up and hope and history rhyme.'' \n     That is the time in which we live.\n       It's the world's good fortune that Ireland has become a \n     force for fulfilling that hope and redeeming the \n     possibilities of mankind--a force for good far beyond your \n     numbers. And we are all the better for it.\n       Today I have traveled from the North where I have seen the \n     difference Ireland's leadership has made for peace there. At \n     the lighting of Belfast's Christmas tree for tens of \n     thousands of people there, in the faces of two communities \n     divided by bitter history, we saw the radiance of optimism \n     born, especially among the young of both communities. In the \n     voices of the Shankill and the Falls, there was a harmony of \n     new hope which we saw. I saw that the people want peace--and \n     they will have it.\n       George Bernard Shaw, with his wonderful Irish love of \n     irony, said, ``Peace is not only better than war, but \n     infinitely more arduous.'' Well, today, I thank Prime \n     Minister Bruton and former Prime Minister Reynolds and Deputy \n     Prime Minister Spring and Britain's Prime Minister Major, and \n     others, but especially these, for their unfailing dedication \n     to the arduous task of peace.\n       From the Downing Street Declaration to the historic cease-\n     fire that began 15 months ago, to Tuesday's announcement of \n     the twin-track initiative which will open a dialogue in which \n     all voices can be heard and all viewpoints can be \n     represented, they have taken great risks without hesitation. \n     They've chosen a harder road than the comfortable path of \n     pleasant, present pieties. But what they have done is right. \n     And the children and grandchildren of this generation of \n     Irish will reap the rewards.\n       Today, I renew America's pledge. Your road is our road. We \n     want to walk it together. We will continue our support--\n     political, financial and moral--to those who take risks for \n     peace. I am proud that our administration was the first to \n     support in the executive budget sent to the Congress the \n     International Fund for Ireland--because we believe that those \n     on both sides of the border who have been denied so much for \n     so long should see that their risks are rewarded with the \n     tangible benefits of peace.\n       In another context a long time ago, Mr. Yeats reminded us \n     that too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart. \n     We must not let the hearts of the young people who yearn \n     for peace turn to stone.\n       I want to thank you here, not only for the support you've \n     given your leaders in working for peace in Northern Ireland, \n     but for the extraordinary work you have done to wage peace \n     over war all around the world. Almost 1,500 years ago, \n     Ireland stood as a lone beacon of civilization to a continent \n     shrouded in darkness.\n       It has been said, probably without overstatement, that the \n     Irish, in that dark period, saved civilization. Certainly you \n     saved the records of our civilization--our shared ideas, are \n     shared ideals, our priceless recordings of them.\n       Now, in our time, when so many nations seek to overcome \n     conflict and barbarism, the light still shines out of \n     Ireland. Since 1958, almost 40 years now, there has never \n     been a single, solitary day that Irish troops did not stand \n     watch for peace on a distant shore. In Lebanon, in Cyprus, in \n     Somalia, in so many other places, more than 41,000 Irish \n     military and police personnel have served over the years as \n     peacekeepers--an immense contribution for a nation whose \n     Armed Forces today number fewer than 13,000.\n       I know that during your presidency of the European Union \n     next year, Ireland will help to lead the effort to build \n     security for a stable, strong and free Europe. For all--all \n     you have done, and for your steadfast devotion to peace, I \n     salute the people of Ireland.\n       Our Nation also has a vital stake in a Europe that is \n     stable, strong and free--something which is now in reach for \n     the first time since nation-states appeared on the continent \n     of Europe so many centuries ago. But we know such a Europe \n     can never be built as long as conflict tears at the heart of \n     the continent in Bosnia. The fire there threatens the \n     emerging democracies of the region and our allies nearby. And \n     it also breaks our heart and violates our conscience.\n       That is why, now that the parties have committed themselves \n     to peace, we in the United States are determined to help them \n     find the way back from savagery to civility, to end the \n     atrocities and heal the wounds of that terrible war. That is \n     why we are preparing our forces to participate there, not in \n     fighting a war, but in securing a peace rooted in the \n     agreement they have freely made.\n       Standing here, thinking about the devastation in Bosnia, \n     the long columns of hopeless refugees streaming from their \n     homes, it is impossible not to recall the ravages that were \n     visited on your wonderful country 150 years ago--not by war, \n     of course, but by natural disaster when the crops rotted \n     black in the ground.\n       Today, still, the Great Famine is seared in the memory of \n     the Irish nation and all caring peoples. The memory of a \n     million dead, nearly two million more forced into exile-- \n     these memories will remain forever vivid to all of us whose \n     heritage is rooted here.\n       But as an American, I must say as I did just a few moments \n     ago in Dublin downtown, that in that tragedy came the supreme \n     gift of the Irish to the United States. The men, women and \n     children who braved the coffin ships when Galway and Mayo \n     emptied; when Kerry and Cork took flight, brought a life and \n     a spirit that has enormously enriched the life of our \n     country.\n       The regimental banner brought by President Kennedy that \n     hangs in this house reminds us of the nearly 200,000 Irishmen \n     who took up arms in our Civil War. Many of them barely were \n     off the ships when they joined the Union forces. They fought \n     and died at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville and \n     Gettysburg. Theirs was only the first of countless \n     contributions to our Nation from those who fled the famine. \n     But that contribution enabled us to remain a nation and to be \n     here with you today in partnership for peace for your nation \n     and for the peoples who live on this island.\n       The Irish have been building America ever since-- our \n     cities, our industry, our culture, our public life. I am \n     proud that the delegation that has accompanied me here today \n     includes the latest generation of Irish American leaders in \n     the United States, men and women who remain devoted to \n     increasing our strength and safeguarding our liberty.\n       In the last century, it was often said that the Irish who \n     fled the great hunger were searching for casleain na n-or--\n     castles of gold. I cannot say that they found those castles \n     of gold in the United States, but I can tell you this-- they \n     built a lot of castles of gold for the United States in the \n     prosperity and freedom of our Nation. We are grateful for \n     what they did and for the deep ties to Ireland that they gave \n     us in their sons and daughters.\n       Now we seek to repay that in some small way--by being a \n     partner with you for peace. We seek somehow to communicate to \n     every single person who lives here that we want for all of \n     your children the right to grow up in an Ireland where this \n     entire island gives every man and woman the right to live up \n     to the fullest of their God-given abilities and gives people \n     the right to live in equality and freedom and dignity.\n       That is the tide of history. We must make sure that the \n     tide runs strong here, for no people deserve the brightest \n     future more than the Irish. \n     \n[[Page S 18097]]\n\n       God bless you and thank you.

Mr. President, the warm reception President Clinton \nreceived last week when he visited Ireland and the United Kingdom was a \nfitting tribute to his commitment to peace in Northern Ireland.\n  President Clinton's involvement in the Northern Ireland issue helped \nbring about the paramilitary cease-fires of 1994 and he continues to \nimpact positively on the efforts for peace there.\n  On Friday evening, the Irish Government hosted a dinner for President \nand Mrs. Clinton at Dublin Castle. Irish Prime Minister John Bruton \nspoke of the President's foreign policy successes, especially his \ncommitment to bringing peace to Northern Ireland. Prime Minister Bruton \nmentioned in particular United States diplomatic efforts and economic \nsupport, including the International Fund for Ireland and the \nWashington Conference on Investment which the President hosted in May \nin Washington.\n  President Clinton commended the Taoiseach for work with Prime \nMinister Major which led to the recent announcement of the launch of \nthe twin-track process.\n  I commend to my colleagues the toasts given by the President and \nTaoiseach and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the toasts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Remarks by the President and Prime Minister Bruton in an Exchange of \n        Toasts, Dublin Castle, Dublin, Ireland, December 1, 1995\n\n       Mr. Bruton.  Mr. President, Finola and I heartily welcome \n     you and your wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to our country. \n     You have seen for yourselves and felt for yourselves the \n     warmth of the affection and the admiration in which you are \n     held throughout this island. The affection and admiration \n     extends to you personally, to your administration, to the \n     office that you hold, and particularly to the great country \n     that you need.\n       We welcome, too, the bipartisan congressional delegation, \n     representing your two great political parties who have come \n     with you to Ireland.\n       Tonight is for remembering; it's for celebrating and it's \n     for looking ahead. We think of past Presidents of the United \n     States who have visited Ireland--in June 1963, John \n     Fitzgerald Kennedy captivated Ireland as he captivated the \n     world. To us, he was not only a reminder of our past, but a \n     vision of our future. We thank you for sending the late \n     President's sister, Jean Kennedy Smith, to work with us now \n     as your Ambassador. (Applause.)\n       The late President Richard Nixon visited this country in \n     1970. And President Ronald Reagan, who visited us in 1984, \n     was, like you, a great friend of this country; a great man \n     whose bravery in publicly acknowledging his illness has given \n     courage, reassurance and consultation to millions across the \n     globe who face the same challenge in their lives.\n       The ties which bind Ireland and the United States cover all \n     human activity. The story of the Irish in America is the \n     story of America itself. It's a tale of extraordinary \n     success, shown in the presence here tonight of some \n     outstanding Irish Americans. But to the spectacular \n     achievements of the few must be added the lesser triumphs of \n     the many--Irish farmers and builders; policemen and nurses; \n     teachers and firemen, who from Boston to San Francisco have \n     made America what it is today.\n       In celebrating success let us not forget hardship. This is \n     the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine which drove so many \n     Irish to seek refuge in America, where they found a welcome \n     and an ability to remake their lives through sheer hard work.\n       As Ireland itself changes, so, too, does its relationship \n     with the United States. The highly educated Irish emigrants \n     of the 1980s and 1990s are helping make America today a \n     stronger and a better place. They moved back and forth \n     between the old world and the new with facility and ease. And \n     many returned here, having worked in the United States, to \n     become part of the young internationally-minded, well-trained \n     work force which, combined with a good tax and investment \n     climate, make Ireland a natural home, a natural base for \n     great United States cooperations like Intel, Motorola, \n     Microsoft, and Abbott.\n       In the 74 years since the treaty of 1921, signed this week \n     74 years ago, this state of ours, born in fire, has \n     transformed itself into a mature European democracy, secure \n     in its ethos, open to the world and proud of its youth.\n       (Speaks in Gaelic.) (Applause.)\n       American political ideas of liberty, of government based on \n     the consent of the governed and of the separation of powers, \n     have inspired our Irish Constitution. Your Constitution also \n     acknowledges the fact that people do not always agree. Your \n     second President, John Adams, said that ``America has been a \n     theater of parties and feuds for nearly 200 years.'' Judging \n     from your own recent experience, Mr. President, I think you \n     might agree with him. (Laughter.)\n       But quarrels pass; ideas remain. The use of political power \n     must be based on moral values. As President Jefferson said, \n     ``Our interests soundly calculated will ever be found \n     inseparable from our moral duties.'' Moral duties freely \n     followed are the best compass in personal relations, the best \n     compass in domestic politics, and the best compass in foreign \n     policy.\n       We admire the achievements of your administration in \n     foreign policy--in Haiti, in the Middle East, and most \n     recently and most notably, in Bosnia. Your country's moral \n     vision has helped bring peace and stability to the world. I \n     know that I speak for all in Ireland when I say thank you \n     from the depth of my heart for the sustained commitment that \n     you have shown in bringing peace to this country. (Applause.)\n       At the beginning of your presidency you said that you'd be \n     there for the Irish not just on one day of the year, but \n     every day of the year. You have lived up to that. And so, \n     too, has Vice President Gore, Secretary Christopher, Tony \n     Lake and his staff, and Senator George Mitchell. You and they \n     have given your time and your energies not only to myself and \n     to the Tanaiste, but to many political figures from every \n     side of the divide in Northern Ireland. You've shown balance, \n     as you saw yesterday in Belfast and Derry. You've won respect \n     and confidence right across the divide, across which it is \n     almost impossible to win common respect--the respect that you \n     have won, Mr. President.\n       And America has backed its words with deeds, as we're \n     seeing in the work of the International Fund for Ireland, \n     and most notably, in the follow-through of your \n     initiative, the Washington Conference on Investment in \n     Ireland.\n       In Northern Ireland, the key to success and agreement is \n     dialogue. And in dialogue, all must accept those on the other \n     side as they are, not as they might wish them to be. Irish \n     Nationalism is beginning to understand and respect Unionism. \n     Unionists are beginning to understand and respect \n     Nationalism. Both must coexist and must grow together.\n       The principle of consent is profoundly important. Consent \n     means that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland \n     cannot be changed without the agreement of the people there. \n     But consent also means that the system of government in \n     Northern Ireland must be one to which both communities can \n     agree. In one sense, neither side has a veto. And yet, in \n     another sense, both sides have a veto. So getting agreement \n     isn't going to be easy.\n       And I believe that we will find in some words of yours, Mr. \n     President, the inspiration that will help us find that \n     illusive agreement. Let us think of all the good that people \n     do on a daily basis--in schools and health care and in \n     business in Northern Ireland. Let us think of the kindness \n     the people there continue to show to one another every day of \n     the week, across the religious divide even at the height of \n     25 years of trouble. That spirit needs to be reflected in \n     politics.\n       You said in your inaugural address, ``There's nothing wrong \n     with America that cannot be cured by what is right with \n     America.'' I say there's nothing wrong with Northern Ireland \n     that cannot be cured by what is right with Northern Ireland. \n     There is nothing wrong between North and South on this island \n     that cannot be cured by what is right between North and South \n     on this island. And there's nothing wrong between Britain and \n     Ireland that cannot be cured by what is already right between \n     Britain and Ireland.\n       While you were still a presidential candidate, in an \n     interview, I believe, to The New York Times in 1992--June, I \n     believe it was--you said, ``If you live long enough you'll \n     make mistakes. But if you learn from those, you'll be a \n     better person. It's how you handle adversity, not how it \n     affects you. The main thing is never quit, never quit, never \n     quit.'' Do you remember saying that? (Applause.)\n       We will not quit. We will not quit in our search for a \n     balanced, fair and just settlement on this island, and \n     between this island and its neighbors to which all can give \n     equal allegiance.\n       I'd like to propose a toast--to the President and the \n     people of the United States of America. The President and the \n     people of the United States.\n       (A toast is offered.) (Applause.)\n       The President. To the Taoiseach and Mrs. Bruton, and to all \n     of our hosts. Hillary and I are honored to be here tonight \n     with all of you, and to be here in the company of some of \n     America's greatest Irish Americans, including Senator George \n     Mitchell, who has taken on such a great and difficult task; a \n     bipartisan congressional delegation headed by Congressman \n     Walsh; many members of the Ambassador's family, including \n     Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Lt. Governor of Maryland; the \n     Mayors of Chicago and Los Angeles; Secretary Riley, the \n     Secretary of Education; Mark Gearan, Director of the Peace \n     Corps. And as I said, we have the Secretary of Commerce, Ron \n     Brown, tonight, who wishes, more than ever before in his \n     life, that he were Irish. (Laughter.) I think he is down deep \n     inside. (Laughter.)\n       I thank you also for--I see the Mayor of Pittsburgh here--I \n     know I've left out some others--my wonderful step-father, \n     Dick Kelley, who thought it was all right when I got elected \n     President. But when I brought him home to Ireland he knew I \n     had finally arrived. (Laughter and applause.) \n     \n[[Page S 18098]]\n\n       You know, the Taoiseach has been not only a good friend to \n     me in our work for peace, but a good friend to the United \n     States. Indeed, he and Finola actually came to Washington, \n     D.C. to celebrate their honeymoon. I think it's fair to say \n     that his honeymoon there lasted longer than mine did. \n     (Laughter and applause.)\n       I managed to get even with at least one member of \n     Congress--or former member of Congress--when I convinced \n     Senator Mitchell to give into the entreaties of the Taoiseach \n     and the Prime Minister to head this arms decommissioning \n     group. Now, there's any easy job for you. (Laughter.) You \n     know, in Ireland I understand there's a--our American country \n     music is very popular--Garth Brooks said the other day he \n     sold more records in Ireland than any other place in the \n     world outside America. So I told Senator Mitchell today \n     that--he was telling me what a wonderful day we had yesterday \n     in Derry and Belfast, and what a wonderful day we had today \n     in Dublin, and I said, ``Yes, now you get to go to work.'' I \n     said, this reminds me of that great country song, ``I Got the \n     Gold Mine and You Got the Shaft.'' (Laughter and applause.) \n     But if anybody can bring out more gold, George Mitchell can. \n     (Laughter.)\n       I want to thank the Taoiseach for the courage he showed in \n     working with the Prime Minister of Great Britain, from the \n     day he took office, taking up from his predecessor, Albert \n     Reynolds, right through this remarkable breakthrough that he \n     and Prime Minister Major made on the twin tracks that he \n     helped to forge just two days ago. This is an astonishing \n     development really because it is the first formulation anyone \n     has come up with that permits all views to be heard, all \n     voices to speak, all issues to be dealt with, without \n     requiring people to give up the positions they have taken at \n     the moment. We are very much in your debt.\n       This has been an experience like none I have ever had \n     before. Yesterday, John Hume, who's joined us, took me home \n     to Derry with him. And I thought to myself--all my life \n     ``Danny Boy'' has been my favorite song--I never thought I'd \n     get to go there to hear it. But thanks to John, I did.\n       And then we were before in Belfast. And all of you, I'm \n     sure, were so moved by those two children who introduced me, \n     reading excerpts from the letters. You know, I've got \n     thousands and thousands of letters from Irish children \n     telling me what peace means to them. One thing I am convinced \n     of as I leave here --that there is a global hunger among \n     young people for their parents to put down the madness of war \n     in favor of their childhood. (Applause.)\n       I received this letter from a teenager right here in \n     Dublin. I thought I would read it to you, to make the point \n     better than I could. This is just an excerpt: ``With your \n     help, the chances given to reason and to reasonable people, \n     so that the peace in my country becomes reality. What is lost \n     is impossible to bring back. Children who were killed are \n     gone forever. No one can bring them back. But for all those \n     who survive these sufferings, there is future.''\n       The young person from Dublin who wrote me that was Zlata \n     Filipovic, the young teenager from Bosnia who is now living \n     here, who wrote her wonderful diary that captured the \n     imagination of people all over the world.\n       I am honored that at this moment in the history of the \n     world the United States has had the great good fortune to \n     stand for the future of children in Ireland, in Bosnia, in \n     the Middle East, in Haiti and on the toughest streets of our \n     own land. And I thank you here in Ireland for taking your \n     stand for those children's future, as well.\n       Let me say in closing that in this 150th anniversary of the \n     Great Famine, I would like everyone in the world to pay \n     tribute to Ireland for coming out of the famine with perhaps \n     a greater sense of compassion for the fate of people the \n     world over than any other nation. I said today in my speech \n     to the Parliament that there had not been a single, solitary \n     day--not one day--since 1958, when someone representing the \n     government of Ireland was not somewhere in the world trying \n     to aid the cause of peace. I think there is no other nation \n     on Earth that can make that claim.\n       And as I leave I feel so full of hope for the situation \n     here in Ireland and so much gratitude for you, for what you \n     have given to us. And I leave you with these words, which I \n     found as I was walking out the door from the Ambassador's \n     Residence. The Ambassador made it possible for Hillary and me \n     to spend a few moments this evening with Seamus Heaney and \n     his wife, since I have been running around the country \n     quoting him for two days. (Laughter.) I might say, without \n     his permission. (Laughter.) And he gave Hillary an inscribed \n     copy of his book ``The Cure At Troy.'' And as I skimmed \n     through it, I found these words, with which I leave you:\n       ``Now it's high water mark, and flood tide in the heart and \n     time to go. What's left to say? Suspect too much sweet talk, \n     but never close your mind. It was a fortunate wind that blew \n     me here. I leave half ready to believe that a cripple's trust \n     might walk and the half-true rhyme is love.''\n       Thank you and God bless you. (Applause.)\n       I thought I had done something for a moment to offend the \n     Taoiseach--he was forcing me on water instead of wine. \n     (Laughter.)\n       Let me now, on behalf of every American here present, \n     bathed in the generosity and the hospitality of Ireland, \n     offer this toast to the Taoiseach and Mrs. Bruton and to the \n     wonderful people of this great Republic.\n       (A toast is offered.)

Mr. President, the action of the House Members on the \ntelecommunications bill conference this morning should send tremors \nthrough the Internet community and defenders of the first amendment. \nThey agreed to a provision that would effectively ban constitutionally \nprotected speech on the Internet.\n  If this amendment becomes law, no longer will Internet users be able \nto engage in freewheeling discussions in news groups and other areas on \nthe Internet accessible to minors. They will have to limit all language \nused and topics discussed to that appropriate for kindergarteners, just \nin case a minor clicks onto the discussion. No literary quotes from \nracy parts of ``Catcher in the Rye'' or ``Ulysses'' will be allowed. \nCertainly, online discussions of safe sex practices, of birth control \nmethods, and of AIDS prevention methods will be suspect. Any user who \ncrosses the vague and undefined line of ``indecency'' will be subject \nto 2 years in jail and fines.\n  We have already seen the chilling effect that even the prospect of \nthis legislation has had on online service providers. Last week, \nAmerican On Line deleted the profile of a Vermonter who communicated \nwith fellow breast cancer survivors online. Why? Because, according to \nAOL, she used the vulgar word ``breast''. AOL later apologized and \nindicated it would permit the use of that word where appropriate.\n  This is a serious misstep by the House Members of the \ntelecommunications bill conference. I urge the full conference to \nconsider the threat this amendment poses to the future growth of the \nInternet, and reject it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18098-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on that November evening in 1972 when I was \nfirst elected to the Senate, I made a commitment to myself that I would \nnever fail to see a young person, or a group of young people, who \nwanted to see me.\n  It has proved enormously beneficial to me because I have been \ninspired by the estimated 60,000 young people with whom I have visited \nduring the nearly 23 years I have been in the Senate.\n  Most of them have been concerned about the Federal debt which is \nslightly in excess of $11 billion shy of $5 trillion--which will be \nexceeded later this year. Of course, Congress is responsible for \ncreating this monstrosity for which the coming generations will have to \npay.\n  The young people and I almost always discuss the fact that under the \nU.S. Constitution, no President can spend a dime of Federal money that \nhas not first been authorized and appropriated by both the House and \nSenate of the United States.\n  That is why I began making these daily reports to the Senate on \nFebruary 25, 1992. I wanted to make a matter of daily record the \nprecise size of the Federal debt which, at the close of business \nyesterday, Tuesday, December 5, stood at $4,988,766,009,862.29 or \n$18,937.44 for every man, woman, and child in America on a per capita \nbasis.\n  The increase in the national debt since my report yesterday--which \nidentified the total Federal debt as of close of business on Monday, \nDecember 4, 1995--shows an increase of $125,665,418.83. That increase, \nI'm told, is equivalent to the amount of money needed by 215,311 \nstudents to pay their college tuitions for 4 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18098-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18098-S18099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                           PRESIDENT--PM 100\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In order to take additional steps with respect to the national \nemergency described and declared in Executive Order No. 12924 of August \n19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, necessitated by the \nexpiration of the Export \n\n[[Page S 18099]]\nAdministration Act on August 20, 1994, I hereby report to the Congress \nthat pursuant to section 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (``the Act''), I have today exercised the \nauthority granted by the Act to issue an Executive order (a copy of \nwhich is attached) to revise the existing procedures for processing \nexport license applications submitted to the Department of Commerce.\n  The Executive order establishes two basic principles for processing \nexport license applications submitted to the Department of Commerce \nunder the Act and the Regulations, or under any renewal of, or \nsuccessor to, the Export Administration Act and the Regulations.

A bill to provide that certain gaming contracts shall remain \nin effect, notwithstanding filing for bankruptcy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  the gaming contracts compliance act\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat is intended to protect State and local governments from the \nfinancial crises caused when a casino declares bankruptcy and shuts \ndown. I believe that gaming corporations should not be allowed to use \nFederal bankruptcy laws as leverage to gain more concessions from the \ncity and State in which they are operating.\n  On November 22, 1995, Harrah's casino in New Orleans declared \nbankruptcy and shut its doors--laying off 2,500 workers and leaving \ncity and State officials facing multimillion-dollar budget shortfalls. \nAs a result, the city may have to lay off as many as 1,000 city workers \nand substantially curtail city services. It is also estimated that the \nLouisiana Legislature faces a deficit of between $88.5 and $97.5 \nmillion this fiscal year if Harrah's remains closed.\n  The Gaming Contracts Compliance Act would protect the city of New \nOrleans and the State of Louisiana, and other cities and State \ngovernments in the future, by prohibiting gambling establishments from \ngetting out of their original contracts with city, county (parish), and \nState governments by declaring bankruptcy. These corporations would be \nobligated to fulfill the original contracts even as they undergo the \nreorganization afforded them by bankruptcy protection. Casinos in \nbankruptcy would be allowed to renegotiate their contracts only if \ngovernment officials agree.\n  This legislation would prevent casinos like Harrah's from closing \ndown to force a better deal from State and local governments--all at \nthe expense of local taxpayers and casino workers. State and local \nofficials cannot be left holding an open bag of broken promises given \nby international gaming operations simply because gambling revenue \nestimates are off the mark. The welfare of our cities and its citizens \nmust come first.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1451. A bill to authorize an agreement between the Secretary of \nthe Interior and a State providing for the continued operation by State \nemployees of national parks in the State during any period in which the \nNational Park Service is unable to maintain the normal level of park \noperations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                       NATIONAL PARKS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senator Kyl in \nintroducing legislation to ensure that Grand Canyon National Park and \nother national park units remain open during Federal budget impasses \nwhich result in Government closures.\n  The bill would authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter into \nagreements allowing State and local governments to operate essential \npark facilities when Federal personnel are furloughed.\n  As my colleagues are aware, during the recent budget crisis, the \nClinton administration decided to shut visitors out of the Grand Canyon \nand other national parks. This decision hurt countless tourists, many \nof whom traveled great distances at enormous expense to experience the \ncanyon. And it harmed local businesses that depend upon tourism.\n  I continue to believe that the decision to close the Grand Canyon was \nunnecessary. I was interested to note that the administration did not \nrestrict visitation to national forests or BLM lands, nor to the Mall \nin Washington--an area administered by the Park Service. Such \nrestrictions, of course, would have been unnecessary, just as shutting \nvisitors out of the Grand Canyon, while politically expedient, was \nunnecessary.\n  Nevertheless, I appreciate the willingness of the administration to \nexamine methods of ensuring that such park closure need not occur in \nthe future. Enacting legislation empowering States to operate park \nunits during temporary Federal furloughs, would help us to achieve that \nend.\n  Mr. President, my fervent hope is that in the future we can avoid \nGovernment shutdowns which penalize not only national park visitors but \nmany others seeking Government services.\n  However, I trust that my colleagues and the administration will \nagree, we have an obligation to mitigate the impact on innocent people \nif and when such crises do occur. In the case of national parks, the \nState of Arizona and other States as well, are willing to offer their \nmanpower and expertise to avoid the closure of these areas which are so \nessential to State and local economies. There is no reason the Federal \nGovernment should not take them up on that offer, even as we work to \nmake sure that no vital Federal operation is cut off because of the \nfailings of politicians in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, often, our constituents are far better than we at \nexpressing the real-life impact of Government decisions. During the \npark shutdown I received an open letter from Susan Morely, a \nconstituent of mine from Flagstaff, AZ who relayed a very sad and \ndistressing story about the impact of the closure on her family. She \nmakes the case in favor of this legislation better than anyone else.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Susan Morley's letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     To: President Clinton, Members of Congress, Governor \n         Symington, House Speaker Mark Killian, The Media\n       In 1992, my husband died of cancer at age 41, his dying \n     request was for his ashes to be distributed at Ribbon Falls \n     in the Grand Canyon. This was done shortly after his death.\n       For the past three years, his brothers and sisters and I \n     and my children have planned a memorial hike so that we could \n     all visit this special site. Family members from Connecticut, \n     New Jersey and California and friends from Washington, D.C. \n     and Arizona came to join us in what was to be an important \n     part of our emotional healing.\n       Instead, Congress and the President have turned this into \n     an emotional nightmare.\n       My 13 year old has been crying because she was looking \n     forward to visiting Ribbon Falls with family and friends. How \n     do I explain to her what is happening in Washington?\n       Family members paid hundreds of dollars for plane tickets, \n     car rentals and hiking gear. People have arranged time off \n     from work. For some, this is their only vacation this year. \n     One teacher had to get special permission from the school \n     superintendent to be here.\n       We have looked forward to being together as family and \n     friends to celebrate Michael's life in a place he loved, at \n     the bottom of the Grand Canyon.\n       Instead, we are stranded at the top because the President \n     and our elected representatives in Congress didn't do their \n     jobs.\n       The Grand Canyon didn't have to close.\n       American workers didn't have to be furloughed.\n       Political agendas have brought us to this.\n       It's time to stop ``playing politics'' and start running \n     the country.\n                                                     Susan Morley,\n                                               Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a piece of \nlegislation introduced by Senator McCain and myself. This bill is \nsignificant, not only for Arizona, but for every State. It would \nauthorize a cooperative arrangement between the Secretary of the \nInterior and a State under which State employees would be able to \nmaintain continued operation of national parks in the State during any \nperiod in which the National Park Service is unable to. The bill is \nintended to mitigate the effects of a Government shutdown, or any other \nsituation which could prevent the national parks from continuing normal \noperations.\n  The recent Government shutdown affected all of us in various ways. As \nmany of you may have heard on CNN, the administration chose to close \nthe Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. This was the first time this \nhas happened since the park opened 76 years ago. The closure had very \nsignificant and widespread effects, not just for Arizona businesses but \nfor visitors who had come a great distance--some as far as New \nZealand--to see this crown jewel of our National Park System.\n  Governor Symington of Arizona made an offer to assist the National \n\n[[Page S 18101]]\n  Park Service in keeping the park open. On behalf of the State, he \noffered to supply the temporary funds and make State personnel \navailable to keep the park functioning and open to visitors. The \nDepartment of the Interior refused his offer, citing a number of legal \nimpediments to the State's plan. The purpose of the legislation that \nSenator McCain and I are introducing today is to overcome these \nimpediments and provide for the legal authorization for the Department \nand an interested State to enter into an intergovernmental agreement \nthat would allow a State to temporarily assume operations of a national \npark.\n  I hope that others will join Senator McCain and myself in sponsoring \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1452. A bill to establish procedures to provide for a taxpayer \nprotection lock-box and related downward adjustment of discretionary \nspending limits and to provide for additional deficit reduction with \nfunds resulting from the stimulative effect of revenue reductions; read \nthe first time.\n\n\n                  the taxpayer protection lockbox act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taxpayer \nProtection Lockbox Act. I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  Mr. President, in light of what is happening today at the White \nHouse--with President Clinton carrying out his threat to veto our plan \nto balance the Federal budget--this legislation could not be introduced \nat a more appropriate time.\n  The American people ought to be disgusted that the President would \nturn his back on their wishes and veto the Balanced Budget Act of 1995.\n  After all, the people have called repeatedly on the Federal \nGovernment to get its spending under control. The President says he \nwants to eliminate the wasteful spending, too. Our plan delivers, and \nyet, our bill is being vetoed.\n  The people want relief from a Federal tax burden that's consuming 26 \npercent of their family's monthly income. The President says he wants \nto provide tax relief too, and even says he supports the child tax \ncredit. Our plan delivers, and yet, our bill is being vetoed.\n  The people have asked us to reform a welfare system that sucks up tax \ndollars yet offers few incentives for welfare recipients to move from \ndependency to independence. The President says he wants welfare reform, \ntoo, in fact, he made it a major part of his Presidential campaign. Our \nplan delivers, and yet, our bill is being vetoed.\n  Most important, the people are calling on us to balance the Federal \nbudget by the year 2002. The President says he wants a balanced budget, \ntoo, and agrees that we can get there in 7 years. Our plan delivers, \nand yet again, the President is stopping it in its tracks with today's \nveto.\n  ``I want a budget that includes all of that,'' says the President--\n``the spending cuts, tax relief, welfare reform, while it balances in 7 \nyears using honest numbers. I just do not want your budget.''\n  And somehow the President manages to say it with a straight face, \neven though he has bogged down the budget negotiations by refusing to \noffer a comprehensive, 7-year plan of his own.\n  Mr. President, despite all the rhetoric and all the campaign \npromises, this administration has no real interest in eliminating the \nFederal deficit and changing the status quo in Washington--they would \nhave to curtail their spending to do it. Today's veto clearly \ndemonstrates the President is not ready to cut spending. And that has \nbeen the pattern in Washington for a very long time--once the \nGovernment has gotten its hands on the taxpayers' dollars and \nsquirreled them away into the Federal Treasury, Congress, and the \nPresident will spend them.\n\n  My legislation, the Taxpayer Protection Lockbox Act, will help ensure \nthat when pork-barrel spending is trimmed from the budget, it is the \ntaxpayers--not the big spenders on Capitol Hill--who will benefit.\n  For years, Members of Congress have bragged to their constituents \nabout trying to cut the fat out of the Federal budget. Yet as time has \npassed, Federal spending has gone up, our annual budget deficits have \ngone up, and the debt we're leaving our children and grandchildren has \ngone all the way up to $5 trillion.\n  How can this be? If all of these claims of cutting the budget are \nright, should spending not go down, not up?\n  Well, if you are speaking in plain English, it should--a cut means \nyou spend less money this year than you did last year. But in the \nlanguage of Congress--``Hill-Speak'' as some call it--a cut is not \nnecessarily a cut.\n  For example, under our plan to balance the budget, Medicare spending \nwill grow from $181 billion this year to $277 billion in the year \n2002--a 53-percent increase over the next 7 years. But because Medicare \nwill not grow at the uncontrolled rates of the past, those who use \nHill-Speak call this increase a ``cut.''\n  It does not make much sense, does it? And yet there is more.\n  Every year, Congress is required to pass the 13 appropriations bills \nwhich fund the Federal Government--everything from the National Highway \nSystem and NASA to foreign aid and the Postal Service. While many of \nthese programs are important and worthwhile, too many tax dollars are \nstill being used for wasteful pork-barrel projects, which either \nbenefit certain regions of the country at the expense of others, have \nnot been previously authorized by law, or are simply not worth the tax \ndollars spent on them.\n  As a member of the Senate pork busters coalition, I have worked to \neliminate this wasteful abuse of the taxpayers' hard-earned \ndollars. For example, during debate on the energy and water \nappropriations bill, I offered an amendment that would have eliminated \n$40 million from the Appalachian Regional Commission. I did not believe \nMinnesota taxpayers should be subsidizing so-called economic assistance \nto the 13 States, located mostly in the Southeast, which make up the \nARC. But due to the program's strong support by Senators whose States \nbenefit from ARC, this amendment was rejected by the Senate.\n\n  What is worse about our appropriations system is that even if \namendments like mine had passed, these funds are not returned to the \nTreasury or the taxpayers. Instead, they are placed into a slush fund \nwhich can be spent on other programs.\n  In other words, even when we are successful in passing amendments to \ncut appropriations spending in these areas, these funds are not used \nfor deficit reduction; they are used for additional spending in other \nareas. As I said before, only in a place like Washington dominated by \nHill-Speak is a cut not necessarily a cut--and the result is a $5 \ntrillion debt for our children and grandchildren.\n  In an effort to end this abuse of taxpayer dollars and to return \nhonesty to the budget process, the Taxpayer Protection Lockbox Act \nchanges the rules of the budget process to ensure that any funds cut in \nappropriations bills be dedicated back to the Treasury for the purposes \nof deficit reduction. By replacing the current Congressional slush fund \nwith a taxpayers' lockbox, my legislation guarantees that when Congress \ncuts funding for wasteful programs, those dollars are returned to their \nrightful owners--the taxpayers.\n  In addition, my legislation creates a new revenue lockbox, which is \ngeared toward our 7-year balanced budget plan.\n  As we all know, when Congress considers a long-term budget, we take \ninto account economic projections which estimate the amount of tax \nrevenue that will come into the Treasury over the next 7 years. We then \nuse these revenue estimates to determine the extent to which Federal \nspending can grow without resulting in a budget deficit in the year \n2002.\n  While these estimates by the Congressional Budget Office are \ngenerally on the mark, they are, of course, simply estimates. It is \nlikely that even more dollars will come into the Treasury as a result \nof our balanced budget plan, given the fact that we include tax relief \ndesigned to stimulate economic growth, create new jobs and turn tax \nusers into productive taxpayers.\n\n  These additional dollars, however, should not be used to feed \nCongress' appetite for spending; instead, any additional revenue that \nresults from our growth plan should be returned to the \n\n[[Page S 18102]]\ntaxpayers in the form of additional tax relief. After all, these funds \nwere made available because of the hard work and productivity of the \nAmerican people; it makes sense to give those dollars back to the \ntaxpayers and encourage even greater productivity, rather than handing \nthem to Washington for more pork-barrel spending.\n  Even now, we can see the very problem my legislation is designed to \naddress. As part of the budget negotiations, President Clinton has \nalready tried to seize more of the dollars we are returning to the \ntaxpayers in the form of tax cuts, to use them for--you guessed it--\nmore spending.\n  The bottom line estimates are, the President wants to spend $400 \nbillion more than our Budget Act of 1995 called for--$400 billion more \nof your money.\n  Well, the taxpayers cannot afford for us to let him do that today, \nnor can they afford it in the future. We must ensure that tax dollars \nare returned to their rightful owners: the taxpayers, not the \nGovernment.\n  And that is just what my revenue lockbox does--it requires that any \nrevenues above and beyond current estimates be used for tax cuts and/or \nadditional deficit reduction. It ensures taxpayers that their hard-\nearned dollars will no longer be automatically spent by the Government. \nIt ends the misperception that tax dollars belong to the Government, \nrather than the taxpayers.\n  Most importantly, it restores honesty to the budget process and \nensures that a spending cut is truly a spending cut, even in \nWashington.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Protection Lockbox Act earns its name by \nlocking in real deficit reduction, while protecting the American \ntaxpayers when Congress just cannot seem to say ``no'' on its own. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in standing up for the taxpayers by \nsupporting this timely legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, last Saturday we saw once again \nproof that democracy is alive and well in Taiwan. In free and fair \nparliamentary elections contested by three leading parties, and with \nseveral independent candidates, with some 67 percent participation, and \nwith no unrest or contesting of the results, the people of Taiwan chose \ntheir own legislative representatives. By that act, those people once \nagain proved that Taiwan is becoming a mature, democratic state worthy \nof our admiration.\n  Let me review here the results of the election. The Kuominatang [KMT] \nor National Party, which has been ruling Taiwan for many years, won a \nnarrow majority of seats, 85 out of a total of 164, and saw their \nnumbers reduced from 90. The Democratic Progressive Party [DPP], which \nhas been the major opposition group for several years, and which \nadvocates moving toward independence, increased its seats from 50 to 54 \nseats. The New Party [NP], which advocates a policy of reunification \nwith China, was probably the biggest winner in the polls, increasing \nits seats \n\n[[Page S 18104]]\nfrom 7 to 21. Finally, a total of four independents won seats in the \nnew legislature.\n  As is usual following any election, the media pundits are busy \nanalyzing the results and the trends they may or may not indicate. Some \npapers are saying that the reduction in the KMT's seats and the \nincrease by the NP were the result, in part, of China's attempts to \nintimidate the Taiwanese over the last few months by testing missiles \nnear Taiwan's shores and making bellicose threats against any attempt \nto move toward independence. Given what I know about the Taiwanese \npeople, who can be very defiant when challenged, I wonder if this is an \naccurate analysis. And I certainly hope that the Chinese Government \ndoesn't believe that its tactics of intimidation are going to work.\n  But no matter what the reason for the result, I think the important \npoint that should be emphasized, as Keith Richburg did in the \nWashington Post, is that, ``Perhaps most remarkable about the elections \nwas that they took place at all. Just 8 years ago, Taiwan was still \nunder martial law. But in 1988 President Lee Teng-Hui launched his \nquiet revolution to shift Taiwan toward multiparty democracy. Taiwan \nhas emerged as one of Asia's liveliest democracies and the world's \nfreest and most democratic Chinese society.''\n  I'm sure that every analyst will agree with that statement.\n  So where are we now, Mr. President? In my view, as a result of the \nelection, the KMT will have to take the steps that any Democratic Party \nwould have to take to ensure passage of its program. There will likely \nbe increased maneuvering on votes among the parties as alliances are \nformed, issue-by-issue, among the three parties. In short, the \nlegislature will have to take into account the will of the people and \ntheir elected representatives--a situation which may cause some \ninefficiencies in the short term, but which will only strengthen Taiwan \nin the long term as democracy takes firmer hold in that society.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the next and equally important step in \nmaking Taiwan a fully democratized state is a free and fair, \nmulticandidate presidential election. That will take place next march, \nand it, like the legislative campaign, promises to be very lively.\n  While President Lee Teng-Hui of the KMT party is favored to win the \nelection at the moment, I'm sure that he and the other candidates will \nbe campaigning very hard over the next month to seek the people's \nmandate. And that too is a very important matter to keep in mind.\n  No matter who wins the presidential election, the Taiwanese people \nwill be able to say, next March, that their freely elected President \nand their freely elected legislature will, for the very first time, \nhave a full and complete mandate.\n  That in turn will allow the elected leaders to feel confident that \nthe people are behind them as they deal with Taiwan's future and, most \nimportant, as they determine their relationship with the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  Then, and presuming that soon the power struggle in the PRC will be \nover, it is my hope that both sides will return to a period of reduced \ntensions and renewed contacts, both economic and political.\n  In the meantime, it is important for us to take note of positive \nsteps like the Taiwan parliamentary elections which advance the \ndemocratization of the world. The people of Taiwan deserve not only our \ncongratulations but also our support as they and their representatives \nmap out their destiny in what we hope will be, in the future, a less \nvolatile and a more peaceful region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18103-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE BUDGET AND PUERTO RICO'S NEEDS\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as the President constructs a 7-\nyear balanced budget plan to present to the Congress, I would like to \nreiterate my view that Puerto Rico's needs should not be ignored. The \nprogram developed by Governor Rosello to apply wage credit incentives \nto economically developed areas should be considered by the President \nas he fashions his plan. This would provide an excellent replacement to \nthe termination of section 936.\n  If no new economic development incentive can be agreed upon this \nyear, Congress can still communicate its intentions to the people of \nPuerto Rico by pledging to consider a new job creation program at the \nearliest possible time. As a step toward this commitment, Congress \nshould establish a new section of the code for economic development, \nand include as an interim measure the 10-year wage credit phase-out \npassed by the Congress. This technical change, which costs the Federal \nTreasury nothing, would demonstrate to the American citizens of Puerto \nRico that Congress remains committed to its economic development and \njob creation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18104-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18104-S18105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PATENT PROTECTION UNDER THE GATT\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Congressional Record a letter from former Surgeon \nGeneral Dr. C. Everett Koop.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                November 30, 1995.\n     Mr. Morton Kondracke,\n     Executive Editor, Roll Call, Washington, DC.\n       In your special supplement on the FDA (October 9, 1995), an \n     article appeared concerning patent protection under the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). I am of the \n     firm belief that any action on the part of the U.S. Senate to \n     weaken the hard-fought patent protections of the GATT would \n     imperil the future of intellectual property rights and \n     undermine the research activities of pioneering \n     pharmaceutical companies.\n       A little-known revolution has taken place in my lifetime. \n     When I started practicing medicine, only a fraction of the \n     drugs that we now take for granted existed. Over the years, I \n     have witnessed great suffering endured by patients and their \n     families that, just a few years later, could have been eased \n     because of the advent of the latest ``miracle drug.'' These \n     breakthrough treatments have brought hope and, in many cases, \n     renewed health to thousands of patients. They are the product \n     of an increasingly important concept: the sanctity of \n     intellectual property.\n       The right to claim ideas as property allows innovators to \n     invest their time and money bringing those ideas to fruition. \n     It is the basis if our patent system that allowed American \n     ingenuity to prosper throughout the Industrial Age. Today, we \n     are at the dawn of an Information Age and now, more than \n     ever, the rights of intellectual property holders must be \n     protected.\n       Consider the enormous investment in time, money, and brain \n     power required to bring a single new medicine to patients: 12 \n     years and more than $350 million is the average investment. \n     Only 20% of new compounds tested in a laboratory ever find \n     their way onto pharmacy shelves. Only a third of those ever \n     earns a return on the colossal investment made to discover \n     it.\n       Though risky and expensive, this process works. The U.S. is \n     the world leader in the development of innovative new \n     medicines. Proceeds from the sales of these medicines support \n     the work and research invested in new successful drugs, as \n     well as the thousands of drugs that never make it out of the \n     lab.\n       Patent protection makes that investment in research \n     worthwhile--and possible. Recently, patent protection around \n     the world was strengthened and harmonized by the GATT, which \n     required changes that equalized intellectual property \n     protection in all participating countries. These changes are \n     important to encourage the risky, expensive research \n     necessary to provide new medicines to fulfill unmet medical \n     needs.\n       Now, some generic drug companies are challenging the GATT's \n     advance in intellectual property protection. They are urging \n     Congress to amend the 1948 Hatch-Waxman Act to give them an \n     advantage under the GATT that no other industry enjoys.\n       A key provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act gives generic drug \n     companies a jump start on marketing by allowing them to use a \n     patented product for development and testing before the \n     patent expires. This special exemption from patent law is not \n     allowed for any other industry. For example, a television \n     manufacturer who wants to market or use its own version of a \n     patented component must wait until the patent expires; \n     otherwise, it risks liability for patent infringement.\n       In return for these special benefits, the Hatch-Waxman Act \n     requires generic drug companies to wait until the expiration \n     of the research companies' patents before they can begin \n     marketing their drugs. Now, the generic drug industry is \n     asking Congress to give it a special exemption from that \n     restriction as well.\n       In my opinion, that would be unwise. Treatment discovery \n     has already slowed; we should reverse that process, not \n     ensure it.\n       While the generic drug industry continues to prosper as a \n     result of the benefits received in the 1984 Act, medical \n     research has continued to become more complex, more costly, \n     and more time consuming, further limiting the effective \n     market life for patented products.\n       Generic drugs play an important role in helping lower the \n     cost of medicines. But it is the pharmaceutical research \n     industry that discovers and develops those medicines in \n\n[[Page S 18105]]\n     the first place, investing billions of dollars in research and \n     development that can span decades without any guarantee of \n     success--an investment made possible by our system of patent \n     protection. Preserve protection and you preserve the \n     opportunity for the discovery of future cures and treatments \n     for disease. Undercut that protection, and you undercut \n     America's hope for new and better answers to our health care \n     needs.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     C. Everett Koop, M.D.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18104-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, complications in my schedule \nprevented me from casting a vote last night on the conference report to \nH.R. 1058, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The \nreport passed by a margin of 65 to 30.\n  I rise today to indicate my full support for the conference report. \nThis is important legislation, because it provides much-needed reform \nto the current rules governing private securities litigation, which \nhave led to far too many abusive and costly strike lawsuits. Those \nsuits hurt businesses by hampering the formation of capital and by \nimpairing the orderly working of America's capital markets. This, in \nturn, hurts all Americans because it places a dangerous drag on the \nability of American businesses to create jobs and prosperity. Yet in \nits scope and effect, the report is appropriately tailored. It \naddresses the harms caused by frivolous litigation without compromising \nthe ability of plaintiffs who have meritorious claims to be made whole. \nMoreover, it does not alter the enforcement prerogatives of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  Mr. President, I voted earlier this year in favor of S. 240, the \nquite similar securities reform bill that the Senate passed in June. \nHad my schedule permitted, I would have cast my vote last night in \nfavor of the conference report on H.R. 1058. I would like to make it \nclear today that if President Clinton sees fit to veto the report--an \nill-advised step I urge him not to take--I will wholeheartedly support \nthis legislation again in order to override such a veto.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18105-1", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n Mrs. KASSEBAUM. Mr. President, today I am cosponsoring \nlegislation offered by Senators McCain and Feingold to reform our \ncampaign finance laws. This legislation offers a sensible, bipartisan \nagreement on steps to change our campaign spending and fundraising laws \nin ways that I believe are long overdue.\n  I am aware that there are deep disagreements within the Senate on \nthis issue, and I know there are legitimate concerns about spending \nlimits. However, I have long believed that money should not be the \ndriving force in congressional campaigns.\n  Mr. President, when I leave the Senate at the end of this term, \nKansas will have an open Senate seat for the first time since 1978. \nCandidates considering this race already are being told that the \ncampaign will cost $2 million or more. In comparison to other, larger \nStates that may seem like a bargain, but the estimates alone impose a \nhigh price on our political process.\n  The simple reality is that many good potential candidates, regardless \nof party affiliation, take themselves out of the running rather than \nface the grueling task of raising such huge sums of money. In effect, \nmoney has become the first primary election.\n  Some may applaud that development as a way to screen out candidates \nwho lack commitment or the ability to raise funds. I believe it too \noften merely screens out candidates who are unwilling to raise and \nspend large sums of money in order to be elected to public office. \nMoney should not be an unwritten qualification for the Senate, but in \nfact it is an increasingly critical factor.\n  The legislation offered by Senator McCain and Senator Feingold does \nnot cure this problem in a perfect and permanent way. The voluntary \nspending limits set in the bill are just that--voluntary--and can be \nignored by candidates who want to spend freely. The incentives for \nvoluntary compliance--free broadcast time, reduced broadcast rates, and \nreduced mail cost--may be viewed as insufficient and ineffective.\n  However, Mr. President, I believe this bill offers a workable and \nrealistic framework for changes in the way we finance our campaigns. I \nknow the primary sponsors are open to suggestions and ready to engage \nin good-faith talks on modifications or changes that might be \nnecessary. However, they believe it is time to move forward with \ncampaign finance reform. I agree with them, and I believe they have \noffered an excellent starting point for this effort. I applaud their \nwork and ask that I be added as a cosponsor of S. 1219.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18105-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF MARYVILLE, TN\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, nestled in shadows of the Great \nSmoky Mountains, in a setting of unusual and almost idyllic beauty, \nlies the great city of Maryville, TN. There among grassy hills and \nrolling farmland, generations of Tennesseeans have lived and worked and \nraised their families.\n  It is a place, Mr. President, where family values, community pride, \nand that distinctive yet intangible quality known as the American \nspirit still exist, nourished by long tradition and carried on by the \ncountless, quiet everyday heros of American life--neighbors who help \nneighbors, parents who sacrifice so their children will have a better \nfuture, church, and community volunteers who feed the homeless, care \nfor the needy, and nurse the sick. It is a place, Mr. President, where \npeople are proud of their past and optimistic about their future.\n  In many respects, Mr. President, the citizens of Maryville are not \nunlike the millions of other Americans who have made our Nation \nspecial--unsung heroes who may never realize their own dreams, but are \ncontent nevertheless to reinvest those dreams in their children.\n  This year, Mr. President, as the city of Maryville proudly celebrates \nits bicentennial year, I wish to pay tribute to those dreams and to \nthat spirit, which not only characterize Maryville's past, but \ndistinguish its citizens up to the present day.\n  Maryville's early settlers had courage and common sense. They met the \ncrises of their times and lived to see a stronger, better, and more \nprosperous community. With the strength of heart and mind, they built \nrailways and lumber mills, established churches and schools--always \nwith an eye toward richer community and a better life.\n  Today, Maryville continues to grow and thrive with new residents and \nnew industry. Its schools are among the best in the land, and in many \nareas of city government, it is on the cutting edge, developing, and \nimplementing programs to provide its citizens with a safe, modern, and \nbeautiful place to live and visit.\n  Bernard Baruch once said America has never forgotten the nobler \nthings that brought her into being and that light her path. Those \nnobler things, Mr. President, live on and prosper in Maryville, TN. Our \nchallenge in government, as Ronald Reagan once said, is to be worthy of \nthem, and to ensure that government helps, not hinders, our way of \nlife.\n  To all the citizens of Maryville, TN, my heartfelt congratulations \nand very best wishes for another century of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18105-3", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S18105-S18106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL BIOETHICS ADVISORY COMMISSION\n\n Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the President recently announced \nthe creation of a National Bioethics Advisory Commission [NBAC]. \nBecause Congress was in recess when this announcement was made, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to share the good news with my colleagues \nand to reiterate the importance of this announcement.\n  There has long been a need for an independent forum for the \ndiscussion of bioethical policy issues. In fact, the catalyst for the \nPresident's announcement of the creation of the NBAC was the release of \na report on human radiation experiments which took place during the \ncold war. These federally sponsored tests included releasing \nradioactive substances into the atmosphere near residential populations \nand injecting pregnant women with radioactive iron to determine its \neffect on the baby. In many cases, the tests were conducted without the \nknowledge of the participants. The NBAC will provide a forum for the \nreevaluation of Federal human research standards to ensure that this \nnever happens again.\n\n[[Page S 18106]]\n\n  There is no question that any experiments conducted with human \nsubjects must be done with full disclosure and a complete examination \nof the ethical questions involved. But today, research scientists are \nexperimenting with life forms on a more subtle level where the \nguidelines may not be as patently clear. In their quest to understand \nthe human body and to conquer disease and disability, scientists have \nturned to the study of the building blocks of living organisms through \ngenetic research and biotechnology.\n  Genetic research has enormous potential implications for society. For \nhere we are dealing with the very foundations of humanity and nature. \nScientists are now able to identify and manipulate gene sequences, and \nhave even begun to create genetically altered life forms. Over the past \ndecade, it has become increasingly apparent that these dramatic \nadvances in biotechnology have outdistanced the legal and ethical \nparameters that we have in place to deal with them.\n  Society may reap great benefits from these advances, and other \ndiscoveries yet to be made by modern science. But history has taught us \nthat new technologies often bring with them costs as well as benefits. \nUntil now, there has been no mechanism through which to examine the \nmoral and ethical implications of this new technology or to weigh the \npotential costs to society.\n  The creation of a National Bioethics Advisory Board is the \nculmination of many years of efforts to establish such a mechanism. In \nthe 103d Congress, I introduced S. 1042, legislation which would have \nestablished a national Biomedical Ethics Advisory Board located within \nthe Department of Health and Human Services. This bill and the two \nhearings held on this subject last session served to stimulate public \ndialogue on the need for such a body and established a framework on \nwhich the newly created NBAC was based. The administration, especially \nDr. Jack Gibbons, worked closely with me in developing their proposal.\n  The NBAC will be an independent body comprised of 15 members \nappointed by the President and are likely to be experts from the fields \nof philosophy, theology, social and behavioral science, law, medicine, \nand biological research. They will be charged with reviewing the \nethical and moral issues that arise in biomedicine including research \ninvolving human subjects, and issues in the management and use of \ngenetic information, including human gene patenting.\n  The addition of specific language establishing genetic information \nand gene patenting issues as a priority for the commission was \nparticularly important to me, and one which I strongly encouraged the \nadministration to make. Each year since 1987, I have introduced \nlegislation providing for a moratorium on the patenting of living \norganisms. I have done so because I firmly believe that it is the \nresponsibility of Congress to carefully consider the broad \nramifications of the technologies it encourages through patenting. I \nbelieve that this newly created National Bioethics Advisory Commission \nwill provide a suitable structure for evaluating the ethical, \nenvironmental, and economic considerations of such patents.\n  Let me emphasize that no one should construe my vigorous support of \nthis commission as a desire to dampen the drive to discover treatments \nand cures. I am firmly committed to the advancement of scientific and \nmedical research and have been one of the leading proponents of Federal \nbiomedical research funding in Congress. My desire is simply to ensure \nthat the difficult social and ethical issues surrounding this research \nare raised and taken into account as public officials struggle to \nestablish appropriate policies and practices relating to biomedicine.\n  The President should be commended for responding to the critical \nreport on human radiation testing by establishing the NBAC to ensure \nthat the rights of human research subjects are examined and protected \nin the future. And, by including genetic research and patenting issues, \nhe has ensured that Congress and the administration will be equipped to \ndeal with the profound ethical questions relating to this rapidly \nadvancing field as they arise.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the effort to make the NBAC a \nreality and look forward to it serving as a vital link between the \nscientific community, the Government, and society as we face the \ndifficult ethical questions which accompany our drive to treat and cure \ndisease and disability through biomedical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18105-4", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

I move that the Senate concur in the House amendment with a \nfurther amendment on behalf of Senators McCain and Levin. I send that \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Dole], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered 3086.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 1041(b) of the House amendment is amended by (1) \n     striking paragraph (1), and (2) redesignating paragraphs (2) \n     and (3) as paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively.\n       Section 1102(b)(1)(B) of the House amendment is amended in \n     the quoted matter by (1) striking ``reports'' and inserting \n     ``report'', and (2) striking ``and section 8152 of title 5, \n     United States Code,''.\n       Section 1121 of the House amendment is amended by striking \n     the matter after subsection (k) and before subsection (l).\n       Section 2021 of the House amendment is amended in the \n     heading for the section by striking ``ELIMINATED'' and \n     inserting ``MODIFIED''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, with passage of this bill, today, we are \nready to eliminate or modify over 200 statutorily required reports to \nCongress and to sunset those reports with an annual, semiannual, or \nother regular periodic requirement, 4 years after the enactment of the \nbill.\n  Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have passed the bill \nin slightly different forms, and I am hopeful that when we send the \nbill to the House this time, it will be promptly passed and sent to the \nPresident for signature. We passed S. 790 on September 12, 1995; the \nHouse of Representatives made some minor changes and passed S. 790 on \nNovember 14. We have now reviewed the bill and have identified four \ntechnical changes that need to be made. These changes would:\n  Eliminate a mistaken reference in section 1041(b).\n  Strike an inappropriate section reference in section 1102.\n  Strike irrelevant material accidentally placed in section 1121.\n  Change ``ELIMINATED'' to ``MODIFIED'' in the heading for section \n2021.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the enactment of this \nbill could result in a savings of up to $5 to $10 million, which does \nnot include savings from the reports subject to the sunset provision.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude \nto Michael Rhee, formerly of my Oversight Subcommittee staff. Michael \nserved on my staff for 1 year as a Javits Fellow, and he honored well \nthe namesake of his fellowship. Senator Javits would have been proud to \nhave supported a person of the caliber of Michael Rhee. Michael worked \ntirelessly, meticulously, and doggedly on this legislation, and I can \nhonestly say it would not have happened without him. He was a terrific \nmember of my staff, dedicated to the principles of public service, and \nwe should all be thankful for his commitment and hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOLE. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18106-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ FOR FIRST TIME--S. 1452\n\n  Mr. DOLE.

It is hoped a vote could occur on adoption of the Commerce-\nState-Justice appropriations conference report after a reasonable \namount of debate. That is estimated to be 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, or \n5 hours. I do not think it goes beyond 5 hours, I hope.\n  But under a previous order, following the disposition of that \nconference report, the Senate will resume H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth \nAbortion Ban Act, with votes occurring on the Dole and Boxer amendments \nfollowing 60 minutes of debate.\n\n  Senators should also be aware that this evening a cloture motion was \nfiled on the motion to proceed to the constitutional amendment \nregarding the desecration of the flag, and we can expect a cloture vote \non that motion to proceed on Friday, unless we can reach an agreement. \nI hope we can. I think the bottom of all this is reaching agreement on \nthe State Department reorganization, and three or four other matters, \nincluding a number of Ambassadors, the START II Treaty, a vote on the \nChemical Weapons Treaty. I understand we are very close to an \nagreement. I know it has gone on and on and on and on.

Mr. President, earlier today in Moscow, the world lost a \nrenowned, first-class historian with the highest of morals, Russia lost \na key reformer, America lost an ally in the search for the truth about \nmissing American servicemen, and I lost a friend and colleague.\n  I am speaking of retired Russian Gen. Dmitry Volkogonov who passed \naway earlier today at the age of 67, following a long battle with \ncancer.\n  I first met General Volkogonov in February, 1992, when Senator John \nKerry and I traveled to Moscow as the cochairmen of the Senate Select \nCommittee on POW/MIA Affairs.\n  More than any other person in Russia at the time, General Volkogonov \nwas eager to assist the United States in finding answers about missing \nAmerican servicemen from the cold war, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, \nand even World War II. This was a very difficult situation for General \nVolkogonov because he had to deal with the archives, he had to deal \nwith the KGB, and others who had much information that they would have \npreferred not to come to the surface. But General Volkogonov bravely \npursued it on our behalf.\n  I will never forget sitting in the general's top-floor office in the \nRussian Duma in February, 1992, listening to the general detail his \npreliminary work in Soviet archives on the issue of missing Americans.\n  It was a cold, winter afternoon in Moscow that day, but as the \nmeeting progressed, the Sun began to shine. In fact, the sunlight was \nso strong that we literally had to close the blinds in the office. The \nsunlight was a good sign that day, Mr. President. I knew we were on the \nright track to seeking answers now that we had found General \nVolkogonov.\n  I also knew it would not be long before the Sun began to shine on \nimportant information previously tucked away in the darkest corners of \nthe Soviet archives.\n  Following my first trip to Moscow with Senator Kerry, then-President \nGeorge Bush and President Yeltsin formally established a Joint \nCommission on the MIA issue between Russian and the United States. The \nRussian side was headed by General Volkogonov.\n  I was happy that Senator Kerry and I were appointed to serve on that \nCommission, along with Congressmen Sam Johnson and Pete Peterson, both \nof whom were POWs in Vietnam. During the last 4 years, it was a \nprivilege to work with General Volkogonov, and I was thankful for the \nopportunities I had to meet with him here in Washington, as well as in \nMoscow.\n  Because of the research conducted by General Volkogonov, the United \nStates has received important documentary evidence concerning the fate \nof unaccounted-for Americans captured or lost in North Vietnam, North \nKorea, China, and along the borders of the former Soviet Union.\n  It is the kind of information, Mr. President, that never would have \nseen the light of day had it not been for General Volkogonov.\n  He has turned over documents concerning discussions between Joseph \nStalin and Chinese officials in 1952 about how many American POW's \nwould be held back during the Korean war. He has also handed \nover Russian translations of North Vietnamese politburo sessions where \nit was indicated that more American POW's were secretly being held in \nNorth Vietnam than those eventually released.\n\n  These documents are both dramatic and disturbing, and it remains for \nVietnam, North Korea, and China to fully explain these documents.\n  I will never forget General Volkogonov sitting in my office telling \nme that these documents were authentic, and that he would do everything \nin his power to get them and to get access to them on behalf of the \nAmerican people. And this is a Russian general.\n  When these documents were formally turned over to the United States \nby Russia, General Volkogonov stated--\n\n       It's a delicate issue, but we can't be quiet about it any \n     longer, since it's a humanitarian issue . . . we are talking \n     about men's fates . . . there is no political spin. We want \n     to help the families.\n\n  Those were the words of General Volkogonov.\n  Mr. President, this was obviously a noble cause for the general. \nAmerica could not have asked for a more committed ally on this issue. \nHe fully understood our joint quest for the truth, and the importance \nthat Americans attached to this inquiry. He had a way of knowing how we \nfelt, how deeply we felt about this issue, specifically our Nation's \nveterans and the families of our unaccounted for Americans.\n  When you think of the thousands, if not millions, of people lost in \nSoviet wars, most of them attributed to Stalin, General Volkogonov took \nthe time to spend looking for these few--compared to the Russian \nlosses--Americans.\n  General Volkogonov always stood on principle. He took action when he \nknew it was morally correct to do so. He was not afraid, and he was not \ndeterred. Nothing showed those traits more clearly than when he wrote \nhis books on Stalin and Lenin, based on his archival research, and when \nhe admitted he had been wrong in believing that Soviet-style communism \ncould be more ``human and effective'' as he put it. Can you imagine the \ncourage of a man who would write something like that?\n  General Volkogonov was the first Russian general to admit the system \nhad failed--he was the ``black sheep'' as he put it in an interview \nearlier this year.\n  Mr. President, history will judge General Volkogonov very kindly. And \nhistorians will owe him a great debt for years to come.\n  I know both the Russian people and the American people will always be \ngrateful for his enormous contributions. I also hope both our \ngovernments understand how important General Volkogonov was in helping \nto build a bridge of partnership and cooperation between Russia and the \nUnited States on these humanitarian issues of missing American \nservicemen.\n  I am going to miss my friend, Dmitry Volkogonov, and I know the \nAmerican people join me in sending our condolences to his wife and two \ndaughters.\n  Let me conclude by expressing my heartfelt hope that President \nYeltsin and the Russian Duma will find someone--it will be difficult--\nbut will find someone to follow in the general's footsteps who is \nequally committed to disclosing information about unaccounted for \nAmerican POW's and MIA's.\n  I can think of no finer tribute to this great man. And let me just \nsay, it would be appropriate, I think, for us to remember him tonight \nbecause he is a part of history and he was a great historian. This is \nwhat we should have for the historical record for General Volkogonov.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two obituaries on General \nVolkogonov from newswire services be printed in the Record, and I also \nask unanimous consent that the statement by the American chairman of \nthe United States-Russian joint commission, Ambassador Malcolm Toon, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Russian Historian Volkogonov Dies at 67\n\n                          (By Anatoly Verbin)\n\n       MOSCOW, Dec. 6 (Reuter).--General Dmitry Volkogonov, one of \n     the best-known Russian historians of the past decade, died on \n     Wednesday at the age of 67.\n       Volkogonov was both famed and hated for his revealing works \n     on Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Josef Stalin.\n       The State Duma lower house of parliament stood in silence \n     to pay final tribute to the man who called himself the \n     ``black sheep'' of the Soviet generals.\n       He transformed from an orthodox communist standardbearer to \n     a writer triggering the nomenklatura's outrage with books \n     mercilessly stripping away decades of myths \n\n[[Page S 18116]]\n     about dictator Stalin and Soviet state founder Lenin.\n       ``I was a Leninist and a Marxist for many years until I \n     gradually realised that I and many of my colleagues had been \n     misled,'' he said in a Reuters interview earlier this year.\n       ``I was not a dissident--I thought the system could be \n     reformed, be made more human and effective, but I was wrong. \n     I was the first general to admit it, a black sheep.''\n       In 1937, when Volkogonov was eight, his father was shot in \n     Stalin's purges and his mother ended up in a labour camp. The \n     young boy's faith in the system was not shaken and he entered \n     the army as an orphan.\n       He made a perfectly orthodox career in the Soviet Red Army \n     ending with a job as as deputy head of the department \n     responsible for communist indoctrination of troops.\n       He then become head of the Institute of Military History, \n     which gave him unparalelled access to the nation's top \n     archives. The deeper he delved, the more disillusioned he \n     became.\n       Volkogonov rose to prominence in 1988 by producing the \n     first Soviet biography of Josef Stalin, which portrayed the \n     dictator as an immoral power-hungry killer.\n       This was hardly a revelation for Western historians. But it \n     exploded like a bombshell among a people kept in ignorance of \n     their own history for decades.\n       In 1991, Volkogov and his team produced the first volume of \n     a planned ten-tome official Soviet history of World War Two.\n       The book, which castigated Stalin for letting himself be \n     outwitted by Hitler, was banned by horrified Soviet Defense \n     Ministry officials.\n       Volkogonov resigned in protest.\n       After producing a biography of Soviet rebel-revolutionary \n     Leon Trostky, he tackled what he described as the last \n     bastion--Lenin.\n       Previous accounts had always been careful to portray the \n     Soviet state's founder as a kindly, wise man whose ideas were \n     subsequently perverted by Stalin.\n       Volkogonov's biography, based on 3,724 top secret \n     documents, smashed the illusion by unmasking Lenin as \n     ruthless and ready to resort to mass killings to achieve his \n     aims. ``Lenin was the anti-Christ, more like the devil . . . \n     All Russia's great troubles stemmed from Lenin,'' Volkogonov \n     once said.\n       Volkogonov once served as a military adviser to President \n     Boris Yeltsin. In that capacity, at the end of 1991, he \n     headed a commission which abolished communist party bodies in \n     the armed forces.\n       Up to his death, he was a co-chairman of a joint Russian-\n     U.S. commission looking into the fates of POWs and missing in \n     action in world War Two, Vietnam and other wars.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n     dmitry volkogonov, military historian and reformer, dead at 67\n\n                           (By Ntasha Alova)\n\n       MOSCOW (AP).--Dmitry Volkogonov, a military historian who \n     helped reveal the truth about Communist Party repression and \n     who headed the Russian-American Commission on missing POWs, \n     has died after a long battle with cancer. He was 67.\n       Gen. Volkogonov died Tuesday night at a military hospital \n     in Krasnogorski, outside Moscow, the Interfax news agency \n     reported.\n       Volkogonov, who as director of the Soviet Defense \n     Ministry's History Museum had extensive access to Soviet \n     military archives, was one of the first historians in Russia \n     to make public the extent of the Communist regime's \n     persecution.\n       His confirmation that the repression began when the \n     Bolsheviks took power in 1917 and was, in fact, launched by \n     Vladimir Lenin, the Communists' idol, made hardliners revile \n     him and pro-reform forces lionize him.\n       Volkogonov wrote more than 30 books. Best known are his \n     history works on Lenin, Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky, \n     written in recent years on the basis of newly opened archive \n     materials.\n       Born in Siberia in 1928, Volkogonov fell victim to Stalin's \n     repression at an early age, when his father was shot and his \n     mother sent into exile.\n       Volkogonov joined the Soviet army in 1949 after working as \n     a teacher. He finished a tank school, then made his career as \n     a student and later professor at the Lenin Military-Political \n     Academy for top Soviet army political-propaganda officers.\n       He later headed the Soviet Defense Ministry's History \n     Museum and conducted archival research there.\n       Volkogonov met Boris Yeltsin in 1990 when both became \n     members of the Russian parliament, and in 1991 he became \n     security and defense adviser to Yeltsin, then parliamentary \n     speaker. He remained an adviser after Yeltsin became \n     president.\n       After the 1991 Soviet breakup, Volkogonov presided over a \n     commission charged with creating a Russian defense ministry \n     and armed forces.\n       When the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War \n     and Missing in Action was formed in 1992, Volkogonov became \n     co-chairman, along with Malcolm Toon of the United States.\n       The commission was charged with determining whether any \n     American servicemen were held on Soviet territory during the \n     Cold War. So far, they have found none.\n       He also headed a presidential commission charged with \n     finding missing Russian soldiers, including those lost during \n     the war in Chechnya.\n       In 1993, the retired general was elected to the first post-\n     Soviet parliament on reformer Yegor Gaidar's ticket.\n       The State Duma, the lower house of parliament. today \n     observed a moment of silence in his honor.\n       Volkogonov was married, with two daughters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nStatement by Ambassador Malcolm Toon, American Co-Chairman of the U.S. \n                        Russia Joint Commission\n\n       The U.S. side of the U.S. Russia Joint Commission was very \n     saddened to learn of the passing of General-Colonel \n     Antonovich Volkogonov, a fellow soldier for whom we had great \n     respect, which only grew in the three and a half years we \n     worked together. While serving as the Russian co-chairman of \n     the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIA Affairs, General \n     Volkogonov widened the windows of communication with the \n     United States on POW/MIA matters, and was unswerving in his \n     efforts to gain information which would help resolve painful \n     questions about lost American and Soviet service members. \n     Enduring great physical hardship, he nevertheless \n     demonstrated a strength of character so admired by his \n     friends and colleagues. His work will leave an enduring \n     legacy to Russians and to the world alike, and his memory \n     will serve as a beacon to those who continue his efforts. We \n     will miss him.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1995/12/06/senate-section/article/S18115-2", "month": "12", "year": "1995"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S18116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
