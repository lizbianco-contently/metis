Mr. President, in a short while, my longtime press \nsecretary, Joe Jamele, will be retiring. Joe Jamele set probably an \nall-time record as press secretaries of 15 years in my office. I think \nthis is a great compliment to two Italian-Americans, Joe and myself, \nthat we put up with each other for 15 years. We were good friends when \nwe began our association; we are even better friends as it comes to an \nend.\n  Joe Jamele is one of those very special people who is a true \nVermonter. I remember when I grew up, we always had the debate of what \nit took to be a Vermonter. Usually, the debate centered around whether \nyour great-great-grandparents were born and raised in Vermont or \nwhether your great-great-great-grandparents were born and raised in \nVermont.\n  Joe Jamele established it in the best of ways. He earned his right to \nbe a\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nVermonter through his sense of hard work, honesty and loyalty, loyalty \nto his family, loyalty to his community, and loyalty to those who were \nfortunate enough to have him serve in their office, whether it was the \nGovernor of the State of Vermont, Governor Salmon, or whether it was \nmyself.\n  Having Joe Jamele as a member of your office comes with a price. I \nwould often come in feeling that I just made some brilliant coup, \neither in the media or on the floor or back home. Joe would lean back \nand say, ``Well, you know, Patrick, the way I heard it was,'' and then \nhe would give it to me from the eyes of the vast majority of \nVermonters. And I would say, ``Yeah, I guess I didn't do quite as good \nas I might have,'' and he would bring it back to Earth. But he also did \nit in a way that was in the best interest of Vermont.\n  He would say oftentimes, ``Let's talk about what really is on \npeople's minds back there.'' That is something he knew because he had \nsuch a farflung group of people, and still does, around Vermont, people \nhe could call and talk with, people who are the true opinionmakers, not \nthose who thought they were the true opinionmakers, but the people who \nreally were the true opinionmakers and those who understood it.\n  Joe had, and has, this sense of history in Vermont. We sometimes have \nmembers of the press who come there, have been there a very short time \nand don't know who had gone before them. He was a very distinguished \nmember of the press and has a sense of history that has probably only \nbeen seen, in my recollection, in Mavis Doyle, a former, and now \ndeceased, reporter for the Rutland Herald. Joe knew who the players \nwere. He knew those who spoke just for a sound bite as compared to \nthose who spoke to do what they thought was best for the State or our \ncountry.\n  He had a professor's true heart, because over this decade and a half, \nwe had so many young people who came into our office who found their \nreal mentor was Joe Jamele, and they could go to Joe with everything \nfrom a professional to a personal concern and get the best of advice.\n  So, Mr. President, I was very pleased when Sam Hemingway of the \nBurlington Free Press wrote in May a column about Joe, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 31, 1996]\n\n                           (By Sam Hemingway)\n\n                   Washington Bids Farewell to Jamele\n\n       To his last day on the job--today--Joseph Jamele Jr., 65, \n     was remaining true to form: part curmudgeon, part romantic \n     and full-time Vermont political junkie.\n       ``It's terrible,'' he muttered on the phone from \n     Washington, D.C., where he's worked as press secretary for \n     U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., for 15 years, an eon in a \n     profession famous for short life spans.\n       ``Winding down is terrible,'' he went on. ``I don't like \n     this going-away stuff. I'd rather say goodbye on a one-to-one \n     basis than have those cheery testimonials. I've been to a lot \n     of them and every one's been a disaster.''\n       And then, a minute later, he was talking fondly about \n     working for peanuts as a reporter in the 1950s. About \n     managing the gubernatorial victory of Democrat Tom Salmon in \n     1972, one of the great upsets in Vermont political history. \n     About the changes in Vermont he can't bear to watch.\n       ``There's some parts I can barely visit because they've \n     changed so much,'' he said. ``Like the outskirts of \n     Burlington. I can remember driving through Colchester at \n     night and not see a light on. Or up around Lake Seymour. It \n     used to be you could go for miles and not see anyone. Now \n     it's ringed with cottages.''\n       The two sports are important to Jamele. Lake Seymour, close \n     by Morgan in the Northeast Kingdom, was where he was sent to \n     summer camp by his family in New Jersey all through the \n     Depression and World War II. Burlington is where he got his \n     first job while still a college student, bundling freshly \n     printed Free Presses on the midnight shift.\n       A reporting job soon followed, with Jamele honoring the \n     advice of a plaque on the wall in the office of his \n     University of Vermont mentor, Andrew Nuquist, that read: \n     ``Never give them two bad ones in a row.''\n       He didn't. Jamele's news writing career covered the \n     mundane--taking sports briefs over the phone--to the \n     dramatic: a story about the abused dog who crawled home to \n     die. He once interviewed a blind man who had wandered lost in \n     a forest for three days. He talked with a sobbing Gov. Phil \n     Hoff the day President Kennedy was assassinated.\n       By the early 1970s, his love for politics and weariness \n     with low-paying journalism jobs got the best of him. In 1972, \n     he had begun working for the GOP gubernatorial campaign of \n     then-Attorney General James Jeffords when Salmon called and \n     coaxed him to not only switch horses, but political \n     affiliations as well.\n       The move paid off, Jeffords eventually lost his party's \n     primary to Luther Hackett; Salmon went on to victory in \n     November.\n       ``The night Tom won, the first returns that came in came \n     from Granby, which voted 26-0 for Hackett,'' Jamele said. \n     ``Tom's daughter began to cry on the couch, and Tom consoled \n     her by reminding her about Hackett's pledge to visit every \n     town. `I think he spent too much time in Granby,' he told \n     her.''\n       Jamele remains convinced that had Salmon run for retiring \n     U.S. Sen. George Aiken's seat in 1974, he would have won. ``I \n     think Aiken really wanted Tom to succeed him,'' Jamele said.\n       But Salmon passed on the chance, and the door was opened \n     for Leahy. Jamele worked for Salmon for four years, then for \n     Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. He joined Leahy's staff \n     in 1981, a move he's never regretted.\n       And will not now sentimentalize as he heads for the exits. \n     He leaves, critical of the way federal workers have become \n     scapegoats for those who blame government for what's wrong in \n     the country, angry about the dominance of polls and \n     television ads in political campaigns.\n       Passionate and skeptical to the end.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will say that my career in the Senate has \nbeen greatly enhanced because Joe has been willing to give so much of \nhimself to this office, to the State of Vermont, to the U.S. Senate, \nand to our country. He is, indeed, a true patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9007-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9008-S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             KELLOGG-HUBBARD LIBRARY AND MRS. JEAN HOLBROOK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Montpelier \nrecently celebrated its 100th anniversary. The Kellogg-Hubbard Library \nholds a very special place in my heart, because I had my first library \ncard there. I used to go almost every day. I would be reading a book at \nschool or a book at home and sometimes a book in the library in the \nevening.\n  Mrs. Jean Holbrook, who was the librarian, was one of those people \nwho truly helped form my life and my educational accomplishments as a \nchild. It was she who told me when I got bored with the curriculum in \nthe third grade that I could also be spending my time reading Dickens \nand Robert Louis Stevenson, and I did with great enjoyment. It was she \nwho told me that when I read just about everything in the children's \nlibrary, that she would go with me to get a card in the upstairs \nlibrary, the grownups' library. I guess I was probably the youngest \ngrownup at the time, but this helped me, and it has helped me \nimmeasurably throughout my life.\n  Even today, when I give graduation addresses in high schools and even \nsometimes grade schools in Vermont, I tell the graduates they have \nalready learned the most important thing in their life--they have \nlearned to read. On top of learning to read, they have developed a love \nfor reading, and every door in life will be open to them because their \nlove of reading will allow them to expand their imagination and their \nlove of life in a way they could not otherwise, but also help them \nlearn to be whatever they want to be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article I wrote for \nthe Times Argus in Vermont about the Hubbard Library titled \n``Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, June 13, 1996]\n\n            Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right\n\n                           (By Patrick Leahy)\n\n       The 100th anniversary of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library \n     triggers memories for all of us who have lived in Montpelier. \n     And they are great memories.\n       While I was growing up, Montpelier did not have television. \n     We children did not have the advantage of cable TV with 10 \n     channels giving us the opportunity to buy things we didn't \n     need and would never use or another 10 offering blessings or \n     redemptions for an adequate contribution.\n       Depirved as we were, we made do with the Lone Ranger and \n     Inner Sanctum on the radio and Saturday's serials at the \n     Strand Theater on Main Street. For a few minutes on Saturday \n     afternoon, we could watch Hopalong Cassidy, Tarzan, Flash \n     Gordon, Jungle Jim or Batman face death-defying predicaments \n     that would guarantee you would be back the next Saturday, 14 \n     cents in hand, to see how they survived (and I recall they \n     always did).\n       Having exhausted radio, Saturday matinees, the latest comic \n     books (I had a favorite) and childhood games and chores, we \n     were left to our own imagination.\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\n       That was the best part.\n       We were a generation who let the genies of our imagination \n     out of the bottle be reading. Then, as now, reading was one \n     of my great pleasures.\n       My parents had owned the Waterbury Record Weekly newspaper \n     and then started the Leahy Press in Montpelier, which they \n     ran until selling it at their retirement. The Leahy family \n     was at home with the printed word and I learned to read early \n     in life.\n       At 5 years old I went down the stairs on the Kellog-Hubbard \n     Children's Library, and the years that followed provided some \n     of the most important experiences of my life.\n       In the '40s and '50s, the Kellogg-Hubbard was blessed with \n     a whitehaired children's librarian named Miss Holbrook. Her \n     vocation in life had to be to help children read and to make \n     reading enjoyable. She succeeded more than even she might \n     have dreamed.\n       She had the key to unlocking our imagination.\n       With my parents' encouragement, the Kellogg-Hubbard was a \n     regular stop every afternoon as I left school. On any day I \n     had two or three books checked out. My sister Mary, brother \n     John and I read constantly.\n       In my years as U.S. senator, it seems I never traveled so \n     far or experienced so much as I did as a child in Montpelier \n     with daily visits to the library. With Miss Holbrook's \n     encouragement I had read most of Dickens and Robert Louis \n     Stevenson in the early part of grade school.\n       To this day, I remember sitting in our home at 136 State \n     St. reading Treasure Island on a Saturday afternoon filled \n     with summer storms. I knew I heard the tap, tap, tap of the \n     blind man's stick coming down State Street and I remember the \n     great relief of seeing my mother and father returning from \n     visiting my grandparents in South Ryegate.\n       Miss Holbrook was right. A good book and an active \n     imagination creates its own reality.\n       In my profession, I read computer messages, briefing \n     papers, constituent letters, legislation and briefings, the \n     Congressional Record--and an occasional book for pleasure--in \n     all, the equivalent of a full-length book each day.\n       Interesting as all this is, and owing much of my life to \n     those earlier experiences at the library, the truest reading \n     pleasure was then. I worry that so many children today miss \n     what our libraries offer.\n       During the past few years I have had many of my photographs \n     published. DC Comics and Warner Brothers have also asked me \n     to write for Batman or do voice-overs on their TV series. In \n     each case, I have asked them to send my payment to the \n     Kellogg-Hubbard Library to buy books for the Children's \n     Library.\n       It is my way of saying: ``Thank you, Miss Holbrook.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see my good friend from Washington State \non the floor. If he is not going to seek recognition, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the weekend, much has been said about \nthe two terrorist acts this country has faced. I assume that the crash \nof the TWA flight was caused by an act of terrorism. Obviously, the \nbomb in Atlanta was an act of terrorism. I assume the two are not \nconnected and the motivation for either may be entirely different. But \nI hope that the American people will not allow themselves to be held \nhostage by these terrorists, because if we do, the terrorists win.\n  This is a great country. We sent armies to fight nazism and fascism \naround the world. This is a great nation that mobilized in World War II \nand did not allow the armies of Hitler to defeat us or the cowardly \nattack on Pearl Harbor to destroy us. If we did not allow those forces, \nthat eventually numbered in the millions, to defeat us, we should not \nallow a few crazed people, no matter what their motivation, to do the \nsame.\n  I also hope that we will have a careful and studied response of what \nis the best way to go after them. I feel strongly that better \nintelligence--and we have probably the best in world--that better and \nmore intelligence is very important. Our law enforcement, State, local, \nand Federal, have worked with the greatest cooperation I have ever \nseen. We should admire Jim Kallstrom, the FBI agent in charge of the \ninvestigation into the TWA crash. And certainly, when we watch the \nGeorgia authorities and the Federal authorities come together in \nAtlanta, for those of us who once served in law enforcement, we can \nonly marvel at this level of cooperation.\n  But we should realize we are going to face more, not less but more, \nterrorist attempts in our country. We are the most powerful nation on \nEarth. Nobody can send an army marching against us or an air force \nflying against us or navy sailing against us. We are far too powerful.\n  But like any great democracy, we have one vulnerability. That is not \na million-person army marching against us, but a half dozen well-\ndedicated, well-trained, strongly motivated terrorists. Their \nmotivation may be to go to Heaven, their motivation may be some twisted \npsychotic sense that they are doing right. But they are the ones in a \ndemocracy who can strike the most, especially against a technologically \nadvanced democracy like ours.\n  I heard some over the weekend say, ``Boy, we'll get them. We'll just \nincrease the penalties.'' I remind everybody that in Georgia, what \nhappened carries a potential death penalty under Georgia law, to say \nnothing of the potential death penalty under Federal law. I remind my \ncolleagues, in most criminal matters, penalties are rarely a deterrence \nbecause the person does not expect to get caught.\n  The example I use are two warehouses side by side. One has virtually \nno lock on it, another has a state-of-the-art security system. The \npenalty for breaking into these warehouses is the same. But a burglar, \nof course, would take the unguarded one because he assumes he will not \nbe caught.\n\n  We have to realize that you stop terrorism not by the easy feel-good \nthings like simply passing legislation, saying we will be tough because \nwe will increase all the penalties or whatever, because these acts \ncarry the death penalty. But, rather, we take the very hard and \ndifficult steps of making sure that our law enforcement is properly \nfunded, equipped, and trained, that they have the tools necessary, \nwithin a democratic society, the investigative tools necessary to do \nthis, and that we realize as a nation that while we watch terrorist \nactivity in Great Britain, Germany, in France, in the Middle East, \nIsrael, several of the Arab nations, the terrorism can strike at us. It \ncan be from outside our borders, as the World Trade Tower bombs were, \nor home-grown, as Oklahoma City now appears to be. Either way, we are \nnot immune. That is the bad side.\n  The plus side is that we are a resilient nation of 260 million people \nof diverse backgrounds, diverse philosophies and faiths, nationalities \ncoming together to make one very great, vibrant nation, the most \npowerful democracy that history has ever known. And it is. We are so \npowerful, we are so vibrant because we have opened ourselves to all \nkinds of ideas, have encouraged all kinds of ideas.\n  We should not allow the terrorists to stop us from having this \nexchange of ideas and this openness of views. Virtually all Americans \nwill join together in wanting these people caught.

Mr. President, when I became chairman of the \nSubcommittee on African Affairs in 1981, I was asked what I knew about \nAfrica. I responded, ``Not much.'' But since that time, either as \nchairman or ranking member, I have spent considerable time working on \nAfrican issues and have developed a deep affinity for the continent.\n  It is a region that is beset with many difficulties, but it also \nholds great\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\npromise and possibilities. I am not going to speak today, Mr. \nPresident, about current tragedies in Burundi or Rwanda or other places \non the continent. But I have been questioned more and more, as I get \nready to retire and will leave this chairmanship of the African \nsubcommittee, why should we care about Africa? In this era of budget \ndifficulties and domestic challenges, why devote resources and \ndiplomatic energies to a region of great needs, unfamiliar cultures, \nand limited strategic value to the United States?\n  Mr. President, I, for one, believe that Africa does matter to \nAmericans, and perhaps in ways that we do not necessarily think about \nwhen we see the current headlines that emerge regarding Africa.\n  The United States does have significant national interests on the \ncontinent. The events in Africa directly affect American citizens. In \nthis age of instant communications, international travel, and world \ntrade, we simply cannot afford to ignore a continent of over 660 \nmillion people and 54 countries.\n  From infectious disease to environmental destruction, narcotics \ntrafficking to terrorism, we live in a world where boundaries have less \nand less meaning. As a world leader, the United States has a \nresponsibility--and a self-interest--in promoting peace, stability, and \ndevelopment in Africa.\n  Mr. President, over the next few weeks, I will deliver a series of \nstatements on United States interests in Africa. As I travel around the \ncountry I find a great amount of skepticism among the American public \nregarding foreign policy and international engagement. Those of us who \nbelieve that events on the African Continent affect United States \ninterests must begin to make the case for why Africa matters.\n  Today, I will begin with an issue of particular concern to me--\nemerging infectious diseases. Last year, I chaired a hearing of the \nSenate Labor Committee on Emerging Infections: A Threat to the Health \nof a Nation. The focus of the hearing was on domestic vulnerability to \ndisease, but international issues--especially those involving Africa--\nsurfaced again and again.\n  It is impossible to isolate the domestic epidemiological situation \nfrom a larger global context. Microbes simply do not observe political \nboundaries.\n  Mr. President, the sheer volume of human contact at the approaching \nturn of the century creates a situation in which no country or class is \nimmune from the threat of disease. In 1993, over 27 million people \ntraveled from the United States and Canada to developing countries. The \nincubation period of most epidemic diseases far exceeds the duration of \nmost international flights. No state can test all entering persons for \nevery known disease. Even secure borders cannot stop contaminated \nwater, food, or animal vectors from transmitting microbes across \nboundaries.\n  For example, international trade was the mechanism by which a strain \nof the Ebola virus, previously confined to central Africa, surfaced in \nReston, VA, in 1989, and in Texas in 1996. The devestating effects of \nEbola's hemorrhagic fever, and the mysteries surrounding its \ntransmission, have created a sense of fear and insecurity around the \nworld since the 1995 outbreak in Zaire. Yet Ebola represents only one \nof a number of new diseases which present a threat to all of mankind--\nat least 30 new infectious diseases have emerged in the last 20 years.\n  Even more familiar diseases like malaria present a cause for concern, \nas poor medical practices in Africa result in new, antibiotic-resistant \nstrains of previously treatable infections. Consider this: each year, \nover 1,000 Americans return to the United States with malaria after \nspending time abroad. The mosquito that transmits malaria is still \npresent on both coasts of the United States. Moreover, precisely \nbecause malaria has not been endemic in our country or in Europe in the \nlate 20th century, it will be far more lethal in those regions than it \nis in Africa today should it be reintroduced.\n  Our national interest in Africa's emerging and reemerging diseases \nextends beyond the most immediate and urgent concern of international \ntransmission.\n  AIDS in Africa exemplifies the economically draining impact of \ndisease. It primarily affects young adults, the most productive segment \nof society, leading some experts to estimate that AIDS could cause a 2- \nto 3-percent reduction in the growth rates of developing countries' \neconomies over the next 20 years. In turn, diminished purchasing power \nin developing country will result in diminished trade revenues and \neconomic opportunities here at home.\n  Traditionally, U.S. interest in tropical infectious disease has \nvaried according to the extent of our political and military \ninvolvement overseas. It seems clear that today's heightened volume of \ncivilian human contact makes this an obsolete strategy. We should all \nbe conscious of the risks that are presented to us.\n  Yet in 1989, a meeting of the American Society of Tropical Medicine \nand Hygiene revealed that neither American agencies nor the World \nHealth Organization were adequately prepared for an epidemic emergency. \nPrepackaged disease hospitals and overseas high-security laboratories \ndo not exist, nor does a clear chain of command in such an emergency. \nIn the 1990's, a review of CDC surveillance systems determined them to \nbe woefully inadequate within the United States, and so haphazard as to \nbe nonexistent abroad.\n  Yet, information is one of the most critical elements of our \nepidemiological security, and surveillance and monitoring mechanisms on \nthe African Continent are crucial to American interests.\n  Mr. President, at the Labor Committee hearing last year, Dr. David \nSatcher, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nindicated that CDC received the first report of the 1994 Ebola outbreak \nin Zaire in May of that year, but the first case probably occurred in \nJanuary.\n  Early warning systems simply did not exist. Likewise, the National \nScience and Technology Council reported that African doctors saw ``slim \ndisease,'' probably a herald of the AIDS epidemic, as early as 1962, \nbut the dearth of technical and financial resources, as well as an \nabsence of engaged, international cooperation, prevented the disease \nfrom being identified before the AIDS epidemic in the United States was \nwell underway.\n  For all of these reasons, the emergence and proliferation of disease \non the African Continent should concern Americans. Population shifts, \nurban overcrowding, eroding health and sanitation infrastructures, \ninadequate public education initiatives, and environmental \nmismanagement all contribute to disease proliferation in Africa, and in \nturn, that proliferation affects the United States\n  Mr. President, in this post-cold-war era, many in the policy and \nacademic community are reassessing American vulnerabilities and global \npriorities. For example, I have strongly believed that nuclear, \nchemical, and biological weapons proliferation presented a clear threat \nto our Nation and have supported efforts to combat those dangers.\n  But traditional perceptions of national security do not encompass \nmany of the new threats facing our nation. As I have argued, emerging \ninfectious diseases in Africa are one such threat--presenting serious \ndangers to United States citizens abroad and at home.\n  American engagement, both explicitly through international disease \nprevention and control initiatives, and indirectly through \nencouragement of stability, social service reforms, and environmental \nresponsibility, helps fight these emerging diseases, keeping both \nAfricans and Americans strong, healthy, and secure as we prepare to \nenter the 21st century.\n  This is just one reason, Mr. President, why Africa does matter to us. \nI suggest it is a security threat, as well as a personal threat, and \none that we should care about with interest and compassion, as we look \nto our own budgets, and as we look to our own strategists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, together with the distinguished chairman \nof the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, I came to the \nfloor today to help deal with any proposals or amendments that might \ncome up during the course of today's activities. In fact, I was in the \nPresident's chair last Friday when the majority leader asked for a \nunanimous-consent agreement listing almost an entire column in the \nCongressional Record of amendments that might be proposed to this bill. \nA handful were debated on Friday afternoon. All of the rest must be \noffered between now and noon, or between 2 and 5 this afternoon.\n  Obviously, we have not dealt with a lot of business at this point. It \nseemed to me appropriate to speak about this bill and about its \nimportance in general terms and, perhaps, to ask for some comments from \nthe chairman, my friend from New Mexico, who knows so much about it, to \nwhom it is so vital, both for his own State of New Mexico and for the \nentire country, and for our national defense and for our \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to state one more time for \nSenators that we did receive 46 amendments. The Senator was alluding to \nthem. The unanimous-consent agreement recognized these amendments as \nthe only amendments that can be offered in the first degree, and many, \nmany of them are to the water resources portion of this bill--we are \nbeginning to ascertain, that is--the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps \nof Engineers. We very much want to attempt to work out some of these \namendments.\n\n  I just say to Senators who have amendments that the time is going to \nrun out, and I know come 4 o'clock this afternoon, or even tomorrow, \nthere are going to be Senators who will be somewhat upset. But we have \nnow, through the good graces of the leader in this unanimous-consent \nrequest, had time since 9:30 this morning until 12. There are 2 hours, \n1 hour on each side, on some additional matters, unrelated to this. We \nwill come back at 2 on this bill, and we will have 3 more hours. At 5 \no'clock, we are off this bill. So anybody who has not offered their \nfirst-degree amendments will have no opportunity. The Senate has just \nagreed that they are out.\n  Now, I know there are four or five amendments that address issues \nthat are not water resource issues. I think I know what all of those \namendments are, although I have not seen them. I ask, especially, that \nthe Senators who have these serious amendments, let us see them as soon \nas possible. So if Senators have amendments that are not water resource \namendments that they are going to offer, we ask that the Senators' \nstaffs and their offices attempt to get us those amendments so that we \nhave an opportunity to work with the Senators on them, or to adequately \nmake our presentations.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the floor. I am delighted that he \nwants to talk about the importance of this bill in many, many aspects \nof our future life in this country.\n  (Mr. COCHRAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my friend from New Mexico. Mr. President, each of \nthese appropriations bills with which we deal is long and very much \ndetailed. Sometimes it is difficult even for Members, much less the \ngeneral public, to have a true understanding of what is contained in \nthem.\n  For this reason, I have asked my staff to prepare a series of charts \nor graphs on the appropriations for those subcommittees of the \nappropriations bills on which I serve.\n  Unfortunately, I only have a page-size one here for energy and water. \nIt is for the bill for the current year, 1996. Due to the efforts of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, we now have an allocation for 1997 that is \nroughly equivalent of that for 1996. So the distribution of the money \nfor the current year is, I think, relevant to what we are dealing with.\n  Mr. President, I am sure your eyes may not be quite good enough to \nsee anything on this chart other than the colors. But the red and pink \nportion of the chart show that the lion's share of this bill goes to \nthe Department of Energy, which is not surprising. This is the energy \nand water appropriations bill. What, perhaps, is not visible to you is \nthe fact that only about a quarter of it appears on the top of the \nchart, and that goes to the civilian activities of the Department of \nEnergy for energy supply research and development--obviously important \nto our future--and for general science research and development. The \nFederal Government, through the Department of Energy, is one of the \nmost important single sources of research for both energy purposes and \nfor some other purposes as well.\n  All of the rest, close to three-quarters of this red and pink line, \ngoes to defense activities, because it is the Department of Energy that \nis in charge of our nuclear defense. Curiously enough, of that defense \nactivity, Mr. President, half really goes to the past. Half is \ncontinuing to pay for the triumph of the United States of America in \nWorld War II and in the cold war against the Soviet Union, because we \nbuilt so rapidly our nuclear capacity, our nuclear defense capacity, \nthat we did not learn at the time the dangers that nuclear waste would \nimpose on this country. And we have stored most of our nuclear waste in \na way that clearly is not permanent in nature and, clearly, threatens \nthe environment--very particularly, in my own State of Washington, \nwhere at Hanford, the great majority of this nuclear waste is located, \nand all across many other nuclear facilities in the rest of the country \nas well.\n\n  So a good portion--maybe a third of this entire appropriation--really \nlooks to the past, to taking care of the nuclear waste that we have \nalready created, and that which will be created in the future. That is \na very important part of this appropriation. It is a payment for past \ntriumphs of this country, and it is a payment which is obviously due to \nthose who are concerned with the environment of the United States and \nto those locations in which it is found. I spoke at greater length on \nFriday on the subject of Hanford and the beginning of a very real \nsuccess on the part of the engineers and the others who work there at \ndoing something about this waste.\n  Once again, Mr. President, this Department of Energy portion here is \nmaybe a quarter for research into the future for the energy needs of \nthe country, almost three-quarters for defense work, of which roughly \nhalf is really a payment for the past, rather than for our present \nsecurity. This much shorter green line, Mr. President, is the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I believe I can say that every single Member of \nthis body will have some interest in the work of the Army Corps of \nEngineers, as it works on all of our river systems, most notably in the \nState of the present occupant of the chair, my State, and all other \nStates as well, in projects to control floods, to conserve water, to \nuse it for agricultural purposes and the like.\n  Yet, this entire green line here includes not only the operations and \nmaintenance activities of the Corps of Engineers, but a very small \nportion for our future. The top tiny little green line here is \nMississippi flood control, Mr. President. But look at that in \ncomparison with all of the other activities of this appropriations \nbill--an an extremely modest investment in a vitally important \nactivity. But some of it, a portion that all of us are interested in, \nis for the construction of future projects on the part of the Corps of \nEngineers to make our ports deeper and safer; to create new areas in \nwhich we can conserve water for various public purposes, and the like.\n\n  Finally, the tiny orange line over here, insofar as the Department of \nthe Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation for a similar project; and, \nlastly, a handful of independent agencies like the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, the Delaware River Commission, the Interstate Commission on \nthe Potomac, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the like.\n  Yet, we tend to think of all of these things in the sense of \nequivalents. They are not equivalents with respect to the amount of \nmoney that we put into it. A very, very large portion, probably close \nto half, of this entire appropriations bill is for defense activities \nboth past and future, and much of it is for research.\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n  As a consequence, it is important. It is a matter of interest to all \nof the Members of this body. It is probably the reason, as the chairman \npointed out, that we have some 46 theoretically pending amendments to \nthe bill even though the chairman has been very careful to listen to \nmessages and requests from Members on behalf of their constituents. A \nsignificant number of projects, both in the research area and in the \nCorps of Engineers' operating area, are designed to build the \ninfrastructure of this country, and, Mr. President, at a time in which \nwe are properly and justifiably concerned with bringing our budget into \nbalance, a duty that we owe to our children and to our grandchildren, a \nmoral duty to pay today for the kinds of services and projects we want \nin government.\n  As significant as that is, as significant as the views of this \nchairman are to that purpose, as he is, after all, the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, it is important that we continue to invest in \nthe infrastructure of this country, whether it is a physical \ninfrastructure from the point of view of energy and water projects or a \nresearch infrastructure in better and more efficient and more effective \nways in which to use all of the energy resources that we have in the \nUnited States of America--one or the other. These investments in \ninfrastructure are vitally important.\n  So this is a really significant bill, Mr. President.\n  I see the chairman returning to the floor at this point. I wonder if \nhe would explain, for the Members who are still considering whether or \nnot to come to the floor to offer their amendments but even more \nsignificantly for the people of the country as a whole, something of \nthe dynamics of this bill.\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, I believe that, due to his \nefforts, there is somewhat more money in this bill than there is in the \nbill passed by the House of Representatives. I also believe that this \nbill stays within the allocations which his subcommittee has been \ngiven, which in turn are a part of a set of allocations which could \nlead us to a balanced budget by the year 2002, if, but only if, we also \nshow the courage and have the support from the President of the United \nStates to deal with the overwhelmingly expensive entitlement programs \nof this country.\n  So, if the chairman could tell us a little bit about how he made his \nchoices in connection with this bill and emphasize the fact that it is \na part of bringing the budget into balance and say what he thinks the \ndifferences between us and the House of Representatives are and how we \npropose to settle those differences, I would appreciate it. I think \nboth our other Members and the country at large would appreciate having \nthat knowledge as well.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me first say to my friend from \nWashington that I thank him very much for the efforts he puts forth in \nevery appropriations bill that he works on, but in particular I thank \nhim for his knowledge and his effort in this one.\n  The Department of Energy, obviously, is very misunderstood. I am not \nhere defending mismanagement or any of the things we read about that we \ndo not think would be in the best interests of maintaining this \nDepartment and maintaining a Cabinet position.\n  But, first, in that regard with reference to the management of the \nWashington headquarters and the top-end governance of that Department, \nwe have cut it 15.9--round numbers 16--percent. We believe, coupled \nwith last year's reduction, that we are sending a very strong signal \nthat the Department of Energy has too many people at the top end and, \nas a result, has an awful lot of regulations that are forthcoming with \nreference to the efforts out in the field that are duplicative, that \nare unnecessary.\n  In fact, one of the major studies with reference to the laboratories \nthat are owned by the Department of Energy and run under different \nmanagement schemes--some run by the universities such as Livermore and \nLos Alamos, some run by management teams of the private sector such as \nLockheed Martin, which runs Oak Ridge and Sandia--but one of the major \nreports was issued by the former chief executive officer of Motorola, \nMr. ``Bob'' Robert Galvin. In that report the indication was that the \nlaboratories are having a great deal of difficulty being efficient \nbecause there are too many rules and regulations.\n  We are looking forward to the Department of Energy, which continues \nto say they are working at that, we are looking forward to their \nquantifying at some point and saying that laboratories can run without \nthis enormous labyrinth of rules built one on top of the other.\n  But in the end, what people must understand about the Department of \nEnergy that I think is of utmost importance is that a very large piece \nof the Department of Energy is defense activities. There are some in \nthis body, some in the other body, and some within the Department of \nDefense, and some former Cabinet people within the Department of \nDefense who frequently make the case that the Department of Energy does \nnot do its defense work as well as some of them would like.\n  Nonetheless, I must remind everyone that one of the things we can be \nmost proud of by way of government doing a good job is how well we have \nsucceeded throughout the confrontation with the Soviet Union in keeping \nthe world from having a nuclear holocaust. What has happened is we \ncreated a stalemate, and we created such a vast array of information in \nthese laboratories, the three that are the big ones that are determined \nto be in that business, along with Oak Ridge as a fourth one, we were \nalways a step ahead. But all of the nuclear defense activities have \nbeen in the Department of Energy, or its predecessor, the civilian \ndepartment, throughout the entire episode of the conflict with the \nSoviet Union. They have not been in the Department of Defense. They \nhave been in the Department of Energy, or ERDA, its predecessor, or \neven the predecessor to that.\n  In this bill for weapons activities and other defense activities--\nthere is $3.46 billion, more or less, for weapons activities in the \nbudget request of the President, and we have funded that at $3.9 \nbillion, about $500 million higher than the President's request.\n  Frankly, we believe that in funding that at about $500 million higher \nthan the President, we have attempted to make sure that the goals and \nobjectives of this President and his Department of Energy and his \nDefense Department, the goals and objectives with reference to a \ntotally new way to handle our nuclear weapons is appropriately funded.\n  Now, those who are critical of the Department of Energy should know \nthat there is a very large portion of this budget that is Defense \nDepartment oriented. And is it an important function? This Senator \nassumes--and I think my friend from Washington supported this--that \nwhen we provided in the big budget $12 billion additional money for the \nDefense Department--and we did that, and we are willing to take the \nheat from that. That is an ongoing debate. We prevailed here, and we \nare funding defense overall at a higher level than the President asked \nfor by about $12 billion. We assumed throughout this DOE defense \nfunction, which has to do with our nuclear weapons and the maintenance \nof them, which I will explain in a moment, we should give them a slight \nincrease as we did the rest of DOD's work, so we assumed a comparable \n4.3 percent increase in those activities because that is how much we \nincreased the Defense Department. Frankly, I believe every single bit \nof that is going to be used in an advantageous way with reference to \nour nuclear stockpile and our nuclear cleanup which I will talk about \nin a moment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GORTON. That $12 billion increase in defense as a whole is over \nhow long a period of time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fiscal year 1997, 1 year.\n  Mr. GORTON. So $500 million is in this bill, and the remainder of it \nis in the bill that has already passed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. Two bills, military construction, \ncommonly known as MilCon, and the defense appropriations bill. The rest \nof it is in there. But $500 million of the $12 billion went to DOE \ndefense. And that can include nuclear weapons activities, but it can \nalso include nuclear cleanup, which, incidentally, the Senator has so\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\ndescribed here that everybody should look at.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In 1989, this pink portion of the Senator's chart \ncalled ``Defense Environmental Restoration and Waste Management'' was \n$800 million. It is now in excess of $5.5 billion. And actually, \neverybody understands that we must clean up the leftovers in the \nSenator's State, in the Savannah River area, in a couple of other areas \nin the United States, we must clean them up because that is our \nresponsibility, and it is a leftover defense activity. So we pay for it \nhere. So whenever we talk about defense money, unless somebody wants to \ntake that out and say it is no longer a defense function, in which \nevent I assume we would reduce defense spending by that amount and put \nit in some other civilian funding, that amount is in this \nappropriations bill and in every other one.\n  Now, I want to comment on two other things.\n  When we were involved in the confrontation with the Soviet Union, we \nhad a number of things that we have since decided we would not do. \nFirst, we did underground testing. For some--and I am not attaching any \nquality to this debate--we should have stopped them a long time ago. \nBut for those who have to be accountable for the quality of the \nweapons, they were very reluctant to give up underground testing. We \nfinally voted that in here in the Senate. It was a Hatfield amendment \nto stop nuclear testing other than in case of an emergency, subject to \nthe certification of the President, it might start again.\n\n  I am not going to talk much about why testing was important to those \nwho make bombs and keep them safe. Let me say those are goals without \nany serious contention. Almost everybody says that was a benefit in \nthat regard.\n  Now, this Department, starting about 2\\1/2\\ years ago, is involved in \na whole new way to maintain our nuclear weapons. And as I have said \nbefore, when we talk about keeping this new inventory of nuclear \nweapons, it would be wonderful to come to the floor and say we do not \nneed them anymore; we are not going to have any. But we are going to \nhave them for quite a long time, and it is a rather large number--not \nnearly as large as before. It is coming down dramatically in number.\n  But a new charge was placed on the laboratories by the Department of \nEnergy and agreed to by DOD. It is called the science-based stockpile \nstewardship. We are now being asked to maintain a stockpile of a given \nnumber of thousands of weapons in a trustworthy, safe, secure, and \ndeliverable mode without any testing underground and without \nmanufacturing any weapons, for we are not making any new nuclear \nweapons. In this bill, we do not have money to make new nuclear \nweapons, and all the money for nuclear weapons is in this bill. If it \nis not here, it is nowhere.\n  But the stockpile stewardship program based on science will require \nnew facilities, new science techniques to make sure that we know \nwhether, in some of these weapons which are 25 and 30 years old, \ncertain parts have to be replaced. And they are not all nuclear \nrelated. There is a huge number of parts that are just related to the \nmechanics of a good weapon, of a weapon that is appropriately safe and \ntrustworthy. To do that we need more resources, and we need to convert \nour major laboratories to that work.\n  We believe it is a real challenge. We believe it is imperative that \nwe give these scientists the same kind of recognition that we give to \nour defense people. When we say we need the best defense people, we \nneed to pay our military men and women the best, we need to give them \nthe best opportunity to serve us well, we have to, in my opinion, say \nthe laboratories that are preserving this healthy situation are akin to \nour military people.\n  They are not military people. And I think many say, thank God, they \nhave not been, for we have never since Harry Truman's time wanted to \nput the maintenance of a nuclear weapons compound and all that goes \ninto it in the Defense Department. We said you give us the criteria; we \nwill deliver them; you make sure that in fact they are what we say they \nare but let civilians do that. So we chose in this bill to put more \nmoney in various functions of the stockpile stewardship program.\n  Mr. President, none of us are thrilled with the efficiency of the \nnuclear cleanup activities. The distinguished Senator from Washington, \nwho has millions of dollars being spent to clean up Hanford, has \nregularly indicated his great displeasure at how long it is taking and \nhow we are standing in place instead of running. But the point of it is \nwe have to put money in that. We have $200 million more in that overall \nprogram than the House did. We will have to defend that in conference. \nWe are going to maybe defend it on the floor. I do not know of an \namendment yet, but I can see in that amendment a reduction in the \ncleanup. There is an amendment offered by Senator Bumpers which would \ncut back on the stockpile stewardship in its broadest sense as I \nunderstand the amendment.\n\n  Now, I want to make one last observation. I said I had two. We have \nput together in the national laboratory systems of the Department of \nEnergy a huge labyrinth of great equipment to do research projects. And \nprobably it is fair to say that over 40 years there was assembled in \nthe nuclear deterrent laboratories and the others, including Oak Ridge, \nthe biggest science talent in a group in an institution, science and \nengineering talent of anywhere in the world. And certainly in America \nwith 7,000 or 8,000, 9,000 scientists with all those that support them \nat some of these institutions, we were always able to get the very \nbest, phenomenal in terms of their research. So there developed within \nthat system research on major deep science and physics issues, and in \nthis budget we have maintained an effort in high-energy physics, \nnuclear physics, biological and environmental research second to none \nin the world. It is not a huge portion, as my colleague pointed out, \nbut high-energy physics and nuclear physics are among the premier \nefforts at finding out the nature of matter, the real nature of atoms \nand every part of atoms, the atomic structure and everything within it, \nto find out clearly what is in this universe of ours. We should never \nstop that research. America is the leader there, and we should continue \nto be the leader.\n\n  We do biological and environmental research. Incidentally, the \ngreatest wellness health research program, one-third of it, is in the \nDepartment of Energy. That is the program called genome research, which \nwill map the entire chromosome structure of the human body, map it and \nhand it to the scientific community so they can then proceed to effect \ncures over time of the great diseases. That is in here for about one-\nthird of $189 million, whatever that number is, for national programs, \nabout $189 million, and we have a third of it here.\n  We have geothermal and fusion research. We have solar and renewables. \nThere will be an amendment on the floor to add some money to solar and \nrenewables. That amendment will add about $23 million. The Senator \nasked what some of the amendments are about. That has been put \ntogether, we understand. Senator Jeffords has been the leader on that, \nand we will try to work that out with him.\n  Obviously, since I spent the last 10 minutes talking about the \nDepartment of Energy, then I must spend a few moments on the other \naspect of this bill. Because, as the Senator's chart so adequately \ndepicts, this bill also covers the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of \nEngineers, the Appalachian Regional Commission, Defense Nuclear \nFacilities Safety Board, Tennessee Valley Authority, Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, and the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. These are \nnondefense activities that are in this bill that are very important. \nAlmost all of the 47 amendments that I alluded to awhile ago that were \nat least reserved by Senators, almost all of them had to do with these \nfunctions that I just elaborated; in particular, the corps and the \nBureau, for the most part. I did not say all of them, but for the most \npart.\n  So, when we have to fund this at a freeze for nondefense, it is not \npossible for us to grant an awful lot of new program startups and the \nlike for the Bureau of Reclamation or the corps. We have done our best \nin the bill. If we can save some money in some of the amendments that \nare being offered in that area, we will try to accommodate some of the \nStates' desires, as evidenced by the reserved amendments from Senators \nwho are seeking to continue projects or to take an authorized\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nproject and fund it in this bill. I think that is very important.\n  Obviously, there are many who wonder about the Federal Government's \ninvolvement in flood protection--until there is a flood. Then everybody \nthinks the Federal Government should be involved. If that is the case, \nwhen there is a known flood potential, when there is a situation with a \nhigh propensity for floods, why shouldn't we be part of preventing it \non some kind of a match basis? We have done that for a long time.\n  There is not as much money going into flood protection, but there is \nsome, and there is a match required at the State level and a cost-\nbenefit ratio, meaning it must be found to be beneficial and that the \nrisks far exceed the costs that we are going to put into the project. \nThat is what we are trying to do there. So this is an interesting \nlittle bill. It is not the biggest appropriation bill, but it is pretty \nimportant.\n  I want to repeat for those who are very concerned about the defense \nof our country, I am trying my best, the Senator from New Mexico is \ntrying his best, every chance that he can, to explain that there is a \nmajor defense activity in this subcommittee. It is not all in that \nDefense appropriation and MilCon bill. If we want to be certain about \nhow we are handling the nuclear stockpile, we ought to make sure we are \nadequately funding the stockpile stewardship program. At the same time, \nwe have to maintain some of the facilities that are not part of the \nstockpile stewardship, but rather part of ``if we have to go back to \nthe old way,'' we have some facilities that are there on a conditional \nbasis, ready to be used. That has been insisted upon by the defense \nleaders of our country. So that means we cannot abandon the State of \nNevada's testing facilities because, in fact, what if we need to use \nthem again?\n  I note today, as we speak, China is undertaking an underground test, \nas I read about it. They say it is the last, and they will soon sign a \nbig international treaty. On the other hand, you do not have to \nbelieve, when they say that is the last one, that they are going to \nabandon all their facilities. I do not believe that is the case. Russia \nis trying to build down, but their facilities are not being abandoned. \nSo there is a little bit of added expense there, but I think it is very \nimportant expense.\n  The last thought has to do with nonproliferation. It is related to \nwhat has been going on in our country in terms of the recent bombing \nand TWA flight 800 that fell out of the skies. The whole issue of \nnonproliferation is no longer simply a nuclear nonproliferation issue. \nBut, in that regard, this bill espouses a concept. The concept is, if \nwe can spend some money helping Russia make sure that their nuclear \ndevices and the science that goes into them are not shipped around the \nworld but rather are dismantled in an orderly manner and their \nscientists put to work at something else, it is in our security \ninterests. That is not foreign aid. That is security aid for us.\n  The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment, which was adopted here in the \nSenate in the armed services bill and partially funded in this bill, \nhas a lot to do with trying to move ahead with making Russia's \ndismantlement more secure, more certain, and safer for the world. It \nhas a couple of interesting projects--partnership with laboratories \nhere and business in an effort to keep some of their great scientists \nfrom succumbing to the offer of money to move to other countries to \nbecome bomb builders.\n  The Nunn-Lugar-Domenici bill has some civilian defense in it with \nreference to disasters that might be forthcoming from chemical and \nbiological incidents. There is a new interagency coordination, a new \nNational Security Council position to coordinate responses to \nterrorism, international crime, and nonproliferation. There is a major \neffort, some of which is vested in the laboratories of the Department, \nto come up with the best approach to containing chemical and biological \nweapons of mass destruction from the very bottom up: Identifying how \nthey are made, identifying ways that they can be prevented in some \ngeneric ways. So we are slightly ahead of the curve in getting that \nstarted and getting it funded. That took a little of the extra money \nthat is in this bill.\n  In summary, we have succeeded, in the U.S. Senate, in getting $200 \nmillion more in the nondefense parts of this bill than the House has in \ntheirs, and $700 million more in all of the Department of Energy's \ndefense activities from cleanup, which we call defense, to the science-\nbased safeguards new system, and other needs to maintain a dual track \nwith reference to our nuclear weapons.\n  I thank my colleague very much for raising the issue about the bill \nand for the discussion that ensued. Since there is no one here to offer \nan amendment, I assume this was worthwhile.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EXON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ncomment on the bill which is before us.\n  First, I salute the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nLouisiana who are the leaders on this particular measure. I think they \nhave done, by and large, an outstanding job. I hope we can move ahead \nas quickly as we can to approval of the measure before us, although I \nam certain some amendments will be in order.\n  Once again, I emphasize that over the years, as has been alluded to \nby the Senator from New Mexico in his remarks, his excellent remarks \njust concluded, the Energy Department has played a much larger role in \nnational defense and national security than is generally recognized.\n  One of the problems that I have seen in this area, of course, is that \ngenerally we refer to the $260 to $270 billion annual appropriations \nfor national defense. To give us a true picture of that, we should add \non the billions of dollars included in the Energy Department under the \ndiscretion of the appropriators who have, for many years, taken a very \nclose look at the operations of the Department of Energy. I urge them \nto continue that effort, as we in the Armed Services Committee do.\n  Generally speaking, there has been excellent cooperation between the \nauthorizers of these funds, the Armed Services Committee, on which I \nhave the honor to serve, and the appropriators, working in close \ncooperation with the appropriators, especially in the Energy \nDepartment, with regard to a whole scope of international relations and \ninternational security.\n  I emphasize, once again, the excellent remarks made by the Senator \nfrom New Mexico with regard to the excellent job that is done by two of \nthe national laboratories that are located in his State. Certainly, I \nagree with him completely that the new challenges that we have placed \non the Department of Energy, and especially under the laboratories that \nthey oversee, with regard to the safety and reliability of our nuclear \nstockpile is very important.\n  I have been one of the leaders from the very beginning to end, if we \npossibly can, nuclear testing of any type, but, of course, that remains \nto be seen as to whether or not we can get the rest of the nuclear \ncommunities around the world, other nations, to agree, because \ncertainly, although I have pressed hard for the nuclear test ban \ntreaty, I recognize and realize that we cannot go it alone forever, \nwhich brings me to a matter that I call to the attention of the Senate.\n  Today in Geneva, Switzerland, the world peacekeepers, the \nnegotiators, in an attempt to end the testing of nuclear weapons, are \ngoing into a fateful 2 or 3 days. Evidently, although there has not \nbeen a great deal of attention paid to this, unfortunately, I think it \nis one of the most meaningful international negotiations that we have \never seen, and I believe the success or failure of those negotiations, \nwhich are reopening today in Geneva, Switzerland, will go a long way to \nassure, if we can get the nuclear test ban treaty extended and signed, \nman's humanity for mankind more than anything else that we can do.\n  I will say that I am very pleased to read in the newspapers this \nmorning that evidently all nations that are considered nuclear states, \nor possibly nuclear states in the future, have agreed to sign on to a \ncontinuation of the nuclear test ban treaty with the exception of \nIndia. India, of course, is pursuing a course that is most difficult \nfor most of us who have followed this with great interest to \nunderstand: Their continuing to say to the international\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\ncommunity that they will not sign on to any kind of an extension of the \nnuclear test ban treaty so long as the nations of the world, the five \nbig nations, primarily, and others, agree to dramatically reduce and \nget on a course to end the stockpile of nuclear inventory.\n\n  While that would, of course, be something that might be good for \npeace, on the other hand, it might not be. The whole drive today is not \nto eliminate nuclear weapons from those nations that now have it. The \nwhole concept of a nuclear test ban treaty is to put roadblocks in the \nway for new states, particularly Third World nations coming aboard and \nbeing part of the nuclear inventory states.\n  That can only be very foreboding, as far as the future of peace is \nconcerned, and especially the future of peace on the basis of not \nhaving and relying primarily--and I emphasize the word ``primarily''--\non nuclear inventories.\n  Suffice it to say, Mr. President, a lot of very important things are \ngoing on today. I happen to feel that, by and large, the measure that \nhas been advanced to the floor of the Senate by the appropriate \nsubcommittee, in this case energy, is a good bill. I think it is an \nimportant step in the right direction, with some modifications and lots \nof compromises.\n  In closing, I compliment, once again, the two Senators who are \nmanaging this bill on the floor for the excellent understanding that \nthey have, the grasp that they have with regard to the whole complex \nmatter of not only national security but international security. I \nthank them for their attention and thoughtfulness on this particular \nmeasure.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9009-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about an \nexciting new project called NetDay East, which is mobilizing volunteers \nin several States, including the Commonwealth of Virginia, to wire our \npublic schools for the Internet. It is exciting, Mr. President, because \nof how the Internet has transformed the way people communicate and \nexpanded access to information worldwide.\n  Our challenge now is to bring this technology into all of our \nNation's schools as quickly as possible so that all students, \nregardless of their economic status or where they live, have access to \nthe same global library of knowledge and information to compete on a \nlevel playing field.\n  The biggest barrier has been the lack of money and manpower needed to \nphysically wire the schools to the Internet. Laying the necessary cable \nto link our K-12 classrooms is estimated to cost billions of dollars \nnationwide.\n  But a project in California has showed us that we can overcome this \nobstacle if we mobilize our communities and work together. In 1 day, \nCalifornia wired 3,500 schools at little or no cost to the schools \nthemselves through the outstanding volunteer efforts of parents, \nteachers, students, businesses, and elected officials.\n  Because of the vision and commitment reflected in their NetDay, \nhundreds of thousands of young Californians will be able to experience \na new global world of unlimited possibility with the stroke of a key.\n  As one who cares deeply about education and surfs the Internet from \nmy Senate office, I am delighted to be a part of NetDay East. Modeled \nafter California's project, NetDay East is now organizing to cable \nschools every weekend in October in Virginia, the District of Columbia, \nand Maryland. Similar efforts are taking place in Massachusetts, North \nCarolina, Montana, Connecticut, and Louisiana as well.\n  Mr. President, an estimated 40 million people from more than 150 \ncountries use the information superhighway. They include Kathleen \nButzler at Northampton Middle School who can lead her seventh grade \nclass on a virtual tour of the White House or talk to a Member of \nCongress without leaving their home in Mochipongo on Virginia's Eastern \nShore.\n  We shouldn't forget that the Internet is a two-way communications \ntour. Through NetDay East, thousands of Virginia students will be able \nto create Web pages, like those at the Northampton Middle School, to \nteach the rest of the world about the treasures of our beautiful and \ndiverse State.\n  This technology is fascinating and could very well be the spark to \nignite the imagination in children who would otherwise be disinterested \nin school work. Capturing the interest and imagination of our students \nthrough this technology can yield enormous future benefits, for \nstudents with access will have a distinct advantage over those who do \nnot. We cannot afford to let our schools slip behind those of our \ninternational competitors when the technology, technology that we \ncreated, is literally right at our fingertips.\n  There are many ways to participate in NetDay, Mr. President. \nBusinesses can contribute in a variety of ways, including partnering \nwith local schools, purchasing wiring kits, lending technical staff, \nand encouraging their employees to volunteer.\n\n  Individuals can help pull wire in schools, since installing this type \nof cable requires a great deal of labor but very little technical \nexpertise.\n  Schools can register to be a part of this project and encourage their \nparents to volunteer and promote NetDay. This October on a Saturday, my \nstaff and I plan to help cable A.P. Hill Elementary School in \nPetersburg, VA, as a part of NetDay East. We will also be doing a \ndemonstration project in Northern Virginia right after school starts in \nSeptember.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that when we wire schools for \nthe Internet this October, we will complete just the first step in a \nmuch greater effort to help young Virginians and young Americans in \nother States travel the information superhighway.\n  It is a first step, but it is certainly an essential one. There will \nbe much to do to finish the job, including arranging for Internet \nconnections, training students and teachers in the effective uses of \nthe Internet and helping to acquire computer donations to the schools. \nI hope NetDay forms an important and productive alliance between our \ncommunities and our schools that can continue well beyond October.\n  Finally, I fully endorse NetDay East, and I encourage others to join \nus during the month of October to participate in this modern-day barn \nraising.\n  If anyone would like to sponsor, volunteer, endorse, sign up their \nschool or just find out more information, please visit the NetDay East \nhome page at ``www.cgcs.org/netday-east.''\n  For anyone who does not have access to the Internet, I invite them to \ncontact my office, and we will certainly assist them with registration.\n  With the help of many caring and committed individuals, Mr. \nPresident, we can keep our children off the wayside and ensure they \nmove swiftly and surely forward on the information superhighway.\n  With that, I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n\n\n                   TRAGEDY AT THE CENTENNIAL OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have just returned from the \nCentennial Olympics in my home city of Atlanta.\n  I ask unanimous consent for a brief moment of silence for those who \ndied or were wounded in the bombing the other evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [Moment of silence.]\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we, of course, extend our grief and \ncondolences to the family of Alice Hawthorne from Albany, GA, and for \nMelih Uzunyoz, a Turkish national, both of whom lost their lives in a \nterrorist-related bombing that occurred at approximately 1:20 a.m. the \nother morning. Also, we extend our concern and prayers to the 110 \ncasualties that occurred during the bombing and to the 17 who remain in \nthe hospital.\n  Mr. President, we all owe a group of law enforcement officers a deep \ndebt. The officer who spotted this bomb and his colleagues, in the face \nof grave danger, were heroes, in every sense, of the Centennial \nOlympics. In the face of danger themselves, they remained on site, and \nwith every avenue available and open to them they tried to evacuate the \ncrowd from the area of danger. I am absolutely convinced that, without \ntheir diligence and duty, the casualties would have been far, far \ngreater. So these officers, these men and women, who tried to evacuate \nthe park are due a deep debt of gratitude from all of us.\n  Further, the volunteers and officers who stayed, not knowing whether \nthere was a series of bombs, to help those wounded receive comfort, \naid, and assistance so that they might be appropriately hospitalized, \nperformed admirably, incredibly in the face of grave danger. To all the \nofficers, the men and women, Federal, State, and local, who in the \nfollowing hours did everything within their power to bring order to the \nsituation, and who were deluged with what I characterize as thrill-\nseekers reporting bombs in other venues, other high-density areas. With \nprecision and expertise and valor, they proceeded to secure this great \nworld event in our State and in our Nation. So my hat is off to these \npeople. Again, the word ``hero'' comes to mind.\n\n  Mr. President, I was first notified of this incident at 3 a.m. in the \nmorning. By 6:30 that morning, I had been in touch with the law \nenforcement command center, which I visited to try to take stock of the \nsituation. It was a gloomy, dark night, drizzling, and as you might \nimagine, a sense of great concern and pall fell over all of us. As I \nwas driving back pondering what it was that all of us were confronted \nwith, as I was driving into the city, I looked at the interstate that \nyou have to walk over, which many fans have to walk over in order to \nget to the grand Olympic stadium, and there was a vision of valor, \ndefiance, courage, and will--the fans. There they were. I could not \nbelieve it. I looked up and, by the thousands, they were walking onto \nthe stadium and throughout the city to the other venues.\n  It will, in my judgment, be a mark of heroism, broad heroism, on a \npar with the athletes themselves, because this world community gathered \nup and said, ``No way; we will not be intimidated. We will go on with \nthe games.'' Not only did IOC proclaim the games would go on--that is a \nstatement--but the key was that the world community said, ``The games \nwill go on.'' The families, the children, all alike, everywhere you \nwent, were coming out to say that the Centennial Olympics is bigger \nthan this heinous act against defenseless and helpless citizens.\n  In many ways, I think it will mark a period of great thought for us \nin this country. The Presiding Officer, among others, is very much \naware that there has been a growing discussion and debate. I think it \nprobably ultimately will call for vaster resources, a better capacity \nto deal with this kind of era that we approach as we come to the new \ncentury. But, for a moment, I had a chance to personally see a broad \nstatement of valor by people from nation after nation. I talked about \nit all afternoon. One volunteer had been coming in on the rapid transit \nsystem that morning, and the car, of course, as you might expect, was \ncrammed from side to side with people of every nation--Dutch, German, \nAmerican, and the like--and the fans broke out into song singing as \nthey went on to the venues.\n\n  So, again, Mr. President, our grief to the families involved, our \nthanks to those that stood in the face of danger to help, and our \nacknowledgment of a heroism and a worldwide statement that was made in \nAtlanta the very next morning as the centennial games continued.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, under the previous order, I am to be \nrecognized during morning business for a period of 60 minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that during this period I be permitted to \nyield portions of my time to other Members without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9015-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9016-S9027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE DRUG EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I have said many times on the floor, \nwe are in the midst of a drug epidemic in the United States of enormous \nproportions that are not yet, I do not believe, fully comprehended. \nDrug use among our youth has doubled in the last 36 months, ending 12 \nyears of a continued decline in drug use.\n\n  Mr. President, this administration, unfortunately, has to come to \nterms with this issue because it is pretty clear that its decision to \nshut down the drug office, to shut down interdiction efforts, to \ndramatically curtail the war on drugs, and to the change policy \nregarding rehabilitation has had some very, very uncomfortable \nconsequences.\n  What does it mean when you say drug use has ``doubled''? Does that \nmean two more people use it? No. What it means is there are 2 million \nAmerican families who have fallen victim to the tragic consequences of \ninvolving themselves in drugs.\n  Mr. President, in a moment I am going to yield to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah. But \nlet me say that among the data we are now discovering is the fact that \nour youth currently do not see drugs as a threat to them. How could \nthat be? How could it be that the vast majority of youngsters no longer \nsee that as a threat to them? Therefore, they are not concerned about \nit. Therefore, they use it more freely. Therefore, twice the number use \nit today.\n  I just have to say that over the last several months, this cavalier \nattitude from the President's press secretary and others and the \nrevelation about drug use in the White House itself--I mean, everybody \nunderstands the White House is a bully pulpit. If that pulpit is \nsanctioning, or appears to be sanctioning, or appears to be minimizing \nthe serious effects of drug use, it should not be surprising that our \nyoung people do not understand the consequences.\n  I am afraid that what has surfaced over the last several weeks--the \nword that comes to mind is ``cavalier''--is that it is not really \nimportant, that message has created a very, very serious repercussion \nin our country. It has to be turned around and changed quickly.\n  Mr. President, with that opening statement, I yield up to 15 minutes \nto the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick \nMurphy, a detailee on my staff, be granted floor privileges for the \nremainder of this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our Federal drug policy is at a crossroads. \nUnfortunately for Americans, drug control is not a national priority \nfor the Clinton administration. For some time now I have been saying \nthat President\n\n[[Page S9017]]\n\nClinton has been AWOL--absent without leadership--in the war on drugs. \nPut another way, the Clinton White House has been MIA in the drug war--\nmired in arrogance. Ineffectual leadership and failed Federal policies \nhave combined with ambiguous cultural messages to generate changing \nattitudes among our young people and sharp, serious increases in \nyouthful drug use.\n  This is painfully evidenced by this chart on my right, which shows \nthat after a 12-year steady decline in drug use by high school seniors, \nfrom 1980 to 1992, there has been a sharp increase in such drug use \nduring the last 3 years. As you can see, the decline came from 1980 \ndownhill in every one of these categories, and in every one of the \ncategories since 1992 drug use has started to go up sharply.\n  Even more troubling is that this increase has been uniform as to \nthose who have used drugs in the past month, in the past year, and \nthose children trying drugs for the first time.\n  No one is more responsible for our current dilemma than President \nClinton. For more than 3 years, I have taken to the floor of the Senate \nto warn my colleagues and the Nation about the threat we face due to \nPresident Clinton's abdication of leadership in the war on drugs. What \nalso troubles me is that a defeatist outlook in the drug war appears \nnow to be supplemented by a softer attitude tolerating or excusing drug \nuse.\n  The Clinton administration has caused serious damage to this country \nas a direct result of failed policies and absent leadership in the war \non drugs. Indeed, as one more manifestation of the administration's \narrogance of power, we now know that the White House strong-armed the \nSecret Service into granting security passes for at least a dozen \npersons who had engaged in the recent use of, among other illegal \ndrugs, crack cocaine and hallucinogens. In responding to questions \nconcerning this matter, White House spokesman Mike McCurry disdainfully \nsuggested that prior drug use was no big deal. What a terrible message \nto send to the country, especially to our young people. Where was \nPresident Clinton during this episode? Why didn't he admonish his \nspokesman? When will someone at the White House acknowledge that drug \nuse is a big deal.\n  To his credit, Mr. McCurry has expressed regret for having been so \ncavalier; but, it is quite telling that it was the President's \nspokesman who expressed this attitude of tolerance for drug use. \nRemember, this is the same President who named the stealth drug czar \nLee Brown and Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, a proponent of legalizing \ndrugs.\n  Let me be clear. I am not suggesting that people who experimented \nwith drugs in their youth are categorically unfit for public service. \nBut we should not make room at the policy table for those who have used \ndrugs even as students and believe that their drug use was not a \nserious wrong, unfortunate step in their life. Nor should those who \nstill use drugs or have recently done so be given a public trust \nespecially in the White House. It is this mindset which will result in \ndefeat.\n  Both President Reagan and President Bush led from the front on this \nwar, confronting our Nation's drug problems head on with positive \nresults. As a Nation, we were committed to winning the war on drugs, \nand we were making gains. Since President Clinton has assumed office, \nhis administration's campaign against drugs has been in full retreat, \nand America is now losing the war.\n  During the Reagan and Bush era, the United States saw dramatic \nreductions in casual drug use. From 1977 to 1992, casual drug use was \nmore than cut in half. Cocaine use fell by 79 percent, while monthly \nuse fell from 2.9 million users in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992. Such \nreductions were achieved not by hollow rhetoric but through sustained, \nvisible use of the bully pulpit, increased quantities, a clear and \nquantifiable antidrug policy and, most important, strong Presidential \nleadership. Substantial investment of resources, coupled with the \neffective use of the bully pulpit, caused a strong reverberation of \nantidrug sentiment throughout this Nation.\n  From his very first days in office, President Clinton was derailing \nthe effective approaches of prior administrations. Although he promised \nto ``reinvent our drug control programs,'' and ``move beyond \nideological debates,'' the President announced a new approach to drug \npolicy, deemphasizing law enforcement and cutting interdiction. He \ncalled his approach a controlled shift. In hindsight, it has been an \napproach of reckless abdication. The Clinton administration renounced \nthe proven policies of previous administrations and instead oversaw the \nfollowing:\n  Federal illegal drug caseloads were reduced by 10.3 percent from \nfiscal year 1992 to fiscal year 1995;\n  The Governmentwide interdiction budget was cut by 39 percent since \n1993;\n  Supply reduction has been put in utter disarray, with a 53 percent \ndrop in our ability to interdict and push back drug shipments in the \ndrug transit zone;\n  Between 1992 and 1994, cocaine seized by the Customs Service and \nCoast Guard dropped 70 percent and 71 percent, respectively.\n  The National Drug Control Policy staff was cut from 147 to 25, but \nCongress did restore funding for adequate staffing levels this fiscal \nyear, and with the President's approval finally admitted that they were \nwrong;\n  The administration's fiscal year 1995 budget proposed to slash 621 \ndrug enforcement positions from the DEA, INS, FBI and Customs Service;\n  From 1992 to 1995, the Drug Enforcement Administration lost 227 agent \npositions, more than 6 percent of its agent force;\n  President Clinton signed legislation repealing mandatory minimums for \nsome drug traffickers and dealers;\n  And agreed to more than $230 million in cuts to drug education and \nprevention funds in 1993.\n  It really is no surprise, therefore, that as the administration has \nturned a blind eye to this problem, drug dealers have flooded our \nNation's streets with more illegal drugs and steadily declining prices.\n  For example, as this next chart here reflects, the last several years \nhave seen a dramatic drop in heroin prices. Since 1992, it has \ndramatically dropped. In fact, you can see it dropped very dramatically \nthere, and then the purity, of course, has been going up. So the drop \nin heroin prices, combined with the dramatic increase in the purity of \nsuch heroin on the streets, has been catastrophic.\n\n  The conclusion that can be drawn from these facts is clear. Supply is \nway up on our city streets resulting in more lethal drugs being \navailable to our children at a much cheaper rate. Despite such glaring \nevidence, the Clinton administration continues to remain silent on \naddressing this problem.\n  In short, since 1992, the bully pulpit has gathered dust, liberal \nsoft-headed policies have been implemented, and a mentality of \ntolerance for drugs has taken root. As a result, almost every available \nindicator today shows the United States is losing our fight against \ndrugs. Let us just consider some of the evidence.\n  First, drugs are cheap and more available. Since 1993, the retail \nprice of cocaine has dropped by more than 10 percent. The price of \nheroin has plummeted from $1,647 a gram in 1992 to $966 a gram in \nFebruary 1996.\n  Second, since President Clinton took office, the number of 12- to 17-\nyear-olds using marijuana has almost doubled--2.9 million kids compared \nwith the 1992 level of 1.6 million. According to a most recent \nUniversity of Michigan study, one in three high school seniors now \nsmokes marijuana, and 48.4 percent of the class of 1995 had tried \nillegal drugs.\n  You can see why I got so upset when Mr. McCurry made his comments. \nNow, to his credit, he has basically apologized for those, and I accept \nhis apology. But it should never have happened to begin with. And it is \nthis tolerance in the White House that is causing these problems. It \ncomes through to these kids and to everybody else, it seems to me.\n  Third, the number of cocaine and heroin-related emergency room \nadmissions has jumped to historic levels. In the first half of 1995, \ncocaine-related emergency room cases were 65 percent above the level in \nthe first half of 1991. Heroin admissions soared 120 percent over this \nsame period of time.\n  Fourth, methamphetamine use has soared with meth-related emergency \nroom admissions in 1995 increasing by\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nmore than 320 percent since 1991. And yet, I might add, someone on the \nother side of the aisle is blocking consideration of a bipartisan \nHatch-Biden methamphetamine bill. I urge the President to call off his \nguardians of gridlock so we can pass this bill that is critical to this \ncountry.\n  Fifth, LSD use has reached the highest rate since recordkeeping \nstarted in 1975. Fully 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 had tried it \nat least once.\n  That is mind-boggling.\n  The widespread increase in illegal drug use is not surprising when \nthe relative ease in which these drugs are now brought across our \nborders is considered. Recent reports indicate that Mexican drug \ncartels are no longer interested in merely crossing our southern border \nto peddle their drugs. Ranchers along the Texas and New Mexico border \nare now finding themselves being forced to sell their border properties \nto these armed thugs. They are getting plenty of money for it. Why \nwould they pay these exorbitant rates? But people are afraid not to \nsell to them for fear they will be killed.\n  As a result, a virtual superhighway for illegal drug flow into this \ncountry is being created--some say has already been created.\n  We are literally losing ground against drugs. In an effort to call \nattention to this disturbing development, I will be holding a hearing \nin the Judiciary Committee this Wednesday on precisely these points: \nWhat is happening on our southern border?\n  Due to President Clinton's failure in the drug war, our children are \nat greater risk, our law enforcement efforts are strained more than \never, and our borders, it appears, are now being bought up by drug \nsmugglers.\n  To his credit, President Clinton named Gen. Barry McCaffrey as his \nnew drug czar. General McCaffrey is a committed man. I have respect for \nhim. But it may be too little too late. Such 11th hour tactics do not \nobviate one absolute truth: For the last 3 years, in the battle to \nregain our streets from the plague of illegal drugs, this \nadministration has let our country down.\n  The Nation must have effective moral leadership in this war against \ndrugs. The President has turned back the clock 20 years in the drug \nwar. He has hurt this Nation by his lack of leadership on this issue, \nand it is time to turn this retreat around.\n  I again call on our President not just to join, but to lead an attack \non illegal drugs and their use in this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary and a series of \nexcerpts of relevant reports be printed in the Record. They are most \ninformative. I urge my colleagues to read them.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Summary\n\n\n                              Key Findings\n\n     Losing ground against drugs\n       1.

Hatch, Utah, Chairman)\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       Through the 1980s and into the early 1990s, the United \n     States experienced dramatic and unprecedented reductions in \n     casual drug use.\n       The number of Americans using illicit drugs plunged from \n     24.7 million in 1979 to 11.4 million in 1992. The so-called \n     ``casual'' use of cocaine fell by 79 percent between 1985 and \n     1992, while monthly cocaine use fell 55 percent between 1988 \n     and 1992 alone--from 2.9 million to 1.3 million users.\n       On the surface, little appears to have changed since 1992. \n     For the nation as a whole, drug use remains relatively flat. \n     The vast majority of Americans still do not use illegal \n     drugs.\n       Unfortunately, this appearance is dangerously misleading. \n     Drug use has in fact experienced a dramatic resurgence among \n     our youth, a disturbing trend that could quickly return the \n     United States to the epidemic of drug use that characterized \n     the decade of the 1970s.\n       Recent surveys, described in detail in this report, provide \n     overwhelming evidence of a sharp and growing increase in drug \n     use among young people:\n       The number of 12-17 year-olds using marijuana increased \n     from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994. The category \n     of ``recent marijuana use'' increased a staggering 200 \n     percent among 14-15 year-olds over the same period.\n       Since 1992, there has been a 52 percent jump in the number \n     of high-school seniors using drugs on a monthly basis, even \n     as worrisome declines are noted in peer disapproval of drug \n     use.\n       One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana.\n       Young people are actually more likely to be aware of the \n     health dangers of cigarettes than of the dangers of \n     marijuana.\n       Nor have recent increases been confined to marijuana. At \n     least three surveys note increased use of inhalants and other \n     drugs such as cocaine and LSD.\n       Drug use by young people is alarming by any standard, but \n     especially so since teen drug use is at the root of hard-core \n     drug use by adults. According to surveys by the Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse, 12-17 year-olds who use \n     marijuana are 85 times more likely to graduate to cocaine \n     than those who abstain from marijuana. Fully 60 percent of \n     adolescents who use marijuana before age 15 will later use \n     cocaine. Conversely, those who reach age 21 without ever \n     having used drugs almost never try them later in life.\n       Described another way, perhaps 820,000 of the new crop of \n     youthful marijuana smokers will eventually try cocaine. Of \n     these 820,000 who try cocaine, some 58,000 may end up as \n     regular users and addicts.\n       The implications of public policy are clear. If such \n     increases are allowed to continue for\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\n     just two more years, America will be at risk of returning to \n     the epidemic drug use of the 1970s. Should that happen, our \n     ability to control health care costs, reform welfare, improve \n     the academic performance of our school-age children, and \n     defuse the projected ``crime bomb'' of youthful super-\n     predator criminals, will all be seriously compromised.\n       With these thoughts in mind, I am pleased to present \n     ``Losing Ground Against Drugs: A Report on Increasing Illicit \n     Drug Use and National Drug Policy'' prepared at my direction \n     by the majority staff of the United States Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary. This report examines trends in drug use and \n     the Clinton Administration's sometimes uneven response to \n     them, including the Administration's controversial policy of \n     targeting chronic, hardcore drug users. The report also \n     reviews the state of trends in use and availability. And, \n     finally, it evaluates the performance over the past three \n     years of our nation's criminal justice and interdiction \n     systems.\n       The report finds Federal law enforcement under severe \n     strain just as the technical sophistication of drug \n     trafficking syndicates is reaching new heights. It finds that \n     the Administration's supply reduction policy is in utter \n     disarray, with a 53 percent drop in our ability to interdict \n     and push back drug shipments in the transit zone. The report \n     also finds increases in the purity of drugs and the number of \n     drug-related emergency room admissions of hard-core users.\n       Federal drug policy is at a crossroads. Ineffectual \n     leadership and failed federal policies have combined with \n     ambiguous cultural messages to generate changing attitudes \n     among our young people and sharp increases in youthful drug \n     use.\n       The American people recognize these problems and are \n     increasingly concerned: A Gallup poll released December 12, \n     1995 shows that 94 percent of Americans view illegal drug use \n     as either a ``crisis'' or a ``very serious problem.'' Their \n     concern, which I share, underscores the danger of \n     compromising our struggle against the drug trade. I look \n     forward to addressing the issues raised in this report in \n     future hearings of the United States Senate Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n\n                                overview\n\n       For its first eight months in office, the Clinton \n     Administration's approach to the drug issue could best be \n     described as benign neglect. Then, in September 1993, the \n     Administration announced a new approach to drug policy, \n     promising to ``reinvent our drug control programs'' and \n     ``move beyond ideological debates.'' The new Administration \n     policy deemphasized law enforcement and shifted away from \n     interdiction, while promising dividends from treating hard-\n     core drug users.\n       Almost three years into the Administration, however, the \n     results of its early neglect, and subsequent policy \n     ``reinvention,'' are in. Drug use is up--dramatically so \n     among young people. Promised reductions in hard-core use--the \n     centerpiece of the Administration strategy--have failed to \n     materialize. New money to expand the nation's treatment \n     system has coincided with a projected decrease in treatment \n     ``slot.''\n       Law enforcement efforts, mean-while, are not keeping pace \n     with the kingpins who run the drug trade, whose resources and \n     technical sophistication are increasing yearly. Prosecutorial \n     efforts appear to have stumbled as well, with a 12 percent \n     decline in prosecutions over just two years.\n       Presidentially ordered interdiction cuts appear to have \n     resulted in an increased supply of drugs on American streets. \n     Illicit drugs are now available in greater quantities, at \n     higher purity, and at lower prices than ever before. The \n     Administration's strategy for coping with these problems is \n     predicated on a series of goals that one drug policy expert \n     described as ``merely an unprioritized list [that does \n     little] to direct policy.\n       Viewed together, these factors paint a disturbing picture \n     of inattention to a serious and growing national threat.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    Preliminary Estimates from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service\n\n\n                               highlights\n\n       The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a national \n     probability survey of hospitals with emergency departments \n     conducted annually by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \n     Services Administration (SAMHSA). The survey is designed to \n     collect data on emergency department episodes which are \n     directly related to the use of an illegal drug or non-medical \n     use of a legal drug. Analyses in this report focus primarily \n     on recent trends in drug-related episodes. Preliminary \n     estimates for the first half of 1995 are compared with data \n     from the first half of 1994. The major DAWN findings are:\n       In the first half of 1995, there were 279,100 drug-related \n     hospital emergency department episodes representing an \n     increase of 10 percent from the first half of 1994 (252,600).\n       An estimated 76,800 cocaine-related episodes were reported \n     in the first half of 1995 compared with 68,400 in the first \n     half of 1994, an increase of 12 percent.\n       Cocaine-related episodes rose by 21 percent (from 26,100 to \n     31,500) among persons aged 35 years and older between the \n     first half of 1994 and the first half of 1995. A 17 percent \n     increase was observed among blacks (from 36,200 to 42,500).\n       The number of heroin-related episodes increased by 27 \n     percent between the first half of 1994 and the first half of \n     1995 (from 30,000 to 38,100).\n       Between the first half of 1994 and the first half of 1995, \n     heroin-related episodes increased by 39 percent among whites \n     (from 10,800 to 15,000) and by 32 percent (from 16,100 to \n     21,100) among persons aged 35 years and older.\n       Marijuana/hashish-related episodes rose from 19,100 in the \n     first half of 1994 to 25,200 in the first half of 1995, a 32 \n     percent increase. Marijuana episodes usually occur in \n     combination with other substances, particularly alcohol and \n     cocaine.\n       The number of methamphetamine (speed)-related episodes \n     increased by 35 percent (from 7,800 to 10,600) between the \n     first half of 1994 and the first half of 1995.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       This report contains preliminary data for the first 6 \n     months of 1995 and final annual and semi-annual estimates of \n     drug-related emergency department episodes for 1988 through \n     1994, from the Drug Abuse Warning Network [DAWN], an ongoing \n     national survey of hospital emergency departments.\n       Since the early 1970's, DAWN has collected information on \n     patients seeking hospital emergency department treatment \n     related to their use of an illegal drug or the nonmedical use \n     of a legal drug. The survey provides data that describe the \n     impact of drug use on hospital emergency departments in the \n     United States. Data are collected by trained reporters--\n     nurses and other hospital personnel--who review medical \n     charts for indications--noted by hospital staff who treated \n     the patients--that drug use was the reason for the emergency \n     department visit. Thus, the accuracy of these reports depends \n     on the careful recording of this information by hospital \n     staff.\n       To be included in DAWN, the person presenting to the \n     emergency department must be aged 6 years and older and meet \n     all four of the following criteria:\n       The patient was treated in the hospital's emergency \n     department;\n       The patient's presenting problem was induced by or related \n     to drug use, regardless of when the drug ingestion occurred;\n       The case involved the nonmedical use of a legal drug or any \n     use of an illegal drug;\n       The patient's reason for taking the substance included one \n     of the following: (1) dependence, (2) suicide attempt or \n     gesture, or (3) psychic effects.\n       Hospitals eligible for DAWN are non-Federal, short-stay \n     general hospitals that have a 24-hour emergency department. \n     Since 1988, the DAWN emergency department data have been \n     collected from a representative sample of these hospitals \n     located throughout the coterminous United States, including \n     21 oversampled metropolitan areas. The data from this sample \n     are used to generate estimates of the total number of \n     emergency department drug episodes and drug mentions in all \n     such hospitals.\n       Recently, SAMHSA conducted a thorough review of the \n     computer programs which produces the DAWN estimates. As a \n     result, corrections were made to the 1993 estimates that had \n     been previously released. Estimated presented in the last \n     DAWN release (Advance Report Number 11 ``Preliminary \n     Estimates from the DAWN--1994'') and in Annual Emergency \n     Department Data 1993 [Series 1, Number 13-A, DHHS Pub. No. \n     (SMA) 96-3080] and in this report are based on these \n     corrected programs. Because the impact on national estimates \n     was found to be small for 1992, those estimates were not \n     revised. However, the impact is significant for some \n     metropolitan areas and may be significant for selected drugs. \n     Thus, readers should use caution when comparing 1992 (and \n     earlier) estimates and 1993 (and later) estimates. See \n     Appendix I for details.\n       Estimates from DAWN are released periodically in reports \n     such as this Advance Report, and are published in Annual \n     Reports which contain more detailed tables and a complete \n     description of the DAWN methodology (reference: Annual \n     Emergency Department Data 1993. Series I, Number 13-A. DHHS \n     Pub l.

Watts.\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       The facts are simple. After more than a decade of decline, \n     teenage drug use is on the rise. Dramatically. Every survey, \n     every study of drug use in America reconfirms this depressing \n     finding.\n       What is even more disturbing is that attitudes among \n     teenagers about the dangers of drug use are also changing--\n     for the worse. After more than a decade of viewing drugs as \n     dangerous, a new generation increasingly sees no harm in \n     using drugs.\n       Just such a shift in attitudes engendered the last drug \n     epidemic in this country. The 1960s saw a significant \n     movement among many of the nation's intellectual leaders, \n     media gurus, and even some politicians that glorified drug \n     use. These attitudes influenced the thinking and decision \n     making of many of our young people. We are still living with \n     the consequences of the 1960s and 1970s attitudes in the form \n     of a long-term addict population and thousands of casualties, \n     including a staggering number of drug-addicted newborns and \n     many of our homeless.\n       The American public recoiled at the social pathologies \n     associated with the illegal drug epidemic then, and recent \n     polls indicate that they are just as concerned today that we \n     are about to repeat history because we failed to learn our \n     lesson. Despite the fact that we made major inroads on \n     reducing drug use in the 1980s, the press and many others \n     have helped to create the idea that nothing works and that \n     our only policy options are the decriminalization or outright \n     legalization of drugs.\n       The media turned their attention away from the drug issue \n     and have not returned to it in the last three years. The \n     Clinton Administration has downplayed the drug issue, \n     demoting it as a national priority and distancing the \n     President from it. The message that drug use was wrong was \n     de-emphasized, while interdiction and enforcement were \n     downplayed in order to concentrate on treatment. The result \n     has been to replace ``Just Say No'' with ``Just Say \n     Nothing.'' We are suffering the consequences.\n       On December 13, 1995, Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker \n     of the House Newt Gingrich convened a bicameral Task Force on \n     National Drug Policy to break the silence. They asked the \n     Task Force to make recommendations on how Congress might, as \n     it has many times in the past, put drugs back on the national \n     agenda. This report is the result of the Task Force's \n     efforts. It reflects the results of town meetings, \n     discussions with experts, and meetings with leading treatment \n     and prevention organizations. This report represents a \n     beginning of effort not the conclusion.\n       The Task Force's first and most important recommendation \n     calls for a serious national drug strategy. Recent \n     Administration strategies have been thin and they have \n     arguably failed to meet the clear statutory obligation that \n     specific and measurable objectives be included. Our national \n     strategy is incomplete and has focused efforts in areas that \n     have not worked. We need a more serious effort.\n       Such a strategy does not have to re-invent the wheel. It \n     does need to do the right things with the right stuff. This \n     means a focus on prevention, law enforcement, and \n     interdiction. It means presidential leadership within the \n     Executive Branch and at large. It involves congressional \n     oversight of programs and support to effective, well-managed \n     efforts. It means a program that adds substance to rhetoric \n     and matches ends to means in a sustainable effort.\n       A reinvigorated national drug strategy needs to focus on \n     five major elements:\n       1. We need a sound interdiction strategy that employs our \n     resources in the transit zone, in the source countries of \n     Latin America, and near the borders to stop the flow of \n     illegal drugs. This means renewed efforts at US Customs, DEA, \n     INS, DoD, and the Coast Guard to identify the sources, \n     methods, and individuals involved in trafficking and going \n     after them and their assets.\n       2. A renewed commitment to the drug effort requires a \n     serious international component that increases international \n     commitment to the full range of counter-drug activities. \n     These must involve efforts to prevent money laundering; to \n     develop common banking practices that prevent safe havens; \n     serious commitments to impose sanctions on countries that \n     fail to meet standards of cooperation; efforts to ensure \n     proper controls over precursor chemicals; and an \n     international convention on organized crime that develops \n     common approaches for targeting the main international \n     criminal organizations, their leaders and assets.\n       3. US national drug strategy should also take steps to \n     ensure that drug laws are effectively enforced, particularly \n     that there be truth in sentencing for rug trafficking and \n     drug-related violent crimes.\n       4. Prevention and education are critical elements in a \n     renewed strategy. There needs to be greater coordination and \n     effective oversight of Federal prevention and education \n     programs, which should involve the integration of disparate \n     drug programs in HHS, DoJ, and elsewhere under one authority. \n     This more integrated approach should focus on empowering \n     local communities and families, and must develop more \n     effective evaluation programs to determine which delivery \n     mechanisms are the best.\n       5. Treatment must remain an important element to any \n     strategy, but more needs to be done to eliminate duplication \n     and waste. A renewed strategy needs to look at establishing \n     more effective evaluation techniques to determine which \n     treatment programs are the most successful. Accountability \n     must be a key element in our programs.\n       We also need to look at the role of religious institutions \n     in our efforts to combat drug use. America cannot ignore the \n     link between our growing drug problem and the increase in \n     moral poverty in our lives.\n       The members of the Task Force also note that even the best \n     strategy in the world is worth no more than the effort spent \n     on turning it into reality. Thus, the Administration and \n     Congress have a responsibility to develop and implement \n     sustained and sustainable programs. An effective effort, \n     however, must go beyond what the Executive and Congress can \n     do. A true national effort must involve parents, families, \n     schools, religious institutions, local and state governments, \n     civic groups, and the private sector.\n       Finally, the Task Force members note that many of our \n     current social pathologies, in addition to drug use, arise \n     from causes directly related to a climate that disparages \n     essential moral and ethical principles of personal behavior. \n     Out of the best of intentions, we have pursued policies that \n     have replaced a sense of personal responsibility with \n     conscienceless self-esteem. In doing so, we have belittled \n     traditional family virtues and encouraged a cheapening of \n     social discourse. Our public places have become threatening \n     to decent people because of misplaced tolerance for \n     aggression and public incivility. Many of our children are \n     now having children, born out of wedlock into lives of \n     meanness and violence.\n       In calling for a recommitment to sustained, coherent \n     efforts against drugs, the Task Force members recognize that \n     this effort is part of a larger struggle for the soul our \n     young people and our future. We reject the counsels of \n     despair that say that nothing can be done. That our only \n     recourse is to declare surrender and legalize drugs. We \n     recognize that the drug problem is a generational one. Every \n     year the country produces a new platoon of young people who \n     must be guided to responsible adulthood. A continuing, vital \n     anti-drug message sustained by meaningful prevention, law \n     enforcement and interdiction programs is part of the \n     responsibility our generation has to the next.

Since 1992 the \n     proportion using any illicit drugs in the prior 12 months has \n     risen by nearly two-thirds among 10th-graders (from 20 \n     percent to 33 percent) and by nearly half among 12th-graders \n     (from 27 to 39 percent.)\n       The findings are from the Monitoring the Future Study, a \n     series of annual surveys of some 50,000 students in over 400 \n     public and private secondary schools nationwide. The U-M \n     investigators who have directed the study for the 21 years of \n     its existence are social scientists Lloyd Johnston, Jerald \n     Dachman and Patrick C. Malley--all faculty at the U-M's \n     Survey Research Center. The work is supported by the National \n     Institute on Drug Abuse, one of the National Institutes of \n     Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n       In 1995, marijuana use, in particular, continued the strong \n     resurgence that began in the early 1990's, with increased use \n     at all three grade levels. Among eighth-graders, annual \n     prevalence (i.e., the proportion reporting any use in the 12 \n     months prior to the survey) has risen to two-and-one-half \n     times its level in 1991, from 6 percent in 1991 to 16 percent \n     in 1995. Among 10th-graders, annual prevalence has nearly \n     doubled from the low point in use in 1992 of 15 percent to 29 \n     percent in 1995; among 12th-graders annual prevalence has \n     increased by more than half, from the low point of 22 percent \n     in 1992 to 35 percent in 1995.\n       ``Of particular concern in the continuing rise in daily \n     marijuana use,'' observes Johnston. Nearly one in 20 (4.6 \n     percent) of today's high school seniors is a current daily \n     marijuana user, and roughly one in every 35 10th-graders (2.8 \n     percent). Fewer than one in a hundred eight-graders use at \n     that level (0.8 percent). These rates have risen sharply as \n     overall marijuana use has increased.\n       The investigators found that while marijuana use has shown \n     the sharpest increase, the use of a number of other illicit \n     drugs, including LSD, hallucinogens other than LSD, \n     amphetamines, stimulants, and inhalants, has also continued \n     to drift upward.\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\n       The use of LSD continued to rise in all three grade levels \n     in 1995, continuing longer-term increases that began at least \n     as far back as 1991. The proportions reporting and LSD use in \n     the 12 months prior to the 1995 survey were 3 percent, 7 \n     percent, and 8 percent for eighth-, 10th-, and 12th-graders, \n     respectively.\n       Hallucinogens other than LSD, taken as a class, showed \n     smaller increases in 1995 at all three grade levels. The \n     annual prevalence rates for eighth-, 10th-, and 12th-graders \n     are considerably lower than for LSD: 2 percent, 3 percent, \n     and 4 percent, respectively.\n       The longer-term rise in the use of amphetamine stimulants \n     continued in 1995 at the eighth- and 10th-grade levels, but \n     use leveled among 12th-graders. Annual prevalence rates are 9 \n     percent, 12 percent, and 9 percent for grades eight, 10, and \n     12, respectively.\n       The use of cocaine in any form continued a gradual upward \n     climb, though most of the one-year changes do not reach \n     statistical significance. The same is true for crack cocaine. \n     So far, at least, these increases have been very gradual. The \n     annual prevalence rates for use of cocaine in any form are \n     2.6 percent, 3.5 percent, and 4 percent for grades eight, 10, \n     and 12, respectively, while for crack use they are 1.6 \n     percent, 1.8 percent, and 2.1 percent.\n       Several other classes of illicit drugs also have been \n     showing very gradual increases since the early 1990s, \n     including tranquilizers and three drug classes reported only \n     for 12th-graders--barbiturates, ice (crystal \n     methamphetamine), and opiates other than heroin.\n       Questions about heroin use have been in the study from the \n     beginning and have generally shown low (and for many years \n     among 12th-graders, stable) rates of use. However, use began \n     to rise after 1991 among 10th- and 12-graders, and after 1993 \n     among eighth-graders, as well. There was a statistically \n     significant increase in annual heroin prevalence among \n     eighth-graders in 1994, and then among 12-graders in 1995. \n     All three grades showed some increase in both years. While \n     the annual prevalence rates for heroin remain quite low in \n     1995 compared to most other drugs, they are nevertheless two \n     to three times higher than they had been a few years ago. The \n     annual prevalence rates in 1995 are between 1.1 percent and \n     1.4 percent at all three grade levels.\n       The small increase in heroin use in 1994 led the \n     investigators to distinguish in half of the 1995 \n     questionnaires between two different methods for taking \n     heroin: with a needle and without a needle. Their hypothesis \n     was that non-injection forms of use (e.g., snorting or \n     smoking) may be accounting for the rise in overall use. \n     Consistent with this hypothesis, in 1995 a large proportion \n     of those reporting heroin use indicated that at least some of \n     their use involved a non-injection method of administration \n     (63 percent, 75 percent, and 89 percent of the past-year \n     heroin users in grades eight, 10, and 12, respectively) \n     Further, a substantial proportion indicated using heroin only \n     in a non-injectable form (32 percent, 45 percent, and 57 \n     percent of the past-year heroin users for grades eight, 10, \n     and 12, respectively).\n       ``Obviously this is not a runaway epidemic among teens, but \n     it should give rise to some caution,'' Johnston comments. \n     ``Many of these young users may be under the misconception \n     that they cannot become addicted to heroin if they use it in \n     a non-injectable form. The fact is that they can. In \n     Southeast Asia and other parts of the world there are many \n     thousands of opium smokers who are heavily addicted, and \n     heroin is simply a powerful derivative of opium.\n       ``While these levels of illicit drug use are certainly \n     reason for concern,'' observes Johnston, ``it should be noted \n     that they are still well below the peak levels attained in \n     the late 1970s. We are in a relapse phase in the longer-term \n     epidemic, if you will, but it is certainly not something over \n     which society is powerless. Our great progress in the past at \n     lowering the rates of illicit drug use among our young people \n     is proof of that.'' To illustrate, between 1979 and 1992, the \n     proportion of 12th-graders reporting using any illicit drug \n     in the 12 months prior to the survey fell by half, from 54 \n     percent to 27 percent.\n       Alcohol use among American secondary students generally has \n     remained fairly stable in the past few years, though at rates \n     which most adults would probably consider to be unacceptably \n     high. (This remains true in 1995, although there has been \n     some small increase among 12th-graders over the past two \n     years.) In 1995 the proportions of students having five or \n     more drinks in a row during the two weeks preceding the \n     survey were 15 percent, 24 percent, and 30 percent for the \n     eighth-, 10th-, and 12th-graders, respectively.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n    [From the Backgrounder, the Heritage Foundation, July 12, 1996]\n\n  The Clinton Administration's Continuing Retreat in the War on Drugs\n\n               (By John P. Walters and James F.X. O'Gara)\n\n\n                               Highlights\n\n       The Clinton Administration has a poor record in fighting \n     the war on drugs. Interdiction efforts and prosecution for \n     illegal drugs are down, illegal drug usage and emergency room \n     admissions are up. Part of the problem has been a failure in \n     personnel management: the inability or unwillingness to \n     appoint effective leaders in key positions to articulate and \n     enforce a strong anti-drug message, as well as inappropriate \n     reductions in staff at agencies dedicated to dealing with the \n     problem on the front lines.\n       The President must exercise leadership on this issue and \n     use his bully pulpit to send an unambiguous anti-drug \n     message. Members of Congress also need to focus federal \n     efforts on law enforcement and interdiction programs that \n     work, and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a \n     track record of success. One way Congress can do this is to \n     allow funding for drug counseling and drug rehabilitation \n     programs provided by religious organizations.\n       America's illegal drug problem is complex and presents a \n     special challenge for policymakers in Congress and the White \n     House. But the complexity and the difficulty of the issue are \n     no excuse for ineffective policy and a lack of serious \n     effort.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The Clinton Administration continues to retreat in the war \n     on drugs. After a decade of consistent progress during the \n     Reagan and Bush Administrations, almost every available \n     indicator today shows the United States is losing--some would \n     say surrendering--in the prolonged struggle against illegal \n     drugs. Consider the evidence:\n       Since President Clinton took office, the number of 12-to-\n     17-years-olds using marijuana has almost doubled--2.9 million \n     compared with the 1992 level of 1.6 million.\\1\\ One in three \n     high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 48.4 percent of \n     the Class of 1995 had tried drugs by graduation day.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       LSD use has reached the highest rate since record-keeping \n     started in 1975. Fully 11.7 percent of the Class of 1995 had \n     tried it at least once.\\3\\\n       The number of cocaine-and heroin-related emergency room \n     admissions has jumped to historic levels. In the first half \n     of 1995, cocaine-related emergency room cases were 65 percent \n     above the level in the first half of 1991. Heroin admissions \n     soared 120 percent over the same period.\\4\\\n       Methamphetamine use has turned into a major problem, \n     particularly in the Western United States. In the first half \n     of 1995, meth-related emergency room cases were up by 321 \n     percent compared with the first half of 1991.\\5\\\n       While there are many different reasons for this \n     deterioration in America's resistance to illegal drugs, part \n     of the explanation is a failure in federal policy. President \n     Clinton and his Administration have demonstrated little \n     leadership on the issue and have failed to send out an \n     unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans. The \n     President's personnel appointments in this area have ranged \n     from the virtually invisible, as in the case of former ``drug \n     czar'' Lee Brown, to the embarrassing, as in the case of Dr. \n     Joycelyn Elders, former Surgeon General of the United States. \n     Staffing at the Office of National Drug Control Policy was \n     cut by 80 percent--from 147 to 25. Moreover, although the \n     President's election year budget reverses this cut and \n     requests major increases for drug law enforcement, his FY \n     1995 request would have eliminated 621 drug enforcement \n     positions.\n       The Clinton Administration's policy initiatives have been \n     similarly ineffectual, especially their focus on hard core \n     drug users at the expense of stronger law enforcement and \n     interdiction. The evidence is in: Federal illegal drug \n     caseloads fell by 10.3 percent from FY 1992 to FY 1995; the \n     government-wide interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent \n     since 1993; the impact of interdiction programs has dropped \n     off sharply; and drug-related hospital emergency room \n     admissions have hit record levels.\n       Instead of pursuing ineffectual anti-drug policies and \n     giving the impression that curbing drug use is not a \n     priority, the President and Congress should demonstrate \n     leadership in this deadly contest. If the United States is \n     serious about combating the infiltration of illegal drugs \n     across America's borders and into the nation's cities, towns, \n     neighborhoods, and schools, several steps need to be taken:\n       The President must use the ``bully pulpit'' of his office \n     to send out a clear message that drug use is unacceptable.\n       American must assist its allies in Latin America and \n     elsewhere in their efforts to take on the drug cartels.\n       The President must propose budgetary, personnel, and policy \n     initiatives that make it absolutely clear that Washington \n     means business in curbing the flow of drugs into America.\n       Congress should pass legislation to close loopholes that \n     result in excessively lenient sentences for marijuana \n     smugglers.\n       Congress should continue to block the United States \n     Sentencing Commission's proposals to lower sentences for \n     crack cocaine dealers.\n       Washington must get serious about promoting rehabilitation \n     that works, such as religion-based programs, instead of \n     simply funding programs that promise to rehabilitate drug \n     addicts and fail to deliver. Congress should re-evaluate all \n     treatment programs carefully. The basis of federal funding \n     for drug rehabilitation should be a clear track record of \n     success.\n       America succeeded in reducing the rate of drug use, \n     especially among vulnerable teenagers, in the 1980s because \n     local efforts were reinforced by a serious program of law \n     enforcement, interdiction, and hard-headed demand reduction \n     policies, and because the Reagan and Bush Administrations \n     made it very clear that they were determined to win the war \n     against drugs. Unfortunately, the\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\n     Clinton Administration has adopted a very different posture, \n     and America is now losing the war.\n\n\n                       the failure of leadership\n\n       The illegal drug problem is admittedly complex, but \n     complexity is no excuse for inaction. President Clinton began \n     derailing the successful approaches of prior administrations \n     from the earliest days of his presidency. After promising to \n     ``reinvent our drug control programs'' and ``move beyond \n     ideological debates,'' the President announced a new approach \n     to drug policy, de-emphasizing law enforcement and effecting \n     a ``controlled shift'' away from interdiction. More \n     important, in a message to Congress, he promised to ``change \n     the focus of drug policy by targeting chronic, hardcore drug \n     users.'' \\6\\ This ineffectual policy--the latest \n     manifestation of the liberals' commitment to a ``therapeutic \n     state'' in which government serves as the agent of personal \n     rehabilitation--seems to have been rejected even by the \n     President's new drug czar. General Barry McCaffrey, who has \n     moved to elevate the profile of prevention programs.\n       Cuts in the interdiction system and the dismantling of \n     other programs with records of success have been accompanied \n     by the increased availability of drugs. Ironically, the \n     Clinton drug policy has been most harmful to its intended \n     beneficiaries--the very hard-core drug addicts who are \n     cycling through emergency rooms at record rates.\n       The President's lack of visibility on the drug issue has \n     drawn criticism from prominent congressional supporters of \n     drug control programs, including leading Democrats in the \n     House and Senate. Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) admits he has \n     ``been openly critical of this President's silence.''\\7\\ And \n     Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) has gone so far as to \n     declare, ``I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have \n     never, never, never found any Administration that been so \n     silent on this great challenge to the American people.''\\8\\\n       In fact, since taking office, President Clinton has been \n     significantly engaged in only one aspect of the drug \n     problem--drugs in schools, which arguably is not even the \n     federal government's responsibility. In June 1995, Clinton \n     promised to veto any attempt by the 104th Congress to cut the \n     Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, which \n     Congress had evaluated and found to be ineffective. Bob \n     Peterson, former Michigan drug czar, described the program as \n     a ``slush fund,'' and even former ONDCP Director Lee Brown \n     acknowledged ``abuses of the program'' in testimony before a \n     House subcommittee.\\9\\''\n       The Disturbing Change in the Trends. During the 1980s and \n     early 1990s, the United States experienced dramatic \n     reductions in casual drug use--reductions that were won \n     through increased penalties, strong presidential leadership, \n     and a clear national anti-drug message. Beyond the \n     substantial investment of resources, engaged commanders in \n     chief used the bully pulpit to change attitudes. Because \n     Ronald Reagan and George Bush visibly involved themselves in \n     the effort to combat illegal drugs, they helped rescue much \n     of a generation. Overall, casual drug use was cut by more \n     than half between 1977 and 1992. Casual cocaine use fell by \n     79 percent, while monthly use fell from 2.9 million users in \n     1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.\\10\\ Strong presidential \n     leadership had tangible effects.\n       Against this backdrop of accomplishment, Bill Clinton \n     promised to get even tougher than his predecessors. Indeed, \n     while campaigning for the presidency, then-Governor Clinton \n     appeared to take an even harder line on illegal drugs than \n     Bush, declaring that ``President Bush hasn't fought a real \n     war on crime and drugs . . . [and] I will.'' On the link \n     between drugs and crime, Clinton said, ``We have a national \n     problem on our hands that requires a tough national \n     response.''\\11\\\n       Despite the tough rhetoric, however, the President's \n     performance has been disappointing. Perhaps the first solid \n     indication that rhetoric and reality would not fit neatly in \n     the same policy box was the appointment of Dr. Joycelyn \n     Elders of Arkansas as Surgeon General of the United States. \n     Dr. Elders, among other things, offered the taxpayers the \n     tantalizing theory that legalization of drugs might \n     ``markedly reduce our crime rate'' without increasing drug \n     use.\\12\\ As for the President himself, his image of \n     rhetorical toughness was compromised on occasion by remarks \n     that could at best be described as indifferent, at worst as \n     flippant.\\13\\\n\n\n                      downgrading the war on drugs\n\n       The President's ill-considered public words have been \n     accompanied by a reduction in tangible resources and effort. \n     Within weeks of taking office, the Clinton Administration \n     announced that it would slash the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy staff from 147 to 25. The President made the \n     Director of the Office a member of the Cabinet, but the move \n     was empty symbolism. This became painfully evident when his \n     new Director, former New York City Police Commissioner Lee P. \n     Brown, was observed to be virtually invisible during his two-\n     and-one-half-year tenure. President Bush's Drug Policy \n     Director, William Bennett, told Congress that the Clinton \n     Administration cuts essentially would relegate the new \n     Director to the position of an office clerk.\\14\\\n       Cuts in the drug czar's office prefigured much larger cuts \n     in federal enforcement and interdiction agencies. The \n     Administration's fiscal 1995 budget, for example, proposed to \n     slash 621 drug enforcement positions from the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS), Customs Service, FBI, and Coast \n     Guard.\\15\\ The DEA, America's only law enforcement agency \n     dedicated exclusively to fighting the drug trade, lost 227 \n     agent positions between September 1992 and September 1995--\n     more than 6 percent of its agent force.\n       Declining Caseloads. Cuts in law enforcement paralleled \n     reduced drug case filings. The Administrative Office of the \n     U.S. Courts registered a 10.3 percent reduction in federal \n     case filings between FY 1992 and FY 1995, and the total \n     number of defendants indicted in these cases declined by 8.5 \n     percent. The number of federal drug cases refused for \n     prosecution increased by 18.6 percent over the same period as \n     U.S. Attorneys pursued more investigations into health-care \n     fraud and other areas deemed to be of greater priority than \n     combating illegal drugs.\n       In an April 26, 1995, letter to Senate Judiciary Committee \n     Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT), then-Drug Policy Director Lee \n     Brown attributed the ``troubling'' decline in prosecutions to \n     ``the policies of the new U.S. Attorneys who de-emphasized \n     prosecution of small-scale drug offenders.'' Director Brown \n     also quoted the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to \n     the effect that the change had been ``consistent with DOJ \n     policy''.\n       Despite the abundance of data confirming the declining \n     trend in illegal drug prosecutions, Clinton Administration \n     officials have cited different figures, compiled by the \n     Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to suggest that case \n     filings and defendants prosecuted actually rose 12.9 and 12.1 \n     percent, respectively, between fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995. \n     But even according to these figures, the number of drug \n     defendants prosecuted dropped for the three years prior to \n     1995, and remains 5.2 percent below the FY 1992 level.\\16\\\n       In a textbook illustration of the laxness of Clinton \n     Administration drug policy, the Los Angeles Times revealed on \n     May 12, 1996, that hundreds of marijuana smugglers ``have \n     been allowed to go free after U.S. authorities arrested them \n     with substantial quantities of drugs at ports of entry in \n     California.'' \\17\\ Attorney General Janet Reno objected to \n     the article's claims, noting that the individuals in question \n     are ``punished'' by having their border crossing cards \n     confiscated. Ms. Reno added that prosecution may be \n     ``deferred'' only if five mitigating factors are present, a \n     claim that elicited this reaction from Bush Administration \n     Drug Enforcement Administration head Robert C. Bonner:\n       Reno claims that only Mexican nationals qualify under the \n     leniency policy. This results in two standards of justice. \n     U.S. citizens are prosecuted, but Mexican nationals get a \n     free ride to Mexico.\n       Another criterion is being caught with under 125 pounds of \n     marijuana. So, if you are smuggling ``only'' 100 pounds, with \n     a wholesale value of over $100,000, you meet one of the \n     criteria.\n       Now, Reno also says that there must also be ``insufficient \n     evidence'' of knowledge and intent, but, of course, no one \n     should be prosecuted, regardless of citizenship or quantity, \n     if evidence of knowledge and intent are not present.\\18\\\n       Dropping the Safeguards. The Clinton Administration began \n     to reduce America's drug interdiction efforts within a year \n     of the inaugural. On November 3, 1993, against the vehement \n     objections of senior Coast Guard officers, the National \n     Security Council issued a classified presidential memorandum \n     dictating a ``controlled shift'' of interdiction assets to \n     other functions. At the same time, flight hours in the so-\n     called ``transit zone'' between the United States and South \n     America were cut by 50 percent, many interdiction aircraft \n     and helicopters were put into mothballs, ship ``steaming \n     days'' were cut by a third, and Department of Defense \n     detection and monitoring budgets were reduced by more than \n     half. Controlling for inflation, the aggregate government-\n     wide drug interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent since \n     the last year of the Bush Administration.\\19\\\n       The impact of these cuts was almost immediate: Between 1993 \n     and 1994, U.S. interdiction forces experienced a 47 percent \n     drop in their ability to stop drug shipments from Latin \n     America. Cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the \n     Coast Guard fell by 70 percent and 71 percent, respectively, \n     during the same period.\\20\\ Overall interdiction \n     effectiveness has dropped by a cumulative 64 percent between \n     1993 and 1996.\\21\\\n       Some, including General McCaffrey, have attempted to argue, \n     against the evidence, that this reduced effectiveness was the \n     result of changing trafficker routes, not vastly diminished \n     levels of national effort. This argument is refuted by an \n     interdiction study commissioned by the Clinton Administration \n     itself. The study, performed for the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy by the EBR Corporation, using conservative \n     assumptions, showed that restoring $500 million in assets to \n     the transit zone could cause seizures, jettisons, and \n     mission-aborts totaling 130 tons of cocaine per year. In \n     round terms, this means that restoring half the assets cut by \n     the Clinton Administration could result in the seizure or \n     disruption of more than the entire amount of cocaine seized \n     domestically every year.\n       Stimulating Demand. Cuts in interdiction and law \n     enforcement have had additional consequences that should have \n     been predictable to anyone with even a modicum of \n     understanding of the basic economic laws of supply and \n     demand. Between 1993 and 1994--the first year of the \n     ``controlled shift'' away\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\n     from interdiction--the retail price of a gram of cocaine \n     dropped from $123 to $104. Two years later, the price was \n     still a low $107 per gram. Heroin prices have fallen even \n     more sharply, from $1,647 per pure gram in 1992 to $966 per \n     gram in February 1996.\\22\\ The increased availability of such \n     relatively cheap drugs has helped drive hard-core drug use--\n     as reflected in emergency room admissions--to record levels.\n       While most drugs are produced in inaccessible regions \n     overseas, limiting the impact of U.S.-sponsored eradication \n     programs, the bulk of the marijuana consumed in the United \n     States is produced domestically. Domestic marijuana \n     eradication under the Bush Administration was highly \n     successful--so successful, in fact, that marijuana became \n     more expensive, ounce for ounce, than gold. Hawaiian \n     producers were forced to import marijuana to satisfy local \n     demand for the first time in recent history.\n       The Clinton Administration, however, has deemphasized \n     marijuana eradication. There has been a 59 percent reduction \n     in cultivated plants destroyed since 1992.\\23\\ The drug \n     budget of the U.S. Park Service has been cut 22 percent from \n     the FY 1992 level,\\24\\ resulting in a 47 percent reduction in \n     plants eradicated by the Park Service. Once again, increases \n     in supply have fueled demand (use by 8th graders has \n     increased 184 percent since 1992) and caused prices to drop \n     (marijuana prices are at the lowest level in eight years).\n       The ubiquitous availability of illegal drugs--de facto \n     legalization--is confirmed by the Administration's own data. \n     According to the latest White House report on drug use,\\25\\ \n     heroin is now so cheap and pure that it has ``driven new \n     demand and drawn some former addicts back into use.'' \n     Meanwhile, the availability of cocaine and crack is described \n     as ``high,'' and marijuana is ``plentiful and potent'' and \n     ``widely available'' in all areas of the country except \n     California.\n       By making drugs more expensive, aggressive interdiction and \n     law enforcement efforts reduce use among particularly \n     vulnerable inner-city populations by forcing addicts to spend \n     their limited disposable income on a smaller quantity of \n     drugs.\\26\\ A cocaine addict named ``Joe,'' interviewed for a \n     book \\27\\ on the impact of cocaine, describes the phenomenon: \n     ``What keeps you from dying is you run out of money.'' \n     Conversely, paring back supply reduction programs hits \n     hardest those who are most heavily addicted and least able to \n     resist drug use.\n       Rising Emergency Room Cases. This phenomenon is evident in \n     the record number of drug-related emergency room admissions \n     that have followed in the wake of the Clinton \n     Administration's cuts to enforcement and interdiction \n     programs. (It is instructive that these record increases have \n     occurred despite the Clinton strategy's stated concern for \n     hard-core addicts, the primary population captured by the \n     emergency room statistics.) Compared with the first half of \n     1994 (which was then the high water mark for drug-related \n     emergency room cases), cocaine-related emergencies have \n     increased 12 percent (from 68,400 to 76,800); heroin-related \n     episodes have risen 27 percent (from 30,000 to 38,100); \n     marijuana-related episodes have increased 32 percent (from \n     19,100 to 25,200); and methamphetamine cases have jumped by a \n     staggering 35 percent (from 7,800 to 10,600)\n       Hard-core addicts deserve access to treatment, but \n     experience teaches that the typical addict will cycle through \n     the treatment system several times over a period of years \n     before getting off drugs, with many never reaching that goal. \n     A 1994 RAND study found that only 13 percent of heavy cocaine \n     users who receive treatment are either non-users or light \n     users at the end of a year. The study also found that 20 \n     percent of heavy users continue to use drugs while in \n     treatment.\\28\\\n       Getting serious about hard-core drug use ultimately \n     requires America to do more to fight youthful drug use: While \n     hard-core users are mostly beyond the reach of drug treatment \n     professionals, today's young people can be dissuaded from \n     going down the road that leads to hard-core addiction. In \n     fact, those who reach age 21 without using drugs almost never \n     try them later in life. Conversely, drug users almost always \n     start young, and almost invariably by smoking marijuana.\\29\\\n       An About Face? With U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey's \n     appointment as the new point man on drugs, the President \n     indicated he was reversing his decision to gut ONDCP and \n     discarding his misguided strategy of targeting hard-core \n     users. The editors of The Washington Post called the change \n     an ``about face.'' President Clinton was able to capitalize \n     on the installation of a tough-minded general; White House \n     aide Rahm Emmanuel was candid enough to say that the changes \n     were ``what the President believes will help us improve on \n     our record.'' \\30\\\n       Given the Clinton Administration's previous track record, \n     however, it remains unclear whether Director McCaffrey's \n     appointment means a genuine change in course. His is a \n     managerial position that accords him little line authority, \n     and his policy accomplishments will depend largely on his \n     willingness and ability to take on the various empires of the \n     federal bureaucracy. This in turn will depend on the degree \n     to which he is supported by the President of the United \n     States.\n       Unfortunately, early indications suggest that Director \n     McCaffrey may be reticent to test the President's commitment \n     to an effective anti-drug strategy. For instance, McCaffrey \n     recently sided with the Department of State in supporting a \n     determination that Mexico had ``cooperated fully'' with the \n     United States on drug control matters, even though the head \n     of the DEA objected that the government of Mexico had not \n     done enough to warrant that designation. This determination \n     was made even though the Administration could have waived the \n     sanctions that typically accompany decertification.\n       This decision sounds a disturbing signal about the degree \n     of General McCaffrey's leverage on drug questions. The United \n     States imports 400 tons of cocaine annually, 70 percent of it \n     transshipped through Mexico. Yet Mexico's seizures have \n     slumped to roughly one-twentieth of the amount passing \n     through their country. Arrest figures are down significantly, \n     and the former president's brother, Raul Salinas, has been \n     arrested on suspicion of ``drug-related charges.'' Four \n     Mexican trafficking ``confederations,'' meanwhile, operate \n     with relative impunity. But President Clinton's statement \n     to Congress explained away Mexican inaction on the peso \n     crisis and declared weakly that President Zedillo's \n     administration has ``set the stage for action against the \n     major drug cartels in Mexico.'' \\31\\ For too long, the \n     U.S. has accepted at face value repeated Mexican promises \n     of future aggressive action against the drug trade. It is \n     time for such complacency to end.\n       McCaffrey also appears to have had little positive impact \n     on recent high-level appointments. For example, on June 12, \n     1996, Patricia M. McMahon was nominated to serve as his \n     Deputy Director for Demand Reduction, a post that requires \n     Senate confirmation. A former Clinton campaign worker with \n     little substantive background in drug policy, Ms. McMahon's \n     appointment to a lower-level position was criticized by the \n     Washington Post in the early days of the Clinton \n     Administration as ``an example of continued political \n     patronage.'' \\32\\ Her principal contribution to the White \n     House drug office was to serve as the political operative who \n     carried out the slashing of the staff by 80 percent at the \n     start of the Administration.\n\n\n                THE COMPONENTS OF A NEW ANTI-DRUG POLICY\n\n       The President and Congress can retake the initiative in the \n     continuing struggle against drug use and the agents of the \n     criminal network that is exporting poison into America's \n     neighborhoods. But this cannot happen without the full \n     leadership of the President and his Administration.\n       The Administration must take several decisive steps:\n       Use the bully pulpit. When President George Bush gave the \n     first national primetime address of his presidency, it was on \n     the drug issue. By doing this, he followed the example of \n     visible and emphatic national leadership set by President \n     Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. The national effort \n     against drugs--carried on by parents, young people, local \n     people, local religious leaders, neighbors, local law \n     enforcement, educators, medical personnel, and local \n     government officials--gains immeasurably from strong, visible \n     presidential support. But it is weakened considerably by the \n     perception of presidential indifference.\n       Do more in Latin America. Fighting drugs at the source \n     makes sense. Federal authorities ought to be going after the \n     beehive, not just the bees. Foreign programs are also cheap \n     and effective.\n       An example: America's chronically underfunded program in \n     Peru will cost just $16 million to run in FY 1996. But \n     targeting even that meager amount effectively can work. The \n     Peruvians have managed to shoot down or disable 20 trafficker \n     airplanes since March 1, 1995. Unfortunately Peruvian \n     President Fujimori's aggressive line on drugs actually caused \n     President Clinton to bar Peru from receiving radar tracking \n     data. That decision has badly damaged Peruvian-American \n     relations, but Fujimori has continued to work with the United \n     States, and much more can be done at very small cost. The \n     Peruvian air force currently uses obsolete A-37 jet trainers \n     from the 1950s. For $50 million, the United States could \n     equip the Peruvians with new tracker aircraft, improved \n     night-flyer gear, and spare parts. This is an opportunity to \n     save American lives by helping the Peruvians press their \n     attack on traffickers. In addition to helping countries like \n     Peru, the United States should make effective cooperation in \n     fighting drugs one of the most important requirements for \n     Latin nations seeking good diplomatic and economic relations.\n       Set more sensible budget priorities. The Department of \n     Defense today is allowed to spend only 0.3 percent of its \n     budget on preventing the inflow of drugs. The U.S. military \n     cannot solve the drug problem, but it can make a profound \n     contribution to cutting the flow of drugs through \n     interdiction. The budget needs to reflect this national \n     priority.\n       Reduce marijuana availability. The federal government \n     urgently needs to restore leadership to the fight against \n     marijuana production, trafficking, and use. Federal marijuana \n     penalties need to be stiffened, partly by eliminating the \n     loophole that allows marijuana smugglers to be treated far \n     more leniently than marijuana growers. Federal eradication \n     efforts need to be reinvigorated.\n       Block lower crack sentences. Last year, the United States \n     Sentencing Commission proposed steep reductions in sentences \n     for crack dealers. Those changes were blocked by statute. In \n     its 1997 amendments cycle, the Sentencing Commission should \n     be blocked, and the Commission should be barred from \n     proposing changes in criminal penalties\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\n     where Congress has established mandatory minimum sentences, \n     except in an advisory format that would require affirmative \n     congressional action before taking effect.\n       Stop undercutting those drug treatment programs that do \n     work. Taxpayers have heard the stories about waiting lists \n     for drug treatment. Waiting lists are not fiction--they do \n     exist. On the other hand, one program that rarely has waiting \n     lists in Mitch Rosenthal's well-regarded Phoenix House, a \n     tough program where addicts spend 18-24 months literally \n     learning to live new lives. Programs like Phoenix House have \n     a proven track record dating back to 1967. But they are \n     unpopular with addicts because, to quote one analyst, ``a \n     residential program with constricted freedom, rigorous rules, \n     and enforced separation from drugs is the last place most \n     addicts want to find themselves, at least initially.'' \\33\\ \n     Nevertheless these approaches work. Yet taxpayers today pay \n     billions of dollars on drug treatment that allows the addicts \n     to decide for themselves how rigorous and how long their \n     treatment will be. Not surprisingly, this arrangement does \n     not work very well.\n       In addition, while many faith-based treatment programs \n     report remarkable success with the addicted, their religious \n     character usually bars them from receiving government \n     treatment funds. In a break from current policy, \n     Representatives Jim Talent (R-MO) and J.C. Watts (R-OK) have \n     introduced a bill, the American Community Renewal Act of 1996 \n     (HR 3467), which would allow the neighborhood groups, \n     including religious institutions, the same access to federal \n     funds that is enjoyed by other drug treatment and counseling \n     facilities. States also would be able to contract with these \n     drug treatment centers. Discrimination against effective \n     religiously based programs should end. Taxpayer funding for \n     drug treatment should be tied strictly to results, \n     religiously based programs should be eligible for funding, \n     and addicts who seek publicly funded treatment should be \n     required to enter rigorous programs and face real sanctions \n     if they fail to complete them.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       The Clinton Administration has a poor record in fighting \n     the war on drugs. Interdiction efforts and prosecution for \n     illegal drugs are down, illegal drug usage and emergency room \n     admissions are up, and there has been an absence of credible \n     presidential leadership on this issue. Part of the problem \n     also has been a failure in personnel management: the \n     inability or unwillingness to appoint effective leaders in \n     key positions to articulate and enforce a strong anti-drug \n     message, as well as inappropriate reductions in staff at \n     agencies dedicated to dealing with the problem on the front \n     lines. With the appointment of General Barry McCaffrey \n     as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, \n     this situation may improve, although the McMahon \n     appointment is far from encouraging.\n       American taxpayers need and deserve presidential leadership \n     on this issue. Members of Congress also need to focus federal \n     efforts on law enforcement and interdiction programs that \n     work, and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a \n     track record of success. One way Congress can do this is to \n     allow funding for drug counseling and drug rehabilitation \n     programs provided by religious organizations. Congress and \n     the states also should undertake a tough re-evaluation of \n     existing grant recipients to make sure that funding is going \n     to programs that work best in reducing dependency on illegal \n     drugs.\n       America's illegal drug problem is complex and presents a \n     special challenge for policymakers in Congress and the White \n     House. But the complexity and the difficulty of the issue are \n     no excuse for ineffective policy and a lack of serious \n     effort.\n       Prepared for the Heritage Foundation by John P.

I thank the distinguished Senator from Georgia for his \nleadership in this area, for being willing to get out here and talk \nabout these issues. I have been talking about them for a long time. I \nam disappointed we have not made more headway, but it certainly has not \nbeen for lack of effort on the part of our friend from Georgia.\n  I want to say in all honesty, we have to fight this war. We have to \ngive it everything we have. We have to have leadership at the top. We \ndo not have it right now but we are going to keep this pressure on \nuntil we get it, one way or the other.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Utah for, as he has \nacknowledged, long and diligent work in this arena. A lot of Americans \ncan be particularly thankful for that work.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I appreciate his remarks this morning. At this time I \nyield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \norganizing this time to speak about this incredibly important issue. \nWhile we do not intend this to be an issue that is partisan in nature, \nas the Senator from Utah, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, has just pointed out, although this is clearly a bipartisan \neffort, or should be, it is impossible to deal with the issue without, \nI think, criticizing some of the people who have been unable thus far, \nor unwilling, to fight this war on drugs, to level that criticism as a \nway of pointing out what needs to change.\n\n  I would not be so willing to do this if President Clinton had not \nmade this a partisan political issue in the first place. That is what \nangers me so much. We just saw the Senator from Utah, the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, point out that from\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n1980 to the end of 1992, during the time of Republican administrations, \ndrug use on all fronts had declined dramatically. In the Presidential \ncampaign of 1992, here is what then-candidate Bill Clinton had to say:\n\n       [President Bush] hasn't fought a real war on crime and \n     drugs. I will.\n\n  Maybe if he had not said that, maybe if he had not made that promise, \nI would not be so critical of him today for failing to keep that \npromise. But as the chart that Senator Hatch just showed us reveals, \nfrom the time that President Clinton took office, drug use among young \npeople in all of the categories increased. So you saw during the entire \ntime of the Reagan and Bush administrations drug use going down and \nthen, when President Clinton took office, drug use sharply going up. \nThat is why it angers me to go back and see statements like this during \nthe campaign 4 years ago, when he criticized President Bush for not \nbeing tough on drugs, and said he would fight the war on drugs. He has \nnot done it and that is why we are critical here today.\n  It is not to try to throw barbs at the President, but to try to get \nhim on board on this issue, because this is critical for the future of \nthe United States and for our kids. Specifically, when usage of hard \ndrugs among White House personnel was finally revealed in the media, \nafter having been denied by Presidential spokesmen, we get the kind of \nreaction that Senator Hatch just pointed out, coming from the White \nHouse, that suggested that using drugs is no big deal. It was Leon \nPanetta 2 years ago who attacked House Speaker Newt Gingrich for his \ncomment that the delay in the White House granting clearance to a large \ngroup of staffers might be in part due to drug use by some of the \nstaffers.\n  That was the information people had at the time, but it was not then \nconfirmed. Here is what Leon Panetta said:\n\n       We cannot do business here with a Speaker of the House who \n     is going to engage in these kind of unfounded allegations.\n\n  The people at the White House at that time knew those were not \nunfounded allegations. Now, 2 years later, the news accounts report \nthat in fact at least a dozen staffers were taken on board, over the \nobjection of the FBI and Secret Service because of their hard core drug \nuse. Now what do the spin meisters at the White House talk about? Of \ncourse they are no longer unfounded accusations. Now it is just the \nexcuse that, well, everyone was doing it. Press Secretary Mike McCurry:\n\n       I was a kid in the 1970's. You know, did I smoke a joint \n     from time to time? Of course, I did. And the FBI knows that, \n     and that was in my background file.\n\n  The ``of course, I did'' is what bothers so many of us. The White \nHouse is the ultimate bully pulpit in the United States. The tone set \nthere permeates our entire culture. Our young people look to the \nPresident for his leadership on issues, to set an example, to be a role \nmodel. When his chief spokesman tosses off his drug use with a mere \ncavalier ``of course, I did,'' inferring that everybody did, that \nsuggests it is behavior that is acceptable. It is against the law and \nit is not acceptable behavior.\n  So, when the people at the highest levels in the White House treat \nthe issue so cavalierly, is it no wonder the young people in our \ncountry, who are obviously susceptible to this kind of language, treat \nit cavalierly as well? Yet this is the same White House that is \nblasting Senator Dole for his comments that not necessarily everyone is \naddicted to tobacco use. It seems to me there is a gross double \nstandard here, at a minimum. But that at maximum, one might say, more \nimportant, for the young people in our country this administration has \nsquandered the assets that had been brought to bear in the war on \ndrugs, had squandered the success of the Bush and Reagan \nadministrations when drug use was brought substantially down.\n  Senator Hatch has pointed out many of the things that have occurred \nduring this administration, like the drug czar's office staff being cut \nmore than 80 percent. After a year of leaving the drug czar's office \nvacant, finally the President selected Lee Brown, who was only in \noffice for a few months. His major initiative was to have ``Big League \nChew'' bubble-gum removed from convenience store chains. It did not do \nmuch to fight the war on drugs.\n  Then he appointed as our Nation's top health official Joycelyn \nElders, who said ``[I] do feel we would markedly reduce our crime rate \nif drugs were legalized.'' In one sense I suppose if you remove all \nprohibitions on illegal activity, you reduce the illegal drug use rate, \nat least measured against what it was during the war on drugs, but that \nis obviously not the way to protect the future of America's children. \nParticularly since we understand that the use of drugs such as \nmarijuana leads to the use of much harder drugs. That is why the \nPresident's reduction in requests for funding from interdiction to law \nenforcement have not been welcomed by the Congress, and why the \nCongress has wanted to fund those programs at a higher level.\n  Just summarizing what Senator Hatch said a moment ago, with the \nreduction in the officers from FBI, INS, Customs Service and Coast \nGuard, they would have lost 621 drug enforcement agents had the \nCongress not put the funding back in. And he mentioned the fact we did \nnot train special agents of the DEA in 1993. But when the Congress has \nfinally insisted on increasing the drug interdiction effort, for \nexample in the bill we just dealt with last week, we get emphasis--\nindications from the White House that they will support those \nincreases. I hope that is true.\n  According to the Wall Street Journal, the Attorney General, Janet \nReno, ``announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum \nsentences for drug trafficking * * *.'' Statistics released by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts reveal that, although drug use \nis going up, the number of individuals prosecuted for Federal drug \nviolations is going down. That is what we have to change. This de facto \nstrategy of the administration in fighting drugs was to deemphasize \ninterdiction, law enforcement and prevention and concentrate on \ntreatment. Yet, as has been pointed out, treatment is not the answer to \nthis problem. It is only one small piece of the puzzle. And a 1994 \nstudy by the Rand Corp. found that 27 percent of hardcore drug users \ncontinued hardcore use while undergoing treatment. And fully 88 percent \nof them returned to hardcore drug use after treatment. So the \nrecidivism rate was very, very high.\n  Let me just hesitate here to make a point. In criticizing the \nadministration's efforts here, again I do not intend to be partisan. \nThere have been a lot of Democrats who have been equally critical. \nSenator Biden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nsaid:\n\n       This President is silent on the matter. He has failed to \n     speak.\n\n  Representative Charles Rangel, a Democrat from New York whose \ndistrict has a very serious problem in this regard said:\n\n       I've been in Congress for over two decades and I have \n     never, never, never seen a President who cares less about \n     this issue.\n\n  So I am not just speaking from the perspective of a Republican, Mr. \nPresident. I am speaking as someone who cares about our future and who \nhas noted it is people on both sides of the aisle who are deeply \ncommitted to fighting this war who are also critical of this \nadministration.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee pointed out that marijuana \nuse is up; that one in three high school seniors now uses marijuana. \nThat is an astounding statistic. Why is it important? Because, as I \nsaid a moment ago, according to surveys by the Center on Addiction and \nSubstance Abuse, 12- to 17-year-olds who use marijuana are 85 times \nmore likely to graduate to cocaine than those who don't use marijuana.\n  So those who argue that marijuana use, so-called ``soft drugs,'' are \nnot important are ignoring scientific evidence that almost all of the \npeople who use those kinds of drugs graduate to harder drugs. That is \nwhy it is so important to stop this drug use at that level.\n  What can we do to recapture the initiative on this war on drugs? \nFirst of all, on interdiction, the action we just took last week, we \nhave to see renewed efforts by Federal agencies responsible for \nfighting drugs to spend greater resources, identifying the sources, \nmethods and individuals involved in trafficking.\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\n  Enforcement I mentioned a moment ago. Drug prosecution under this \nadministration has decreased. Those violating our drug laws must be \nprosecuted, and we have to make sure those who are profiting from the \ndrug trade are severely punished.\n  Finally, education and prevention. Kids need to learn and be \nconstantly reminded that drugs are harmful, and that is where the \nPresident's bully pulpit comes in.\n  They laughed at President Reagan and his wife when they said that we \nshould ``just say no.'' I think they were making a big mistake. We know \nthe President has to say no.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds more from the Senator from \nGeorgia, since I know my time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield another minute to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. That will enable me to \nmake this final point.\n  We are doing our part in Congress to revitalize this war on drugs. We \njust passed the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill, which \nwill improve our enforcement and interdiction efforts. It increases the \nfunding substantially. I think, however, once we have done this, the \nPresident is going to have to help us regain the initiative by \ndemonstrating that the administration is just as concerned about this \neffort as is the Congress. Of course, another option is to elect a \nPresident who really seems to care about this effort. But that is \nanother matter.\n  Let me say in conclusion, this effort should be bipartisan. It has to \nbe coordinated. The President and the Congress have to join in the \neffort, and we have to convince the younger people in our country that \nthe trend of drug use that is now going up must be reversed if their \nfuture is going to be great and if the future of America is going to be \ngreat, because all Americans bear the cost of drug abuse through \nincreased crime and increased taxes to pay for welfare and other social \nprograms and all the other costs to society that can't be measured.\n  It is time to resume the drug war. America's future is at stake.\n  I commend the Senator from Georgia for taking this time so we can \nemphasize the issue and get on with this important effort.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Arizona \nwill stay with us for just a moment.\n  I would like to read an editorial that appeared in the Boston Globe \non Tuesday, July 23. It relates to his remarks. It quotes Speaker \nGingrich in December of 1994. He said on a television show:\n\n       I had a senior law enforcement official tell me that, in \n     his judgment, up to a quarter of the White House staff, when \n     they first came in, had used drugs in the last 4 or 5 years.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Now, that's very serious. I'm not making any allegation \n     about any individual person, but it's very clear that they \n     had huge problems.\n\n  It goes on. This editorial says:\n\n       Then the sky fell in. ``We cannot do business here with a \n     Speaker of the House who is going to engage in these kinds of \n     unfounded allegations,'' fumed Panetta. He lashed Gingrich \n     for behaving like an out-of-control talk show host, for \n     making an absolutely false accusation, for trafficking in \n     smear and innuendo.\n       George Stephanopoulos has labeled Gingrich \n     ``irresponsible.'' Hillary Clinton said, ``So unfair.'' Press \n     Secretary Dee Dee Myers called them ``reckless charges.''\n\n  McCarthyism was alluded to. That was the beginning of the \ndemonization of the Speaker. Let me ask this question of the Senator \nfrom Arizona. Don't you think these people owe him an apology?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am so glad that the Senator from Georgia \nhas asked that question, because now that this has been reported on in \nthe media 2 years after the fact and some people from the White House \nhave, apparently, acknowledged that there is truth to these \nallegations, I think that every one of the people who smeared House \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich not only owe him an apology--and it should be a \nvery direct and specific apology--for the comments that the Senator \nfrom Georgia just read, but they owe an apology to the American people, \nbecause they, in smearing him, suggested that he was lying, that he was \nnot telling the truth, that the allegations were unfounded, when, in \nfact, they either knew or should have known what was going on in the \nWhite House, why those clearances had not been granted. Therefore, it \nis they who were misleading the American public by suggesting that what \nhe said was untrue.\n  So I have been wondering for some time when we would receive an \napology, and I think it is as important that the House Speaker receive \nan apology.\n  I happened to see the Sunday morning talk show when Speaker Gingrich \nsaid what he said. I saw him say it, and I thought at the time, ``Boy, \nhe was certainly careful how he repeated that allegation because it was \nall over the news media.''\n  He was very careful in saying, ``Now, I'm not making allegations, \nthis is what a high-ranking official told me, and if it is true, it's \nvery bad.''\n  Well, all of the qualifications went out the window when all the \nWhite House pack dogs immediately attacked him the next day suggesting \nhe was the one who was some kind of wild accuser here.\n  That is why I think the Senator from Georgia hits the nail right on \nthe head when he suggests that each one of these people owes the \nSpeaker a very specific apology. And if I can go further and suggest \nthey should apologize for misleading the American people as well.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the Senator will yield.\n\n       On dozens of editorial pages--\n\n  I am quoting--\n\n     there were comparisons to the most infamous demon in American \n     history. The Georgia Republican's words, said Newsday, were \n     laced with the kind of innuendo which fueled McCarthy's witch \n     hunt. To Herblock, the Washington Post venerable cartoonist, \n     Gingrich was McCarthy, cruelly blackening reputations with a \n     broad brush.\n\n  I think there are a lot of people who owe the Speaker an apology. \nThis attack was very harmful to this gentleman, and you alluded to it. \nThere is no way that all of these people in the White House could not \nhave known about the problems they were having in getting White House \nclearance. I believe they not only owe him an apology, but they owe him \nan apology at the same level to which they leveled this attack: a \npublic apology from all of them, not just one of them on their behalf.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator from Georgia will yield for a moment, the \npoint here is not to extract an apology for the sake of an apology, but \nrather, I think, to make a larger point.\n  Clearly, when the Speaker of the House is vilified the way he was \nwithout good reason, and we know now incorrectly if not with animus, he \nis owed an apology. But the point of these attacks was to try to \ndistract attention away from the specific charge and the problem that \nwas being alluded to by the Speaker.\n  That is where I think these people owe an apology to the American \npublic, because they were trying to divert attention away from a \ncondition, a problem, and it is very much like the way the \nadministration has treated this drug war from the very beginning.\n  It is basically a nonwar, and that is why drug use has gone up during \nthis administration's tenure. They have to focus back on the fact that \nwhat they say matters. The way the President acts matters a great deal, \nespecially to the young people in this country.\n  He is the first really young new-generation President here. As a \nresult, I think young people really look to President Clinton because \nhe is younger than most of the Presidents have been in recent years. \nWhen they see him act in a relatively cavalier way, then they are going \nto pick up on that. That appears to be what is happening, if you look \nat the statistics.\n  So again, while it is important to apologize to the Speaker, because \nwhat they said about him was extraordinarily unfair and inaccurate, I \nthink it is more important, again, that they get back on track in \nfighting the war on drugs by apologizing to the country as a whole for \ntrying to distract attention from the problem in the White House, \ntrying to distract attention from what was going on here in their \ninadequate effort to fight the war on drugs and refocus attention on \nthe very, very difficult nature of this problem.\n  President Clinton has an extraordinarily great ability to be \npersuasive, to demonstrate that he cares about things. And if he were \nto mount the podium with the same sincerity that\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nNancy Reagan and Ronald Reagan did and George and Barbara Bush to tell \nthe young people of today why it is so destructive for them to begin \nthis path of doing drugs, I think he could be enormously helpful. He \ncould be so powerful in his appeal and reach to these young people.\n  So instead of obfuscating the issue and accusing others of making too \nbig a deal out of it, as they did with Speaker Gingrich, I think they \nought to try to focus on what they can do to help. It would be a \ntremendous benefit if they would do that. I thank the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9016-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9027-S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CULTIVATING THE FUTURE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a wise man once said that what is \nhonored in a society is cultivated there. In other words, what a \nsociety believes is important and respects, it will teach its children \nand demand in its public life. I have been concerned in the last few \ndays by what it seems to me that we are honoring in our society. And I \nam concerned because of that about what we may be cultivating for the \nfuture.\n  I am concerned about what we have learned in the past few days and \nweeks about the attitudes the Clinton White House has about security \nclearances and security procedures in general. I am also concerned \nabout drug use, respect for privacy, and regard for simple facts \nstraightforwardly presented. I am concerned about what attitudes on \nthese issues, coming from the Nation's first household, are \ncommunicating to the public. I am particularly troubled about the White \nHouse's seemingly cavalier attitude about drug use and about the \nmessage that this careless viewpoint is sending.\n  Based on reporting in the Washington Post, ``The Secret Service in \n1993 balked at granting permanent passes to about a dozen people in the \nClinton White House because of concerns about recent use of illegal \ndrugs that in some instances included crack cocaine or hallucinogens. . \n. .'' But this is not all. The problem was evidently so serious as to \nrequire the unprecedented step of establishing a special drug-testing \nprogram in the White House. We have heard that this involves only a few \npeople. But then we also heard from the same White House that there \nwere only a few unauthorized FBI files. That story had to be revised \nseveral times as the numbers grew. Perhaps that will not happen here, \nbut the numbers are not really the issue.\n  What is of concern is the principle. In the files case, one file \nimproperly obtained, illegally reviewed, and carelessly kept was too \nmany. In any normal operation, the person responsible for this chain of \nslipshod management would be identified, fired, and, if a crime was \ncommitted, prosecuted. In the present case, however, the White House \nnot only does not know who was responsible, they cannot or will not \nfigure out who hired him. Based on this White House's public assertions \nabout hiring practices in the world's most important household, Rosy \nthe Bag Lady could have moved locations from Lafayette Park into the \nWest Wing, gotten a White House pass, and set up shop with no one the \nwiser.\n  As in the files case, it is the principle that matters in the White \nHouse's attitude about drug use. It is what actions there say publicly \nabout what is honored and what should be cultivated. Perhaps it should \ncome as no surprise that a President who did not inhale should see no \nproblem in hiring known drug users to sit on the world's most visible \nfront porch. But what is of more concern than this peculiar tolerance \nis the response of the President's spokesman to the issue. Let me quote \nhis remarks. ``I was a kid in the 1970's,'' he said. ``You know, did I \nsmoke a joint from time to time?\n  Of course, I did.'' Of course? There is a lot of consequence in that \n``of course.'' As Mr. Bennett, the country's first drug czar noted, \nthat ``of course'' is very disturbing. Mr. Bennett asks a very \nimportant question: ``What exactly did Mr. McCurry mean by `of course'? \nThat every young person used drugs in the 1970's? Or that it was no big \ndeal?'' In either case, as Mr. Bennett notes, the President's spokesman \nis wrong. He not only has the facts wrong, he has now put the White \nHouse behind the notion that drugs are no big deal.\n  Mr. McCurry's words are very revealing. They are dismissive of the \nidea that drug use is of any serious concern. They indicate an \nindifference to the realities of drug use. And, for a White House whose \nclearest competency is in message management, it shows a remarkable \nignorance of the importance of using the bully pulpit of Presidency to \nsend a clear, antidrug message. We need to remind ourselves that Mr. \nMcCurry did not make these remarks in private. He is no babe in the \nwoods. He did not get trapped. He did not speak out thinking that the \nmicrophones were turned off. Mr. McCurry made these remarks to the \npress as the chief spokesman for the President of the United States. \nSay what you will, his remarks are now an indelible part of the public \nrecord. So too, are the White House's attitudes to drug use revealed \nhere.\n  I am sure that in the next few days we will have more clarifications \nabout the position. I am sure that these clarifications will include \nthe typical accusations that discussion of the issue at all is just \npartisan politics. But, what remains is a public demonstration about \nhow this White House thinks about drugs. It reflects a casualness about \nthe drug problem that is communicated to the public. It is a \ncommunication that, frankly, concerns me a great deal.\n  On a number of occasions I have raised my concern on this floor about \nthe dramatic rise in teenage drug abuse. If there are any of my \ncolleagues who have not acquainted themselves with the realities of \nwhat is happening with kids and drugs today, I urge them to take a look \nat the facts. I think that what they will find will disturb them. In \nbrief, by whatever standard you use or reporting system that we \ncurrently have to tell us about drug use, teenage use is on the rise.\n  In the last several years, after more than a decade of decline, we \nare seeing returning drug use that is wiping out all the gains that we \nhad made. What is just as alarming, teenage attitudes about the dangers \nof drug use are also changing for the worse. Today's kids see drugs as \nfar less of a problem than did kids just a few years ago. Even worse, \ndrug use today is starting even earlier. We are now seeing the problem \naffect 11 and 12 year olds. Unless you believe that drug legalization \nfor kids is a realistic option or a responsible policy, then you cannot \nignore what is happening under our very noses, in our homes, schools, \nbackyards, and front porches.\n  In this context, do you think that remarks like the President's or \nMr. McCurry's do not matter? Let us not kid ourselves about kids. What \nthe White House says publicly is one of the ways we communicate lessons \nabout what we honor and should cultivate. That the White House \nunderstands this is clear from what it has to say on other issues. On \nthis issue, however, the message is anything but clear.\n  In March of this year, I co-chaired a Senate-House Task Force on \nNational Drug Policy. Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich established the task \nforce to take a look at the problem and recommend solutions. The report \nfrom that effort documents not only the present trend in drug use among \nkids, but the policies or lack of policies by the Clinton \nadministration to deal with the problem. I invite all of my colleagues, \nthe press, and the public to take a look at what the task force \nlearned. It is sobering.\n  One of the essential findings of the report, which is hardly new, was \nthat the bully pulpit for sending messages about what is right and \nwrong, good and bad, must be central to any drug policy. As the report \nnotes, we must be consistent in our message. We must have words and \ndeeds that are complementary not contradictory.\n  Democrats and Republicans over the last several years, however, have \nrepeatedly noted that the administration, and particularly the \nPresident, have been virtually silent on the drug issue. The only \nserious pronouncements that anyone here or elsewhere likely remembers \nabout this administration's drug policy was the President's remark that \nhe didn't inhale. That and the repeated public statements by the \nSurgeon General of the United States calling for consideration of drug \nlegalization. Except for these less than inspiring remarks, the drug \nissue simply disappeared in the first\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\n3 years of the administration. Like the drug czar's office, it was \nbenched. For this administration, drug policy was not just the least \nvalued player. It was traded to a farm team and hustled out of town \nunder a blanket of silence.\n  Now, in an election year, when the drug use numbers are bad and \ngetting worse, we have seen a new public posture by the administration \non drugs. We have a new drug czar--more power to him--and we have had a \nfew presidential sound bites and backdrops. I am sure that none of \nthese actions have anything to do with politics. But, we have seen also \nother things that leave a more lasting impression, particularly in \nyoung minds. Particularly, what we have seen disseminated to the public \nis the knowledge that ``of course, I used drugs'' and ``I didn't \ninhale'' are the hallmarks of this White House. As Mr. Bennett noted, \npolicy follows attitude. It is not hard to understand the \nadministration's policies with attitudes like those coming from the \nWhite House.\n  Recently, a music group with the unlikely name of Smashing Pumpkins \nlost one of its lead performers to a drug overdose. In recent years, \nsuch deaths of celebrities have become a common occurrence, another \nreminder of the 1960's culture born again. So serious has the problem \nbecome that record companies and managers are looking to institute drug \nprograms to help prevent these losses. In the case of Smashing \nPumpkins, they fired one of the band members who was involved in drugs \nalong with the young man who died. Evidently, drug use in this case was \ngrounds for dismissal. I wish that this White House understood the \nmessage here. That tolerating drug use, even former drug use, sends a \ndangerous message.\n  If we learn from the bully pulpit of the Presidency about what we \nshould honor and cultivate in our national life, then I am concerned \nabout what recent events tell us. I am concerned that we seem to have \nreplaced ``Just Say No'' with a muddled message. I am concerned that \nthis garbled text is sending the wrong signals, is reinforcing the \nwrong attitudes. Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that calls for \nlegalization of drugs are now more vocal and well-financed than at any \ntime since the 1960's. It is perhaps why, we see initiatives on the \nballot in California and Arizona that would legalize marijuana. It is \nperhaps why one of the largest financiers of drug legalization is a \nWhite House confidante. It is perhaps not just coincidence that the \ndrugs-are-good-for-you message is back in movies, music, and on TV. It \nis perhaps why we see a White House where the Colombian drug lords can \nnumber employees as some of their former clients.\n  I worry about what we seem to be honoring and what we may cultivate \nas a consequence.\n  Mr. GORTON. Would the Senator from Georgia yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I certainly will be more than pleased to yield to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. It seems to me, Mr. President--and I ask for the comments \nof the Senator from Georgia on this--that during the course of this \nlast half-hour or so, there have been perhaps five different, but \nrelated, themes. I wonder if my understanding is accurate.\n  The first, and in a sense the most immediate, is the way in which the \nWhite House responds to any kind of criticism, very frequently with \nnasty personal attack.\n  The second, which is one step above that and perhaps triggers the \nfirst, is the indifference in the administration itself to the question \nof drugs and of security and the like, you know, by the people who \nserve the administration.\n  The third, it seems to me, is the drug policy of the administration. \nI think the Senator from Georgia has already spoken to that question--\nless money, fewer people, less attention.\n  The fourth is as the Senator from Arizona just said, the use or \nnonuse of the magnificent platform that any President of the United \nStates has to speak to matters which are of deep concern to the \nAmerican people or which create grave social problems or challenges to \nthe American people. And the question as to whether or not any \nparticular President pays any attention to that subject.\n  But I think each of those, in my view at least, leads to the final \nquestion. And that is, what impact is the plague of drugs imposing on \nthe American people? Is the use of illegal substances rising or falling \nat any given level? And particularly, is this use rising or falling \namong young people, first becoming conscious of the world around them? \nAnd is that increase in use--quite clearly that is the case at the \npresent time--attributable at least in part to what society, through \nits leaders, through its President, says or does not say, says or \nimplies by an action or nonaction in connection with this drug use?\n  I think if you start from No. 1, attacking anyone who attacks them, \nsecond, an indifference to personal health, security or drug use, \nthird, the amount of money and attention paid in budgets, fourth, the \nuse or more particularly the nonuse of that bully pulpit in the \nPresidency, that fifth and most important consequence is almost an \ninevitable consequence, is it not? Is it not very difficult to make the \ncase that these are unrelated phenomena, with the fact of increased \ndrug use, the fact of a more serious problem in society today? Is it \nnot connected with this indifference in money, in attitude, and the \nlike on the part of the executive leaders of our Nation?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, I commend the Senator from Washington in his \nusual fashion of framing issues so well. But I think there is no \nconclusion one could reach but that these five points you allude to are \ninextricably connected and have resulted in a new drug epidemic in the \nUnited States, period.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington, from my own point of view, I \nhave been surprised that a change in public policy, which occurred when \nthis administration took office, could result in these kinds of changes \nso quickly. I would have thought these changes might have taken a \ndecade to have the impact. It has been a revelation to me that within \nmonths you began to see a trend of less use of drugs turn completely \naround and now turn into something that is a devastating phenomenon in \nour country.\n  I will say one other thing and then go back to the Senator from \nWashington. On your fourth point, the use of the pulpit, so to speak, I \nwould say that is even more serious than has been characterized. Not \nonly has it not been used, but to the extent it has been used, it is \nthe wrong message.\n  First of all, there is too much silence. Second, we had an Attorney \nGeneral arguing for legalization in this administration. Third, we had \nstatements, like press secretary McCurry and the President himself when \nhe said, ``Well, I didn't inhale.'' These are all cavalier tones that \nsuggest a lack of seriousness about the issue. That is why I believe it \nis not just the trend lines have reversed, but they have dramatically \nreversed. And the damage is of epidemic proportions. And 12 years have \nvirtually been cashiered because of the link between these five points, \nbut particularly Nos. 4 and 5.\n  Mr. GORTON. I think the Senator from Georgia makes a good point. I \nwould like to share this reflection with him and hear his views on the \nsubject. I believe sometimes we have these problems by a misuse of \nterms. And in this connection, a few years back, when drug policy was a \nhigher order of priority, we had what was, I think, misnamed as a ``war \non drugs,'' sincerely carried out by men and women who felt that drugs \nwere a plague on our society creating a tremendous amount of crime, \nsocial dislocation, wasted lives. But the implication, when they used \nthat term, was that it somehow or other could have been won permanently \nand decisively.\n  I believe that we made the same mistake a generation ago when we \nbegan a war against poverty with the same implications. Just set up a \nfew programs and you will get rid of the circumstance. Perhaps, it has \noccurred to me, that this began because we have had truly wars where \nthey have a beginning, middle, and an end, whether it was World War II, \nat one level, or even a half-a-century-long cold war. It is over. We \nhave had a definitive triumph.\n\n  When one Presidential administration starts a war on poverty or, more \nparticularly in this case, a war on drugs, and then the next \nadministration discovers the real truth, that this is a struggle that \nbegins over again in the minds of every young person in the\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nfirst, second, third, or eighth grade and, in fact, has never \ndefinitively been won in the minds of an individual who may have \nstarted on some form of drug and then gotten off but is a life-long \nprocess in the lives of every single individual, then that \nadministration tends to lose its sense of focus or even its sense of \ncaring, because each administration wants something else that it can be \ndefinitively responsible for.\n  Do we not have a situation here in which we had a significant degree \nof success over a period of 4, 8, or 12 years, which one other \nadministration by diligent effort could continue, could lose no ground, \nmaybe by tremendous effort could maybe even make a few gains, but knew \nit could not win the way you win World War II, so the administration \njust lost interest in it. There were just a lot of other things it \nwanted to do.\n  Have we all not suffered? And this is the most important part of the \nquestion, have we not all suffered as a result, because the implication \nmade that we have gotten this far, we do not have to do anything to at \nleast keep it the status quo. But as the Senator from Georgia pointed \nout, in 4 years you can lose all the ground you gained in 12. Is that \nnot essentially what we have done as a result of this administration's \nindifference to the problem?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator has raised several very, very crucial \nquestions and sort of a constructive criticism which I might need to \ntake to heart. First, we have not lost all the ground; we have just \nlost a lot of it. If unchecked, we will lose it all.\n  I do not know that I agree that it was strictly a function of \ninterest level. I believe there are people in our country, and some of \nthem are in this administration, like former Surgeon General Elders, \nwho believes the construction of the struggle was wrong. I believe that \nthey believed rehabilitation is more important that interdiction, so \nthere are some philosophical differences here.\n  We now have the results of the interdiction law enforcement and \neducation. It cut it in half. The new idea, empirically, has failed, \nbecause it has doubled, but we still have people in this administration \nwho do not agree with the war on drugs.\n  Now, the last point I make, the war on drugs, I think the Senator \nmakes a very valid point that it is not something to ever be won or \nlost. I have called it a war on drugs, of late, because of the level, \nseparate from usage in the United States.\n  The fact is, we have come into an era where drug cartels with their \nenormous capacity of resources and sophistication, in my judgment, have \nput democracies in the hemisphere at stake. When the President of \nMexico turns to me and says, ``The single greatest threat to my public \nare the drug cartels,'' that raises it to a new level. I think there is \na war in the hemisphere to gain control of this circumstance so that it \ndoes not threaten fragile and small democracies--some of them rather \nlarge. I draw that distinction and separate the two.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct, this is an issue for which society \nhas always and will always struggle. Maybe it is improper to \ncharacterize it as a war. That is a duty. It is a duty of one \ncivilization to those that follow. From time to time, I argue, there \nare incidents--and we are in one--where there is a configuration where \nwe really are in a very adversarial struggle with a force that is \ncapable of undoing society. I do believe the hemisphere is confronted \nwith that at this point.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Georgia for the clarity of his \nthought and for his dedication to a cause which is of vital importance \nto the future of our country and society.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate very much the thoughts of the Senator \nfrom Washington. As always, the Senator brings great clarity and \npoignancy to issues of importance to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na statement by former drug czar William Bennett.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Bennett Criticizes McCurry and White House Drug Policy\n\n       Washington, DC, July 18, 1996.--Today, Empower America co-\n     director and former Bush ``drug czar'' William J. Bennett \n     released the following statement:\n       Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service \n     agents (released by a House committee) that background \n     investigations on White House employees found that more than \n     40 had used drugs; a few dozen showed drug usage had been \n     within the last five years; and that among those few dozen \n     people were individuals who had used cocaine, crack cocaine \n     and hallucinogens. We learned, too, that the Secret Service \n     initially rejected White House passes to an unspecified \n     number of White House employees because they were considered \n     a security risk--a recommendation which apparently was \n     unacceptable to the Clinton administration. Instead, the \n     administration opted for a far more lenient policy--a twice-\n     per-year surprise drug test. These are very disturbing \n     revelations--but ones which do not seem to trouble the \n     Clinton administration at all.\n       I have also read the transcripts of Mike McCurry's July \n     17th press briefing in which he stated that ``of course'' he \n     used illegal drugs during the 1970s. What exactly did Mr. \n     McCurry mean by ``of course''? That every young person used \n     drugs in the 1970s? Or that it was no big deal? Why didn't \n     Mr. McCurry show any regret for having used illegal drugs? \n     Mr. McCurry is wrong on all counts--and he should admit that \n     he was wrong.\n       These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined with \n     Mr. McCurry's comments are, I think, emblematic of the \n     Clinton administration's cavalier and indifferent attitude \n     toward illegal drug use. The Clinton administration doesn't \n     seem to care about this issue. They seem unwilling to take a \n     strong and unambiguous stand against drug use. And this \n     nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton \n     administration's indifference, in terms of wrecked and lost \n     lives.\n       Mr. McCurry's comments are of course not helpful. But \n     neither are they surprising. After all, President Clinton's \n     record on fighting illegal drug use is abysmal. It is worth \n     pointing out that this is not a partisan opinion. Democratic \n     Senator Joe Biden has been a strong critic of the \n     administration's anti-drug efforts. And it was Democratic \n     Congressman Charles Rangel who said this about the \n     Clinton administration: ``I've been in Congress over two \n     decades, and I have never, never, never found any \n     administration that's been so silent on this great \n     challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people.''\n       Consider the record under Bill Clinton's watch: drug use \n     among high school seniors has risen steadily since he took \n     office. The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana has \n     almost doubled. Methamphetamine emergency room cases are up \n     over 300 percent. LSD use has reached the highest rate since \n     record-keeping started in 1975. Drug-related emergency room \n     admissions are at record levels. And these trends have \n     occurred after real progress was made against drug use in the \n     mid-1980s and early 1990s.\n       But there is more involved here than a failure of public \n     policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral \n     diffidence on this issue. Policy follows attitude. In 1991, \n     when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that \n     he had never ``broken any drug law.'' A year later, he \n     admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented \n     with marijuana but he said, ``I didn't like it. I didn't \n     inhale it, and never tried it again.'' Later, when asked \n     whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he \n     answered, to laughter: ``Sure, if I could. I tried before.''\n       Then there is President Clinton's former Surgeon General \n     Joycelyn Elders, who had been one of this administration's \n     most vocal voices on drugs and who had favorable words about \n     drug legalization. And of course now we have Mr. McCurry's \n     comments.\n       During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her ``Just \n     Say No'' campaign. But it turns out that ``Just Say No'' is \n     far more effective than ``I didn't inhale'' or an attitude of \n     ``of course I used illegal drugs.''\n       I realize that Mr. McCurry, a skilled press secretary, was \n     simply reflecting the attitude of the President and his \n     administration. But I would be interested in the answer to \n     two questions: first, what does General Barry McCaffrey think \n     about Mr. McCurry's comments and the underlying attitude they \n     expressed? And second, does President Clinton have any \n     objection if a person who has used cocaine, crack cocaine or \n     hallucinogenic drugs during the past five years is working in \n     his administration? Is there any kind of recent (pre-White \n     House) drug use or drug activity that would disqualify \n     somebody from joining the Clinton administration? Perhaps the \n     president could clarify what his policy is on these matters.\n       On the issue of fighting illegal drugs--like so many other \n     issues of national importance--the American people deserve \n     better from their president.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will take just a minute to read from this statement \nfrom William Bennett:\n\n       Yesterday we learned from interviews with Secret Service \n     agents that background investigations on White House \n     employees found that more than 40 had used drugs; a few dozen \n     showed drug usage--\n\n  I have always wondered what that remark means; what is ``a few \ndozen''? It sounds an awful lot like 40.\n\n       . . . a few dozen showed drug usage has been within the \n     last 5 years; and that among those few dozen people were \n     individuals who\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\n     had used cocaine, crack cocaine and hallucinogens.\n\n  It goes on: ``These revelations by Secret Service agents, combined \nwith Mr. McCurry's comments,'' which we have all talked about earlier, \n``are, I think, emblematic of the Clinton administration's cavalier and \nindifferent attitude toward illegal drug use. The Clinton \nadministration does not seem to care about this issue. They seem \nunwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use. And \nthis Nation is now paying a very heavy price for the Clinton \nadministration's indifference in terms of wrecked and lost lives.''\n  This is the point I want to underscore over and over. We are not \ntalking about just reciting numbers of increase, et cetera. We are \ntalking about some kid in your family, somebody that lives next door, \nsomebody you work with, that you know and care about. Every one of \nthese 2 million new families that are experiencing drug use in their \nfamily are just like somebody we know, or they may be somebody we know.\n  It is time for the White House to put the bully pulpit to work, \ncalling on our youth across this land to be knowledgeable and \nunderstanding of the fact that drugs will ruin their lives and forever \nchange their futures.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9027-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it was on Friday, February 23, 1996, that \nthe Federal debt broke the $5 trillion sound barrier for the first time \nin history. The records show that on that day, at the close of \nbusiness, the debt stood at $5,017,056,630,040.53.\n  Twenty years earlier, in 1976, the Federal debt stood at $629 \nbillion, after the first 200 years of America's history, including two \nworld wars. The total 1976 Federal debt, I repeat, stood at $629 \nbillion.\n  Then the big spenders really went to work and the interest on the \nFederal debt really began to take off--and, presto, during the past 2 \ndecades the Federal debt has soared into the stratosphere, increasing \nby more than $4 trillion in 2 decades--from 1976 to 1996.\n  So, Mr. President, as of the close of business Friday, July 26, the \nFederal debt stood--down-to-the-penny--at $5,181,675,045,058.46. On a \nper capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes \n$19,525.25 as his or her share of that debt.\n  This enormous debt is a festering, escalating burden on all citizens \nand especially it is jeopardizing the liberty of our children and \ngrandchildren. As Jefferson once warned, ``to preserve [our] \nindependence, we must not let our leaders load us with perpetual debt. \nWe must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and \nservitude.''

Mr. President, I feel compelled to make this statement at \nthis time on the Senate floor. First, I want to express my profound \ndismay that after an attack of terrorism that occurred at the Olympics, \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle would use 1 hour of time to \ndegrade and demean the President of the United States. We only have one \nPresident at a time, and we may not think that everything he does is \nperfect. But at such a time when we are trying to unite as one, in the \nface of an act of terror and, perhaps, an act of terror on TWA flight \n800 not long ago, that we would use the Senate floor in such a blatant \npartisan way is offensive to me.\n  The junior Senator from Georgia made a few very appropriate remarks \nin the beginning of his statement. He called for a moment of silence \nfor those who perished, and that was most appropriate. But, after that, \nwe descended into something that I could describe as a blatant attack \non this President. It seemed to me as if it was almost scripted, that \nthis is what they had planned to do, and it did not matter what \nhappened over the weekend.\n  I come to the floor to call on our country to come together in the \nface of what has occurred, not to find issues that divide us. Does that \nmean that I am pleased with the progress made on the war against drugs? \nNo, I am not. Does that mean that I do not share my colleagues' view \nthat we must do more? I do agree with that. We must do more. We all \napplaud the appointment of General McCaffrey to head this war on drugs. \nWe must do more on that. We must do more in curbing alcohol \nabuse, because these things bring tragedy to families. But, today, I \nhope that if we are going to discuss the war on drugs, we will keep it \nelevated at a level that could bring us together and not pull us apart.\n\n  To me, it was extraordinary that Senators on the other side of the \naisle, over and over again, alluded to individuals who worked for the \nPresident who admitted to using marijuana. But they omitted something \nin their partisan attack. What about the Speaker of the\n\n[[Page S9038]]\n\nHouse, who admitted that he did the same thing? What about the keynote \nat the Republican National Convention admitting over the weekend that, \nsure, she did it? But this place is so partisan that you never hear any \nof that. Look, many individuals in our society have made mistakes, have \ndone things they should not have done. We know more now than we knew \nthen, true. So rather than attack one particular individual, as they \ndid on this floor, or members of one particular party, as they did on \nthis floor, let us get past it and let us work together.\n\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, now, in the remainder of my remarks, I am \ngoing to talk about what I think we should be doing in a constructive \nway. The first thing I want to do is compliment Senator Nunn from \nGeorgia for leading the fight on this floor to ensure that, in fact, we \nhave a military presence at the Olympics--in plainclothes, but \nthousands and thousands of personnel are there. This Federal Government \nis supplying that. There was a fight on this floor, and 20 Senators \nthought it was wrong. I am glad that, in a bipartisan fashion, we \nprevailed, because that presence is needed and is important.\n  Second of all, I want to commend the President for his remarks, for \nbringing us together, for vowing, along with so many others on the \nOlympic committee, that the Olympics would continue in the face of this \ncowardly act, and for calling congressional leaders to the White House \nto fix the antiterrorism bill that we passed that we could not get \nsupport for in certain areas where we should have gotten support:\n  A provision increasing the statute of limitations for making bombs, \nsawed-off shotguns, and silencers. That happens to be a provision I \nauthored, was passed in the Senate and dropped by the House. It is not \nthe law of the land. The police sometimes need more time to go after \npeople who make a bomb. We should fix that.\n  A provision requiring the placement of taggants on black and \nsmokeless powder. We need to get that passed.\n  A provision prohibiting the dissemination of bombmaking instructions \nwhen the instructor knows that the information will be used for \ncriminal purposes. We need to get that passed.\n  A provision that changed wiretapping authority so criminals cannot \nuse modern technology to evade court-approved wiretaps.\n  A provision making terrorism an offense for which a wiretap can be \nauthorized on an emergency basis. There is no reason that Republicans \nand Democrats cannot come together with the President and get that done \nimmediately.\n  Mr. President, we could be taking more security measures at our \nairports. I keep focusing on the fact that this Congress gave the \nmilitary $12 billion more than the military asked for. I think we have \nto be prepared to fight terrorism. It is a threat against our people. \nAnd if we took a small portion of that $12 billion, we could put the \nmost up-to-date scanners at every single airport in this country. If we \ntook a portion of that money that the Pentagon did not want, we could \nmake sure there are bomb-sniffing dogs at every airport where the \nairport asks for that kind of assistance. These are very effective \ntools. There is no reason why, in the greatest country in the world, \nthe greatest democracy in the world, the strongest country in the \nworld, we have airports that don't have those tools available to them, \nand we have a military that says, ``You gave us $12 billion too much.'' \nWe can do it through the military budget--just make sure it is under \ncivilian control. But we should act to do those things.\n\n  Mr. President, when I was in the House, I sat as the Chair of a \nsubcommittee that oversaw the FAA, and then we saw problems that \nhaven't been remedied. So there are things that we can do. Now, we know \nthat Vice President Gore is heading a Presidential commission, and in \n45 days we are going to have his report. I hope we will pull together. \nI hope we will not see the kinds of things we saw here on the Senate \nfloor this morning. I hope we will pull together and do what it takes.\n  We know that the European Union countries have much stronger \nscreening techniques than we have here. There is no reason that our \npeople should not have that sense of confidence. Yes, it may take us 15 \nor 20 minutes more to get that flight off the ground. I don't know one \nindividual in this U.S. Senate, be he or she a Republican or a \nDemocrat, that would believe another 15 minutes would hurt \nthem. Fifteen minutes is not going to hurt anybody.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for allowing me to \naddress the U.S. Senate over the subject matter of the bill. But I hope \nwe will all be moved to come together in a spirit of bipartisanship and \nset aside our partisan bickering, that we will work together, that we \nwill send our sympathies as one to Alice Hawthorne's family, 44 years \nold, killed at the bombing, and to the Turkish cameraman, Melih \nUzunyoz, who died from a heart attack while rushing to the scene; and, \nof course, to every single family member who lost people in the TWA \ncrash.\n  I hope that we will come together and that we will do what it takes \nto take every step we can in a democratic society to guard against \nterrorism, be it terrorism from within our borders or terrorism from \noutside our borders. These are cowardly acts, and we should put a stop \nto them to the extent that we can within our democratic framework.\n  We can take the steps that I mentioned without giving up any of our \nfreedom. We can take the steps that I mentioned without spending too \nmuch. We have those resources in this country, and I urge us to work \ntogether. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9037-6", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9038-S9050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 1958, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1959) making appropriations for energy and water \n     development for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment, which would cut $22 million from the Advanced Light Water \nReactor Program.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of reasons not to cut this money. \nThe clearest and simplest and most obvious and most unanswerable is \nthis is the fifth year of a 5-year program, a program entered into at \nthe behest of Congress with the Energy Policy Act of 1992 for which \ncontracts have been made and it would cost more to terminate the \nprogram, Mr. President, than to continue the program.\n  This has been certified to by Assistant Secretary Terry Lash, who is \nDirector of the Office of Nuclear Energy Science and Technology, in his \nletter to Honorable Michael Doyle of July 24, 1996, which was entered \ninto the Congressional Record on July 24, and certifies the fact that \ntermination costs in the program would be considerably more than the \ncontinuation of the program.\n  Moreover, the recoupment of cost by the Federal Government would be \nprecluded, which would result in further lost revenue to the Federal \nGovernment of $125 million according to Director Lash's Department of \nEnergy office.\n  The reason for this is that, for example, with the AP-600, which is a \nWestinghouse reactor, the agreement requires that, upon the sale of the \nfirst reactor, they will have to repay the Department of Energy $25 \nmillion, and $4 million for each reactor thereafter sold.\n  The same thing is true with General Electric, which has already sold \ntwo reactors under this program to Taiwan for which there would be a \nrequired payment of $3 million for those reactors. That obligation \nwould presumably be canceled.\n  So, Mr. President, in order to make any nuclear demonstration, the \nMcCain amendment would actually cost the Federal Government money \nwithout regard to whether or not you like the program. Whether you are \nantinuclear, or whatever, the fact of the matter is the Federal \nGovernment\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nwould lose money under the McCain amendment. It is the fifth year of a \n5-year program, and it is very close to fruition. All of the money that \nhas been spent on this program, most of it private, would be lost if \nthe program is not finished.\n  Why did the Congress see fit in 1992 to go into this program? Because \nthe American nuclear program, from its inception I think, was not \nconceived in the way that it should have been in that each reactor \nwhich was built in America under this program was a one-of-a-kind \nreactor designed from the ground up as a separate reactor. Each had to \nbe separately licensed. Each had to meet separate tests to determine \nwhether design was sufficient.\n  We found, after Three Mile Island, that many of these designs were \nlacking and had to be redesigned. During the construction of many of \nthese reactors after Three Mile Island in the mid-70's, those were the \ndays of very high interest rates. Interest rates were well over double \ndigits at the time. You had to undo that which was done and start all \nover again. For that reason, those reactors are very high cost, some \nrunning between 5 cents and 10 cents a kilowatt hour, several times the \namount for which electricity can be generated today.\n  In order to remedy that situation, in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, \nwe, first of all, remember, did nuclear licensing to provide for what \nwe call the generic design and the generic licensing of a new reactor, \nso that you would be able to go in and separate the construction \nlicense from the design license and be able to rely upon the fact that \nyour design was a valid and safe design at the time you commissioned \nyour reactor project. We amended the licensing act in order to do that.\n  Also, as part of that, in tandem with that program, we entered into \nthe Advanced Light Water Reactor Program, which was calculated to \ndesign a generic reactor so that each reactor of the time sought to be \nlicensed would be the same reactor. Westinghouse has probably the lead \ndesign in this. It is called the AP-600. The AP-600 is unique for \nAmerican reactors in two respects:\n  First, it would be, as I say, generically designed and generically \nlicensed so that when you go to buy an AP-600, wherever you are in the \nworld, it would be the same AP-600. It would be largely manufactured at \nthe factory so that you do not have to do everything out at the site, \nand each one will be the same.\n  Second, Mr. President, and very importantly, it is what we call a \npassively safe reactor. It does not depend totally on pumps and sources \nof electricity and that sort of thing in order to provide coolant. So \nin case of a catastrophic failure, it is designed to have coolant which \nwould automatically come down into the reactor and render it safe.\n  Nuclear plants, as the Chair well knows, are designed to have many \nredundant safety features so that you have power lines coming in from \ntwo or three different places and generators on site so that in case \none set of power lines goes out, another will be there. In the case of \nboth of those or all three of those going out, then generators are \ndesigned to come on automatically.\n  But the AP-600, the advanced light water reactor, is designed to be \npassively safe so that even if everything else fails, in effect the \ncoolant water will automatically come down into the reactor vessel and \nrender it safe in case of the most unimaginable catastrophic event.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are very close to completing this program. The \nAP-600 was delayed not by the Department of Energy, not by Westinghouse \nbut by the NRC in its licensing program which no one could control but \nthe NRC. It is due to be finished in the next fiscal year, fiscal year \n1997, and the money provided in this bill will complete the job.\n  The argument against this is apparently that no American utility at \nthis point wants to buy one, and so therefore do not complete it and \ntherefore we can be sure that no one is going to be able to buy one.\n  The fact is it is unlikely that any American utility in the next few \nyears will build a new nuclear plant, and that is because natural gas \nis relatively cheap. It is because the technology of natural gas \nturbines has advanced so far so fast that it is now the cheapest way to \ngenerate electricity, and I do not expect a big coal plant to be built \nand I do not expect big solar plants to be built as far as the eye can \nsee. But I do expect additional natural gas plants to be built. And \nthat is in this country.\n  Mr. President, around the world, the situation is somewhat different. \nIn China, for example, it has already commissioned some 6,000 megawatts \nof nuclear power. They really wanted American technology, and they have \na very long and excellent relationship with Westinghouse, and I believe \nthat the Chinese would purchase the AP-600. It will soon be licensed. \nIt would be licensed in time for them to use the technology. But our \nGovernment prevents us from selling nuclear plants to China, this being \nan outgrowth of the Tiananmen Square incident in 1989. We expect that \nagreement with respect to nuclear power will be in the not too distant \nfuture. At least I hope that we would have an agreement with China for \nthe furnishing of nuclear technology. In fact, the 6,000 megawatts have \nbeen ordered from Russia, from France and from Canada, all of which \nhave technology which is inferior to American technology and I think is \nfar inferior to the newest technology, that is, the AP-600.\n  The Chinese like the size of the AP-600--that is, 600 megawatts, a \nmodular size. The Chinese have lots of dirty coal but virtually no \nnatural gas and a huge population, a huge problem of So2, of global \nwarming, of air pollution, and they believe that nuclear power is a \nvery big part of their future, and that is why they have already \ncommissioned some 6,000 megawatts. They have in future plans an \nadditional, I believe it is, 11,000 megawatts for the first decade of \nthe next century and a clear and strong commitment to nuclear power.\n  I must say for those in this country who feel strongly about global \nwarming--and I do--I submit that this is the best solution to the \nproblem of global warming, clearly the best solution for the problem of \nair pollution. If the economics are right, clearly the environment so \nfar as China is concerned, as well as other nations on the Pacific rim, \nthis is an excellent solution. Other countries are moving ahead, \nparticularly in the Pacific, with nuclear power including Japan and \nTaiwan, South Korea. Of course, North Korea will soon be getting a \nreactor built and designed principally by the South Koreans adopting \nthe original Westinghouse technology.\n  Mr. President, the point I am making is not that we are getting ready \nto sell a lot of these reactors in the United States. We are not. But \non the Pacific rim they are moving forward; they have made the \ndecision; they have made the commitments. And the question is, would \nyou rather complete a 5-year program on which private industry has \nspent almost $500 million to complete and get the good out of it to \nbuild the most technologically proficient, the safest reactor in the \nworld which would then be available for sale to these foreign countries \nor would you rather terminate the program and subject the Government to \ngreater damages than it would cost to spend on the $22 million it takes \nto complete the program.\n\n  No one has answered that overwhelming argument of why you would want \nto terminate a program that is so close to finishing when it cost more \nto terminate than it does to complete the program.\n  One other thought. I believe the Federal Government needs to be true \nto its word and to its commitments just as individuals need to do that. \nAnd the reason is that if people are going to be encouraged and \ncompanies are going to be encouraged to do business with the Federal \nGovernment, to undertake research, to undertake the expenditure of \nlarge amounts of their own money, then they ought to have some \nassurance that the word of the Federal Government is good because to \nthe extent that we terminate these projects--we terminated the SSC, we \nhave terminated the other projects--then soon the reputation of the \nFederal Government will be such that no one will want to enter into the \ndoing of business with it.\n  In the home State of the occupant of the chair, they are now seeking \nto enter into large contracts with private firms in order to clean up \nthe mess at Hanford, in order to vitrify the waste\n\n[[Page S9040]]\n\nthere and be able to store it. It is a private undertaking. They are \nbeing encouraged to bid and to have a competition and to do business \nwith the Federal Government.\n  If we would adopt this amendment, it would make that kind of \nobligation and others like it less and less attractive to the private \nsector.\n  I repeat, the most overwhelming and most unanswerable part of this \nargument is that it costs more to terminate than it does to finish this \nobligation of the Federal Government, and we ought therefore to do it. \nIn addition to the fact that the Federal Government would lose the \nprofit which it would get from the sale of these reactors in the future \nas well as those already sold to Taiwan, and that the Federal \nGovernment and our country would lose a great opportunity to do \nbusiness in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know that Senator Bumpers wants to offer an amendment \nand he is going to be very generous in the agreement on time.\n  I thank Senator Johnston for his argument, and I wish to indicate \nvery openly and publicly that I support his position. I do not believe \nwe ought to kill this program when it is about finished. We ought to \nlet it complete its remaining 1 year.\n  A couple things have not been said about the program. Obviously, the \nword subsidy is bantered around, but everyone should know that the \nadvanced light water reactor program, first, is 90 percent complete.\n  Second, there is $40 million in this entire appropriations bill to \ncomplete this project. When it is completed, that will complete a $713 \nmillion advanced light water reactor program, of which $270 million is \nthe DOE and, get this, $440 million is private industry funded. So for \nthose who talk of a subsidy, we have $440 million coming from the \nprivate sector, $270 from DOE. This last $40 million will complete the \nwork and wrap the program up and dismantle it. So the subsidy is there, \nbut the ratio is pretty heavily in favor of the private sector putting \nthe money in.\n  I have looked at this. I understand what some of my colleagues are \nlooking at. We are looking at this budget critically, but I am aware of \nthe fact that we are not going to save any money by closing the program \ndown now, and as a matter of fact we may throw away some real \nopportunities to have some really significant and new technology \napplied to nuclear reactors.\n  Whether we think we want any more nuclear reactors or not is not the \nwhole issue. American companies build nuclear reactors for the world, \nand we are the world's leader in that. We will continue as the leader \nand probably sell many of these types of reactors in the world market. \nTo the extent that China chooses to use them, it is a very, very \nsignificantly appropriate environmental cleanup method, because if they \ndo not use this, they use dirty coal, which they have in abundance. So, \nin a real sense we are being very, very irresponsible in closing down a \nprogram with 1 year left which has many qualities that will add to \nAmerica's capability to employ our people and sell our products and at \nthe same time help the world clean up some of the dirtiest environment \naround in some of the growing industrial areas of the world outside of \nour own country and Europe and the like.\n  So, for those who wonder about frugality, I would be for cutting any \nprogram of $40 million I could take out of this bill, but this is not \nthe one.\n  Mr. President, opponents of the ALWR Program have argued with great \nindignation against continuation of what is called a corporate subsidy. \nIt is only fair to note that U.S. electric utility companies and the \nALWR contractors have contributed $3.50 for every $1.00 of DOE funds \nspent on the program.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, the ALWR Program is 90 percent \ncomplete. The modest funding contained in this bill is the last piece \nof Federal funding. It will complete the $713 million ALWR Program, of \nwhich almost $270 million is DOE funding the $444 million is private \nindustry funding.\n  Mr. President, may I assure my colleagues who are critical of the \nALWR Program, that I am mindful of their point of view. And I would \nhope that their close examination of what the committee proposes to do \nin this bill will lead them to the conclusion which I myself have \nreached:\n  That is, the ALWR Program funding in the bill is the best and most \neffective way to close out the program successfully and with the \nhighest return to the taxpayer for the hundreds of millions of dollars \nalready spent. Conversely, failure to close out the ALWR Program in the \nway the committee recommends creates a colossal waste of the money \nalready spent.\n  Mr. President, I believe prudence and thoughtfulness require support \nfor the committee's position.\n\n\n                     completion of the alwr program\n\n  Starting in 1990--design certification--and in 1993--first of a kind \nengineering--the ALWR represents a joint commitment by government and \nindustry to develop a new generation of standardized, advanced \nreactors, coupled with a one step NRC licensing process for such \ndesigns.\n  In fulfilling the plan set out in the Energy Policy Act, both \nCongress and industry recognized that developing a new generation of \nreactors involved Government/regulatory risk as well as technological \nrisk. While reactor manufacturers and the utility industry committed \nfunds to develop the technology, the Government/regulatory risk with a \nnew, untried licensing process was sufficiently significant to call on \nGovernment to share that risk and cost with the private sector.\n  The innovative, passively safe systems involved in this new \ngeneration of reactors are recognized as a world class development. As \nan example, 20 nations are involved in the AP600 program and extensive \ntesting programs both in the United States and abroad have demonstrated \nthat the passive safety systems will work as predicted by the design \ncodes.\n  Congress directed that the program should be cost shared, with \npayback to the Federal Government from royalties on the sale of plants. \nTo date $713 million has been invested in the program, of which $444 \nmillion--62 percent--has come from private industry. In addition, $125 \nmillion of the DOE funding will be repaid as royalties on the sale of \nplants.\n  The program is 90 percent complete and will be completed with the \nmodest funding provided by the $40 million DOE fiscal year 1997 \nrequest. At the end of the design certification and first-of-a-kind \nengineering programs for the AP600, three new standardized American \nreactor designs will be ready for the market. This accomplishment will \nrepresent the only recent, successful completion of a major new energy \ndesign project to meet America's and the world's future energy needs. \nThis could not have been accomplished without the shared commitment of \ngovernment and the private sector to the Advanced Light Water Reactor \nProgram.\n  Failure to provide the final year of funding and abandoning DOE's \nrole before completing the final year would result in the complete loss \nof the $713 million investment to date. The end goal of final design \napproval and design certification by the NRC would not be realized and \nthe investment and years of effort wasted. Failure to complete would \nalso be a clear signal that the United States no longer seeks to lead \nthe world in developing standardized passively safe reactor designs for \nworld wide application.\n  I ask unanimous consent some material, a list of seven common myths, \nand a letter from the chairman of the advanced reactor corp. be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        investments--through september 1996--total alwr program\n\n       Design certification: DOE--$188 million; Industry--$305.7 \n     million.\n       Foake: DOE--$81.3 million; Industry--$138.4 million.\n       Total program: DOE--$269.3 million; Industry--$444.1 \n     million.\n       TOTAL--$713.4 million.\n       DOE--37.7 percent.\n       Industry--62.3 percent.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n   Seven Common Myths Regarding the DOE Advanced Light Water Reactor \n                                Program\n\n         (Prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy, July 1996)\n\n       Myth 1.--The Program's Authorization under the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 ends in FY 1996\n\n[[Page S9041]]\n\n       Reality: The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) limits the \n     First-of-a-Kind Engineering (FOAKE) program to five years, \n     states that no entity shall receive assistance for a period \n     greater than 4 years, and limits total program funding to \n     $100 million. The EPACT became law in fiscal year 1993. \n     Therefore, the five year limit will not be reached until FY \n     1998 and the four year ``assistance'' limit will not be \n     reached until FY 1997. The Department is full authorized \n     under the EPACT to apply funds to the FOAKE program in FY \n     1997.\n       Further, the Department has spent only about $82 million on \n     this program since it began in 1992. There have been \n     significant increases in program cost, but these have been \n     absorbed by industry. In any event, the Department is also \n     fully authorized by the Atomic Energy Act to conduct nuclear \n     energy research and development programs and the EPACT does \n     not limit this authority.\n       Myth 2.--The FOAKE Program was to end in 1996 because the \n     EPACT mandated that any nuclear designs developed in the \n     program should receive certification in 1996\n       Reality: In 1992, the Department expected that both of the \n     designs included in the FOAKE program--the Advanced Boiling \n     Water Reactor (ABWR) and the AP600--could be developed on \n     schedules which would have achieved NRC certifications by the \n     end of FY 1996. While the program was designed to lead to \n     certification in FY 1996, the Department had no control over \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's certification process, \n     which involved far more review and testing than the \n     Commission anticipated in 1992 (most of the delays are \n     associated with extra testing required to verify the \n     performance of advanced safety systems). As a result of these \n     delays, the Department expects certification of the ABWR by \n     late FY 1996 and of the AP600 by FY 1998. The EPACT does not \n     limit the Department's authority to conduct the program, but \n     merely guided DOE's selection of technologies to assure that \n     only near-term technologies would be included in the program.\n       Myth 3.--The EPACT Prohibits the industry from seeking \n     export markets for ALWRs developed in the FOAKE program\n       Reality: The EPACT places no restrictions on U.S. \n     industry's ability to compete in the international market. \n     Further, the fact that U.S. vendors participating in the \n     program are seeking overseas contracts to build ALWRs does \n     not suggest that ALWRs will not be built in the U.S. In fact, \n     since the market for new nuclear plants in the United States \n     is not expected to materialize for another ten years, it is \n     imperative that U.S. vendors win overseas orders if the U.S. \n     capability to build new plants is to be preserved.\n       Myth 4.--The ALWR Program is Corporate Welfare\n       Reality: The Department's program is designed to apply a \n     very limited allocation of federal funds to encourage U.S. \n     industry to pursue R that is in the interest of the United \n     States. The preservation of the nuclear energy option is \n     vital to the future of energy diversity in this country. It \n     is clear that the market in the United States for ALWRs will \n     not materialize for at least another ten years. In this \n     environment, U.S. industry could be forced to abandon the \n     nuclear power plant market to heavily subsidized foreign \n     industrial concerns. The future ability of U.S. industry to \n     build new plants in this country could be lost.\n       To prevent this from occurring, the Department conduct a \n     very modest program--the last commercial nuclear energy \n     program conducted by the federal government--to work with \n     industry to maintain the nuclear option for the next century. \n     Since the ALWR program began in 1986, the Department has \n     conducted $800 million in program activities with a taxpayer \n     investment of only $300 million over ten years.\n       Moreover, the Department receives reimbursements when \n     technology developed by the FOAKE program is sold. For \n     example, the federal government will receive approximately $3 \n     million from General Electric as a result of its sale of \n     ABWRs to Taiwan (which, unlike the plants GE previously sold \n     to Japan, are based on technology developed by DOE's \n     program).\n       Myth 5.--There is no U.S. utility interest in building new \n     ALWRs\n       Reality: The fact that the electric utility industry has \n     provided hundreds of millions of dollars to conduct ALWR \n     activities indicates that utility executives remain \n     interested in the nuclear option. For obvious reason, no \n     utility that is interested in placing ALWR orders in the \n     future would be likely to indicate that interest publicly. \n     However, recent discussions between DOE officials and \n     electric utility chief executives have clearly indicated that \n     U.S. utilities continue to see the nuclear option as viable. \n     While the U.S. market for ALWRs is not expected to \n     materialize for another decade, these utilities seek the \n     Department's program as a critical step to assure that next-\n     generation nuclear plant designs are available if they are \n     needed.\n       Much has been said in recent months about a Washington \n     International Energy Group survey of utility executives that \n     indicates that 89% of utility CEOs would not consider \n     ordering any new nuclear power plants. It is important to \n     note that this survey received responses from only 397 of \n     nearly 3600 U.S. electric utilities--and it is not clear that \n     the respondents include the 44 utilities that currently own \n     and operate nuclear power plants. The Department does not \n     believe that this survey provides an accurate view of \n     utility interest in new nuclear plants.\n       Myth 6: DOE is paying Nuclear Regulatory Commission fees \n     that should be paid by industry.\n       Reality: No taxpayer dollars have been used to pay NRC \n     fees. It is true, however, that NRC's increased review and \n     testing requirements forced the program to perform additional \n     technical work. While most of the extra work was funded by \n     industry, part of the added cost was supported by the DOE \n     ALWR program. The additional technical work represented an \n     expansion in the work scope for the program, but is clearly \n     the type of expenditure anticipated by the EPACT.\n       Myth 7: General Electric terminated its Simplified Boiling \n     Water Reactor (SBWR) activities because there is no market \n     for small plants. Similarly, there is no market for the \n     Westinghouse-designed AP600.\n       Reality: While it is true that GE terminated its mid-sized \n     SBWR project, it must be recognized that GE's market strategy \n     is very focused on the east Asian market-particularly Japan. \n     In many of these countries, land is a scarce resource and \n     there is considerable incentive to build large plants with \n     high power capacity. Other potential markets are less \n     concerned with space and more interested in factors such as \n     lower capital cost and lower complexity--attributes natural \n     to mid-sized plants. These attributes are very attractive to \n     U.S. utilities and others as well--currently 22 countries \n     contribute funds and personnel to the AP600 program. The \n     Department believes that this represents a significant \n     international interest in advanced mid-sized nuclear power \n     plants with passive safety systems.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                       Advanced Reactor Corp.,\n\n                                                    June 28, 1996.\n     Hon. Neil Abercrombie,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Abercrombie: On behalf of the member \n     utilities of the Advanced Reactor Corporation, we urge you to \n     support $40 million for research and development on Advanced \n     Light Water Reactors (ALWR) in the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997. The \n     ALWR Program has an excellent record of achievement and is \n     nearing accomplishment of its goal to open the option for \n     future nuclear power electricity generation, as endorsed by \n     the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n       The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has granted final design \n     approval for the evolutionary ALWR designs and formal design \n     certifications on both are awaiting formal resolution of NRC \n     regulatory process issues. The first-of-a-kind engineering \n     (FOAKE) portion of the ALWR program for the GE evolutionary \n     advanced boiling water reactor will be essentially completed \n     by certification and FOAKE for the new, midsize, passively-\n     safe, pressurized water ALWR, the Westinghouse AP600.\n       The ALWR program is a sound investment continuing to build \n     on the energy security and environmental benefits provided by \n     current plants. Risk sharing of the investment and commercial \n     interest are carefully balanced with industry paying about 62 \n     percent of the total costs, coupled with subsequent pay-back \n     provisions. For example, Westinghouse will pay back $25 \n     million of the Energy Department's contribution for design \n     certification as a royalty on the sale of the first AP600. \n     Additionally, all of the funds provided for FOAKE by both the \n     utilities and the Energy Department will be paid back to each \n     as royalties on sales of the AP600 by Westinghouse and by \n     General Electric on sales of its Advanced Boiling Water \n     Reactor.\n       Our companies entered the government partnership for the \n     FOAKE portion of the ALWR program in February 1992. Later \n     that year, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992, \n     which reaffirmed the nation's commitment to nuclear power and \n     to cost-shared energy research and development. At that time, \n     Congress recognized the time, costs, and risks associated \n     with the process of developing and certifying new reactor \n     designs. Congress has proceeded with this timely program, \n     sharing those costs and risks so that new reactor designs \n     will be a safe, cost-competitive option for future baseload \n     electricity needs.\n       Clearly, America has benefited from the nation's investment \n     to date in nuclear energy technologies with about 20 percent \n     of our electricity coming from pollution-free nuclear power \n     plants.\n       Although there is not an immediate need for new baseload \n     electricity in the United States, energy forecasts predict a \n     28 percent growth in demand by 2010. To meet this need, our \n     companies believe they must have the option to consider \n     standardized, NRC-approved nuclear plants as a part of a \n     balanced mix of power generation facilities. To obtain that \n     option, ARC member utilities are investing in the industry-\n     government program to develop advanced light water nuclear \n     plants. No other type of nuclear plant for commercial \n     generation of electricity will be available in the U.S. \n     within our planning horizon. With this technology, we will \n     continue to lead the world and set high standards for safe \n     and reliable commercial nuclear power.\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\n       We urge congress to continue its commitment for this vital \n     national energy investment by appropriating a supporting \n     government share of $40 million in FY97.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                James J. O'Connor,\n                                  Chairman, Advanced Reactor Corp.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope we will not agree with Senator \nMcCain when we vote tomorrow. If the unanimous consent agreement is \ncomplied with, it will be the first amendment up tomorrow. So we will \nremind you that is the first amendment tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is advised the \nyeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am sorry. They were not ordered because we did not \nhave a sufficient second, but we assured Senator McCain we would \ncooperate with him getting the requisite yeas and nays.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5096\n\n (Purpose: To reduce funding for the weapons activities account to the \n                 level requested by the Administration)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The two pending amendments will be set aside \nby unanimous consent. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 5096.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, line 8, reduce the amount by $286,600,000.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent we \nlimit this amendment to 15 minutes with the time equally divided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator. I wholeheartedly agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which could get \nterribly complex. It involves a segment of the energy and water bill \nthat is immensely complex. It is called ``Atomic Energy Defense \nActivities.'' Within that there is an account called ``Weapons \nActivities.''\n  This bill contains $3.978 billion, almost $4 billion, for weapons \nactivities. That is too much.\n  Let me say by digression, there are not two people in the Senate for \nwhom I have a greater respect and admiration and personal friendship \nthan the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, Senators \nDomenici and Johnston. But I feel obligated to raise this issue and get \nthe debate going on how much money we are putting into this weapons \nactivities account. Mr. President, the Senate bill proposes to provide \nroughly $269 million more than the President's request and $300 million \nabove the House level.\n  The Senate bill's proposed funding level is actually $531 million \nabove the amount provided in fiscal year 1996, a 14-percent increase. \nThat is just entirely too much.\n  I had a very good, lengthy letter from Senator Domenici pointing out \nthat one of the reasons for this increase is that DOE had some \ncarryover money in prior years that we are spending in 1996. However, \nthat only accounts for a portion of the 14-percent increase. My \namendment takes the carryover funds into account and proposes to reduce \nthe weapons activities account by only $269 million, which is the \ndifference between the amount provided in the Senate bill and the \nadministration's request.\n  The Senator makes what I know he considers to be plausible arguments, \nand I am not in a very good position to dispute some of the technical \narguments made about why it was necessary to put all this extra money \ninto this account. But any time you are offering a 14-percent increase \nin any kind of a budget in this day and time, with the budget \nconstraints we are under, it ought to get every single Senator's \nattention.\n  The OMB Acting Director, Mr. Lew, sent each Member of the Senate a \nletter outlining the administration's concerns about the Senate bill \nbeing $531 million above 1996 spending levels. And well he should be \nconcerned. He is concerned because we are putting another $531 million \ninto weapons activities, and the Department of Energy is suffering \nmightily from cuts in civilian energy and research programs.\n  The Appropriations Committee report outlines the add-ons to the \nweapons activities programs. If you look over those add-ons, I am not \nsure exactly what they do, but there is one thing I do know. About $90 \nmillion is not authorized.\n  For example, there is an $80 million add-on for stockpile stewardship \nand $50 million of that is not authorized. What are we doing \nappropriating money that has not been authorized?\n  There is an add-on for $40 million for the accelerated strategic \ncomputing initiative--a mighty fancy name and I am not sure what all it \ndoes. But it is not authorized. The request already proposes $120.6 \nmillion for the program--a 43-percent increase from fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, I only have 7\\1/2\\ minutes on my time. I am not going \nto pursue this any further. I would just like to make a comment. I was \nspeaking to 400 of the brightest kids in Arkansas at what is called \nGovernor's School Saturday and about 800 parents. Politicians do not \nget a chance to talk to 1,200 people very often. I was trying to figure \nout what I could say to those youngsters that my father used to say to \nme about the nobility of being in politics and public service. Not too \nmany people believe that anymore, including an awful lot of people in \nthis Chamber. They do not think it is such a hot profession anymore, \neither, including the 15 colleagues that are leaving this body.\n  But I tried to leave them on an upbeat note. I told them there were \nno problems in this country that were insurmountable. Indeed, if it \nweren't for the way we misspend money, I promise you we could have a \nbalanced budget with a $100 billion surplus in 1997.\n  When I talk about how we misspend our money, you bear in mind that \nthis year, this fall, September 1, we will have for the third \nconsecutive year less food carryover in our grain bins than we have \never had. The third straight year that our foodstuff carryover is going \nto be down, and in 1995, for the first time in 50 years, yields of \nfoodstuff such as wheat, corn, rice, and so on, did not go up.\n  So how are we dealing with that? We are putting $1.2 billion into \nagriculture research this year, 1996; $1.2 billion. What are we giving \nthe Defense Department for research on things that will explode and \nkill people? Mr. President, $35 billion, almost 35 times more than what \nwe are putting into agriculture research to feed our people and help \nfeed the world, indeed.\n  Mr. President, $14 billion is going to NASA, $2 billion of which will \nbe for the space station, and nobody has ever explained why we are \nputting money in the space station.\n  And $12 billion for medical research, which everybody heartily agrees \nwith. Incidentally, one of my staff members, Tracy Alderson, is leaving \nmy office to pursue a medical degree and hopefully advance the cause of \nmedical research in the future.\n  When you put it like that, there are very few people in America who \nwould agree with those priorities. So while the $531 million increase \nin weapons development doesn't mean much around here in a $1.7 trillion \nbudget, it ``ain't'' beanbag either. What it would do in medical \nresearch, what it would do in educating people, what it would do in \nproviding more health care--and think about this--think what it would \ndo in reducing the deficit, $531 million.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not even propose to eliminate the \nentire $531 million increase. Rather, I am only trying to get us back \nto what the President requested, which is a 7-percent increase in this \naccount.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, when we took testimony from Mr. Vic \nReis, who is the Defense Department liaison with these programs, we \nestablished the basic proposition with him in the\n\n[[Page S9043]]\n\nrecord during his testimony, that the entire stockpile stewardship \nprogram, with all of the things we would have to add to it, to the \nprevious programs and the maintenance of certain facilities that we \nhold in a contingency posture, should be about $4 billion.\n  Having established that, we went through the budget and determined \nthat the executive budget was only $3.7 billion. They were $300 million \nshort of what Mr. Vic Reis, the leading expert in the Department of \nEnergy for the DOD stockpile stewardship program, said.\n  If one notices, the difference between $3.7 billion and $4 billion is \nvery, very close to the $269 million that my good friend from Arkansas \nis seeking to take out of this bill. It doesn't quite get to the $4 \nbillion mark with $3.7 billion, but it gets close.\n  The President's budget request said the following:\n\n       Defense program 5-year budget projections contained in the \n     national security 5-year budget plan for 1996 through 2000 \n     indicate that the stockpile stewardship and management \n     programs will require increased funding for a period of \n     several years after FY 1996. This baseline--\n\n  That is starting point--\n\n     has been modified to reflect fiscal year 1997 programs and \n     budget decisions, but the outlook is much the same. Near-term \n     investment must be increased to develop the new and \n     appropriately sized effective complex and to develop the new \n     tools required to maintain confidence in the safety, security \n     and reliability of the stockpile in the absence of \n     underground testing.\n\n  From a base of about $3.6 billion in 1996, the annual total may reach \n$4 billion by the year 1998. In August of 1995, President Clinton \nannounced the United States would pursue a zero yield comprehensive \ntest ban treaty as a condition. The President outlined a series of \nconditions under which the United States could enter this comprehensive \ntest ban treaty.\n  The first condition was the implementation of a stockpile stewardship \nprogram. In January 1996, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the START \nII Treaty. The ratification text committed the United States to, one, a \nrobust stockpile stewardship program; two, maintain sufficient \nproduction capabilities; three, maintain the national laboratories and \nthe core competencies within them; four, maintain the Nevada test site \nin case the President determines a case of supreme national interest \nnecessitated an underground test.\n  Where the increases go: $82.5 million of the $269 million that \nSenator Bumpers is referring to for the stockpile stewardship program \nwill be spent on the following: $20 million is for enhanced \nsurveillance to monitor the aging of weapons. That is perilously \nimportant. We must develop new techniques to monitor the aging of these \nweapons, some of which are 30 years old, and they contain hydrogen and \nnuclear blast capabilities and they must be safe, they must be \ntrustworthy, and they must be maintained.\n  Of that $82.5 million, $40 million is for advanced scientific \ncomputing programs. Incidentally, the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas questions that program. Last Friday, the President announced \nthat these funds would be used by IBM to build a computer 300 times \nfaster than existing computers to model the inside of nuclear weapons. \nThe computer will be installed at Lawrence Livermore in California. I \nam certain that within the confines of the money here for this area of \nendeavor that there will be some other major advanced scientific \ncomputing programs announced.\n  Mr. President, $10 million is for software for these new \nsupercomputers, and $10 million is for advanced manufacturing \ntechniques.\n  The second item that he would strike is $171 million from stockpile \nmanagement, of which $100 million is to upgrade production plants in \nTexas, South Carolina, and Missouri. This money will ensure the plants \nwill be able to remanufacture weapons as needed. This is also a \ncondition that I understand those in charge of our national defense \ninsist upon if we are going to abide by the ``no additional underground \nnuclear testing'' position. Fifteen million dollars of that $171 \nmillion is to enhance surveillance activities at plants to assess the \nreliability and safety of the weapons stockpile.\n  Fifty million dollars is for new tritium sources so that the total \namount of $150 million may be provided.\n  Mr. President, having worked on this bill for a long time, I am \nconcerned that we provide adequate defense money to the Department of \nEnergy so they can do their job, for there are many who would like to \naccuse it of not doing its job but are not considerate of the money \nneeded for the defense work.\n  We believe we are moving rapidly in the direction recommended by the \nPresident and the Joint Chiefs of Staff with reference to the science-\nbased program for stockpile safety and maintenance. We think these \nitems are absolutely essential to get us there and keep us there for \nthe next few years as we see whether or not we can actually accomplish \nthis without underground testing.\n  If I have any additional time, I yield it back. I ask Senator \nJohnston, do you want to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield whatever time I have remaining to Senator \nJohnston.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I simply rise in support of the position of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I was here several years ago speaking in favor of the \ncontinuation of the testing program, because I thought it was important \nfor both reliability and safety.\n  The Senate saw fit to do away with that testing program. The \njustification was that there were other ways with this stockpile safety \nprogram to achieve the same ends. That is why we have funded the \nprogram as we have. That is to achieve those same ends for reliability \nand safety of our nuclear deterrent. I think it would be a great \nmistake to cut that funding.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5097\n\n (Purpose: To ensure adequate funding for the Biomass Power for Rural \n                          Development Program)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I have been requested by the Senator \nfrom Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], to offer an amendment on his behalf. I \nwill shortly send that to the desk. Let me state what it does. I am \nsorry that I will not be able to support the amendment. In fact, I will \noppose the amendment. But nevertheless, as a courtesy to my colleague, \nI will offer it.\n  What it would do is to take four-tenths of 1 percent of each program \nin R, energy supply, and put that into a program called Biomass Power \nfor Rural Development. The money now available, some $55 million, in \nbiomass fuels in the bill, part of that could be used for the purposes \nfor which the Senator from Minnesota would like it used, that is, the \nNiagara Mohawk power project, involving short rotation willows, which \nwould be grown and harvested every 3 years, and also another project \ninvolving alfalfa stems. The alfalfa stem program would be a total of a \n$232 million project, where the DOE cost share would be 20 percent of \nthat, or approximately $46 million.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me we should not get into one of these \nprojects unless it can pass muster against the other programs. These \nwould be available to be funded under the program--Mr. President, I \njust misspoke. I said $55 million would be available for the program. \nActually, only a part, $27 million, would be available for biomass \nelectric program.\n  All of these projects ought to compete for that $27 million. We \nshould not come in and, in effect, specify by limiting it to the \nBiomass Power for Rural Development Program, which is a very narrowly \ndefined program. We should have all of these projects compete for the \namounts available.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask that it be \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Johnston] for Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes amendment numbered 5097.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 4, strike ``expended.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``expended; Provided, That funds appropriated for \n     energy supply, research and development activities shall be \n     reduced by four-tenths of one percent from each program and \n     that the amount of the reduction shall be available for the \n     biomass power for rural development program.''\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 5096\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on Senator \nBumper's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second for the yeas and \nnays on the Bumpers amendment? There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I might move to table. Let us get \nthat done. I move to table the Bumpers amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is an amendment in order now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An amendment is in order if unanimous consent \nis granted to set aside the pending amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside so Senator Kyl can offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5098\n\n(Purpose: To reduce by $13,402,300 funding of the Lower Colorado River \n                        Basin Development Fund)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5098.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 1, strike ``$410,499,000'' and insert \n     ``397,096,700''.\n       On page 14, line 5, strike ``$71,728,000'' and insert \n     ``$58,325,700''.\n       On page 14, line 14, before the colon insert ``: Provided \n     further, the amounts allocated by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of each House in accordance with sections \n     602(a) and 602(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and \n     pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1997 shall be adjusted downward by $13,402,300 \n     and the revised levels of budget authority and outlays shall \n     be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget of that House and shall be printed in the \n     Congressional Record''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment may sound a little strange at \nfirst because it actually reduces funding for an Arizona project, but \nthis is important to do.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to reduce funding for the \ncentral Arizona project (CAP) by $13,402,300. The amendment would bring \nthe bill's fiscal year 1997 appropriation for CAP to $58,325,700. That \nwould represent a cut of about 19 percent in this project, and about a \n3.2-percent reduction from the total Bureau of Reclamation construction \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, I want to begin by commending the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development, Senator Pete Domenici, \nfor his work on this bill and for his unwavering support of the CAP, a \nproject that provides central and southern Arizona with its lifeblood--\nwater.\n  The amendment I am offering today is the result of information \nreceived since the subcommittee took action on the energy and water \nbill a few weeks ago. Had the chairman been aware of the information at \nthat time, I believe the funding levels in the bill would have been \nadjusted accordingly. In any event, it is appropriate that we adjust \nthe figures now to prevent the unnecessary expenditure of hard-earned \ntax dollars.\n  The House of Representatives has already approved a similar \namendment, which was offered with the unanimous support of Arizona's \nHouse delegation, during floor action in that body on July 24. My \namendment differs somewhat from the House measure because of a \ndifference of opinion between the Bureau and staff about how certain \nfunds are accounted for. Although my amendment uses the more \nconservative numbers provided by the Bureau, the savings could rise \ndepending upon how that dispute is resolved. If more could be saved, I \nwould hope the conference committee would adopt that higher amount of \nsavings.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to give credit to the Central Arizona Water \nConservation District, the local sponsor of the CAP, for helping to \nidentify savings that could be achieved, and I want to specifically \nlist those savings here:\n  Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct: Siphon repairs, $1,616,000;\n  Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct: Other repairs, $1,509,000;\n  Modified Roosevelt Dam: Noncontract costs, $214,000;\n  Other project costs: Water allocations--noncontract costs, $500,000;\n  OPC O during construction, $350,000;\n  Curation facilities, $400,000;\n  Native fish protection, $2,775,000;\n  Native fish protection--noncontract costs, $332,000;\n  Environmental Enhancement: Major contracts, $1,100,000\n  Noncontract costs, $801,300;\n  New Waddell Dam: New recreation enhancement contracts, $1,550,000; \nand\n  Noncontract costs, $2,255,000.\n  Total reduction in fiscal year 1997 CAP budget--$13,402,300.\n  Included in these reductions, for example, is $1.5 million that was \nin the Bureau's budget request for Reach 11 dike repairs. But our \ninformation is that the Bureau has already completed such repairs and \nhas no need for more money related to those repairs.\n  Another $1.6 million relates to repair and replacement of siphons, \nbut the Bureau has refused to complete the remaining siphon repairs.\n  I want to make clear that nothing in my amendment is intended to \nhamper work on Indian distribution systems. Funding for work related to \nthis activity is contained in a separate line item within the CAP \nbudget that is left untouched by the amendment. I fully intend that \nthese projects go forward as we have promised. Any effort by the Bureau \nto reprogram moneys set aside for such contracts would require the \napproval of the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Energy \nand Water Development. Such approval is highly unlikely.\n  If there are any activities that are adversely affected and \nproponents can justify why they should legitimately be supported \nthrough the CAP budget, I know the Arizona delegation would be glad to \nrevisit the issue next year. Until then, however, I believe it is \nappropriate for the Senate to accept the savings being proposed today.\n  Mr. President, we have a unique opportunity today to save taxpayers \nsome money without harming ongoing activities that are vital to the \nCAP. I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to first reassure the Senator \nfrom Arizona that I have not in any way diminished my support for the \nproject he alluded here today, the great Arizona water project. I am \ntotally in favor of it and have been a part of funding it for as long \nas I have been here, and, as chairman, I remain committed.\n  I thank the Senator for reducing the costs this year. He has found a \nway to save some money. I gather the amount is about $13.4 million that \nhe thinks we can save. The Senator proposes to save that and still keep \nthe project on course. Is that not correct, Senator Kyl?\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator, in behalf of the people of his State, is \nfully aware this project is fully funded in this bill, and he is going \nto leave it fully funded in the best interests of his State. I give my \ncommitment to keep that going in that manner.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5099 to Amendment No. 5098\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, having said that, the amendment has a \nprovision in it with reference to what the money can be used for that \nis saved, and I have a second-degree amendment that I will offer which \nmakes that no longer subject to a point of order, because it directs \nwhere the money must be spent. I provide a number of amendments that I \nhave agreed to with other Senators to clean up this bill. These will \nall be offered as second-degree amendments to the Kyl amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask for immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for himself and \n     Mr. Johnston, proposes an amendment numbered 5099 to \n     amendment No. 5098.\n\n\n[[Page S9045]]\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the second-\ndegree amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5099) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this \nlegislation for working with me to protect our country's renewable \nenergy programs. The amendment I offered, along with Senators Roth, \nLeahy, Murkowski, Chafee, Bumpers, Daschle, Kohl, and Conrad, will \nessentially maintain fiscal year 1996 spending levels for most solar, \nwind, biomass, and other renewable energy programs. The amendment \nrestores $23 million to these accounts, preserving our nation's main \nefforts to attain energy independence.\n  Mr. President, the United States imports in excess of 50 percent of \nthe oil we use to power our homes, automobiles, and workplaces. Our \ndependence on this foreign oil continues to be a risk to our national \nsecurity and is running up our trade deficit. Despite this fact, we \ncontinue to reduce funding for the few programs which lead us down the \npath of energy independence. In the legislation we are debating today, \nfunding for solar, wind, biomass, and renewable energy programs is cut \nby almost 30 percent and a number of important programs are eliminated \ncompletely.\n  I am very aware of the constraints the managers of this legislation \nhave had with this bill and I commend them\n\n[[Page S9046]]\n\nfor their efforts. However, I feel strongly that this Nation and this \ncongress should continue to support investment in renewable \ntechnologies. The cost of wind, photovoltaics, solar thermal, and \nbiomass have dropped more than ten fold over the last 15 years. Wind \nenergy, which has been cut 50 percent from last year's levels in this \nbill, has developed into the major alternative energy contributor. Over \n5,000 megawatts of wind energy electricity has been installed to date--\nor energy equal to five nuclear power plants.\n  Due to cost-shared research and development on materials, turbine \nblade design, and manufacturing, the U.S. wind industry leads the world \nin the lowest-cost and most efficient wind generators. The combined \nresearch and development budget of the European Community equals $130 \nmillion. This legislation provides the entire research and development \nfunding for our renewable efforts, which is only while this bill \nprovides only $15 million. Clearly this is inequitable and does not \nprovide a sufficient threshold to continue the basic research and cost-\nshared applied research necessary to maintain the lead in both the \ndomestic and global markets. The amendment I am offering will provide \n$31.5 million for wind programs, $1 million lower than fiscal year 1996 \nlevels.\n  Our Nation should be proud of its lead in developing advanced wind \nenergy systems. My State of Vermont certainly takes pride in its \ngrowing wind industry. One of our utilities, Green Mountain Power, has \nbeen a national wind energy leader, and is currently constructing a 6 \nmegawatt project that will utilize eleven 550 kilowatt turbines \nmanufactured by Zond Systems of California. The Zond turbine has been \nparticipating in cost-shared development with the U.S. Department of \nEnergy and the National Wind Technology Center at NREL. Green Mountain \nPower's Vice President, Norm Terreri, is now serving as president of \nthe American Wind Energy Association.\n  Vermont is also home to NRG Systems, of Hinesburg, VT, one of the \nworld's leading high technology manufacturers of wind measuring devices \nand a company that has made export sales in over 50 countries. Atlantic \nOrient, of Norwich, VT, has manufactured a 50-kilowatt wind turbine in \ncooperation with the Department of Energy that has become one of the \nmost popular turbines for wind-diesel hybrid locations for remote \nlocations such as Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. The New World Power \nTechnology Company of Waitsfield, VT, is a leading manufacturer of \nwind-PV village power systems.\n  Wind companies around the country, like those in Vermont, look to the \nFederal Government for support in this new, booming market. We cannot \nlet these companies fall behind their European or Asian competitors as \nthis market expands.\n  Solar thermal electricity has been on a major growth spurt, with the \nUnited States leading the world. In June, the Solar Two project was \nribbon-cut in California. At this site, the heat from solar mirror \nconcentrating sunlight atop a tower is stored in nitrate salt which can \nthen create steam-to-electricity day or night, rain or shine. A solar \ndish/engine manufacturing facility was ribbon-cut in Texas. Both \nprojects came from cost-shared research and development at the \nDepartment of Energy. In this bill we are including funding for solar \nindustrial research and development to bring this same technology to \nindustrial process heat, new material creation from photon \nconcentration, and some interagency cost share research on solar \ndetoxification.\n  Over 70 percent of photovoltaics are exported overseas and over 50 \npercent of wind, solar thermal, geothermal, and biomass equipment and \nservices are exported primarily to third world countries. To this end, \nthe amendment has included $1.5 million directed explicitly to continue \nthe work of the Federal interagency activity called the Committee on \nRenewable Energy Commerce and Trade [CORECT] signed into law by \nPresident Reagan to ensure that the U.S. Government coordinates its \nexport capabilities. The European Community and Japan provide \nsubsidized export financing to their respective industries and other \nincentives which equal hundreds of millions of dollars of support. The \nfunding for this program is to make U.S. Federal agencies maximize \ntheir efficiency by utilizing existing programs to promote the \nexportation of renewable energy equipment and services. Nearly 2 \nbillion people on the globe do not have access to electricity and this \nprogram has made great strides in rectifying that situation. To that \nend, three new automated manufacturing facilities in the United States \nhave been recently ribbon-cut to manufacture photovoltaics for this \ngrowing overseas market.\n  This bill also provides support to an effective program at the $1 \nmillion level for the Renewal Energy Production Incentive [REPI]. REPI \nprovides support to municipal electric utilities and rural electric \ncooperatives to utilize solar and renewable energy. This program was \nestablished under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 because at that time \nonly private utility subsidiaries could access the solar and geothermal \ntax credits. REPI allows the rest of the industry an equivalent program \nto utilize tax credits. The response from the municipal utilities and \ncooperatives has been enthusiastic and this program has over 18 \nrenewable energy projects underway.\n  Another voluntary program is also funded at $1 million level for all \nutilities to integrate renewable energy in an effort to offset \nemissions that have wrought global climate change. The Utility Climate \nChallenge Program has been supported by all of the electric utilities \nas a stellar example of the way Government should work--encouraging \ninnovation rather than command-and-control measures.\n  The final program funded is the Resource Assessment Program at $1 \nmillion. This is a program carried our primarily by the National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory [NREL] which analyzes satellite and other \ndata for those that want to know the extent of renewable energy in \ntheir area, whether that be solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal. This \nprogram can only be carried out by national laboratories and would put \nour industries at a competitive disadvantage if not explicitly funded.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is an extremely modest investment to \npreserve U.S. energy options, create U.S. jobs, and protect our \nenvironment. I commend the managers of this bill for recognizing the \nimportance of these programs and for supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I strongly support the efforts of Senator \nJeffords and Senator Roth to maintain level funding for renewable \nenergy programs. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment and join their \nefforts.\n  Mr. President, this amendment restores our investment in the future \nof sustainable energy. Unfortunately, this Congress has cut funding for \nrenewable energy by 38 percent over the last two years. These cuts are \nshortsighted. To ensure that future generations can enjoy clean energy, \nwe must maintain our commitment to support funding for research and \ndevelopment of solar, wind, and biomass energy.\n  In particular, I firmly believe that Congress has a responsibility to \nreaffirm its commitment to wind energy funding. Wind energy is now a $4 \nbillion industry in the United States. Department of Energy funding has \nbeen key to this success by developing wind energy projects for \ncommercialization.\n  In my home State of Vermont, for example, Department of Energy \nfunding for wind energy has helped develop a growing environmentally-\nfriendly industry. With DOE support, Vermont companies have developed \nstate-of-the-art wind turbines and other high technology products at \nwind energy projects in the Green Mountains of Vermont, in rural \nvillages in Alaska and even on the top of the South Pole. And these \nDOE-supported projects have become proving grounds for Vermont \ncompanies to tap into a growing wind energy export market around the \nworld.\n  But the wind energy industry in Vermont and across the country is at \na critical stage in its development. European and Asian wind \nindustries--which are heavily subsidized by their governments--are \nemerging as competitive rivals. As a result, we must continue strong \nDOE funding to maintain America's leadership role in the global wind \nenergy market.\n  Mr. President, this amendment makes sense for our future and our\n\n[[Page S9047]]\n\nchildren's future. Our children and grandchildren should be able to \nenjoy sustainable, clean and renewable energy. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5098) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will go through and make sure the \nSenators know which of their requests are in this amendment, but I will \ngo through the comprehensive amendment that takes care of many \namendments that were pending, not all of which cost money, and some of \nthese have offsets from other provisions in the bill.\n  An increase in solar and renewable energy by $2,372,000 in behalf of \nSenator Jeffords and others; stir-melter technology, Senator Lott and \nothers, $2 million; allow guards at enrichment plants to carry \nsidearms, McConnell and others; technical corrections to the USEC \nPrivatization Act regarding the Thrift Savings Plan, McConnell and \nothers; provide DOE authority to offer voluntary separation incentives, \nrequested by the Secretary; Tahoe Basin study, Senator Reid; Walker \nRiver Basin study, Senator Reid; study of the water needs of the \nCheyenne River Sioux, Daschle; language that would require 50 percent \nof the Montgomery Point lock and dam project be derived from the Inland \nWaterway trust fund, Senator Bumpers; maintenance of dredging at \nCocheco River project, Senator Smith; Mill Creek project in Ohio, half \na million dollars; Virginia Beach erosion control for the State of \nVirginia; tritium production, additional $10 million requested by the \nSenator from South Carolina; rural water system development mid-Dakota, \nfor Senators Pressler and Daschle.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Helena and vicinity, Arkansas.\n  I am happy to yield.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 5099, as Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am advised there was a pending objection by Senator \nGlenn to part of the first amendment relating to the U.S. Enrichment \nCorporation.\n  Therefore, I move to vitiate the action just taken with respect to \nthe following language. In other words, the following language of that \nfirst amendment should be deleted.\n       Insert where appropriate: Technical correction to the USEC \n     Privatization Act--Section 3110(b) of the USEC Privatization \n     Act (Public Law 104-134, title III, chapter 1, subchapter A) \n     is amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the \n     following:\n       (3) The Corporation shall pay the Thrift Savings Fund such \n     employee and agency contributions as are required or \n     authorized by sections 8432 and 8351 of title 5, United \n     States Code, for employees who elect to retain their coverage \n     under CSRS or FERS pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n  I send a modification of amendment No. 5099 to the desk deleting the \nlanguage I just read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are now ready \nfor additional amendments.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, may I also ask what the pending business is \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Johnston, for \nWellstone, amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \nbusiness be set aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5100\n\n   (Purpose: To limit funding for Appalachian Regional Commission at \n  House-passed level and require the Commission to be phased out in 5 \n                                 years)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I send an amendment to the desk\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 5100.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, line 16, strike ``$165,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$155,331,000''.\n       On page 28, line 17, at the end of the sentence, add the \n     following: ``The Commission shall provide the House and \n     Senate Appropriations Committee a specific plan for \n     downsizing.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a very moderate and a very \nstraightforward amendment. It would simply adopt the funding for the \nAppalachian Regional Commission at the House-passed level of $10 \nmillion less than the Senate level and require that the commission \nprovide a specific plan for future downsizing and elimination.\n  Mr. President, this is not a new issue. We have debated it many times \nbefore, and I offered a very similar amendment last year. The reason I \nbring it up again is simple. I want to remind the American people that \npork-barrel spending is alive and well in Washington, and Congress has \ndemonstrated little courage to phase out or eliminate these costly \ntypes of programs.\n  For a number of years, the Congressional Budget Office has \nrecommended the elimination of the ARC as one of the many options for \ndeficit reduction. Last year, both the Senate and the House passed a \nbudget resolution calling for the elimination of ARC. This year, the \nHouse budget resolution has again assumed further savings from a \nphased-in downsizing of ARC. While the House-passed appropriations bill \nprovides $155 million for the Appalachian Regional Commission and \nrequires continued downsizing, the Senate bill grants $165 million--\nthat is $10 million more than approved by the House--and it does not \naddress the question of downsizing.\n  There are no persuasive justifications for the Senate funding level. \nThe program should be terminated. Yet there appears to be no \ncongressional will to end any program once it has been authorized. That \nis why I have sought to sunset Federal programs since I came to \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in \n1965 as a temporary response to poverty in Appalachia. Let me say that \nagain. In 1965, it was created as a temporary response to poverty in \nAppalachia. Today, over 30 years later, despite the infusion of more \nthan 7 billion taxpayer dollars into the region, we are still pouring \nmoney into the area under the pretext of fighting poverty. If the \nAppalachia region is still impoverished, we should ask ourselves why we \nhave spent so much money for so many years, and why poverty in this \nregion requires still more Federal dollars than other poverty-stricken \nareas of our country.\n  We should also question the real contribution the ARC has made to any \nlong-term economic development of the Appalachia.\n  A study conducted by scholar Michael Bradshaw in 1992 might help to \nprovide us with some kind of an answer. After analyzing 25 years of \nGovernment policy in the region, Mr. Bradshaw concludes:\n\n       The great paradox of Appalachian development since 1960 is \n     that although relatively greater sums of money have been \n     invested in central Appalachia, this part of the region has \n     shown the lowest ability to increase its economic and social \n     indicators relative to the rest of the United States.\n\n  The region as a whole has made strides over the past 25 years toward \nimproving conditions for attracting new sources of employment, but Mr. \nBradshaw goes on to say that ``these changes have had more to do with \nexternal economic factors than with the influence of the ARC.''\n  Now, in the 1980's, there was strong growth in the area which \nmirrored the economic growth of the country at large. During this time, \nARC funding was reduced by 40 percent. Did the region suffer? On the \ncontrary. Taxes were cut and unemployment rates fell by 38 percent.\n  That is how President Kennedy created jobs back in the 1960's, that \nis how President Reagan created jobs in the 1980's, and that is how we \nneed to create jobs as we approach the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, what does not make any sense about this program is \nthat it is one of 62 Federal economic development programs that are \nunder the jurisdiction of 18 different departments and agencies. Yet \nthe ARC is the only major Government agency targeted toward a specific \nregion of the country. Many of the projects funded by the ARC duplicate \nactivities are already funded by other Federal agencies.\n  For instance, the $104 million Appalachian highway development \nproject provided by the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill \nalso falls under the jurisdiction of the Transportation Department's \nFederal highway program. Other projects of the ARC are funded by \nagencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n  As one Member of Congress rightly pointed out, ``What the Appalachian \nRegional Commission does is essentially allow 13 States in this country \nto double dip into infrastructure money, money to do economic \ndevelopment and money also to do highway and water construction and \nprojects like that.''\n  While the ARC claims to allocate funds for the poor rural communities \nof Appalachia, these areas are no worse off than rural communities in \nMinnesota, in Arizona, or the 35 other States that do not benefit from \nARC funding. In fact, in my home State of Minnesota, 12.8 percent of my \nconstituents live below the poverty level, and that is a disturbing \nstatistic. It is higher than many States which benefit from the ARC \nfunding, such as Virginia, which is at 9.4 percent; Maryland, at 11.6; \nPennsylvania, at 11.7; and Ohio, at 12.6 percent.\n  So these States benefit from ARC funding because of poverty levels, \nyet my home State of Minnesota, which does not, of course, enjoy ARC \nfunding, is at 12.8 percent. But do Minnesotans have a Federal program \ndesigned just for them? Of course not, and I am not advocating that we \nshould.\n  To pay for something like the ARC on a nationwide basis would require \nbillions of dollars, funded either by cutting more from other programs, \nborrowing money from our children, increasing the deficit, or by \nraising taxes. The first option is unlikely. The remaining three are \ncompletely unacceptable. Already, for every dollar the taxpayers of my \nState send to the Federal Treasury, they receive only 82 cents of \nGovernment services. For every dollar they send to the Federal \nTreasury, Minnesotans receive only 82 cents worth of the Government's \nservices, but the States which benefit from ARC funding receive on \naverage $1.21 for every tax dollar they contribute.\n  So for every dollar they send in, they get $1.21 back from \nWashington, while in my State of Minnesota, for every dollar we send \nin, we get 82 cents back.\n\n[[Page S9049]]\n\n  Minnesota has been a good neighbor and has contributed more than its \nfair share, but when Minnesotans see $750,000 of ARC funds spent on a \nsummer practice stadium for the National Football League's Carolina \nPanthers, this is a huge slap in the face.\n  My point, Mr. President, is not that Minnesota and other States with \nhigh poverty levels in this country should get more Federal assistance \nbut that there is a compelling reason to reduce the funding for ARC and \ncompelling reasons to continue downsizing a program that has outlived \nits original mandate. It is ineffective, it is expensive, and it simply \ndoes not work.\n  American taxpayers can no longer afford such extravagant spending. It \nis time to let this important region of our country benefit from the \nsame myriad of programs that serve other poverty areas. These programs \ncan be improved and streamlined to help stimulate economic development \nand thereby provide needed Federal assistance to all of the country. \nOur first priority, however, is to balance our budget, provide tax \ncredits for working Americans, and to create an environment that will \nstimulate job growth and help to boost all salaries.\n  So, Mr. President, although I strongly believe that the ARC should be \nterminated, my amendment does not zero out funding for the ARC, nor \ndoes it reduce it significantly, but it simply reduces the level of \nfunding to that already approved by the House, and that is to take the \n$165 million in the Senate bill and to match it with the $155 million \ncurrently in the House bill.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this moderate amendment. Congress \nshould show the American people at least a little courage by slowing \ndown this Federal spending ``Energizer Bunny,'' or we could say the \n``Energizer Piggy,'' which keeps going on and going on and going on.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add Senator McCain as an original \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Domenici). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. If there is no further debate, I ask for the yeas and nays \non my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nappropriations bill, and I thank the manager of the bill, the able \nSenator from New Mexico, who is currently the Presiding Officer of the \nSenate, Senator Domenici, for his tremendous leadership on these issues \ndealing with energy and water, and the senior Senator from Louisiana, \nBennett Johnston, noting that this will be the culmination of his \nservice in the Senate. He will be greatly missed because of the \nexpertise and experience and enthusiasm that he brings to today's \nissues of energy and natural resources. A wealth of knowledge goes with \nhim and with him our best wishes as well.\n  The fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill provides \nfunding for some of the highest priority Federal responsibilities. For \nexample, the bill provides a total of $5.6 billion, an increase of $205 \nmillion above the budget request for the Department of Energy's defense \nenvironmental management program. The DOE defense environmental \nmanagement program includes the safe handling and the treatment of some \nof the most toxic materials on this planet Earth such as spent nuclear \nfuel, high-level liquid waste and surplus weapons grade plutonium--\ncertainly the appropriate use of funds and in fact the addition of \nthese funds.\n  The budget increase recommended by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee is consistent with the increase authorized by the defense \nauthorization bill passed by the Senate just a few weeks ago. The \npending appropriations bill provides increases for important programs \nin Idaho including an increase in funding for the Department of \nEnergy's national spent nuclear fuel program.\n  In testimony earlier this year, Secretary O'Leary acknowledged that \nthe Idaho National Engineering Laboratory had been designated as the \nDOE lead lab for the spent nuclear fuel program but additional funds to \nmeet these new responsibilities had not been provided.\n  The bill now before the Senate addresses this shortfall. The pending \nbill also provides $200 million to move forward with the effort to open \na permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain. In \nlight of the ongoing Senate debate regarding the Craig bill, this \nfunding, which represents a 32 percent increase over the fiscal year \n1996 level, is certainly appropriate and needed.\n  The bill also provides almost $4 billion, an increase of $269 \nmillion, for the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons program. These \nfunds are essential to ensure that our nuclear stockpile remains safe \nand reliable.\n  The pending bill also funds important energy functions of the \nDepartment of Energy. The bill provides $20 million for the \nelectrometallurgical demonstration program at Argonne National Lab. \nThis important program to treat DOE spent nuclear fuel for final \ndisposition is reduced by $5 million from the budget request. I will \naddress this reduction with the chairman and the ranking member at the \nappropriate time.\n  I want to offer my praise for the funding levels provided in this \nbill and to the leadership, again, of the two managers of this bill. \nThe funding increase for the defense environmental management program \nwill expedite cleanup and remediation at sites like INEL, Savannah \nRiver, and Hanford, and save American taxpayers money in the long run. \nThese funds will show the American people that this Senate will deal \nwith the environmental challenges left over from our victory in the \ncold war.\n  I urge adoption of the pending bill and thank the managers again for \nthis time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n    the pacific ocean division office, u.s. army corps of engineers\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the managers of this \nbill for including my language in committee to prohibit the Army Corps \nof Engineers from obligating funds to close the Pacific Ocean Division \n[POD] office.\n  The Pacific Ocean Division has the largest civil works jurisdictional \narea, covering almost a one-third of the globe. Maintaining the POD \noffice is very important to the United States' ability to deliver \ncritical military and civil works assistance to our allies in the Asia-\nPacific region.\n  The POD has been characterized as a model of efficiency and \neffectiveness, particularly in military construction. In this age of \nrestructuring to improve efficiency, the Army Corps of Engineers \nproposal seems to undermine these goals.\n  I have requested that the Army Corps of Engineers provide me with a \ndetailed cost/benefit analysis justifying closing the POD. I have not \nbeen provided with this analysis. Until an analysis is provided that \ndemonstrates that the POD is not a model of efficiency and \neffectiveness, I will fight to see that the POD remains open.\n  I request that the chairman and ranking member make every effort to \nensure that the Senate position is maintained in conference with the \nHouse.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \nbipartisan bill. It contains funding for many programs and projects \nimportant to our Nation and my region. I thank Chairman Domenici and \nSenator Johnston--and their very capable staffs--for the superb jobs \nthey have done.\n  Cleanup and restoration of the Hanford site is one of my top \npriorities. In this bill, the Department of Energy's Environmental \nManagement program is well funded. While I disagree with the allocation \nof resources between defense and nondefense programs in the majority's \nbudget, I appreciate that some of that extra defense money goes to \nworthwhile programs, like environmental management.\n  One aspect of the EM program that continues to trouble me is the \napproach the Department has taken to privatization at Hanford. I \nappreciate the subcommittee's effort to minimize the impact of \nprivatization by suggesting that only $150 million, rather than $185 \nmillion, be taken from the tank farm operating budget in order to\n\n[[Page S9050]]\n\nmake a down payment on the tank waste remediation program. Senators \nGorton, Domenici, Johnston, and I have sent a letter to the Department \nasking a number of questions about this approach to privatization. \nWhile I am a supporter of privatization, I believe sweeping changes \nmust be well thought out and should not harm ongoing efforts to \nstabilize the tank farms.\n  Mr. President, this administration has done a terrific job of moving \nHanford cleanup forward. For years, Hanford has been largely a money \nhole into which enormous Federal dollars were thrown, but little was \naccomplished. I want to recognize the accomplishments of Secretary \nO'Leary's Department of Energy and the people at Hanford who have done \nsuch an outstanding job of reducing costs and increasing results.\n  Let me share some of the latest results at Hanford.\n  There are several specific cleanup programs that have made \nsignificant progress recently. One of those is at the Plutonium Uranium \nExtraction [PUREX] Plant where the criticality system was shut off \nforever last month. The alarm is not necessary because there is no \nlonger a chance of a nuclear accident at the 40-year-old plant. This \nshows tremendous progress and is evidence of the dedication of Hanford \nemployees--who reached this goal 16 months ahead of schedule and $47 \nmillion under budget.\n  The K-basin's spent fuel project is also on track. The canister \nstorage building is 15 percent complete and the managers estimate they \ncan begin large-scale spent fuel removal by December 1997. At that \ntime, fuel will be removed from both K-basins to be cleaned, loaded \ninto baskets, placed in multi-canister overpacks, dried in a cold \nvacuum, and placed in the canister storage building. Already, several \nhundred spent fuel canisters have been removed and cleaned; and the \nsystem is working as planned. Another point of interest is that project \nacceleration decisions made and implemented in 1995 have saved $350 \nmillion and will allow the project to be completed 4 years early. This \nis great progress.\n  The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is in the final stages of \nconstruction of the new Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory \n[EMSL]. The lab is a critical component of our efforts to develop the \nscientific understanding needed to create innovative and cost-effective \ntechnologies for environmental remediation. EMSL scientists will \nresearch soil and water quality, waste characterization, processing, \nand health effects. This state-of-the-art facility will complement the \nHanford cleanup mission and make a positive contribution to many of our \nmost troubling environmental and pollution problems.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the commitment of this body and the \nadministration to the cleanup of former defense production sites, like \nHanford. I pledge to work with my colleagues to see that progress \ncontinues and that the Federal Government fulfills its responsibility \nto the people of this Nation who fought and won the cold war.\n  I would also like to voice my strong support for an amendment offered \nby Senator Jeffords regarding funding for renewable energy. In the last \n2 years, funding for wind, solar, and other renewable energy research \nand development programs has been cut by almost 40 percent. Last year, \nthe Senate restored some of the funding for these important programs, \nbut eventually the renewables program lost ground in conference with \nthe House. I want to lend my voice to many of my colleagues who support \nrenewable energy and see such programs as a critical component of the \nFederal Government's commitment to future generations and a healthy \nenvironment.\n  Again, I thank Senators Domenici and Johnston for their work on this \nimportant bill and urge my colleagues to support final passage.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with the consent of the manager, if no one \nis here to offer amendments or speak on the bill, I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed for 10 minutes as in morning business, with the \nunderstanding that if someone comes to present an amendment, I will be \nhappy to relinquish the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the courtesy of the managers. Again, \nbusiness on the bill itself takes precedence. I will not continue if \nsomeone comes to do business on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9038-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9050-S9052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ELECTIONEERING VERSUS DAY-TO-DAY ISSUES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

It is pretty \nhard to keep up with them, because they come in significant waves.\n  I want to use the time for a couple of minutes to talk about the \ndifference between what we confront in the electioneering, or the \npolitical efforts these days, and what the American people expect us to \nconfront in terms of the issues they face day-to-day.\n  If one were to view the activities from time to time, especially when \nwe get 1 hour or 2 hours set aside for a couple of my friends from the \nother side of the aisle who then recruit several others, as was the \ncase today, and have five, six or seven people come and repeat a \nmessage to try to get that message out to the country, it is kind of \nlike watching beavers build a dam: They slap their tails, they are out \nthere gnawing, chewing and biting and knocking down trees.\n  In this case, however, it is interesting. These are, it seems to me, \npolitical beavers building a dam where there is no water, which I find \ninteresting. Slapping the water and chewing on dead wood seems hardly \nproductive to me, but it is a way to pass the day for some, I suppose.\n  Most people sitting at home these days look at this political system \nof ours and say, ``Why can't you all work together?'' We have an \nOlympics going on, and in the Olympics, what is interesting is they all \nwear jerseys, and the jerseys identify one team versus another team.\n  I particularly have enjoyed watching various sports in the Olympics \nand, I must confess, I root for all the athletes. I think it is a \nwonderful thing to see these young men and women, in some cases older \nmen and women, compete, but I, like most others, especially want those \npeople who wear the red, white and blue jerseys to do very well, \nbecause they compete with a little logo that says ``USA.'' They are all \non the same team.\n  The American people elect different kinds of men and women to the \nU.S. House and Senate. My guess is they expect us to all be on the same \nteam. We might all have different techniques, different strengths, and \ndifferent approaches, but they really do, in the long term, at the end \nof the day expect us to be working for the same ends.\n  We can, I suppose, spend most of our energy being critical and \nchewing away and gnawing away and flailing away, but it hardly seems \nvery productive.\n\n  We have been working on a number of things in this Congress which I \nthink are interesting. The Federal deficit: Some say unless you put \nsomething in the Constitution, you have not addressed the Federal \ndeficit issue. Yet, the Federal deficit has been coming down, way down, \nand that is good news.\n  We have some people who rush to the floor to explain why one person \nor\n\n[[Page S9051]]\n\nsomeone else should not gain credit for that. But nonetheless, the \nFederal budget deficit has come down very, very substantially.\n  We have been working on health care issues, the need for the American \npeople to have Congress address the issue of being able to take your \nhealth care from one job to another and not lose coverage because you \nchange jobs or find you can't get health care because your child or \nyour spouse or someone in your family has a preexisting condition. \nThose are very important issues, and I think we finally made progress. \nIt has taken a long, long while, but I think we are going to have a \nhealth care bill that finally gets done and gets signed by the \nPresident.\n  That would be a significant accomplishment. I hope we don't have much \nfoot dragging in the coming weeks with respect to that issue, because \nthat is something the American people want and need.\n  We have been working on the issue of the minimum wage. Some say there \nshouldn't even be a minimum wage. If you believe that, why don't you \nbring a bill to the floor to repeal the minimum wage?\n  There are some around here who say we do not want a minimum wage, let \nthe market system set the wage; let 12-year-olds work for 12 cents an \nhour. I heard some people suggest that, by the way, not here on the \nfloor of the Senate. But there are some people in this political debate \nwho believe there should be no minimum wage at all. If you believe \nthat, bring a bill to the floor. Why don't you represent a position \nthat hearkens back to half a century ago and say, in your judgment, \nthere ought not be a minimum wage?\n  Some of us think that there ought to be a minimum wage. We have had \none now for some 60 years. The question is, when should it be adjusted?\n  The last time the people at the bottom rung of the economic ladder \ngot a raise was 7 years ago, in 1989, when the Congress last enacted \nlegislation adjusting the minimum wage.\n  There are some who say, ``Well, if you adjust the minimum wage, it is \ngoing to cost a lot of lost jobs.'' The interesting thing about that \nis, I have not heard anyone suggest when the CEO's of major U.S. \ncorporations get a 23-percent increase in their salaries in 1 year--a \n23-percent increase in 1 year--I have never heard someone say, ``Gee, \nthat's going to cost lost jobs.'' But take someone at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder working at minimum wage and suggest after 7 years they \nget a very small increase--not 23 percent in 1 year, but a freeze for 7 \nyears and then a small increase--and all of a sudden the sky is \nfalling.\n  We have worked on that, and I am pleased to say, finally, that those \nwho were holding that bill hostage have seen the light. We are moving \nthat. I hope maybe by the end of this week we can have a bill passed \nthat addresses that issue.\n  Let me mention one other thing that is in that piece of legislation. \nWe attached to that piece of legislation something helpful to small \nbusiness, and I am for that. There are a series of tax changes helpful \nto small business, but there is a provision--and I bet there are not \nfive Members of the Senate who know it is there--a provision that comes \nfrom the House, and here it is:\n  It is a provision called 956(A) dealing with the Tax Code. That \nprovision says, ``Let's make it easier for companies to invest in jobs \noverseas.'' The Congress already passed that once, by the way, and the \nPresident vetoed that in a larger bill. But let's make it easier for \nAmerican companies to create jobs overseas as opposed to jobs here.\n  I am interested to know whether the Senate conferees will accept that \nprovision of the House, which is a terrible provision. I have no idea \nhow anyone thinking clearly could believe that repealing this \nprovision, 956(A), which we did 3 years ago to try to tighten up on the \nloophole that exists to encourage people to move their jobs overseas, I \nhave no idea how people believe it is in this country's interest to \nmake it more attractive for companies to move their jobs overseas.\n  That is something we are going to have to watch, because if it comes \nback to the Senate, some of us are going to be very upset and very \naggressive.\n  Let me, Mr. President, say those are the issues that make sense. I \nmean, those are the issues we ought to be dealing with--health care, \nminimum wage, economic growth, the deficit.\n  There will be economic growth figures out at the end of this week, \nboth unemployment and GDP figures. The interesting thing about our \ncountry today is if it shows that the country is growing well and has a \nrobust economic growth figure for the last quarter, if it shows that \nmore people are working, we have fewer unemployed, what is going to \nhappen? Well, if what has happened in the last year will happen again, \nWall Street will have an apoplectic seizure and look for windows to \njump out of. They will want to find a doorway to the roof, I suppose.\n  The slightest bit of good economic news creates, on Wall Street, some \nkind of enormous sense of sadness and sorrow and concern, and all of a \nsudden, we see stock prices drop, bond prices drop. I do not have any \nidea why they seem to be out of step with the interests of the rest of \nthe country. I guess they think if we have any kind of good economic \nnews at all, they are worried that over the horizon we will have more \ninflation. They are wrong about that.\n  The fact is, wages in this country are going down, not coming up, \nhave been going down consistently for about 20 years. So we do not have \nthe threat of more inflation. What we have is a threat of our economy \nnot producing enough, not growing enough in order to produce the kind \nof robust opportunity that we want for the American people. But those \nare the central issues. Those are the issues we ought to be dealing \nwith.\n  You know, the reason I came over today, after five people have talked \nabout the subject of President Clinton again, is, we have, it seems to \nme, created in American politics an infection of sorts, an infection \nthat suggests that we always have to be sawing away, always have to be \nchipping away and sawing away and gnawing away and biting away, or \nsomehow we are not doing the public's work. That is not the public's \nwork at all. That is the newly defined vision of American politics that \nI think is fundamentally wrong.\n  There was, a couple of years ago, something put out by this new wave \nof politicians who took control in the last year or so, last couple of \nyears. There was a primer put out by an organization called GOPAC, and \nthey put out tapes. They had instructional sessions for candidates. \nThey put out a primer: ``Here is how you talk. Here is what you say. \nHere is how you appeal to people.'' In it, they did something that I \nbasically consider reprehensible. They said, ``When you talk about \nyourself, you use contrasting words for yourself. Always try to use the \nwords like `hard work, toughness, flag, family, country.' '' They said, \n``When you talk about your opponent, whenever you are talking about \nyour opponent, you need to use the terms `sick, permissive, pathetic, \ntraitor.' ''\n  This is an organization, incidentally, that has been winning. They \nwon the last election. This organization trained the candidates that \nwon the last election. The training manual says: ``If you're dealing \nwith your opponents, call them sick, pathetic, traitor,'' fundamentally \ncorrupting the American process, I say. That is not what the political \nprocess ought to be about.\n  Calling your opponents traitors, sick, pathetic--what is sick and \npathetic is the new style and the new brand of politics that believes \nthis advances the public interest in this country.\n  What advances the public interest in this country is, if and when \nboth sides in the two major political parties finally come to the same \npoint and are addressing the same central issues, even in different \nways--jobs, education, health care, the environment, family farming. \nWhen both sides are addressing them, even if they have substantially \ndifferent views, they are at least addressing the public's business, at \nleast addressing the things that most American families want to see the \nCongress address.\n  But when they are off always sawing away at the bottom of the tree, \nalways biting and nibbling, always trying to figure out how you can \nsimply destroy the base somehow, it seems to me you can hardly be \ncalled builders, you can hardly be called--in the tradition of those \nwho always believed there would be enough people to make this system\n\n[[Page S9052]]\n\nwork--hardly be called constructive builders who participate in helping \nbuild the political system that the American people want.\n\n  My hope is that in the coming weeks--we have just 1 week left before \nthere is an August break, and then about 4 or 5 weeks left before we \nwill adjourn for the election--my hope is that during that time we will \nsee substantially more cooperation, substantially less confrontation, \nand legislation enacted by the House and the Senate that addresses the \ncentral questions of people's concerns. I mentioned a few of them. Are \nthey safe? Can they walk the streets? What about crime? Do they have \njobs for themselves and their children? Does the education system work? \nAre our schools good enough? If not, what will make them better?\n  Can we fix the health care system to deal with preexisting conditions \nand portability of health care coverage, and make health care \naffordable for all people? Can we address the issue of those frozen at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder working for very low wages who have \nbeen frozen for 7 years? Can we adjust the minimum wage?\n  Those are the central kinds of questions that if the Congress does \naddress, will, I think, relate to the concerns of most of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. My hope is that, although we \nare going to run through some appropriations bills this week, my hope \nis that a number of these other issues coming out of conference will be \naddressed as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9050-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I want to take just a couple of minutes, I \nwill be very brief, to make a point to those managing this legislation.\n  My understanding is an amendment has been noticed dealing with the \nissue of Lake Traverse. I want it to be clear that if an amendment is \noffered on Lake Traverse, I will oppose that amendment.\n  The issue is a lake in South Dakota. There is some concern about the \nwater level in that lake. The water level and the amount of water held \nfor flood control disadvantages people around Lake Traverse. It is also \ntrue, that Lake Traverse is used less for flood control and as the lake \nwater level is lowered, more water would be flushed out of the lake and \ninto the Red River, adversely affecting a good number of communities \nalong the Red River.\n  We did have a meeting with the St. Paul District, Corps of Engineers \nfolks and the staffs of a number of congressional delegations about \nwhat kind of collaborative effort could be developed to make sure the \ninterests of all parties are resolved in an appropriate way.\n  Legislation introduced here in the Senate, if such an amendment is \nintroduced, would represent a unilateral way to do this. I will not \nsupport that.\n  It seems to me we have a circumstance where a lake project was \nauthorized many, many years ago for the purpose of flood control. I \nunderstand some of the controversy about it. If the Congress is going \nto instruct the Corps to manage that lake in a way that diminishes \nopportunity for flood control, then the question is, who is going to \nbear the cost of that?\n  There will be a number of communities in North Dakota and Minnesota \nup on the Red River that will bear the cost of it. To the extent this \nproblem is addressed and resolved, it must be resolved in a \ncollaborative way, not through this kind of legislation.\n  If such an amendment is offered and I understand one has been \nreferenced, I intend to oppose it. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON.

Mr. President, I am sending to the desk a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on behalf of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and others regarding the United States-Japan \nsemiconductor trade agreement which is set to expire on July 31 of this \nyear.\n  His resolution, after recounting the history of this agreement, \nresolves that: It is the sense of the Senate that, if a new United \nStates-Japan semiconductor agreement is not concluded by July 31 of \nthis year, that, first, it ensures continued calculation of foreign \nmarket share in Japan according to the formula set forth in the current \nagreement, and, second, provides for continuation of current measures \nto deter renewed dumping of semiconductors in the United States and in \nthird country markets, the President shall do three things: First, \ndirect the Office of the Trade Representative to provide for unilateral \nUnited States Government calculation and publication of the foreign \nshare of the Japanese semiconductor market, according to the formula \nset forth in the current agreement; second, report to the Congress on a \nquarterly basis regarding the progress, or lack thereof, in increasing \nforeign market access to the Japanese semiconductor market; and, third, \ntake all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure that all United \nStates trade laws with respect to foreign market access and injurious \ndumping are expeditiously and vigorously enforced with respect to the \nUnited States-Japan semiconductor trade.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement is set to \n     expire on July 31, 1996;\n       The Governments of the United States and Japan are \n     currently engaged in negotiations over the terms of a new \n     U.S.-Japan agreement on semiconductors;\n       The President of the United States and the Prime Minister \n     of Japan agreed to the G-7 Summit in June that their two \n     governments should conclude a mutually acceptable outcome of \n     the semiconductor dispute by July 31, 1996, and that there \n     should be a continuing role for the two governments in the \n     new agreement;\n       The current U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement has \n     put in place both government-to-government and industry-to-\n     industry mechanisms which have played a vital role in \n     allowing cooperation in replace conflict in these important \n     high technology sector such as by providing for joint \n     calculation of foreign market share in Japan, deterrence of \n     dumping, and promotion of industrial cooperation in the \n     designing of foreign semiconductor devices;\n\n[[Page S9053]]\n\n       Despite the increased foreign share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market since 1986, a gap still remains between \n     the share U.S. and other foreign semiconductor makers are \n     able to capture in the world market outside of Japan through \n     their competitiveness and the sales of these suppliers in the \n     Japanese market, and that gap is consistent across the full \n     range of semiconductor products as well as a full range of \n     end-use applications;\n       The competitiveness and health of the U.S. semiconductor \n     industry is of critical importance to the United States' \n     overall economic well-being as well as the nation's high \n     technology defense capabilities;\n       The economic interests of both the United States and Japan \n     are best served by well-functioning, open markets and \n     deterrence of dumping in all sectors, including \n     semiconductors;\n       The Government of Japan continues to oppose an agreement \n     that (1) ensures continued calculation of foreign market \n     share in Japan according to the formula set forth in the \n     current agreement, and (2) provides for continuation of \n     current measures to deter renewed dumping of semiconductors \n     in the United States and in the third country markets; and\n       The United States Senate on June 19, 1996, unanimously \n     adopted a sense of the Senate resolution that the President \n     should take all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure \n     the continuation of a government-to-government U.S.-Japan \n     semiconductor trade agreement before the current agreement \n     expires on July 31, 1996:\n\n     SEC. 2.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that if a new U.S.-Japan \n     Semiconductor Agreement is not concluded by July 31, 1996, \n     that (a) ensures continued calculation of foreign market \n     share in Japan according to the formula set forth in the \n     current agreement, and (b) provides for continuation of \n     current measures to deter renewed dumping of semiconductors \n     in the United States and in third country markets, the \n     President shall--\n       (1) Direct the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representative and the Department of Commerce to establish a \n     system to provide for unilateral U.S. Government calculation \n     and publication of the foreign share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market, according to the formula set forth in \n     the current agreement;\n       (2) Report to the Congress on a quarterly basis regarding \n     the progress, or lack thereof, in increasing foreign market \n     access to the Japanese semiconductor market; and\n       (3) Take all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure \n     that all U.S. trade laws with respect to foreign market \n     access and injurious dumping are expeditiously and vigorously \n     enforced with respect to U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade, as \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that is \nthe result of the calendar. I appreciate, therefore, the cooperation \nfrom the bill managers in allowing us to use the Energy-Water \nappropriations bill as a vehicle for drawing attention to an important \nissue for Americans. Today is July 29, and in 2 days, on July 31, the \nSemiconductor Agreement between the governments of the United States \nand Japan expires.\n  That is why I rise, on behalf of myself, and Senators Craig, Byrd, \nKempthorne, Bingaman, Domenici, and Boxer to offer a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that if our negotiators are unable \nto reach a compromise on this important issue with the Government of \nJapan, that we should continue calculating the foreign share of the \nJapanese semiconductor market--with or without their formal \ncooperation. We need to do this in order to ensure continued access to \nthe Japanese market, and to prevent illegal dumping into our market.\n  Since 1986, when the first Semiconductor Agreement was signed, the \nU.S. share of the Japanese market has grown from 8.5 percent to a \nlittle more than 17 percent. The United States share of the world \nmarket, excluding Japan, is about 54 percent. Mr. President, each point \nof the Japanese market is worth about $420 million in sales to the \nAmerican economy and jobs, which translates into about $46.2 million in \nincreased research and development, and $63 million in new capital \ninvestment. With numbers like that, I think it is clear how important \nit is that we ensure continued American access to the Japanese \nsemiconductor market.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that we would start off this week \nexpressing relief that a new agreement between Japan and the United \nStates has been reached. But unfortunately, that has not happened yet. \nThis remains an example of a situation in which American trade \nnegotiators still are unable to succeed in convincing their Japanese \ncounterparts that it is in our mutual interest to resolve a trade-\nrelated issue that is about market access and ensuring fair trade.\n  What surprises me is that industry on both sides of the Pacific, and \naround the world, have generally applauded the two Semiconductor \nAgreements. Things have come a long way since 1986, when the first \nSemiconductor Agreement was reached and the U.S. semiconductor industry \nwas on death's door. Since then, that agreement and the subsequent 1991 \nagreement, along with initiatives like Sematech, have helped American \nindustry regain its footing and become the world leader that it is \ntoday. Markets around the world are expanding, profits are up, and the \noutlook for the entire industry is good.\n\n  But this period of improving market access for the U.S. semiconductor \nmarket and injecting more fairness in our trade relationship has also \nbeen short enough that we still need another agreement to avoid \nsetbacks or suprises that could otherwise easily confront us and \nescalate trade-related tension unnecessarily.\n  Because the stakes are so high, I offer this Sense-of-the-Senate \nResolution to call for appropriate action that should be taken if an \nagreement is not reached. Our resolution says: if an agreement on \nsemiconductors is not reached by July 31--the date when the current \nagreement expires, and the date that Prime Minister Hashimoto agreed \nto--then the United States should unilaterally establish a system to \nmonitor the Japanese semiconductor market, and report to Congress on a \nquarterly basis the progress, or lack thereof, in increasing foreign \naccess to the Japanese semiconductor market.\n  I have spent many years studying and working on issues involving \nJapan, especially in the trade area. For that reason, I have watched \nthe semiconductor agreement with keen interest. Many observers think or \ntalk of this particular issue as one that just affects the businesses \nand communities tied to making this technology. But we are actually \ntalking about a product often called chips that play a key role in the \ncondition and prospects of many other industries. This type of chips, \nthese semiconductors, form the guts of all those things shaped out of \nthe steel that my State of West Virginia produces, along with plastics \nand practically everything else that makes our trains run on time, \ninflates the airbags in our cars, makes the elevator stop on our \nfloors, and of course, powers our computers.\n  My State does not have an Intel or a Motorola that actually makes the \nchips. But West Virginia and many other states have industries that \nfall somewhere in what is called the high technology food chain. \nSemiconductors are the result of companies and workers who make and \nprovide the materials that go into the end-product--sophisticated chips \nthat make the United States one of the world's powerhouses in high-\ntech, and generate business and profits for many other industries \naround the country.\n  Earlier this month, I visited PPG Industries in West Virginia. PPG \nstarted more than 100 years ago as the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. They \nare still one of the leading flat glass companies in the world, but \nthey no longer resemble their ancestor of the 19th century, or even the \nearly 20th century. They are a 21st century company that makes high \nperformance thermoplastics that go into the housing for Pentium chips--\nthe most advanced semiconductors in today's personal computers [PC's]. \nWhen Japan buys more American made semiconductors and computers, the \nbenefits are reaped all the way down the high technology food chain to \ncompanies like PPG.\n  My hope is that Japan will see how they benefit, in so many ways, \nfrom finding common ground with the United States in settling our trade \ndisputes and maintaining the fair and open trade arrangements we seek \nin the case of semiconductors. The United States and Japan have deep, \nmeaningful ties with one another, from our security relationship which \nforms the bedrock of security and stability in East Asia to the leading \nrole we both play in the world's economy. We must continue as friends \nand as major economic players\n\n[[Page S9054]]\n\nin the world to try to make bilateral trade another area where we \nresolve our differences, adhere to the principle of reciprocity and \nfairness, and play by the same rules. In the case of semiconductors, \nthe United States should not be asked to risk going back to the days, \nfrom not very long ago, when we could not reach the Japanese market \nwith products that are the best in the world. I hope Japan will soon \nagree, but until that happens, I offer this resolution to highlight \nAmericans' stake in the outcome and to propose the steps that should be \ntaken to protect our economic interests.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment on \nour side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5101) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 5099 to Amendment No. 5098, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, earlier this afternoon, Senator Domenici \nintroduced an amendment on his behalf and on my behalf a second-degree \namendment, and later we struck a paragraph of that amendment. I now, \nMr. President, would like to further correct our action.\n  On the first page of amendment No. 5098 to S. 1959, on the first page \nwe should strike the following language--strike the paragraph that \nbegins: ``Insert where appropriate: `Maintenance of Security' '' et \ncetera, and ending with the phrase: ``Security at the Gaseous Diffusion \nPlants;''.\n  I would like to vitiate that action with respect to that paragraph.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, did we not do that?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We took out part of it but not all of it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that there is a McConnell amendment, and \nwe have the right in his behalf of offering it freestanding. Now, as \nsoon as we contact him, we will in short order offer it. This would not \npreclude us from offering that; is that correct? I ask a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Just a moment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the first stacked \nrollcall vote, each remaining vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think we have appropriately reserved \nwhat everyone wanted us to preserve and protect, and if I understand \ncorrectly--and perhaps Senator Johnston can listen and see if I am \nright--Senator Grams' amendment on the Appalachian Regional Commission \nis not provided for in this. Therefore, it will be taken up in due \ncourse tomorrow. But none of this agreement with reference to time \nlimits and/or amendments applies.\n\n[[Page S9055]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand Senator McCain has an amendment pending \nstriking section 503. It has not been disposed of, or provided for, I \nshould say, in this unanimous consent request. So unless we can dispose \nof it, it will be pending also tomorrow. I understand that on the \nDemocratic side, you are trying to get Senator Feingold, if he can, to \ncome to the floor with reference to an Animas LaPlata amendment.\n  Is there any hope that that will be forthcoming soon, Senator \nFeingold on Animas LaPlata?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I am advised he has an amendment, but we do not have a \ncopy of it.\n  We are advised he is on his way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. There has been time provided for Senator \nCampbell in a previous unanimous consent agreement, but I believe if \nthe amendment is offered tonight, the Senator has the privilege of 10 \nminutes in opposition to it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5095\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I send a letter to the desk addressed to \nme dated today and signed by Terry R. Lash, Director of the Office of \nNuclear Energy, Science and Technology, which details the principal \narguments against terminating the advanced light water reactor program \nand, among other things, points out that in the fifth year of a 5-year \nprogram, the cost to terminate this program would exceed the \nGovernment's obligation, which is $22 million in this budget. So it \nwould seem foolhardy at best to do so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 29, 1996.\n     Hon. J. Bennett Johnston,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Energy and Water \n         Development, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnston: We are pleased to respond to your \n     request for additional information about our Advanced Light \n     Water Reactor (ALWR) program. As we indicated in our recent \n     letter to Senator Domenici, the Department of Energy opposes \n     the amendment to eliminate funding for the ALWR program from \n     the FY 1997 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill. \n     This amendment appears to be based on several important \n     misconceptions about the Department's ALWR program.\n       One misconception is that it is ``corporate welfare.'' We \n     strongly disagree with this characterization. The program \n     uses limited federal funds to encourage U.S. industry to \n     pursue R that is clearly in the long-term interests of the \n     United States. The preservation of the nuclear energy option \n     is vital to the future energy supply in this country.\n       In addition to serving the national interest, this program \n     is designed such that industry provides the majority of \n     program funding. With the Department's leadership, a unique \n     alliance of electric utilities, technology vendors, and \n     government have come together to conduct a highly focused and \n     goal-oriented technology development program. Since the ALWR \n     program began in 1986, the Department has conducted $800 \n     million in program activities with a taxpayer investment of \n     only $300 million. Further, the federal government will \n     receive reimbursements when the technology developed by the \n     FOAKE program is sold. For example, the federal government \n     should receive approximately $3 million from General Electric \n     as a result of its sale of ABWRs to Taiwan (which, unlike the \n     plants GE previously sold to Japan, are based on technology \n     developed by the Department's program). Westinghouse Electric \n     Corporation has agreed to pay $25 million to the government \n     with the sale of its first AP600 to repay design \n     certification funding and an additional $4 million for each \n     reactor sold to repay federal FOAKE contributions.\n       Second, critics of the program have stated that the \n     program's authority under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 \n     (EPACT) ends in FY 1996. In truth, the EPACT limits the \n     First-of-A-Kind Engineering (FOAKE) program to five years and \n     limits total program funding to $100 million. The EPACT \n     became law in fiscal year 1993. The Department is, therefore, \n     fully authorized under the EPACT to apply funds to the FOAKE \n     program in FY 1997. Further, the Department has spent only \n     about $82 million on the FOAKE activity program since it \n     began in 1992. There have been significant increases in \n     program cost, but these have been absorbed by industry. In \n     any event, the Department's General Counsel has determined \n     that the Department is also fully authorized by the Atomic \n     Energy Act to conduct nuclear energy research and development \n     programs and the EPACT does not limit this authority.\n       Third, there have been recent statements to the effect that \n     there is no U.S. utility interested in building new ALWRs. In \n     our view, the fact that the electric utility industry has \n     provided hundreds of millions of dollars to conduct ALWR \n     activities indicates that utility executives remain \n     interested in the nuclear option. The Department is aware of \n     an invalid recent survey which indicates that 89 percent of \n     utility CEOs would not consider ordering new nuclear power \n     plants, but even a casual examination of the response data \n     finds that its accuracy is suspect. This survey received \n     responses from only 397 of nearly 3600 U.S. electric \n     utilities--and it is not clear that the respondents include \n     the 44 utilities that currently own and operate nuclear power \n     plants.\n       Fourth, there has also been considerable discussion about \n     General Electric's decision to terminate its Simplified \n     Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) activities. The program's \n     critics theorize that this action was taken because there is \n     no market for small plants, including the Westinghouse-\n     designed AP600. It must be recognized that GE's market \n     strategy is very focused on the east Asian market--\n     particularly Japan. In many of these countries, there is \n     considerable incentive to build large plants with high power \n     capacity. Press accounts indicate that GE's intent apparently \n     is to abandon this small reactor in favor of a significantly \n     larger plant with the same technical approach as the SBWR.\n       Other potential markets are more interested in factors such \n     as lower capital cost and lower complexity--attributes \n     natural to mid-sized plants. These attributes are very \n     attractive to U.S. utilities and others as well. Currently \n     twenty-two countries contribute funds and personnel to the \n     AP600 program. The Department believes that this represents a \n     significant international interest in advanced mid-sized \n     nuclear power plants with passive safety systems.\n       Regarding recent concerns about termination costs, the \n     Department has been informed by its program contractors that \n     significant termination costs may be sought from the \n     Department if the FOAKE program is terminated prematurely. \n     Many of these costs would result from the early termination \n     of personnel and subcontractors. Westinghouse, for example, \n     estimates that the early termination of its portion of the \n     design certification program would cost about $28 million. \n     Westinghouse also estimates that its FOAKE termination costs \n     would be approximately $10 million. Other contractors would \n     be expected to seek lesser amounts, because their \n     participation in the program is nearly complete. The Advanced \n     Reactor Corporation, which manages the FOAKE program, has \n     indicated that it may seek as much as $24 million from the \n     Department if the program is terminated at this stage.\n       Since the potential that these costs might have to be paid \n     by DOE has been raised only recently, we have not fully \n     evaluated the accuracy of this claim. The contract appears to \n     offer some protection from these costs, but it is possible \n     that the federal government could be held liable for some \n     termination expenses. A legal analysis has been initiated to \n     investigate this and other ramifications of an early shutdown \n     of the ALWR program.\n       I hope this information is of assistance to you. Do not \n     hesitate to call me if you would like additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Terry R. Lash, Director,\n\n                                         Office of Nuclear Energy,\n                                           Science and Technology.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Louisiana a \nquestion? In that $40 million that we have been talking to with \nreference to----\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. It is $22 million.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator McCain's amendment on the light water reactor, \ncan the Senator inform me again what portion is the light water reactor \nand what portion is now for wrapping up the program? There are two \npieces, are there not, 22 and 18?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The 18 is for termination costs?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. Of the first-of-a-kind engineering program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. President, in the afternoon when I spoke about the $40 million \nprogram, two programs that are being stricken by the McCain amendment, \nI alluded to those collectively at 40 and as the light water reactor. \nAs a matter of fact, that is incorrect; $22 million is for the light \nwater reactor and $18 million is for termination of first-of-a-kind \nengineering. Wherever I alluded to that, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Record be corrected and there be the distinction made as to the two \nparts of the $40 million.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S9056]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before Senator Feingold is recognized, I \nwonder if I could offer first an amendment that has been approved on \nthe other side on behalf of Senator Simon. It is an amendment regarding \n$5 million being made available for research in converting saline water \nto fresh water.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5102\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Simon, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 5102.\n\n       On page 19, line 4 add the following before the period: ``: \n     Provided, That $5,000,000 shall be available for research \n     into reducing the costs of converting saline water to flush \n     water''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there objection to the amendment that is pending?\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. We are in full agreement with that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 5102) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. JOHNSTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5103\n\n   (Purpose: To provide that $10,000,000 shall be available for the \n    electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel at Argonne \n                          National Laboratory)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the managers, the Senator from \nMexico and Louisiana, for their management of the bill and for their \ncooperation in making it possible for me to offer this amendment at \nthis time.\n  I rise today to discuss a matter of concern to me and many other \nSenators, the $10 million in funding for the initiation of construction \nof the Animas LaPlata water project that is contained in the Senate \nversion of the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill.\n  This project is a perfect example of water policy from a by-gone era. \nFor those who are unfamiliar with it, the Animas LaPlata project is a \n$714 million taxpayer-funded water development project planned for \nsouthwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico. Designed to supply 191,230 \nfeet of water, the Animas LaPlata project consists of two major \nreservoirs, seven pumping plants, and 200 miles of canals and pipes. \nThe project will pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, consuming enough \npower to run a city of 60,000, to supply municipal, industrial, and \nirrigation interests.\n  I am concerned about this project because of its extremely high \nprojected cost to the taxpayer. This is among the last of the big \nFederal water projects, and the kind I believe we can no longer afford. \nThe cost to the Federal Government of this project will amount to $481 \nmillion, nearly 68 percent of the total cost--an expense which has led \nopponents of the project to label it ``Jurassic Pork.'' My fiscal \nconcerns are compounded by the likelihood that, as a remedy to address \nthe legitimate water rights concerns of the Ute Mountain Ute and \nSouthern Ute tribes, it may fall short of achieving even its \nnonmonetary benefits.\n  The high cost of the project makes the water it seeks to store \nincredibly expensive. The construction cost allocated to irrigation \namounts to $7,467 per acre of irrigated land--for land currently worth \nabout $500 per acre. The project provides an average irrigation subsidy \nof over $2 million per farm over the 100-year life of the project. I \nbelieve that the Congress should act to seek the consideration of \nlower-cost alternatives and terminate this project rather than initiate \nconstruction. My concerns are heightened now that the House has acted \nto terminate Animas LaPlata. I believe it would be additionally costly \nand wasteful to allow Animas LaPlata to move forward with limited \nappropriations in this and the next few fiscal years only to find the \nproject will be terminated in the coming years. This seems pretty \nwasteful.\n  I would like to discuss each of my concerns in greater detail, and to \ntry to provide more extensive background on the history of this matter.\n  First, while there are concerns about the fulfillment of Ute tribal \nwater rights now associated with this project, I wanted to make it \nclear to my colleagues that this project was not initiated as a way to \naddress these claims. Animas LaPlata has a much longer history. It was \nauthorized in 1968 as a project to supply irrigation water to farmers \ngrowing low value forage crops. Even back then in the days of big water \nprojects, this one was so bad it could not get going. In 1988, nearly \n20 years after it was authorized, the settlement of the Ute Indian \nwater rights claims became an additional justification for pushing the \nproject through; but it was an additional justification, not the \ninitiation. Yet, as with any bad idea that is dressed up to appear \nbetter, this project continues to be riddled with many problems.\n\n  By way of background, I do not need to tell the current Presiding \nOfficer, he knows very well, this project is scheduled to be built in \ntwo phases. Phase 1 of the project is to be constructed entirely at \nFederal cost in two stages, A and B. And then phase 2 is to be \nconstructed at non-Federal cost.\n  At the present time, there are at least 6 overlapping impediments to \nthis project going forward successfully:\n  First, conflicts under the Endangered Species Act;\n  Second, failure to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, \nNEPA;\n  Third, violation of the Water Supply Act of 1954 regarding repayment \nof construction costs;\n  Fourth, a 1994 inspector general's audit determining that the project \nis not economically feasible;\n  Fifth, the Bureau of Reclamation's own 1995 economic analysis \nsupporting the 1994 IG's report conclusions;\n  And finally, six, persistent questions about the ability of this \nproject to meet the regional Indian water rights claims, even if that \nwas the original purpose, which it was not.\n  I would like to discuss each of these concerns a little bit more. In \n1990, the Bureau was notified that the project would trigger Endangered \nSpecies Act protections because withdrawal of water from the rivers \naffected would result in the demise of certain fish native to the area.\n  The issue was reviewed, and the Bureau is currently permitted to \nbuild only one-third of the project, the portion known as phase 1, \nstage A. Building only this portion of the project would not allow the \nproject to actually fulfill the tribal water rights claims that are \noften cited as the reason to go forward.\n  In 1992, the Bureau was sued because it had failed to comply with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, and the court upheld that claim. The \nBureau of Reclamation took 3 years to complete its supplemental \nenvironmental impact statement, and within days, the EPA promptly found \nthe supplemental EIS unsatisfactory, and now the project is a likely \ncandidate for referral to the Council on Environmental Quality.\n  In May 1996, the EPA wrote to the Bureau to express its concerns. All \nMembers of the Senate should have received a copy of the EPA letter \nwhen they received my Dear Colleague letter on this amendment last \nFriday. A letter to Mr. Martinez, Bureau Director, from Richard \nSanderson, Director of EPA's Office of Federal Activities, dated May 1, \n1996, states:\n\n       We remain concerned that the Bureau of Reclamations's \n     present formulation of the Animas LaPlata project will result \n     in unacceptable adverse environmental impacts that should be \n     avoided.\n\n  The letter cites, among those consequences, impacts to water quality, \nNavajo water rights, mitigation concerns, and impacts associated with \nmunicipal and industrial uses. The letter concludes:\n\n       It is unclear whether the fully sized Animas LaPlata \n     project will ever be constructed if the current constraints \n     remain unchanged. We believe that the Bureau of Reclamation \n     needs to reexamine whether there are more appropriate \n     alternatives that meet these constraints instead of merely \n     constructing stage A of the Animas LaPlata project.\n\n  In addition, municipal and industrial users are required under the \nWater Supply Act of 1958 to fully repay all the construction costs and \noperation and maintenance costs attributable to the supply of municipal \nand industrial water. Those repayment contracts are to be in place \nbefore construction begins.\n  Currently, a number of repayment contracts have not been signed. \nThose that have been signed and those that\n\n[[Page S9058]]\n\nare anticipated to be signed are over $100 million short of the \nprojected municipal and industrial cost. It is questionable if the \nproject will ever comply with the law and obtain full reimbursement of \nmunicipal and industrial costs from the project beneficiaries.\n  In addition, in 1994, the Interior Department's inspector general \naudited the project and declared that the project was neither \nfinancially feasible nor economically justifiable.\n  A July 1995 economic analysis by the Bureau of Reclamation, the only \nanalysis that used economic procedures approved for Bureau analyses and \na current discount rate, reported that the project's benefit cost ratio \nis 36 to 1. That is 36 to 1. In other words, the project will only \nreturn 36 cents for every tax dollar invested. That is not a very good \nratio.\n  Given all of these failures to comply with the Federal laws designed \nto protect the taxpayer and the environment, Mr. President, one has to \nquestion the advisability of moving forward with such a troubled \nproject.\n  In addition to Federal law concerns, the project does face some State \nlegal problems, as raised by the attorney general of the State of New \nMexico in a letter to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee on July 17, 1996. Our colleagues should have received a copy \nof this letter on Friday, as well, in their offices. Attorney General \nUdall's letter states, ``The ALP project threatens to violate or \nexacerbate existing violations of multiple State water quality \nstandards, including selenium, mercury, and others.''\n  Now, Mr. President, having listed these six concerns, I want to \nspecifically address the issue of the effect of the termination of this \nproject on the legitimate water rights claims of the Ute Mountain Ute \nand Southern Ute tribes. This is an issue of grave concern to me, and I \nknow it is of paramount importance to the occupant of the chair, the \njunior Senator from Colorado, who has longstanding ties to the Ute \nNations that predate his service in the U.S. Senate. As a Senator from \na State with 11 federally recognized tribes, I take tribal issues \nextremely seriously and know, as does the junior Senator from Colorado, \nthat tribal issues are often the least well understood and can be very \ndivisive.\n\n  I believe it is of paramount importance to fulfill the Federal \nGovernment's obligations to the tribes. And as the junior Senator from \nColorado will undoubtedly state, both Ute tribal governments do \nformally support Animas LaPlata. However, it is also important to place \nthe Ute's interest in perspective. Of the 191,230 acre-feet of water \nsupplied by the project, two-thirds of that water will go to nontribal \ninterests with only 62,000 acre-feet of the total to be supplied to \nboth tribes.\n  I am concerned that the Animas LaPlata, despite the best of \nintentions and arguments of proponents' attorneys, simply cannot meet \nthe needs of the tribes because the initial construction phase of the \nproject will neither provide the delivery system nor the quantity of \nwater needed to fully honor the Federal Government's commitments to the \ntribe. We should not spend hundreds of millions of dollars and still \nfind the tribal needs potentially unmet. Instead, we should begin to \nhave the Bureau examine alternatives that would fully meet the needs of \nthe tribes in a timely way and at less cost.\n  There is at least a portion of the Southern Ute tribe, as you well \nknow, Mr. President, that shares these concerns. From the perspective \nof the tribal councils, majority rules and the majority position of the \ncouncils is to support this project. However, we in the Senate know \nwell the importance of protecting minority voices. Indeed, that is \nexactly what this body is designed to do. Those in the Southern Ute \nTribe who oppose Animas LaPlata, the Southern Ute Grassroots \nOrganization, are on the committee of elders and have strong concerns.\n\n  On Friday, every Member of this body should have received another \ncopy of the letter they sent to Members of the Senate in April 1995. \nThat letter specifically asked Congress to refuse to appropriate money \nto the Animas LaPlata until the Bureau thoroughly studies the other \nalternatives. I think it important for all Members of the Senate to be \naware that there is actually a substantial division among the members \nof the Southern Ute Tribe about the wisdom of this project.\n  If we do not reexamine this project, a future Senate will be right \nback where we are today. The Ute Tribes' water rights settlement says \nif the project isn't built and fully functional by the year 2000, the \ntribes may, and are able to, void the settlement and go back into \nnegotiations or litigation. The Bureau of Reclamation, most in this \nbody would agree, is not an agency whose operating history has been \nfree from cost overruns and delays. The Bureau now indicates, before \nthe commencement of the project, that it cannot complete the project at \nleast before the year 2003, Mr. President.\n  I am afraid what will likely happen if Congress moves forward with \nthis project is that the project may be in some sort of state of \nconstruction in 2003, the tribal governments will examine the cost they \nwill have to pay for Animas LaPlata water, which will be about twice \nthe local cost for municipal and industrial water, and they simply \nmight decide they will not be able to use the water or sell it. It is \nnot unreasonable to expect the Utes may seek to avoid their settlement, \nwherein the non-Indian irrigators will get their project with its \n$5,000 an acre subsidy and Congress, in the year 2005 or so, will have \nto fund a new water rights settlement anyway, without resolving the \nlegitimate concerns of the two tribes.\n  Mr. President, I also want to raise another question relating to \ntribal water rights, and that is the rights of the Navajo Nation who \nlive downstream of this project in New Mexico.\n  The Navajo Nation has not formally opposed this project, but they are \nconcerned about the impacts it will have on their nation. In an August \n1995 letter to the Bureau of Reclamation Denver office, the Navajo \nNation indicated that the Animas LaPlata project would adversely affect \ntheir trust water resources by decreasing the amount of water in the \nSan Juan River basin for their use and development. The Navajo Nation \nas expressed in their letter ``exert sovereign control over its water \nresources through the Navajo Nation Water Code * * * Depletions \nresulting from ALP development will affect the sovereign administration \nand management of Navajo water resources. Projected ALP development and \nNavajo reservoir operation may require the reevaluation of existing \nwater uses permitted under the Water Code, with potentially adverse \nconsequences for the Navajo Nation.''\n\n  So, Mr. President, my understanding is that Navajo's rights to use \nwater within the San Juan River have not yet been adjudicated, yet as \nthe San Juan is the only reliable developable source of water in the \nnorthern portion of the Navajo Nation these issues will continue to be \nimportant.\n  I want to make the record clear however, that the Navajo Nation, in a \nfollow-up letter, clearly stated its concern that they did not want to \nadversely affect the Utes' legitimate claims. Nevertheless, their \nNation has made it clear that they are prepared and ready to assert \ntheir own water claims.\n  In other words, Mr. President, the continuation of Animas LaPlata is \nnot likely to settle tribal water rights claims in this region. \nTherefore, it is critical before construction begins, that we take a \nsecond look at whether there is a better way, a small, less \ncontroversial means of satisfying the Ute claims without the massive \nAnimas LaPlata project.\n  By every indication, even the Bureau recognizes the massive project \noriginally envisioned will never be built. At best, a much smaller, \nless ambitious project is the only feasible outcome. Yet the Bureau has \nnever formally acknowledged this fact, nor has Congress taken an active \nrole in shaping a project modification. Instead we are asked to \ncontinue to appropriate funds for an infeasible project.\n  There are those in the Senate that may ask why this Senator has such \nsignificant concerns about a very old water project for which some \nindividuals have such strong support. I have some personal experience, \nMr. President, of a situation like this in Wisconsin because people in \nthe western part of my State are living with the legacy of a failed \nArmy Corps of Engineers water project, the La Farge Dam. In 1962 \nCongress authorized $15.5 million--which would today cost about $102 \nmillion to build the same thing--for La\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nFarge dam and lake to be constructed along the Kickapoo River in \nWisconsin. They touted the tourism opportunities of lake and flood \ncontrol for neighboring residents not unlike the Animas LaPlata. And \n144 farms and homes were condemned. Families were relocated. It \nImpacted both the tax base and local business. Construction began in \n1971 and was their discontinued in 1975, due to its environmental \nimpact and the presence of native archeological sites, when the project \nwas three-quarters complete.\n  At one point passions over this issue became so intense that former \nSenators Proxmire and Nelson, and former Governor Lucey were burned in \neffigy. The area, already struggling economically prior to the dam's \ndevelopment, was devastated. By 1990, it was estimated that annual \nlosses resulting from the cessation of family farm operations and the \nunrealized tourism benefits that had been promised with the dam totaled \nmore 300 jobs and $8 million for the local economy per year.\n  In fact, Mr . President, the only remaining legacy of the project is \na fragmented landscape. It is dotted with scattered remains of former \nfarm homes, and a 103 foot tall, concrete shell of the dam, with the \nKickapoo River flowing unimpeded through a 1,000-foot gap. The most \nimportant benefit of the dam, its flood control protection, was never \nrealized. The legacy of La Farge, which only recently has begun to have \na silver lining with the passage last month of language to deauthorize \nthe project and turn the lands over to control by the State and the Ho \nChunk Nation, a Wisconsin tribe, is one that I think should not be \nforgotten. It is a serious example of the Federal Government's mistake \nwith a big project that did not work.\n  Last week, as you well know, the House of Representatives finally \nvoted 221-200 to stop the funding for the Animas LaPlata project as it \nis currently designed. That effort was led by my colleagues from \nWisconsin, Representative Petri, and Congressman DeFazio from Oregon. \nMembers in the other body made it very clear that they want the \nDepartment of the Interior to review and develop a sensible alternative \nthat will effectively meet the legitimate needs of the tribes in a more \ncost-effective and environmentally sound fashion.\n\n  We should do the same in the Senate for the sake of the taxpayers, \nsound water policy and those tied to a project that will not deliver \nwhat was promised. However, even if we do not do the correct thing, the \nwise thing, let us make no mistake: The project as currently designed \nis dead, and we will impose far greater costs if we decide to continue \nto make infrastructure investments in its future when it is never going \nto go anywhere.\n  The House has heard the voices of citizen groups and taxpayer groups, \ntribal members and environmentalists. The House is no longer going to \nsupport this bad idea. It is no longer a question of whether the \nproject will die. It is now a question of how much money and time will \nbe wasted in the end game. Yes, we could go back and forth for a few \nyears with the House terminating funding and then the Senate restoring \nthe money. That has happened before in other projects where we wasted \nmoney. But eventually, the House will resist, and ultimately--\nhopefully, sooner rather than later--so will the Senate. Meanwhile we \nwill waste millions more of taxpayers' money.\n  That is why, Mr. President, it is time for us to step up now and put \nthis matter on a positive track. Let us stop funding this project as \ncurrently designed and tell the Bureau of Reclamation to use the \nunobligated funds available in the Animas account to size the project \nto legitimate water needs and then explore all the alternatives to \nmeeting those needs in an effective, environmentally sound and cost-\nefficient manner. Mr. President, to conclude, my amendment is identical \nto that which passed the House, and I strongly urge my colleagues to \nlend their support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Did the Senator use all his time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used all of his time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a couple of items I have to clean \nup before I take a few minutes in opposition. For Senator Mack, who is \nwaiting, it will not be long. We will be through very soon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for purposes of timing, I yield myself 5 \nminutes in opposition.\n  Mr. President, before I start using that time, I say to the Senate, \nwe are within a couple of minutes of completing the work on this bill. \nI understand that pursuant to the understanding, the next bill will be \nlegislative appropriations. So we will not be long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to take 5 minutes to talk about \nthe Animas LaPlata project. The occupant of the chair is very familiar \nwith the fact that there are two issues--big, big issues--in this \nAnimas LaPlata.\n  One issue is frequently forgotten when people talk about whether this \nproject has earned its spurs in terms of costs to the taxpayer. \nFrequently, the only thing that is used is the dollars versus what \nphysical improvements we will produce and what they mean in terms of a \ncost-benefit ratio. That is well and good. And we will say that cost-\nbenefit ratio is not very high.\n  There is a second part to this bill. It is a very, very big part of \nthis bill. We do not even know how many millions of dollars it would \ncost the Federal Government, but we know this: The U.S. Government is \nassumed and presumed by many to have violated the rights of two Indian \ntribes with reference to taking care of their water. The United States \nof America, as evidenced in other cases, can be liable in dollars for \nthat when there is no other way to give to the Indian people what we \nhad committed as a nation to do for them. In this case, that is \nfrequently forgotten in terms of a justification for this project.\n  The Southern Utes and the Mountain Ute Tribes will have no remedy for \nthe abuse of their water if this project is not completed, and thus we \ngive them water, irrigatable land, and a way to use water that is \navailable to them which would otherwise disappear because of \nmalfeasance on the part of the U.S. Government.\n  Now, I, for one, have taken that very seriously, even though it is \nnot totally applicable to my State, the State of New Mexico. Most of \nthose claims and most of that water and most of the Indians represented \nby those two groups of Indians are in the State of Colorado, the State \nthat the occupant of the chair represents in this body.\n  Speaking for my own State, so that it is clear, I know there is a \nletter from our attorney general, but let me say the cities of \nFarmington, Aztec, and Bloomfield all need the water provided in this \nproject. All these communities are strongly committed to the projects. \nThey committed resources to it to meet repayment obligations under the \n1986 cost sharing.\n  In addition, the State of New Mexico is strongly committed to the \nproject, as shown by the 1986 cost-sharing agreement for the project, \nto support for the Colorado Ute water rights settlement, allocation of \nconsumptive use required for the project from New Mexico's \napportionment on the Colorado River basin compact, and fourth, \nparticipation of the San Juan River recovery implementation program.\n  Having said that, obviously, there will be more said on this \namendment and probably much more eloquently and in a more relevant \nmatter by the distinguished occupant of the chair who has time reserved \nto make an argument against the amendment. I do not intend to spend any \nmore time on it. I am ready to finish the bill and yield whatever time \nI might have had with reference to it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9060]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have five amendments that I will \nsubmit en bloc. Let me quickly describe them and then submit them en \nbloc.\n  I offer one in behalf of Senator Hutchison regarding the abatement of \npayments because of drought on two projects in the State of Texas; one \nin behalf of Senator McConnell, which has been totally worked out now \nwith Senator Glenn, and that is Enrichment Corporation, with reference \nto the presence of an adequate number of security guards and a few \nother items relating to that; third, I offer in behalf of Senator \nChafee a 50 percent match program on the Seekonk River, Rhode Island \nBridge; the last one, two distinct amendments for Senator Boxer \nregarding the Bolinas Lagoon restoration study, and the other is \nregarding a facility on Compton Creek Channel in Los Angeles.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 5107 through 5111\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send the amendments to the desk and ask for their \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], proposes \n     amendments en bloc numbered 5107 through 5111.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments en bloc (No. 5107 through 5111) are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5107\n\n       On page 37 add the following after line 25:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to \nprotect the safety of employees at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, \nas well as the safety of the greater Paducah community.\n  The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant produces enriched uranium and \nemploys some 1,800 people. By all who live in the Paducah area, the \nGaseous Diffusion Plant, which occupies more than 3,400 acres, is \nregarded as a nuclear plant. This year, the plant is undergoing a \ntransition from being a Department of Energy owned and operated \nfacility to one owned by the U.S. Enrichment Corporation and operated \nby private contract. The plant will be under the regulatory authority \nof the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by year's end.\n  Historically, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant has maintained an \non-premises security force to protect the plant and employees from \nsabotage, theft or unauthorized control of the nuclear material. The \nsecurity personnel are currently authorized to make arrests, and they \ncarry firearms in support of their mission. In the past several years, \nthese plant security officers have foiled a number of unauthorized \nentries onto plant premises, protected the facility from disgruntled \nformer employees and enforced security rules against contract employees \nwho have access to the plant. In an era of domestic terrorism, as in \nthe World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings, these security \nemployees perform an increasingly vital function.\n  In the transition from DOE to NRC supervision, the security force \ncurrently employed at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, absent \nadoption of this amendment, will be downgraded. under current NRC \nregulations, they will lose their authority to make arrests and carry \nfirearms. But privatization does not change the nature of the work or \nthe risk at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The plant will \ncontinue to produce radioactive enriched uranium.\n  The amendment simply continues the authority of the plant security \npersonnel at enriched uranium facilities to execute arrests and carry \nfirearms. Without this authority for the security officers at the \nplant, the plant will have to rely on area law enforcement officials to \nrespond in emergency situations. The city of Paducah has informed plant \nofficials that their response time for their police and firefighters \nwill be approximately 20 minutes. The Kentucky State Police has a \nspecial response team which would assist the Paducah facility in the \nevent of a threat to public safety. That special response team is \nlocated in Frankfort, halfway across the State from Paducah and it \nwould take 4 hours to have a helicopter respond to an emergency at the \nPaducah plant. The McCracken County Sheriff's Department has expressed \nserious concern at the prospect of the security force losing its arrest \nauthority. McCracken County Sheriff Frank Augustus has advised the U.S. \nEnrichment Corporation of the problems his department would encounter \nin responding to an emergency call by the Paducah plant:\n\n       If a hostile situation should occur, I could not guarantee \n     adequate personnel or response time due to our department's \n     manpower shortage. When only seconds matter I am very much \n     afraid it would take many minutes to adequately respond.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter of Sheriff Augustus be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Sheriff of McCracken County,\n\n                                       Paducah, KY, July 10, 1996.\n     Bern Stapleton,\n     Safeguard and Security Associate, U.S. Enrichment Corp., \n         Bethesda, MD.\n       Dear Mr. Stapleton: It has recently been brought to my \n     attention that Security personnel at the Paducah Gaseous \n     Diffusion Plant may possibly lose their arrest authority and \n     their ability to be armed. This issue causes me a great deal \n     of concern.\n       I understand the police operation of the Paducah Gaseous \n     Diffusion Plant is responsible for the protection of \n     classified material, sensitive nuclear material, government \n     property, and over 2,200 employees situated on 3,423 acres, \n     including 748 acres of fenced area. In contrast, the \n     McCracken County Sheriff's department is responsible for \n     patrolling over 250 square miles in order to meet the needs \n     of our County's citizens. Since I took office in 1994, \n     citizens' calls for law enforcement have increased by 23,000 \n     calls. Crime is on the rise in McCracken County and due to \n     financial constraints, my department has only 17 full-time \n     road deputies to handle these increases.\n       I am extremely concerned that if a major problem should \n     arise at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant it would be \n     extremely difficult for my department to provide proper \n     security for such a sizable site until more enforcement could \n     arrive. If a hostile situation should occur, I could not \n     guarantee adequate personnel or response time due to our \n     department's manpower shortage. When only seconds matter I am \n     very much afraid it would take many minutes to adequately \n     respond.\n       Another issue that must be addressed is our officers' lack \n     of knowledge in regard to the actual facility and surrounding \n     grounds. As noted above, the immense size of this facility \n     poses many problems in regard to providing adequate safety to \n     plant employees as well as my deputies.\n       In my opinion, the current security staff is of immense \n     value to the safety of the plant facility and the employees \n     that work within. I fully understand the move toward \n     privatization necessitates many changes in operations that \n     have been in place for many years. I would like to strongly \n     recommend, however, that a long serious look be taken at \n     proposed changes in the security force at the Paducah Plant \n     before a final decision is made. I am sure that your utmost \n     concern,\n\n[[Page S9061]]\n\n     as well as it is mine, is for the safety of the people of \n     McCracken County as well as the safekeeping of the Plant, \n     whether it remains a government facility or is privatized in \n     the future.\n       I would be more than happy to discuss this matter with you \n     in more detail at your convenience. Please feel free to call \n     me.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Frank Augustus,\n                                         McCracken County Sheriff.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the employees \nof the Gaseous Diffusion Plant, as well as the residents of Paducah are \nentitled to an immediate response to an emergency situation. While the \nsecurity force may need assistance in the event of a serious threat, \nthe employees should not be left unprotected while local law \nenforcement responds.\n  This amendment does not add any additional security protection to the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant; it maintains the status quo, allowing \nthe current security officers to continue doing their job, protecting \nthe plant and employees from danger. I urge the adoption of my \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5109\n\n       On page 5 add the following between lines 2 and 3: \n     ``Seekonk River, Rhode Island bridge removal $650,000;''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5110\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the Secretary of the Army to maintain \n  Compton Creek Channel, Los Angeles County drainage area, California)\n\n       On page 7, line 6, after ``facilities'', insert the \n     following: ``, and of which $500,000 shall be made available \n     for the maintenance of Compton Creek Channel, Los Angeles \n     County drainage area, California''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5111\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for the Secretary of the Army to carry out \n  the restoration study for Bolinas Lagoon, Marin County, California)\n\n       On page 2, between lines 24 and 25, insert the following: \n     ``Bolinas Lagoon restoration study, Marin County, California, \n     $500,000;''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the record, let me state these have all been \napproved by the minority. They have no objection, or, in some \ninstances, they were the supportive cause for a couple of the \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments en bloc are \nagreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5107 through 5111) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe that is all the amendments I \nknow of regarding this energy and water bill. I believe we can announce \nin the morning further amplification of the record, but I think we know \nwe will start with 20 minutes of debate by the managers, to be followed \nby 10 minutes by Senator McCain regarding the McCain amendment, and \nthen there is a list of amendments that would follow with time limits, \nand 2 minutes for each side.\n  We have four or five amendments pending that have not been agreed to \nin that sequence, and we will just have to attend to those in due \ncourse in the morning.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senate for its consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9052-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9061-S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn \nto the consideration of the legislative appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3754), making appropriations for the \n     Legislative Branch for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1997, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 1997 \nlegislative branch appropriations bill to the Senate. The subcommittee \nbuilds upon the success that the Congress achieved last year in \nreducing the size and the cost of the legislative branch, and again \ndemonstrates this Congress' leadership in making strides toward the \nimperative of a balanced budget.\n  The subcommittee's recommendation is an appropriation of \n$2,165,081,000. This is a reduction of $22.275 million, or \napproximately 1 percent below the program levels in fiscal year 1996. \nThe bill is $174 million below the requested amount, and compared to \nfiscal 1995, the bill reflects a $225 million reduction.\n\n  While the legislative branch bill is the smallest in terms of dollars \nappropriated, with the adoption of this bill, we will have contributed \nnearly one-half billion dollars toward deficit reduction in just 2 \nfiscal years.\n  The recommended funding for the Senate is $441.208 million, \napproximately $14 million above the 1996 enacted amount. However, the \namount is $48 million below the request.\n  In large part, the increases reflected in the bill are for cost of \nliving adjustments for Senate employees and expenses for the Sergeant \nat Arms. I point out that Senate employees did not receive the 1996 \nCOLA that was granted to other Federal employees.\n  Specifically, the Senate's amendment to the bill provides $208 \nmillion for Senators' official personnel and office expense account. \nThis amount is a 2 percent increase from last year's level. The \nincrease is sufficient to accommodate an expected cost-of-living \nadjustment for Senate employees in the 1997 calendar year. The \nrecommended funding for committees is $69.5 million, a $3 million \nincrease, again, for cost-of-living adjustments.\n  For the official mail cost, the funding is reduced by 9 percent. The \nrecommended funding of $10 million is sufficient, however, to cover \nprojected costs for fiscal year 1997. Again, Mr. President, I just say \nthat while this is a reduction from $11 million last year to $10 \nmillion last year, in analyzing the trends and expenditures for mail, \nwe believe we can make this reduction without requiring the Senators to \nmake any reduction in their mailing. As you know, last year, we \neliminated mass mailing. So we are talking about mail now that is \nprimarily for the purpose of responding to inquiries from our \nconstituents.\n  Funding for salaries and expenses of the Secretary of the Senate is \n$14.225 million. That is an increase of $831,000. Funding for salaries \nand expenses of Sergeant at Arms is $99.968 million. That is an \nincrease of $8.880 million. I bring my colleagues' attention to the \nfact that combined funding recommendations for the Secretary and the \nSergeant at Arms fiscal year 1997 are still $8 million below the 1995 \nenacted levels.\n  The subcommittee appreciates the leadership demonstrated by the \nSecretary of the Senate and the Sergeant at Arms. Each office is \nmanaging a substantial reduction this is fiscal year along with the \ncompounded challenges rendered by the Congressional Accountability Act. \nI remind Members that, last year, we made reductions in the accounts of \nthe Sergeant at Arms and Secretary of the Senate of between 12.5 and 14 \npercent. While they have been managing these reduced amounts, they have \nalso been given an additional responsibility as a result of the \nCongressional Accountability Act.\n  During the subcommittee hearings, the Secretary and Sergeant at Arms \noutlined a series of initiatives regarding technology. The subcommittee \nis pleased that under the direction of the Senate Rules Committee, the \nSenate is taking a long-term strategic planning approach in this area. \nThe subcommittee looks forward to working with the Rules Committee on \nthis issue of common concern.\n  In addition, the subcommittee wishes to thank each of the legislative \nbranch agencies for their cooperation and contributions in the \ndevelopment of this year's bill. On a special note, the subcommittee \ncommends the General Accounting Office for its successful management of \na 2-year, 25-percent reduction in its budget. Managing a funding \nreduction of such magnitude in a relatively short period has been very \ndifficult, and the subcommittee wishes to commend the Comptroller \nGeneral and the entire staff at GAO for an outstanding job.\n  We had quite a discussion at our hearing with the Comptroller General \nas to the approach that was taken to downsize this Government agency 25 \npercent in a 2-year period. That is a substantial reduction. I would \nrecommend to my colleagues that we\n\n[[Page S9062]]\n\nought to look at how the GAO went about this process of managing over a \n2-year period a reduction of 25 percent in its budget, because they did \nit extremely well. They did it with a great deal of thought. They found \nways to use technologies of today to make their operations more \neffective and efficient. Again, I think it is a case study in the way \nto manage the downsizing of a Government agency. I encourage everybody \nto look at what they have done and what they have accomplished.\n  I will now yield to Senator Murray for any comments she wishes to \nmake. I thank her and each member of the subcommittee for their hard \nwork and cooperation in crafting this bill. Again, I want to say to \nSenator Murray that I appreciate very much the way we have, during the \npast 2 years, been able to work together in, I think, crafting two \nappropriations bills that the Senate can be proud of, and should again \nbe used as an example. Frankly, it was in my mind that we should set an \nexample for the rest of Government. If we are going to ask people to \nspend less and do with less, I think, again, our taking the lead in \ndoing that is setting a good example.\n  I now yield to Senator Murray for her comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3754, the \nfiscal year 1997 legislative branch appropriation bill. The bill as \nreported by the full committee is a fair and responsible bill.\n  As Members will recall, this committee took a bold step last year in \nrecommending a bill that cut spending for the departments and agencies \nfunded in the legislative branch appropriations bill by $200 million, \nor 10 percent. This year, again, we have continued the effort to reduce \nthe funding levels and streamline the operations of Congress by \nrecommending a bill that cuts a net of over $22 million from the 1996 \nenacted level. At the proposed funding level contained in this measure, \nthe Legislative Branch, in total, will have less funding than in fiscal \nyear 1991 or 6 years ago.\n  The major reductions recommended by the committee involve the support \nagencies that are so vital to the Congress in order to enable us to \ncomplete our work in an effective and expeditious manner. The committee \nthis year saves $6.1 million below fiscal year 1996 as a result of the \nelimination of the Office of Technology Assessment. I did not \npersonally support that elimination but, nevertheless, it has been \naccomplished and we are saving $6.1 million this year because of OTA's \nelimination.\n  Another major reduction in this year's bill is the cut to the General \nAccounting Office. Their budget is reduced by $44,381,000 below fiscal \nyear 1996. Testimony by the Comptroller General, Mr. Bowsher, made \nclear that the GAO can undertake this reduction as part of their \noverall, 2-year 25 percent commitment made to the Congress last year. \nThe amount appropriated for fiscal year 1997 for the GAO is \n$338,425,000 and will provide for a personnel ceiling of no more than \n3,500 positions. This personnel ceiling amounts to a reduction of 1,825 \nbelow the level of GAO's workforce in 1992 when they had a ceiling of \n5,325 positions.\n  As Senators can see, the reductions the committee is recommending \nthis year are dramatic. However, Mr. President, I believe that the \ncommittee has accomplished these savings in a way that is as fair and \neven-handed as possible. We have been careful to ensure that the \norganizations and agencies which support Congress and are funded in the \nlegislative branch appropriation bill are able to carry out their \nresponsibilities under these reduced budgets as effectively as they \nhave in the past.\n  I would have adamantly opposed these budget cuts if they were \nundertaken only to save dollars, without recognizing any negative \nconsequences. It would be fruitless, for example to reduce the budget \nof the Congressional Budget Office with their ever-increasing \nresponsibilities simply for the sake of saying we have achieved \nbudgetary savings.\n  With this in mind, I carefully reviewed the testimony of our \nwitnesses for any indication that cuts of the magnitude we have \nrecommended would harm the ability of these Congressional-support \nagencies to carry out their very important responsibilities. Testimony \nreceived by the subcommittee indicated that these recommended savings \ncan be achieved while allowing these support agencies to carry out \nthese responsibilities with no reductions-in-force.\n   Mr. President, Senator Mack provided members with a detailed \nexplanation of all of the recommendations contained in the bill, and I \nwill not take the time of Members by repeating them. I would, however, \ncall to the attention of Members Section 5 of the administrative \nprovisions. I included, with the enthusiastic support of Chairman Mack, \nlanguage that will enable the Sergeant at Arms to transfer excess or \nsurplus computer equipment to schools.\n  In the past, the Senate sold its computers to employees at bargain \nprices. Fortunately, this practice has been terminated, and I commend \nthe Sergeant at Arms for doing so. For the past couple of years, our \ncomputers have simply been transferred to GSA for disposal through the \nnormal surplus process.\n  I think Senators should be aware that the Senate disposes of over \n1500 computers every year. Over the past 3 years, nearly 5,000 \ncomputers have been let go. For the most part, these are IBM-\ncompatible, 386, 16-megahertz machines. They are a generation old, but \nthey could be very useful to schools, especially in rural areas, that \nmay not have a big budget to buy fancy new computers.\n  I am fortunate to represent Washington State, which is very \naggressive in trying to put computers in the classroom. Our companies \nhave been generous in donating software and hardware, and people are \nexcited about giving kids skills that will help them get an edge in \nlife.\n  But not every school district is moving aggressively on computers. \nMany do not even know how to go about it, and cannot afford it. I am \ncertain that every Senator is aware of how fast technology is evolving \nin our economy. I really believe that, in the future, a child's ability \nto compete in the work force will be measured in part by his or her \nfamiliarity with computers. In my view, the earlier they start, the \nbetter.\n  The Senate will debate the broad role of government in education \ntechnology, and I look forward to having that debate. For now there is \na small, and I think constructive, role for the Senate to play. We can \nuse the bully pulpit. We can lead by example. We can help school \nchildren by transferring our computers to schools that want or need \nthem. By doing this, we can help some kids, and we can show the country \nwe think bringing technology to the classroom is a high priority.\n  Here is how it will work: the Sergeant at Arms will make sure that \nany excess or surplus computers are in good working order. Then he will \nmake them available to interested schools at the lowest possible cost \nto both the Senate and the schools. Most likely, he will transfer these \ncomputers to the General Services Administration. GSA, in turn, will \nprovide information to schools through its regional offices about \navailable inventory. The equipment eligible for transfer will include \ncomputers, keyboards, monitors, printers, modems, and other peripheral \nhardware as described in the bill.\n  I envision schools being able to obtain this equipment on a first-\ncome, first-served basis, for the cost of shipping and handling from \nGSA regional offices. The language provides the Sergeant at Arms with \nflexibility to determine the best way to complete the transfers.\n  I think this is a useful change in policy. Again, I appreciate the \nhelp of Chairman Mack on this, and I look forward to working with him \nand the Sergeant at Arms to make this work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would point out that there is a provision \nincluded in the House-passed bill--Section 312--that was stricken \npursuant to a motion by Senator Hatfield during full committee markup. \nThat section deals with so-called ``dynamic'' scoring of certain \nmeasures. Although this provision would apply to House measures only \nand, therefore, would normally not be stricken by the Senate in view of \nthe comity between the Houses that is traditionally recognized, in this \ninstance there is a Budget Act point of order under Section 306 which \nwould lie against Section 312 and that was the basis upon which the \ncommittee chairman moved to strike the provision.\n\n[[Page S9063]]\n\n  I strongly oppose Section 312 on its merits. I do not believe that \neither branch of Congress should be dictating selective macroeconomic \nscorekeeping procedures upon either the Congressional Budget Office or \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation. I will have more to say on this later \nduring debate on this bill should any attempt be made to revive Section \n312 or anything similar to it.\n  On balance, Mr. President, I believe this is a good bill that \ndeserves the support of Members. I would hasten to add, however, that I \nshare the concerns expressed by Senator Reid, a former chairman of this \nsubcommittee, during the committee's markup of the legislative branch \nappropriation bill. Senator Reid stated that we have reached the bottom \nof the barrel in cutting the legislative branch appropriation bill. \nOnce the savings we have undertaken are accomplished in the \nCongressional-support agencies over a multi-year period, we cannot look \nto these agencies for further budget cuts. These agencies have been \nvery forthcoming and have understood our need to reduce spending for \nthe Legislative Branch, and I am deeply appreciative of their \nwillingness to do so. But, Mr. President, we have indeed reached the \nbottom of the barrel.\n   Mr. President, let me close by commending our subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Mack. He has proven himself to be a real leader on legislative \nbranch issues and has worked with me on a bipartisan basis. I \nappreciate it very much. I also wish to express my thanks to the \nsubcommittee staff--Keith Kennedy, Jim English, and Mary Dewald for \ntheir fine work, and also to recognize the excellent support we had \nfrom Ric Ilgenfritz of my staff and Larry Harris for Senator Mack.\n   Mr. President, I urge the support of all Members for this bill.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a series of amendments to the desk \nand ask for their consideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack] proposes amendments \n     numbered 5112, 5113, 5114, 5115, 5116, and 5117 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5112\n\n       On page 34 line 20, strike all after the word ``Act'' \n     through line 21 and insert: ``such sums as may be necessary \n     for each of the fiscal years 1997 and 1998.''\n\n  Mr. HATFIELD: Mr. President, this amendment would provide for the \nreauthorization of the American Folklife Center at the Library of \nCongress for fiscal years 1997 and 1998. It is a substitute for the \npermanent reauthorization reported by the committee. I am offering this \namendment after conversations with Representative Thomas, the chairman \nof the Committee on Oversight in the other body. I understand Chairman \nThomas' concerns about the proper role of the authorization committees \nand am willing to respond to his concerns at this time. I hope, \nhowever, that the next Congress will enact a permanent authorization \nfor the center.\n  The American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress was created \n20 years ago by passage of the American Folklife Preservation Act of \n1976. I was pleased to be a cosponsor of the legislation, which enjoyed \nbroad bicameral and bipartisan support. The legislation was endorsed by \nSenators Strom Thurmond and Hubert Humphrey, and by Representative \nDavid Obey and then-Representative Trent Lott. The support was so broad \nbecause the legislation had such obvious merit.\n  The Library was chosen as the site of the Center for several reasons, \nbut principal among them was the strength of the Library's folklife \ncollections. It is not too great a stretch to say that those \ncollections began at the beginning, when Thomas Jefferson's library was \npurchased for the Library of Congress. Jefferson's library included \nsignificant material about Native Americans, and, of course, the \ninformation collected during the expedition of Merriwether Lewis and \nWilliam Clark.\n  Now as then, one has to collect folklife. No one stands with pad and \npencil, recording the lives of workaday Americans. What tends to be \nautomatically recorded is what we at first think very important: the \ncoming and going of the elite or infamous, the domestic affairs of the \nKing or President, the fads that engross the rich and famous, the \nhistory of battles as told by generals. But sometimes the foot soldier \nhas a better story than the general. The diary kept by Samuel Pepys in \nthe 1660s is important today because Mr. Pepys went about London and \nrecorded what he saw. He told about the great fire and the coming of \nthe Black Death and seeing the first Punch and Judy show. His record of \nLondon is far more interesting than the ones kept by historians \nengrossed in the intrigues and peccadilloes that swirled around Charles \nthe Second.\n  I believe all of us understand, Mr. President, that the strength of \nour Nation proceeds from its smaller places; from small towns in \nMissouri and Oregon, from short streets in Brooklyn and Omaha. We know \nthat it is in the forms of learning transmitted in families, small \ncommunities, the workplace, and in ethnic groups that we develop the \nstrength of our families, our communities, and our culture. And we know \nthat the makers of our culture in the smaller places do not bring their \nprimary documents to the Library of Congress. They are not invited to \nelegant dinners in the great hall of the Jefferson building, or courted \nin fundraising drives. Theirs is at least as great a contribution as \nthe millions raised for other efforts, but it cannot be measured in \ndollars. It is the Center's great achievement, and ongoing strength, \nthat it recognizes the value of the everyday, and gives it a home where \nit can be cherished as it deserves to be.\n  It is very important, Mr. President, that the present structure of \nthe Center be maintained. It is important to have a Board of Trustees \nselected from all over the Nation and appointed by the Joint leadership \nof Congress. They bring to the Center a diversity of outlook and \npurpose that cannot be replicated by the best-intentioned professionals \nof the Library's career staff. It is important to have this be a Center \nfor folklife, and not just another division within the many divisions \nof the Library. We could have taken that route in writing the original \nenabling legislation, but we were trying to raise up the center out of \nthe other collections of the Library to be a beacon to the folklife \ncommunity across the country. That beacon must be maintained. If it \ncannot be maintained at the Library of Congress, then it should be \nmoved and sustained elsewhere. I believe the Library is the best home \nfor the Center, but it must get the support expected in a good home.\n  Mr. President, I hope that ups and downs of the center's \nauthorization in this Congress will serve as a wake-up call from the \ncenter's board and the center's supporters. I hope the board will be \nmore attentive to the concerns of the Congressional committees which \noversee the Library's operations. I hope the board will work hard to \nsupplement federal funding with private fundraising efforts. I hope the \nnational folklife community will work with the proper authorizing \ncommittees to achieve a permanent reauthorization for the center. And I \nhope that the Library of Congress budget for, and the Congress will \nprovide, funding sufficient to the center's task.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Mack for his cooperation and support \nin this matter, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5113\n\n       On page 8, after line 17 insert:\n       Sec. 7.

I am proposing an amendment on an important matter to the \nSenate. I am speaking of the quality and the cost of its legislative \ninformation systems. Two years ago, this committee requested from the \nLibrary of Congress an analysis of the duplication among the \nlegislative systems supported by the Congress. That study documented \nthat there is extensive overlap in these systems and that there are \nopportunities for reducing that duplication. We then directed the \nLibrary to prepare a plan for creating a single integrated information \nsystem that would serve the entire Congress.\n  The committee received that report in February of this year. The plan \ngives us a useful framework for building a new, coordinated legislative \ninformation system that will better assist the Members of Congress to \ncarry out their legislative duties. The plan recognizes that there are \nvarious independent responsibilities for legislative information within \nthe Congress and proposes a technical scheme that takes advantage of \nthis fact. The new system will therefore require the active support of \nall of the offices and agencies within the legislative branch that \nassist the Senate and the House in this critical area.\n  In our commitment to the American people to reduce the size of the \nGovernment, this committee has been reluctant to recommend significant \nadditional resources for any of the Congress' offices and agencies. We \nare not providing any additional funds for this legislative system, \nalthough we will allow the Secretary of the Senate, at his request, to \nreprogram some funds to support the Senate's need to modernize the \ncollection and preparation of its legislative information. We do expect \nall legislative branch offices and agencies to support fully this very \nimportant initiative with their existing appropriated funds, which we \nbelieve are sufficient.\n  This is a challenging task, and will require appropriate policies, \nguidelines, and oversight. We hope that the House of Representatives \nwill join us in this task. If they do not, however, we shall proceed in \nthe Senate nonetheless. Even without the participation of the House, \nthe Senate can and must improve its own system and begin to reduce the \nduplication that currently exists.\n  This amendment was prepared in consultation with the Committee on \nRules and Administration. With this amendment, we are taking the next \nsteps in creating a new legislative information system for the Senate \nby designating some of those responsibilities for this system now, \nspecifically for the Secretary of the Senate, the Congressional \nResearch Service, and the Library of Congress. The Committee on Rules \nand Administration has jurisdiction for this system and will be making \nother designations of responsibility as the system progresses.\n  I am pleased that the distinguished chairman of our Committee on \nRules and Administration shares our views on the importance of these \nmatters, and that his committee is prepared to oversee the development \nof the Senate's new legislative system.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 5116\n\n       On page 8, after line 17 insert:\n\n     SEC. 8. PAYMENT FOR UNACCRUED LEAVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Financial Clerk of the Senate is \n     authorized to accept from an individual whose pay is \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate a payment \n     representing pay for any period of unaccrued annual leave \n     used by that individual, as certified by the head of the \n     employing office of the individual making the payment.\n       (b) Withholding.--The Financial Clerk of the Senate is \n     authorized to withhold the amount referred to in subsection \n     (a) from any amount which is disbursed by the Secretary of \n     the Senate and which is due to or on behalf of the individual \n     described in subsection (a).\n       (c) Deposit.--Any payment accepted under this section shall \n     be deposited in the general fund of Treasury as miscellaneous \n     receipts.\n       (d) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``head \n     of the employing office'' means any person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an individual \n     whose pay is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate.\n       (e) Applicability.--The section shall apply to fiscal year \n     1996 and each fiscal year thereafter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5117\n\n (Purpose: To direct the Congressional Research Service to develop an \nelectronic congressional legislative information and document retrieval \n                                system)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Congressional Research Service, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of the Senate and the heads \n     of the appropriate offices and agencies of the legislative \n     branch and with the approval of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate, shall coordinate the \n     development of an electronic congressional legislative \n     information and document retrieval system to provide for the \n     legislative information needs of the Senate through the \n     exchange and retrieval of information and documents among \n     legislative branch offices and agencies. The Secretary of the \n     Senate, with the oversight and approval of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration of the Senate, shall have \n     responsibility for the implementation of this system in the \n     Senate. All of the appropriate offices and agencies of the \n     legislative branch shall participate in the implementation of \n     the system.\n       (b) As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``legislative information'' refers to that \n     information and those documents produced for the use of the \n     Congress by the offices and agencies of the legislative \n     branch as defined in this section, and such other information \n     and documents as approved by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate;\n       (2) the term ``offices and agencies of the legislative \n     branch'' means the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, the \n     Office of Legislative Counsel of the Senate, the Office of \n     the Architect of the Capitol, the General Accounting Office, \n     the Government Printing Office, the Library of Congress, the \n     Congressional Budget Office, and the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate; and\n       (3) the term ``retrieval system'' means the indexing of \n     documents and data, as well as integrating, searching, \n     linking, and displaying documents and data.\n       (c) The Library of Congress shall--\n       (1) assist the Congressional Research Service in supporting \n     the Senate in carrying out this section; and\n       (2) provide such technical staff and resources as may be \n     necessary to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me first commend the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Legislative Branch for his foresight in initiating this \neffort to improve our legislative information systems. When I became \nchairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration I began a review \nof our entire program for information technology. This is a rapidly \nchanging, and\n\n[[Page S9065]]\n\nvery expensive area for the Senate. Yet it is vital to all the \noperations of the Senate, from the way we pay our bills to the way we \nprepare, debate, and pass--or reject--legisation. It is critical, \ntherefore, that we have sound planning for, and careful implementation \nof information technologies that will adequately support our \nfundamental work of legislation and oversight. Because of the potential \nhigh cost of technology, and also its ability to support our work, I \ncan think of very few areas that require such close scrutiny, well-\nthought out policies, and effective management Achieving these \nobjectives has been one of my highest priorities since being appointed \nChair.\n  We have in the Senate now an historic opportunity to reduce \nduplication and to ensure that our use of technology to support our \nlegislative process is both responsive to the needs of Senators and \nalso cost effective. The Committee on Rules has taken a number of \nimportant steps to accomplish this, and we are planning to take more in \nthe near future. I have already noted our strategic review process, \nwhich will continue under my chairmanship. In addition, we have \ndirected the Secretary of the Senate, in coordination with the Clerk of \nthe House, to establish standards for the exchange of legislative \ninformation between the two Chambers. The Secretary has done this, and, \nI am pleased to report, is well launched on a plan for implementing \nthese standards. In addition, the committee and the Secretary are about \nto let a contract that will provide the Senate with options for the \ndesign of a system that will enable us to collect and prepare our \nlegislative information on a much more efficient basis. You will recall \nthat many of our systems were developed over 20 years ago, and while \nthey have served us well, few would disagree that we can do much better \nwith the technology that is available to us today. The result will be \nthat Members and staff of the Senate will have legislative information \nthat is more accurate, more timely, and more comprehensive, every day, \ndirectly at their desktops. While this program will take several years \nto complete fully, we will be able to benefit immediately as each new \ncomponent becomes available.\n  This program will require a long and sustained effort by many people \nand many legislative branch organziations, without additional \nresources. It will require the establishment of priorities and good \nmanagement to ensure these priorities are met. Through this amendment \nwe are designating the Secretary of the Senate, who has the primary \nresponsibility for the Senate's legislative information, to provide \noverall management of this system. We are also directing the \nCongressional Research Service, which understands the legislative \nresearch needs of the Congress, to coordinate with the Committee and \nthe Secretary the development of the retrieval portion of the system. \nAdditionally, we have directed the Library of Congress, with its \nexpertise in the development of information systems, to provide \nsufficient staff and technical support to assist CRS in building this \nretrieval component. We will need and expect the cooperation and \nsupport of the other legislative branch agencies, including the GPO, \nand the GAO and CBO, both of whose reports we will want to include in \nthe system. And, of course, we will continue to rely upon our own \nexcellent staff in the Senate Computer Center and the \nTelecommunications Office in the creation of this system.\n  Mr. President, when this initiative is complete, we in the Senate \nwill have a new, more efficient, and far more useful legislative \ninformation system that will serve the needs of Members and committees. \nIt will be based on standards that allow us to update it regularly and \nas needed. And it will last us well into the next century. It will be \nof a quality that is commensurate with our constitutional \nresponsibilities, and it will aid us greatly as we strive to serve the \ncitizens of this great country.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the first of the amendments is offered on \nbehalf of Senator Hatfield.\n  It amends language reported by the committee to provide for a 2-year \nreauthorization for the American Folklife Center in the Library of \nCongress.\n  The second amendment extends certain provisions of Federal law to \nemployees of the Senate for the Employees Child Care Center.\n  The third amendment provides for the deposit of a contract \ntermination payment to credit the expenses of the Sergeant at Arms.\n  The fourth amendment authorizes and directs the Secretary of the \nSenate to oversee the development and implementation of a legislative \ninformation system for the Senate.\n  Funds for that initiative may be derived from funds previously \nappropriated for a new financial management system for the Senate with \nthe approval of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  The fifth amendment brought to us today by the Disbursing Office \nauthorizes the Financial Clerk of the Senate to receive payments for \nunaccrued annual leave for individuals whose pay is disbursed by the \nSenate and deposit those payments in the General Fund of the Treasury \nas a miscellaneous receipt.\n  And, finally, the sixth amendment recommended to us by the Committee \non Rules and Administration addresses the creation of a legislative \nbranch-wide legislative information system.\n  Mr. President, all of these amendments have been discussed with \nSenator Murray. I believe she has no objection. Therefore, I would ask \nthat these six amendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have had time to review all of these \namendments. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 5112, 5113, 5114, 5115, 5116, and 5117) were \nagreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Limitations on exclusive rights: reproduction for \n       blind or other people with disabilities\n\n       ``(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and \n     710, it is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized \n     entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or phonorecords \n     of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such \n     copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in \n     specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other \n     persons with disabilities.\n       ``(b)(1) Copies or phonorecords to which this section \n     applies shall--\n       ``(A) not be reproduced or distributed in a format other \n     than a specialized format exclusively for use by blind or \n     other persons with disabilities;\n       ``(B) bear a notice that any further reproduction or \n     distribution in a format other than a specialized format is \n     an infringement; and\n       ``(C) include a copyright notice identifying the copyright \n     owner and the date of the original publication.\n       ``(2) The provisions of this section shall not apply to \n     standardized, secure, or norm-referenced tests and related \n     testing material, or to computer programs, except the \n     portions thereof that are in conventional human language \n     (including descriptions of pictorial works) and displayed to \n     users in the ordinary course of using the computer programs.\n       ``(c) For purposes of this section, the term--\n       ``(1) `authorized entity' means a nonprofit organization or \n     a governmental agency that has a primary mission to provide \n     specialized services relating to training, education, or \n     adaptive reading or information access needs of blind or \n     other persons with disabilities;\n       ``(2) `blind or other persons with disabilities' means \n     individuals who are eligible or who may qualify in accordance \n     with the Act entitled ``An Act to provide books for the adult \n     blind'', approved March 3, 1931 (2 U.S.C. 135a; 46 Stat. \n     1487) to receive books and other publications produced in \n     specialized formats; and\n       ``(3) `specialized formats' means braille, audio, or \n     digital text which is exclusively for use by blind or other \n     persons with disabilities.''.\n       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of \n     sections for chapter 1 of title 17, United States Code, is \n     amended by adding after the item relating to section 120 the \n     following:\n\n``121. Limitations on exclusive rights: reproduction for blind or other \n              people with disabilities.''.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that I am offering on \nbehalf of myself and those Senators that I just listed.\n  This amendment is supported by the Association of American \nPublishers, the National Federation of the Blind, the American \nFoundation for the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, \nRecording for the Blind and Dyslexic, and the U.S. Copyright Office.\n  It also has the support of the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand we are waiting for approval by the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee before proceeding.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am proposing along with those Senators \nI mentioned is an amendment to the legislative branch appropriations \nbill regarding books for the blind.\n  In 1931, the Library of Congress National Library Service for the \nBlind and Physically Handicapped was established by an act of Congress. \nSince then, funding for this immensely valuable program has been \nincluded in the legislative branch bill, which, of course, funds the \nLibrary of Congress. The National Library Service and a handful of \nnonprofit organizations reproduce in specialized formats published \nmaterial that is readily available to sighted individuals in libraries, \nbookstores, newsstands and countless other locations.\n  Specialized formats refers to braille, sound recordings--either on \ncassette or phonorecord--and new digital formats that can be used for \nspecial software. To make certain that recorded books and magazines are \nonly used by those for whom they are intended, they are recorded at a \nspeed that simply does not work on standard tape players.\n  The National Library Service provides special tape players and record \nplayers to eligible individuals. This equipment is not generally \navailable to the public. To be eligible to receive this special \nequipment, an applicant must be certified by a qualified professional \nsuch as a doctor, nurse or social worker that he or she is unable to \nuse standard print.\n  The National Library Service selects the books to reproduce in these \nspecialized formats.\n  Frequently, the National Library Service issues request after request \nonly to wait months for a response from the publisher. These delays are \nnot because the publishers have a desire to withhold permission; it is \nsimply a low priority. They just set it aside.\n  There are still 17 books from the 1995 best seller list for which \npermission is still pending.\n  For our Nation's more than 54,000 blind elementary and secondary \nschool students, this is a great problem.\n  The American Printing House for the Blind in Louisville, KY, is the \nprimary producer of braille textbooks. It is a challenge to reproduce \ntoday's highly visible textbooks in braille format. Maps, charts, \ngraphs, and illustrations that take up one page in a standard textbook \nmay require multiple pages of braille or tactile graphics to convey the \nsame information. All in all, it can take a full year to produce a \nbraille textbook. Added time consumed by trying to get permission from \npublishers makes it certain that the blind student is not in sync with \nhis classmates.\n  The amendment Senator Frahm and others and I are introducing seeks to \nend the unintended censorship of blind students' access to current \ninformation. The amendment, as I say, is endorsed by the Association of \nAmerican Publishers, the National Federation of the Blind, the American \nFoundation for the Blind, the American Printing House for the Blind, \nand the U.S. Copyright Office.\n  This is a very simple amendment. This says groups that produce \nspecialized formats for the blind no longer are required to gain \npermission from the copyright holder before beginning production. It is \nbased on an agreement that was reached last January between the \nAssociation of American Publishers and the National Federation of the \nBlind. It includes a very narrow definition of those who are eligible \nto undertake such production and applies the definition for eligibility \nused by the National Library Service to those who receive \nreproductions.\n\n  So, Mr. President, as has been said by a member of the National \nFederation of the Blind, It should be obvious that the delays here \npresent a significant barrier which must be overcome if blind people \nare to be informed and literate. It is not too much to say that living \nsuccessfully in our modern society often depends upon being able to \ncommunicate ideas and facts both orally and in writing.\n  I conclude by a statement from Marybeth Peters, who is the Register \nof Copyrights at the Library of Congress. In testifying before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee she said,\n\n       Blind and physically handicapped readers have a legitimate \n     need for prompt and timely access as soon as possible after \n     works become available to the general reading public. \n     Textbook materials in particular are commonly out of date \n     within 1 to 2 years, superseded by new editions.\n\n  Passage of this amendment will permit the speedy access to \ninformation that blind people need.\n  It is my understanding the managers of the bill are prepared to \naccept the amendment, but we are waiting for the approval of the \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill and hope that \nwhen we receive the approval, as I expect we will, of the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, if I am not here, the manager of the \nbill might be able to call up this amendment and have it considered in \nmy absence.\n  I ask the manager and the ranking member of the committee, if we \nreceive the approval--the only thing we are waiting for is the approval \nof the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. If I could pass that \non, when it is\n\n[[Page S9067]]\n\nreceived, to the managers, if they could then call up the amendment if \nI am not here.\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator, we will be in a position to do that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator very much. I do not know what the \ntime schedule is. We may have to move forward rather quickly. So we \nwill get that information regarding the ranking member as soon as we \ncan.\n  Mr. MACK. I am under the impression, since the Senator has offered \nthe amendment, that his rights have been protected. We will be moving \nforward the remainder of this evening and then tomorrow taking whatever \namendments have been agreed to in the unanimous consent request last \nweek dealing with those amendments.\n  I have forgotten the time that we were slotted for votes.\n  It has not been set yet, but, again, the Senator's rights have been \nprotected since he has offered the amendment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me say that I support the amendment \nthe Senator has offered. We are simply on this side waiting for the \nauthorizing committee to review it, and hopefully that will come fairly \nsoon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Wisconsin seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], is \nrecognized.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask the managers if this would be an appropriate time \nto offer an amendment? Have they had an opportunity to make their \nopening statements?\n  Mr. MACK. I say to the Senator, this is an appropriate time to offer \nan amendment that has been listed in the unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I intend to offer the amendment on behalf of the \nSenator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] and myself. I believe that is one of \nthe listed items.\n  Mr. MACK. I believe I would be in a position to object to that. As I \nunderstand it, the unanimous-consent request indicates that there is a \nslot for Senator McCain to offer an amendment. I have the right to \nobject to a request for someone to offer an amendment on someone else's \nbehalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is correct. The \nSenator from Wisconsin would have to ask unanimous consent to offer the \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that I may offer an amendment \non behalf of the Senator from Arizona, who is unable to be here at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. MACK. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 5120\n\n (Purpose: To further restrict legislative post-employment lobbying by \n                      Members and senior staffers)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf \nof the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. I send the amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for Mr. McCain, \n     for himself and Mr. Feingold, proposes amendment numbered \n     5120.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Section 207(e)(1)(A) of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``1 year'' and inserting \n     ``2 years''.\n       (b) Paragraphs (2)(A), (3), and (4)(A) of section 207(e) of \n     title 18, United States Code, are amended by striking \n     ``within 1 year after'' and inserting ``within 5 years \n     after''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have offered the amendment on behalf \nof Senator McCain of Arizona, which is an outgrowth of a bipartisan \neffort that relates to the issue of post-employment restrictions on \nelected officials and what is more commonly known as the practice of \nthe revolving-door lobby.\n  This amendment follows in a long line of congressional reforms that \nhave been proposed on a bipartisan basis by myself and the Senator from \nArizona and others. Several of us who have been trying to address the \nissue of special interest influence have proposed and pursued several \navenues of reform. Whether it is requiring greater disclosure from the \nlobbying community or passing new gift restrictions that clamps down on \nfree vacation trips and fancy dinners, or finally addressing the \nwoefully inadequate system of campaign finance we are currently saddled \nwith, it is clear that reforming the Congress has become one of the \npreeminent issues among an electorate that has grown to not only view \nthis institution with cynicism and disdain, but has also developed, \nunfortunately, a fundamental distrust of their elected representatives.\n  Mr. President, restoring the faith of the American people in their \nGovernment is without a doubt one of the most important tasks that \nfaces us today.\n  Those of us who have been proposing lobbying reform and gift \nprohibitions and campaign finance reform have sometimes been accused by \ndefenders of the status quo of seeking to limit citizen access to their \nelected representatives. But this is not the case.\n  What we are trying to do is limit special access to elected \nrepresentatives, the kind of access that ordinary Americans living in \nStates like Wisconsin and Arizona do not have. Many of us believe that \nit is simply wrong to suggest that just because you have the financial \nresources to write out enormous campaign contributions or treat \nlegislators to expensive meals, that you should therefore have special \naccess to those Government officials. That is nothing more than \nauctioning off democracy to the highest bidder.\n  A very large part of the culture of special interest influence that \npervades Washington is the revolving door between public service and \nprivate employment. By putting a lock on this revolving door for a \nmeaningful period of time, we can send a message that those entering \nGovernment employment should view public service as an honor and a \nprivilege, not as just another rung on the ladder to personal gain and \nprofit.\n  Mr. President, the facts show there is a public perception that there \nis a problem that needs to be addressed. It is not misguided.\n  There are countless instances of former Members of Congress who once \nchaired or served on committees with jurisdiction over particular \nindustries or special interests who are now lobbying their former \ncolleagues on behalf of those very industries or special interests. \nFormer committee staff directors use their contacts and knowledge of \ntheir former committees to secure lucrative positions in lobbying firms \nand associations with interests related to those committees.\n  Just how fast is the revolving door spinning, Mr. President? Just \nlook at the countless announcements, after the 1994 elections, of \nGovernment officials leaving the public sector to work for lobbying \nfirms.\n  One article announced that an aide leaving her position on the House \nSubcommittee on Energy and Power will be working for the lobbying arm \nof the American Public Power Association.\n  Mr. President, another announcement tells us a recently retired \nofficial member of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on select \nrevenue measures, is joining a Washington lobbying firm as a specialist \non tax policy. Mr. President, we have the former chief of staff to the \nchairman of the House Transportation Committee now lobbying the \ncommittee on behalf of a number of transportation interests.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. The problem of the revolving \ndoor lobbying is quite clear, and in my view, and I strongly believe in \nthe view of\n\n[[Page S9068]]\n\nthe author of this amendment, the senior Senator from Arizona, so is \nthe solution. The solution is clear, too.\n  The amendment offered by the senior Senator from Arizona today will \nstrengthen the postemployment restrictions that are already in place. \nKeep in mind, Mr. President, postemployment restrictions are not \nsomething new. There is currently a 1-year ban on former Members of \nCongress lobbying the entire Congress, as well as a 1-year ban on \nsenior congressional staff lobbying their former employing entity. \nMembers and senior staff are also prohibited from lobbying on behalf of \na foreign entity for 1 year.\n  The McCain amendment will prohibit Members of Congress from lobbying \nthe entire Congress, not just for 1 year but for 2 years. It doubles \nthe time. We double the current restriction.\n  In the most egregious abuses, when a former high-ranking committee \nstaffer is hired by a special interest to lobby that committee, we \nextend the lobbying ban to 5 years. This amendment then bars former \nsenior staffers, defined as any senior staffer or any staffer earning \nin excess of 75 percent of a Member's salary, from lobbying their \nformer employing entities for a period of 5 years.\n  For example, the former chief counsel of the Ways and Means Committee \nwould be prohibited from lobbying any member of that committee or any \ncommittee staffer for a period of 5 years.\n  Mr. President, some might argue that we are inhibiting these talented \nindividuals from pursuing careers in policy matters in which they have \nbecome extremely proficient. It may be asked why a former high-level \nstaffer on the Senate Subcommittee on Communications cannot accept \nemployment with a telecommunications company. After all, this person \nhas accumulated years of knowledge of our communication laws and \ntechnology. Why should this individual be prevented from accepting \nprivate sector employment in the communications field?\n  Of course, Mr. President, our legislation does not do that. Our \nlegislation does not bar anyone from seeking private sector employment. \nThat staffer can take the job with the telecommunications company, but \nwhat they cannot do is lobby their former subcommittee for 5 years. \nThey can consult, they can advise, they can recommended, but they \ncannot lobby their former employer. That is it. That is what the McCain \namendment does.\n  We are only limiting an individual's employment opportunity if they \nare seeking to use their past employment with the Federal Government to \ngain special access or influence with the Government in return for \npersonal gain.\n  Mr. President, we are not here to outlaw the profession of lobbying. \nNot only would that be unconstitutional, but I do not think it would \nreally be addressing the true flaws of our political system. Lobbying, \nwhen done right, is merely an attempt to present the views and concerns \nof a particular group. There is nothing inherently wrong with it. In \nfact, lobbyists, whether they are representing public interest groups \nor Wall Street, can present information to public representatives that \nthey may not otherwise have or obtain. So it can be helpful.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that there is no more noble \nendeavor than to serve in Government, but we need to take immediate \naction to restore the public's confidence in their Government and to \nrebuild the lost trust between Members of Congress and the electorate. \nThis amendment is a small, but I think strong step, in that direction. \nI urge the Members to give it their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nworking out the situation here a few moments ago. I am glad we were \nable to have the amendment offered, and I appreciate the Senator's \nunderstanding with respect to voting this on a voice vote.\n  I am prepared to accept the amendment and take it to conference.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The manager has correctly stated our understanding. I \nappreciate the courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 5120) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MACK. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 3754, in \nlegislative branch appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997.\n  The bill, as reported, provides $2.2 billion in new budget authority \nand $1.9 billion in outlays for the Congress and other legislative \nbranch agencies, including the Library of Congress, the General \nAccounting Office, and the Government Printing Office, among others.\n  When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.3 billion in budget authority \nand $2.2 billion in outlays. The bill is under the subcommittee's \n602(b) allocation by $23 million in budget authority and $49 million in \noutlays.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe legislative branch subcommittee for producing a bill that is \nsubstantially within their 602(b) allocation. I am pleased that this \nbill continues to hold the line on congressional spending.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this bill and to avoid offering amendments \nwhich would cause the committee to exceed its 602(b) allocation.\n\n\n                   appointment of a deputy librarian\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to bring the attention of the \nSenate to committee report language concerning the Library of Congress \nand the appointment and responsibilities of a deputy librarian.\n  I also note the presence of the chairman of the Joint Committee on \nthe Library, Senator Hatfield, and the chairman of the Senate Committee \non Rules and Administration. I wonder if they would care to engage in a \nbrief colloquy regarding this issue.\n  But let me first read the report language in question.\n\n       The committee has reviewed the findings and recommendations \n     of the recent audits of the Library, and believes that the \n     single most important action to be taken would be the \n     appointment of a deputy librarian fully empowered to be the \n     chief executive officer of the Library. The management tasks \n     identified in the audit reports are daunting, and must be \n     given full-time attention. The extraordinary demands already \n     placed upon the Librarian in any number of external arenas \n     and in developing a vision for the Library's transition into \n     a digital future make it impossible for him to deal with the \n     day-to-day administration of the Library's operations. Those \n     responsibilities must be delegated to the Deputy Librarian \n     and the committee looks forward to that being done as soon as \n     the deputy position is filled.\n\n  Mr. President, the committee's phrasing in its instruction to the \nLibrary to empower the Deputy Librarian as the chief executive officer \nwas done so advisedly. The committee is aware that the specific \nrecommendation in the GAO management audit suggested that the deputy \nact as the chief operating officer. And, indeed the library is in the \nprocess of selecting a deputy librarian to fill the position as a chief \noperating officer.\n\n  However, the committee wishes to make it crystal clear that, in our \nconsidered judgment, and for the reasons outlined in the report which I \nhave just read, the Deputy Librarian should be charged with the \nresponsibilities of a chief executive officer.\n  The title and terminology are not as important as the idea that this \ncommittee will be looking to the deputy as the accountable authority in \nthe day-to-day management of the institution.\n  I yield to our most distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee who also serves as the chairman of the Joint Committee on the \nLibrary.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee was \ngood enough to consult with me in the development of the report \nlanguage he has just read, and I concur wholeheartedly in the direction \ngiven to the Library in that language. Our Librarian of Congress, Dr. \nJames Billington,\n\n[[Page S9069]]\n\nis an extraordinary individual of numerous talents and many \nachievements, but no one individual can possibly personally direct all \nthe Library's activities. When the position of Deputy Librarian is \nfilled, the Librarian should delegate to him the responsibility and the \nauthority to deal with the day-to-day administration of the Library's \noperations. The Librarian has written to me to indicate he intends to \ndo exactly that, and I look forward to the beneficial effects of that \ndelegation of responsibility. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. I yield to our most distinguished chairman of the Committee \non Rules and Administration for his comments on the issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I share with both distinguished chairmen, \nthe views as expressed in committee report 104-323 relating to the \nappointment and responsibilities of a deputy librarian of the Library \nof Congress.\n  In our meeting of the Joint Committee on the Library, ably chaired by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from Oregon, we discussed the critical \nneed for a deputy librarian, fully vested with the authority to run the \nday-to-day operations and management of the institution.\n  Each of us recognize the many responsibilities already placed on the \nLibrarian, including those by outlined by statute. His responsibilities \nin developing a vision for the Library into the 21st century is an \nenormous task. Promoting this vision within the institution, in the \nCongress, and indeed throughout the Nation requires an immense amount \nof time and energy. The Librarian has done a tremendous job in this \ncritical area. We applaud his efforts and wish him greater and \ncontinued success. I know we all look forward to working with the \nLibrarian as he continues to set the course for the future of the \nLibrary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9061-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      unanimous-consent agreement\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of amendments numbered 5119 and 5118, which will occur on \nTuesday, that the bill be advanced to third reading, and Senator Byrd \nbe recognized for up to 20 minutes for closing remarks, to be followed \nimmediately by final passage of H.R. 3754, the legislative \nappropriations bill; provided further, that amendments numbered 5118 \nand 5119 not be subject to second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I just have a few more comments to make with \nrespect to the legislative appropriations bill. I am trying to \nanticipate where we might have possible contention in a conference \ncommittee meeting, and that would be on the issue of dynamic scoring, \nwhich Senator Murray referred to in her opening statement.\n  I am one who strongly supports the language, frankly, that was \nincluded in the House bill, which would allow for both the joint \ncommittee and for the CBO, Congressional Budget Office, to use dynamic \nscoring upon request. But I realize the situation that we are in in the \nSenate. There would have been a Budget Act point of order that could be \nraised against the entire bill if, in fact, it had not been removed in \ncommittee. And if I remember correctly, Senator Hatfield offered an \namendment to remove the House language, so that we could proceed \nwithout a point of order being raised.\n  Again, this is an issue that we will have to deal with in conference. \nI just want to make everybody aware that it is one in which there are \nstrong feelings on both sides of the Capitol, and both sides of the \naisle, I suspect.\n  Lastly, I, again, would just like to thank Senator Murray for her \ncooperation in the effort that we have put together to bring about this \nappropriations bill. I also want to express my appreciation to Jim \nEnglish, Eric Llgenfritz, and Larry Harris and Keith Kennedy of our \nside of the aisle, for the work they have put into the writing of this \nlegislation. I appreciate the efforts all of you have made.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from \nFlorida for his work on the legislative branch appropriations bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 5118, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the ranking member sent an amendment to the \ndesk numbered 5118 on behalf of Senator Leahy.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 5118) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have a statement I wish to put into the \nRecord as it relates to that amendment. I want to read it so that there \nwill be no mistake about what we are putting in the Record.\n  Although the ``U.S. Senate Internet Services Usage Rules and \nPolicies'' were adopted on July 22, 1996, Chairman Warner and I have \ndetermined that implementation of the requirements concerning \npromotional and commercial links to Senators' home States will be \ndelayed for 60 days. During that time, the committee is interested in \nhearing from Senators and Senate offices concerned about this issue and \nwill seriously consider constructive input during that time.\n  All other aspects of the policy remains in effect.\n  I thank the Chair.

GEN. NORMAND G. LEZY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today and pay \ntribute to Maj. Gen. Normand G. Lezy, the Director of Air Force \nLegislative Liaison, whose 2-year tenure in that position is about to \ncome to an end.\n  The support that the 535 Members of Congress, and various committees \nof the House and Senate, receive from the legislative liaison offices \nof the four military services and the Coast Guard is critical to \nallowing us to serve our constituents. The men and women who work in \nthese congressional relations offices are known to be courteous, \nresponsive, and excellent representatives of their individual branches \nof the military. Clearly, the high standards these soldiers, marines, \nsailors, coast guardsmen, and airmen adhere to are set by those who \nhead the various legislative liaison missions. These are officers who \nbring a wealth of experience, professionalism, and knowledge with them \nwhen they assume these highly visible and extremely demanding \npositions.\n  For the past 24 months, the Air Force has been well served by General \nLezy, an officer with 21 years of experience, and whose broad \nbackground not only gives him an understanding of Air Force operations \nthat few can match, but which has aided him greatly as he worked to \nmeet the needs and demands of those in Congress. From his days as a \nyoung second lieutenant in the 3355th Student Squadron, where he \nassumed the duties of administrative officer, to his work at the \nPentagon, General Lezy has repeatedly demonstrated his abilities as an \nofficer and his commitment to selflessly working for the security of \nthe United States. Without question, the Air Force Legislative Liaison \noffice has benefited from his command.\n  Mr. President, I am certain that my colleagues both on the Armed \nServices Committee and in the Senate would echo my commendations of \nGeneral Lezy, the support he has provided us, and the service he has \nrendered our Nation. I wish the general great health and much happiness \nin the years to come, and I am sure that he will continue to play a key \nrole in continuing to protect the ideals, interests, and people of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9069-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9069-S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WITHDRAWAL OF REQUEST FOR SEQUENTIAL REFERRAL--S. 1718\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

YVONNE TUCKER\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Yvonne \nTucker, who will retire from the Department of the Army on August 2, \n1996, after a long career of distinguished service to our Nation as a \nFederal civil servant. I am pleased to note that her many efforts over \nthe past 32 years have positively impacted the relationship between the \nArmy and the U.S. Congress.\n  Ms. Tucker began her career in Federal service in the Army's Office \nof the Chief for Legislative Liaison, where she first established a \nreputation for excellence. From 1972 to 1979, she served as a \ncongressional affairs specialist in the Office of the Legal Advisor and \nlegislative assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nDuring her tenure there, she made significant contributions to such \npresidential initiatives as the Panama Canal Treaty Task Force and the \nDepartment of Defense Special Task Force on Korea.\n  In 1979, Ms. Tucker earned a promotion to the Army's Special Actions \nBranch of the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, and \nultimately became Deputy Branch Chief. Having again distinguished \nherself through characteristic outstanding performance, she was \nassigned to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1990 to serve as a \ncongressional actions analyst. Here too, she distanced herself from her \npeers by executing her duties with exceptional skill and innovation.\n  Congress expects and requires timely, accurate information from our \nsenior defense leadership; unfortunately, we often overlook the \ntremendous amounts of staff work required to fulfill these needs. Ms. \nTucker has been instrumental in ensuring that the Army is able to meet \nCongress' expectations, by providing Army officials with guidance as to \nhow to interact with Congress most effectively.\n  Yvonne Tucker is indeed a consummate professional. As a career civil \nservant, she embodied loyalty, integrity, and competence, ideals which \nshe will continue to uphold and to which all Americans should strive. \nShe has served our Nation well, and our heartfelt appreciation and best \nwishes for continued success go with her as she prepares for her next \nendeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9070-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9070-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR \n         CALENDAR YEAR 1994--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 166\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. 3536, I transmit herewith \nthe 30th Annual Report of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, which covers calendar year 1994.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to provide for expedited negotiations between the \nSecretary of the Interior and the villages of Chickaloon-Moose Creek \nNative Association, Inc., Ninilichik Native Association, Inc., Seldovia \nNative Association, Inc., Tyonek Native Corp., and Knikatnu, Inc. \nregarding the conveyances of certain lands in Alaska Under the Alaska \nNative Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the alaska native claims settlement amendment act of 1996\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Stevens. This legislation is intended to \nhelp facilitate a settlement regarding a complex land dispute between \nfive Native Alaskan villages and the Department of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, the villages of Chickaloon-Moose Creek, Ninilchik, \nSelovia, Tyonek, and Knikatnu selected lands over 20 years ago pursuant \nto the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANSCA) along the shores of \nwhat would later become Lake Clark National Park and on the western \ncoast of Cook Inlet. These five villages later relinquished many of \ntheir original selections so that the Department could consolidate \ntheir holdings and preserve valuable lake frontage to create the Lake \nClark National Park in 1980. Without the relinquishment of the \nvillage's original land selections Lake Clark National Park may never \nhave become a reality.\n  In return for the relinquishment of their original selections, the \nvillages were offered other lands on the western coast of Cook Inlet. \nBecause there were five villages, the DOI worked with the villages to \ncreate different ``rounds'' of selections. This process would ensure \nthat no one village would receive all the high or low priority \nselections being offered in the new lands. These rounds were similar to \nthe way the NFL conducts its draft.\n  After the villages made their selections, with the assistance of the \nBureau of Land Management (BLM), the selections were then rejected by \nthe BLM because they were not ``compact and contiguous'' as required by \nANSCA. This resulted in a deficiency conveyance agreement which divided \nthe village selections in Cook Inlet into two appendices--appendix A, \nand appendix C. When the villages signed their agreement they were \ncontinuously assured by the BLM that their selection rounds would \nremain intact thereby preserving their highest priority land \nselections. Indeed, correspondence over the years from the Department \nof the Interior indicates that this was the case.\n  However, now the DOI claims that none of the appendix C lands could \nbe transferred until all appendix A lands have been conveyed. If \nallowed to continue this would result in the Native villages not \nreceiving their priority selections under ANCSA.\n  It is ironic that it was village corporations who gave up their \nselections so that the Department could create Lake Clark National Park \nand now the DOI is blocking the villages right to select lands they \noriginally assisted in selecting by saying it would threaten Lake Clark \nNational Park.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is a fair compromise to this \nproblem. In short the legislation would:\n  Require the Secretary to enter into expedited negotiations with the \nvillage corporations for the purpose of resolving their remaining land \nentitlement issues with either the lands in dispute or other lands in \nAlaska;\n  For any village with much the Secretary reaches agreement he must \nimplement the agreement within 90 days and the issue is then resolved;\n  For any of the villages with which the Secretary fails to reach \nagreement within 180 days, the Secretary must convey to that village 50 \npercent of the lands they selected, in the order of their selection by \npriority rounds;\n  For any of the five villages that still have remaining acreage in \ntheir land entitlements, the Secretary must continue to negotiate with \nthem and report back to Congress on the status of these negotiations;\n  Lastly, the legislation will preserve the village's right to pursue \nthe issue through the judicial system.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is fair and balanced. Each of the two \nparties involved have the opportunity to resolve the issue in an \namicable way where both can walk away with positive results. Failing to \naccomplish this, each party then only gets half of what they want.\n  I would like to point out that, regardless of the rhetoric coming \nfrom opponents of this legislation, these selected lands are not part \nof Lake Clark National Park.\n\n[[Page S9073]]\n\n  I understand the DOI may oppose this legislation. I would like to \ninform the Department of the Interior that I am opposed to them making \nAlaska Natives wait 20 years for their promised land \nconveyances.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Helms, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n   Faircloth, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Lott, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bennett, \n Mr. Frist, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burns, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Stevens, and \n                              Mr. Gorton):\n\n  S. 1999. A bill to define and protect the institution of marriage; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                      the defense of marriage act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill called \nthe Defense of Marriage Act. This bill does just two things. It defines \nthe words ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' for purposes of Federal law and \nit says that no State shall be required to give effect to a law of any \nother State with respect to a same-sex marriage.\n  This bill is a simple bill. It is based on common understandings \nrooted in our nation's history. it merely reaffirms what each Congress \nand every executive agency have meant for 200 years when using the \nwords ``marriage'' and ``spouse''. That is, that a marriage is the \nlegal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a \nperson of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife. The current \nUnited States Code does not contain a definition of marriage, \npresumably because most Americans know what it means. Therefore, the \ndefinition of marriage in this bill comes from well-established case \nlaw. The meaning of spouse is taken from language already in the U.S. \nCode.\n  This bill also does not change State law. It allows each State to \ndecide for itself with respect to same-sex ``marriage''. It does this \nby exercising Congress's powers under the Constitution to legislate \nwith respect to the full faith and credit clause. It provides that a \nState shall be required to give effect to any public act of any other \nState respecting a relationship between persons of the same sex that is \ntreated as a marriage under the laws of such other State. Congress has \nmost recently legislated in a similar fashion with respect to full \nfaith and credit in 1994 when it enacted the Full Faith and Credit for \nChild Support Orders Act and the Safe Homes for Women Act.\n  This bill simply says that marriage is the legal union between one \nman and one woman as husband and wife, and a spouse is a husband or \nwife of the opposite sex. There is nothing earth-shattering there. No \nbreaking of new ground. No setting of new precedents. No revocation of \nrights.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act is necessary for several reasons. In May \nof 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court rendered a preliminary ruling in \nfavor of three same-sex couples applying for marriage licenses. The \ncourt said the marriage law was discriminatory and violated their \nrights under the equal-rights clause of the State constitution. Many \nStates are concerned that another State's recognition of same-sex \nmarriages will compromise their own laws prohibiting such marriages. \nLegislators in over 30 States have introduced bills to deny recognition \nto same-sex unions. Fifteen States already have approved such laws, and \nmany other States are now grappling with the issue--including Hawaii, \nwhere legislative leaders are fighting to block their own courts from \nsanctioning such marriages. This bill would address this issue head-on, \nand it would allow each State to make the final determination for \nitself.\n  Another reason this bill is needed now, concerns Federal benefits. \nThe Federal Government extends benefits, rights and privileges to \npersons who are married, and generally it accepts a State's definition \nof marriage. This bill will help the Federal Government defend its own \ntraditional and commonsense definitions of ``marriage'' and ``spouse''. \nIf, for example, Hawaii gives new meanings to the words ``marriage'' \nand ``spouse'', the reverberation may be felt throughout the Federal \ncode unless this bill is enacted. For instance, a redefinition in \nHawaii could create demands for veterans' benefits for same-sex \nspouses.\n  Let me cite an example. In the 1970's, Richard Baker, a male, \ndemanded increased veterans' educational benefits because he claimed \nJames McConnell, another male, as his dependent spouse. When the \nVeterans Administration turned him down, he sued, and the outcome \nturned on a Federal statute that made eligibility for the benefits \ncontingent on the State's definition of ``spouse'' and ``marriage''. \nThe Federal courts rejected the claim for added benefits because the \nState supreme Court had already determined that in Minnesota, marriage \nwas not available to persons of the same sex (McConnell versus Nooner, \n547 F.2d 54, 1976). This bill anticipates future demands such as that \nmade in the veterans' benefits case, and it reasserts that, for the \npurposes of Federal law, the word ``marriage'' will continue to mean \n``only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and \nwife'' and the word ``spouse'' will continue to mean ``a person of the \nopposite sex who is a husband or a wife.''\n  Another example of why we need a Federal definition of the terms \n``marriage'' and ``spouse'' occurred during debate on the Family and \nMedical Leave Act of 1993. Shortly before passage of this act, I \nattached an amendment that defined ``spouse'' as ``a husband or wife, \nas the case may be.'' I also gave a short speech on the amendment. When \nthe Secretary of Labor published his proposed regulations, a \nconsiderable number of comments were received urging that the \ndefinition of ``spouse'' be ``broadened to include domestic partners in \ncommitted relationships, including same-sex relationships.'' When the \nSecretary issued the final rules he stated that the definition of \n``spouse'' in the act and the legislative history precluded such a \nbroadening of the definition of ``spouse''. The amendment, which was \nunanimously adopted, spared a great deal of costly and unnecessary \nlitigation over the definition of spouse.\n\n  These are just a few reasons for why we need to enact the Defense of \nMarriage Act. Enactment of this bill will allow States to give full and \nfair consideration of how they wish to address the issue of same-sex \nmarriages instead of rushing to legislate because of fear that another \nState's laws may be imposed upon them. It also will eliminate legal \nuncertainty concerning Federal benefits, and make it clear what is \nmeant when the words ``marriage'' and ``spouse'' are used in the \nFederal Code.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this bill and I ask for \ntheir support when this issue comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1999\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas, the Paris Peace Accords of 1991 and the successful \n     national elections of 1993 ended the genocide in Cambodia, \n     brought two decades of civil war nearer to cessation, \n     demonstrated the commitment of the Cambodian people to \n     democracy and stability, and led to the creation of a \n     national constitution guaranteeing fundamental human rights;\n       Whereas, since 1991 the international community has \n     contributed almost $2 billion to peacekeeping and national \n     reconstruction in Cambodia and currently provides over 40 \n     percent of the budget of the Royal Government of Cambodia \n     (RGC);\n       Whereas, recent events in Cambodia--including the arrest \n     and exile of former Foreign Minister Prince Sirivudh, the \n     expulsion of former Finance Minister Sam Rainsy from the \n     FUNCINPEC Party and the National Assembly, a grenade attack \n     against the independent Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party of \n     Cambodia, mob attacks against pro-opposition newspapers, the \n     assassination of journalist and Khmer National Party member \n     Thun Bunly, and harassment of other journalists--suggest that \n     Cambodia is sliding back into a pattern of violence and \n     repression;\n       Whereas, rampant corruption in the RGC has emerged as a \n     major cause of public dissatisfaction, which--when expressed \n     by opposition politicians and the press--has resulted in \n     government crackdowns;\n       Whereas, Cambodia has been added to the Department of \n     State's list of major narcotics trafficking countries;\n       Whereas, the RGC--in contravention to the Cambodian \n     Constitution--has sanctioned massive deforestation and timber \n     exploitation which has devastated the environment, endangered \n     the livelihoods of many of the country's farmers, and helped \n     finance both the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and the Khmer \n     Rouge in their civil war;\n       Whereas, the desire to cite Cambodia United Nations \n     peacekeeping success story has stifled official international \n     expressions of concern about deteriorating conditions in \n     Cambodia; Now therefore, be it Resolved, That it is the sense \n     of the Senate that:\n       (1) among the primary objectives in U.S. policy toward \n     Cambodia should be improvements in Cambodia's human rights \n     conditions, environmental and narcotics trafficking record, \n     and the RGC's conduct;\n       (2) the Secretary of State should closely monitor \n     preparations for upcoming Cambodian elections in 1997 and \n     1998 and should attempt to secure the agreement of the RGC to \n     full and unhindered participation of international observers \n     for those elections to ensure that those elections are held \n     in a free and fair manner complying with international \n     standards,\n       (3) the Secretary of State should support the continuation \n     of human rights monitoring in Cambodia by the United Nations, \n     including monitoring through the office of the United Nations \n     Center for Human Rights in Phnom Penh and monitoring by the \n     Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary \n     General for Human Rights in Cambodia;\n       (4) the Secretary of State should encourage Cambodia's \n     other donors and trading partners to raise concerns with the \n     RGC over Cambodia's human rights, environmental, narcotics \n     trafficking and governmental conduct;\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and Senator \nFeinstein to submit a resolution expressing concerns about a series of \ndisturbing developments in Cambodia.\n  Recently, the Senate Finance Committee reported out H.R. 1642 to \nextend permanent most-favored nation tariff treatment to Cambodia. \nYesterday, the full Senate passed this legislation by voice vote.\n  When the Finance Committee marked up H.R. 1642, the committee's \nmembers made clear their serious concerns about increasing acts of \nrepression by the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]. They also \nregistered their concerns about growing corruption at the highest \nlevels of the civilian and military administration, increasing drug \ntrafficking, and substantial environmental degradation.\n  In reporting out the bill, the committee made it clear that it was \ndoing so, in part, because it believes normal trade relations with \nCambodia could serve to improve Cambodia's behavior.\n  The resolution we are submitting today is meant to send a parallel \nmessage--that the United States Senate\n\n[[Page S9075]]\n\nremains deeply concerned about problems in Cambodia, and will continue \nto follow events in that country closely.\n  Since 1991 the international community has contributed almost $2 \nbillion to peacekeeping and national reconstruction in Cambodia. \nMultilateral aid also provides over 40 percent of the Royal Government \nof Cambodia's annual budget. American taxpayers contribute a major \nportion of these sums.\n  While the United Nations-sponsored election of 1993 brought a brief \nperiod of freedom and democratic improvement to Cambodia, recent \ndevelopments on a variety of fronts suggests that Cambodia's future \nremains precarious at best.\n  For instance, Prince Norodom Sirivudh, former Deputy Prime Minister \nand Foreign Affairs Minister was arrested by the current government \nunder trumped up charges of fomenting a plot to assassinate the Second \nPrime Minister, Hun Se. After a summary trial without proper defense, \nPrince Sirivudh was found guilty by Hun Sen-appointed judges and was \nsent into exile in France.\n  Another prominent opposition leader, Former Finance Minister Sam \nRainsy was expelled from the coalition Funcinpec Party and the National \nAssembly for having criticized the RGC for its lack of transparency in \nits business deals with foreign firms. Since his expulsion, several \nmembers of his party have been murdered.\n  A number of members of another opposition party, the Buddhist Liberal \nDemocratic Party of Cambodia, headed by former Prime Minister Sonn San, \ndied as a result of a grenade attack during that party's national \nconvention.\n  In addition, a number of editors and reporters from opposition \nnewspapers have been assassinated. Currently, none of these \nassassination cases have been solved.\n  Corruption in Phnom Penh is rampant and Cambodia has emerged as a \nmajor heroin trafficking center in Asia. Finally, in contravention to \nthe Cambodian Constitution, the RGC has permitted deforestation and \ntimber exploitation on such a massive scale that the agricultural \nlivelihoods of enormous numbers of Cambodians are now threatened.\n  The resolution I am submitting registers the concerns I know we all \nshare in the Senate on these disturbing trends in the Cambodian \neconomy, government and environment. Mr. President, I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9074-3", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9075-S9077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                BUMPERS (AND HARKIN) AMENDMENT NO. 5096\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, and Mr. Harkin) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 1959) making appropriations for energy and water \ndevelopment for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 23, line 8, reduce the amount by $268,600,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 5097\n\n  Mr. JOHNSTON (for Mr. Wellstone) proposed an amendment to the bill, \nS. 1959, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 19, line 4, strike ``expended.'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``expended; Provided, That funds appropriated for \n     energy supply, research and development activities shall be \n     reduced by four-tenths of one percent from each program and \n     that the amount of the reduction shall be available for the \n     biomass power for rural development program.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 5098\n\n  Mr. KYL proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1959, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 14, line 1, strike ``$410,499,000'' and insert \n     ``397,096,700''.\n       On page 14, line 5, strike ``$71,728,000'' and insert \n     ``$58,325,700''.\n       On page 14, line 14, before the colon insert'': Provided \n     further, the amounts allocated by the Committee on \n     Appropriations of each House in accordance with sections \n     602(a) and 602(b) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and \n     pursuant to the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 1997 shall be adjusted downward by $13,402,300 \n     and the revised levels of budget authority and outlays shall \n     be submitted to each House by the chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget of that House and shall be printed in the \n     Congressional Record''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               DOMENICI (AND JOHNSTON) AMENDMENT NO. 5099\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Johnston) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 5098 proposed by Mr. Kyl to the bill, S. 1959, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       In amendment No. 5098, strike lines 3 through 9 and insert \n     in lieu thereof:\n       On page 19, line 3, strike ``2,749,043,000,'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``2,764,043,000,'' and on page 20, line 9, \n     strike ``220,200,000'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     ``205,200,000.''\n       Insert where appropriate: ``Technology development for the \n     defense environmental restoration and waste management.--\n     Within available funds, up to $2,000,000 is provided for \n     demonstration of stir-melter technology developed by the \n     Department and previously intended to be used at the Savannah \n     River Site.

It is the sense of the Senate that if a new U.S.-\n     Japan Semiconductor Agreement is not concluded by July 31, \n     1996, that (a) ensures continued calculation of foreign \n     market share in Japan according to the formula set forth in \n     the current agreement, and (b) provides for continuation of \n     current measures to deter renewed dumping of semiconductors \n     in the United States and in third country markets, the \n     President shall--\n       (1) Direct the Office of the United States Trade \n     Representatives and the Department of Commerce to establish a \n     system to provide for unilateral U.S. Government calculation \n     and publication of the foreign share of the Japanese \n     semiconductor market, according to the formula set forth in \n     the current agreement;\n       (2) Report to the Congress on a quarterly basis regarding \n     the progress, or lack thereof, in increasing foreign market \n     access to the Japanese semiconductor market; and\n       (3) Take all necessary and appropriate actions to ensure \n     that all U.S. trade laws with respect to foreign market \n     access and injurious dumping are expeditiously and vigorously \n     enforced with respect to U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade, as \n     appropriate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        SIMON AMENDMENT NO. 5102\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Simon) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1959, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 19 line 4 add the following before the period: '': \n     Provided, That $5,000,000 shall be available for research \n     into reducing the costs of converting saline water to fresh \n     water''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                KEMPTHORNE AND CRAIG AMENDMENT NO. 5103\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Kempthorne, for himself, and Mr. Craig) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 1959, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``Of \n     amounts appropriated for the Defense Environmental \n     Restoration and Waste Management Technology Development \n     Program, $5,000,000 shall be available for the \n     electrometallurgical treatment of spent nuclear fuel at \n     Argonne National Laboratory.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HATFIELD AMENDMENT NO. 5104\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Hatfield) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n1959, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 37 add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, recently the Nashville News, of \nNashville, IL, carried a column by Grover Brinkman, a former newspaper \neditor who is now 93 years old and lives in Monroe County, IL.\n  What he wrote for the Nashville News is a great combination of wisdom \nand humor. Those of us who have acquired the status of senior citizen--\nI am now 67--can appreciate the wisdom handed down by a 93 year old.\n  I ask that the Nashville News article by Grover Brinkman, be printed \nin the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                         Admit A Generation Gap\n\n                          (By Grover Brinkman)\n\n       How does one accept senior status with grace? Good \n     question, isn't it! Perhaps some sage will have the right \n     answer some day, but it's debatable.\n       One can turn hermit and play checkers in a nursing home. Or \n     perhaps a better way . . . face the ticking clock in a \n     humorous vein that has no negatives.\n       Or if deep thinking is part of your waking hours, check out \n     some of the following questions:\n       Do you remember the time when you dimmed the lights for \n     romantic reasons? Now you replace the 100 watt bulbs with 40s \n     as an economy measure to stretch your Social Security \n     dollars.\n       There are many memories of voluptuous gals in a halter and \n     bikini; now a bit of this memorbilia triggers your pacemaker \n     and raises the garage door.\n       Your house is much too large at the moment. When the kids \n     were growing up, it was just the opposite.\n       A rocking chair was once used by grandma, now you're in it.\n       You bite down on one of those luscious red apples from the \n     Pacific Northwest, and your newly-acquired dentures stay \n     there.\n       You satisfy a whim to have your palm read, but the seer \n     instead concentrates on your forehead, for the lines there \n     are more distinctive.\n       You always insisted that burning the midnight oil was the \n     routine that made life livable; now end of day seems to be \n     nine o'clock.\n       You read only the headlines in the morning paper, for your \n     tired eyes can't decipher the seven-point body text.\n       You get winded playing a game of dominoes with your \n     grandson.\n       Most of the seniors at the center carry little black books, \n     but now they contain only names with an added M.D.\n       If you get an occasional gleam in your eyes, it's probably \n     the sun bouncing off your tri-focals.\n       Your realize that your entire body aches, and what doesn't, \n     won't work. Even your toes at times have toothaches. (Or \n     would the word toe-aches be better?)\n       Your children have a middle aged look, and your grand-kids \n     are six feet-plus basketball giants.\n\n[[Page S9079]]\n\n       You walk holding your head high, necessary to see the \n     potholes high, necessary to see the potholes in the walk \n     through your tri-focals.\n       You're still 15 around the collar, 54 around the waist, and \n     90 on the golf course.\n       When you go for a haircut, the barber trims more hair out \n     of your nose and eyebrows than on your balding head.\n       Presumably you're well-versed, know most of the answers to \n     today's problems, but no one asks for your opinion.\n       All your peers talk about the golden years, but you doubt \n     if they have as much shiny metal as a new penny.\n       You used to take a pill or two at bedtime to keep a \n     vigorous health, now they advise one to help you sleep.\n       Even a sip of your favorite wine seems to aggravate your \n     ulcer, so you drink skim milk instead, remembering when you \n     were a boy growing up on a boon-docks farm, they used skim \n     milk only for hogs. Today it costs about as much as the real \n     article.

But as a \n     youngster, the only cramps you knew were deep stomach \n     wretching called cholera morbus, after you'd eaten too many \n     green apples.\n       But it's still a good life despite negative viewpoints. In \n     fact it's the only thing left, come to think of it. You're \n     old, stubborn as the proverbial Missouri mule, but still \n     confident that you'll be around for a few more moons, \n     awaiting the day when the good Lord throws in the final \n     towel.\n       There is one consoling thought in this treatise on \n     longevity--scores of old friends are up there, holding open \n     the gate. Some of them, with genes shorter lived than mine, \n     have been holding open that gate for a long time.\n       I don't have the genes of a Methuselah, but I'm running \n     neck and neck with Bob Hope, and that would tickle anyone's \n     hormones. Grow old, but don't let senility be a part of \n     it!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9078-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BALDWIN FIRE DEPARTMENT CELEBRATING 100\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of \nthe Baldwin Fire Department as they gear up to celebrate 100 years of \nvolunteer fire service to Baldwin, NY.\n  Baldwin was a small hamlet in 1896 when, on a cold January night, the \ngeneral store at its center caught fire after a kerosene lantern was \ndropped. The neighboring Freeport volunteers were summoned to save the \nsurrounding buildings. Shortly thereafter a group of civic leaders met \nto organize fire protection in and for Baldwin. A committee was formed \nto raise funds and the department was officially organized on February \n8. Initial equipment was purchased for $680 and the department went \ninto service in April of 1896. There were 40 volunteers who were \nrequired to pay $3.90 each for their uniforms which consist of a cap, a \nwhite sweater lettered ``Baldwin'' and a belt. At that time the alarm \nwas a railroad locomotive wheel rim hung from two poles and rung by a \nlarge sledgehammer. John H. Carl served as chief for the first 4 years. \nAfter 2 years, a permanent firehouse was built and a proper alarm bell \nwas installed. The department had strong support from the community and \nthe mortgage on this firehouse was paid off in May 1905.\n  Since those humble beginnings, the Baldwin Fire Department has kept \npace with firefighting techniques and developments and attained its \npresent size of 226 members among its seven companies. The present \napparatus consists of seven pumpers, two tower ladders, one heavy \nrescue truck, two ambulances, two water rescue boats on trailers, and \nfour chief's vehicles. In 1995 this all-volunteer fire and rescue \nservice responded to 1,783 alarms. Currently it is led by Chief James \nBugler. His deputy chiefs are John Coughlin, Keith Eckels, and Henry \nChambers. Gary Eckels serves as chief of fire prevention, as public \ninformation officer, and as a fire commissioner.\n  One of the biggest events ever held in Baldwin will take place on \nSaturday, August 10, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the \nBaldwin Fire Department. The day will begin with some lively \nfirefighter competitions. Later in the day a centennial parade will be \nled by the U.S. Marine Corps Band, followed by the world famous \nBudweiser Clydesdales, thousands of firefighters, hundreds of fire \ntrucks, and many other participants. This will truly be a once-in-a-\nlifetime event; a celebration of life, good works, and community spirit \nwhich has been displayed by the Baldwin Fire Department over 100 years \nof change. Many pieces have been woven together over the years to bring \nus to this great day; a day of celebration, a day to salute all of \nthose who have given of their very selves to better community, to \nbetter America. Mr. President, I salute the brave men and women of the \nBaldwin Fire Department and wish them many more years of continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9079-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9079-S9080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, the United States has made clear its \nintention to veto a second term for United Nations Secretary-General \nBoutros Boutros-Ghali. This unfortunate opposition to his reelection \nwas the subject of a column I wrote for Illinois newspapers, which I \nask be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                     A Misstep by the United States\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Suppose a local Rotary Club had the community's most \n     wealthy and powerful citizen, Sam Smith, as a member. Imagine \n     that the Rotarians had a dues system that reflected the \n     ability to pay, so that wealthy Sam Smith paid more in dues \n     than any other Rotarian.\n       To complicate the story, Sam Smith is far back in the \n     payment of his dues, so far back that the money he owes \n     amounts to almost the total budget of the club for a year.\n       The president of the Rotary Club is up for reelection, and \n     most of the members want him reelected, but Mr. Big, Sam \n     Smith, says no.\n       How popular do you think Sam Smith would be with the other \n     Rotarians? Would his influence rise or fall? And what will \n     the other Rotarians do in their election of a president?\n       The story is true.\n       Only the ``club'' is called the United Nations. The wealthy \n     deadbeat member is called Sam, Uncle Sam. Most of the UN \n     members believe that Secretary General Boutros-Ghali is doing \n     a good job, despite being hampered by approximately $1.4 \n     billion that the United States owes but has not paid.\n       But the United States has made clear that we want to veto \n     his reelection as Secretary-General.\n       The other nations, already too often unimpressed by our \n     uncertain leadership in foreign policy, are not pleased with \n     what we are doing, believing it is dictated by domestic \n     political considerations.\n       In 1978, President Jimmy Carter designated me as one of the \n     delegates to a two-month session of the United Nations, and I \n     have followed the UN and its work with more than casual \n     interest.\n       My impression is that overall the United Nations performs a \n     vital service and a good job, not perfect, and that Boutros-\n     Ghali has been a hard-working, effective leader--hampered in \n     part by the United States talking a great game, but not \n     paying our dues.\n       Egypt is the home of the Secretary-General, and as an \n     Egyptian he is also an African. Africa sometimes is called \n     ``the dark continent.'' It is more accurately described as \n     the ignored continent.\n       One little-known fact is the gradual spread of democracy in \n     Africa, some of them fledgling democracies that deserve more \n     encouragement from the United States and other nations.\n       African countries take pride in having Boutros-Ghali as the \n     Secretary-General.\n       Our opposition to him is coupled with other realities that \n     they see: President Clinton has never visited Africa. \n     Secretary of State Warren Christopher has not visited any \n     sub-Saharan country since he has been Secretary, compared to \n     24 visits to Syria.\n       Our inattention, coupled with our unfortunate open \n     opposition to the reelection of the Secretary-General, has \n     not made us any friends.\n\n[[Page S9080]]\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and \nrevenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1996 concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. \nRes. 67), show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $15.5 billion in budget authority and by $14.3 billion in \noutlays. Current level is $109 million below the revenue floor in 1996 \nand $5.5 billion above the revenue floor over the 5 years 1996-2000. \nThe current estimate of the deficit for purposes of calculating the \nmaximum deficit amount is $260.0 billion, $14.3 billion above the \nmaximum deficit amount for 1996 of $245.7 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 8, 1996, Congress has cleared for \nthe President's signature an Act Amending the Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961 and the Arms Export Control Act (H.R. 3121), an Act for the Relief \nof Benchmark Rail Group, Inc.

Mr. President, the recently completed report on \nthe investigation of Whitewater development and related matters was a \ncostly political exercise. I was a member of that special committee and \nwrote about the committee's findings in a weekly column that was \ndistributed to newspapers in Illinois.\n  I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n      The Whitewater Investigation Was A Costly Political Exercise\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       The Senate Whitewater investigation resulted in a political \n     exercise that contributed nothing, except to add to public \n     cynicism and confirming the already widespread belief that in \n     Congress we are playing partisan games rather than tending to \n     the nation's and the public's real needs.\n\n[[Page S9081]]\n\n       Obviously some people broke the law in the Whitewater \n     events, but the evidence indicated neither a violation of the \n     law nor of ethical standards by Bill Clinton or Hillary \n     Clinton while he served either as President or as Governor of \n     Arkansas.\n       But the misuse of the FBI files is another matter. Both the \n     White House and the FBI are at fault. The President probably \n     is not personally involved, but it happened in his White \n     House and administration and it should not be treated as a \n     minor mess-up by the President or his staff. The misuse of \n     police powers by governments is as old as governments \n     themselves, and something that must be constantly guarded \n     against.\n       The abuse of the FBI files comes at a time when there are \n     two other abuses.\n       One is the Senate investigation which spent almost $2 \n     million, received testimony from 139 witnesses, and took more \n     time than any investigation of a sitting President in our \n     history--longer than the Watergate or Iran-Contra hearings. \n     ``Where there is smoke there must be fire'' is an old saying, \n     but those hearings were designed to create smoke. Not only is \n     there a product of questionable worth, we took testimony from \n     many individuals who never in their lives thought they would \n     testify before a Senate Committee, such as secretaries. Some \n     were terrified by the combination of coming before a \n     committee and being on national television.\n       A second abuse is the multiplying like rabbits of special \n     counsels--really special prosecutors--with no limits on their \n     expenses and their ability to use huge resources from the FBI \n     and other agencies. I voted for the law creating the special \n     counsel, but now I sense we need a better answer.\n       Since the FBI and the work of U.S. attorneys fall under the \n     jurisdiction of the Attorney General, my sense is that we \n     should review the possibility of a change in how we structure \n     that office. It differs from other cabinet posts in its broad \n     police and prosecutorial responsibilities, and the recent FBI \n     debacle and the runaway habits of the special prosecutors, \n     might provide an incentive to the next Congress and President \n     to look at this question.\n       For example, we might have an Attorney General appointed \n     for a 10-year term, with a small bipartisan group giving the \n     President a list of five names to choose from, and also \n     giving him the ability to request a new list of names if he \n     found them unsatisfactory, but still requiring confirmation \n     by the Senate. And then have no special prosecutors.\n       This is not a criticism of Janet Reno, who is a much-above-\n     average Attorney General. Another example of a good \n     appointment is President Gerald Ford's naming of Ed Levi, \n     then president of the University of Chicago. No one felt that \n     at any time Gerald Ford could get Ed Levi to do anything but \n     what he believed was in the best interests of the nation. \n     That is the way it should be.\n       My hope is that out of the present mini-storms something \n     constructive can happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9080-1", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INDIGENOUS CONSERVATIONIST OF THE YEAR AWARD HIS MAJESTY KING \n                          TAUFA'AHAU TUPOU IV\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, all Americans are concerned about \nthe world's environment and how to protect it. Parts of the world not \nclose to most of us still affect all of us greatly. One part of the \nworld that is remote to most Americans, but vitally important to all of \nour welfare, is the rain forest. All of us are endangered by the \ndestruction of rain forests that is occurring all over the world. The \nrain forests constitute unique and irreplaceable ecosystems sometimes \ncalled the lungs of the earth. In addition to their function in \nreplenishing the Earth's atmosphere, the rain forests provide essential \nprotection against global warming, contain hundreds of plants found \nnowhere else on Earth, house many animals unique to the rain forests \nalone, and provide protection against destruction of coral reefs and \nmarine life. I would like to bring to your attention the efforts to \nsave these vital systems and to recognize an individual who is being \nhonored for his own efforts to save the rain forests.\n  His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV of the Kingdom of Tonga has been \nselected to receive this year's Seacology Foundation Award as the \nIndigenous Conservationist of the Year in recognition of his superb \nefforts to preserve the rain forest and indigenous Polynesian culture. \nHis Royal Highness' successes include providing royal protection for \nthe peka or flying fox colony in Kolovai Village in Tongatupu Island. \nHe is also responsible for protecting the primary forest of `Eau Island \nand for establishing a system of nature preserves throughout the \nKingdom of Tonga. None of these achievements would have occurred \nwithout His Royal Highness.\n  Seacology Foundation is a nonprofit foundation founded to help \nprotect island ecosystems and island cultures. Seacology scientists \ninclude experts in endangered species, island flora and fauna, and \nisland ecosystems. One hundred percent of the money donated to \nSeacology goes directly to building schools, hospitals, installing safe \nwater supplies, and meeting other needs of the rain forest villagers so \nthat they will not have to sell off the rain forest to survive. \nSeacology scientists donate their time as well.\n  I congratulate His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV and the Seacology \nFoundation for all of their efforts.\n  I ask that the letter from Paul Alan Cox, Ph.D., chairman of the \nboard of the Seacology Foundation, to His Royal Highness be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n\n                                     The Seacology Foundation,\n\n                               Springfield, UT, December 15, 1995.\n     His Majesty King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV,\n     The Kingdom of Tonga.\n       Your Royal Highness: It is with deepest respect that I \n     inform your royal highness that you have been selected as the \n     1996 Indigenous Conservationist of the Year by the Seacology \n     Foundation. This annual award is made to honor those \n     indigenous people who have performed heroic service in \n     preserving their own ecosystems and cultures.\n       After careful consideration of the activities of your \n     majesty in providing royal protection for the peka or flying \n     fox colony in Kolovai Village in Tongatapu island (which is \n     the oldest flying fox refuge in the world), for your \n     protection of the primary forest of Eua island, for your \n     support in establishing a system of nature preserves \n     throughout the Kingdom of Tonga, and for your life-long \n     service as an interpreter and custodian of Tongan culture, \n     both ancient and modern, the Scientific Advisory Board of the \n     Seacology Foundation has unanimously voted to honor your \n     majesty with this award, which is the most prestigious \n     conservation award for indigenous people in the world.\n       The Seacology Foundation invites you, at our expense, to \n     attend an award dinner in your honor and a presentation \n     ceremony in Salt Lake City, Utah to receive your award, which \n     will consist of an engraved plaque and a cash award of \n     $1,000. Fine Nau and I will meet with you personally to \n     arrange a convenient date for this event.\n       Because of your stellar service, both public and private to \n     conservation, and because of the tremendous example of \n     dedication and courage that you have set for your own \n     people--the Polynesian Islanders--and for indigenous peoples \n     throughout the world, the Seacology Foundation is pleased to \n     bestow upon you the most distinguished award for indigenous \n     conservation in the world by naming you 1996 Indigenous \n     Conservationist of the Year.

Mr. President, the annual Defense Department \nauthorization passed by the Senate would create a Corporation for the \nPromotion of Rifle Practice and Firearms Safety. In a weekly column \nthat is distributed to newspapers in Illinois, I discussed this useless \nand wasteful program.\n  I ask that the column be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                        A Boondoggle for the NRA\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Buried in the annual Defense Department authorization bill \n     is an outrageous gift of $77 million that will benefit \n     something called the Corporation for the Promotion of Rifle \n     Practice and Firearms Safety.\n       This corporation is the new ``private'' incarnation of the \n     old National Rifle Association-backed Civilian Marksmanship \n     Program. This program was intended to make sure people could \n     shoot straight in case they entered the military. In recent \n     years, however, it has simply funneled cash, weapons and \n     ammunition to private gun clubs, thanks to the power of the \n     NRA.\n       Until a Federal judge ruled it unconstitutional in 1979, \n     gun clubs which participated in this program were required to \n     be NRA members.\n       Under public pressure to eliminate this useless and \n     wasteful program, Congress ``privatized'' the program last \n     year.\n       In fact, the corporation is private in name only. When the \n     corporation becomes fully operational in October of this year \n     it will be given by the Army: 176,218 rifles the Army views \n     as outmoded, but valued at $53,271,002; Computers, vehicles, \n     office equipment and other related items valued by the Army \n     at $8,800,000; 146 million rounds of ammunition valued by the \n     Army at $9,682,656; $5,332,000 in cash.\n       That totals $77,085,658.\n       Our friends in the National Rifle Association strongly back \n     this measure and it appears to be a boondoggle for them.\n       What the Army should do with outmoded weapons is to destroy \n     them. Our government\n\n[[Page S9082]]\n\n     has a theoretical policy that it does not sell federally \n     owned weapons to the public. The Civilian Marksmanship \n     Program violates this policy, and the new corporation would \n     continue to violate it.\n       Why we should be subsidizing rifle practice--which is the \n     theory behind this--baffles me. Hardly any of those who will \n     use the weapons will enter into the armed forces. The Defense \n     Department did not request this.\n       I had never fired a rifle or handgun before entering the \n     Army, and with minimal training I became a fair-to-good \n     marksman.\n       Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and I tried to \n     eliminate this incomprehensible expenditure from the bill and \n     we got only 29 votes for our amendment. The NRA still has \n     power.\n       We should be reducing the numbers of weapons in our \n     society, not increasing them.\n       A government policy of destroying weapons and not selling \n     outmoded guns to the public is sound.\n       While rifles are not the primary weapons for crime--pistols \n     are--some of those 176,000 weapons will get into the hands of \n     people who should not have them. If 1 percent reach someone \n     who is irresponsible, that is 1,760 weapons.\n       Let me in advance extend my sympathy to the families of the \n     people who will be killed by these weapons. They will be \n     needless victims of this folly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9081-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. AID TO AFRICA\n\n Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, The salaries of the most elite \nprofessional basketball players who became free agents and signed \ncontracts during a 1-week period in July outstripped the amount of \nUnited States development aid to all African nations except Egypt. I \ndiscussed this development in a weekly column written for newspapers in \nmy State and ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n        NBA Star Pay Shoots Past U.S. Development Aid To Africa\n\n                        (By Senator Paul Simon)\n\n       Ask people at any town meeting whether we are spending too \n     much money on foreign aid and there will be a resounding \n     ``yes'' response--but there would not be if they knew the \n     facts.\n       The world's poorest continent is Africa, and this year we \n     are spending $628 million in development aid to African \n     nations, if Egypt is excluded from the calculation.\n       Compare that with the total for the contracts signed July \n     11th to July 18th for free agents with the National \n     Basketball Association: $927 million.\n       Twenty-nine African nations have total government revenue \n     less than the amount paid to these star athletes.\n       I have no objection to the money earned by Michael Jordan \n     and the others. They are players of unbelievable talent. And \n     the people of the nation are not making any great sacrifice \n     to provide these funds for them.\n       Nor are we making a great sacrifice in foreign aid.\n       That $628 million in aid to Africa compares to $1.2 billion \n     we get from one cent of gasoline tax in the United States. So \n     the aid to Africa is slightly more than one-half cent a \n     gallon, if we were to use the gasoline tax to pay for it, \n     which we are not.\n       The United States was once the most generous nation in \n     helping the poor beyond our borders. Now, of the nations of \n     Western Europe and Japan, Australia and New Zealand, we are \n     dead last.\n       We once gave almost 3 percent of our national income to \n     help the needy beyond our borders, and now we give less than \n     one-sixth of 1 percent. Norway gives eight times as much as \n     we do, in percentage terms.\n       Foreign aid is less than 1 percent of our Federal budget. \n     And the total is getting smaller each year.\n       Should we be doing a better job of giving opportunity to \n     the poor here at home?\n       Of course we should. And those of us who advocate doing \n     more to help the poor at home are the same ones who advocate \n     helping them beyond our borders.\n       If instead of giving the Defense Department $18 billion \n     more than they requested for this year and next, which we are \n     doing, we were to devote one-third of that amount to helping \n     the poor here at home, one-third to helping the impoverished \n     in other countries, and one-third to reduce the deficit, we \n     would have a stronger nation, a better nation, and a more \n     stable world.\n       The United States is gradually becoming more short-sighted \n     and provincial both at home and abroad. ``Let's take care of \n     ourselves,'' is the cry, and ``ourselves'' excludes the poor \n     at home and the poor abroad.\n       And so we fall far behind in paying our United Nations \n     dues, and do not provide adequate leadership in troubled \n     areas at home and abroad.\n       Congressman Ray Thornton of Arkansas suggested that the \n     United States should have a Marshall Plan for impoverished \n     areas of our Nation. He is right. We need it both here and \n     for other nations.\n       But that requires creativity, courage and compassion by \n     leaders. ``Welfare reform'' for too many has become a code \n     phrase for bashing the poor even more, though genuine reform \n     is obviously needed.\n       The nation that led the world with the exciting and \n     compassionate and sensible Marshall Plan is now a nation in \n     retreat.

A former political writer, and associate editor \nof the Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock, he wrote this article for the \nHerald.''\n  I don't believe I've ever met Mr. Dumas, but he has written an \narticle that gives a perspective on the Whitewater situation that I \nfrankly have not seen in the media elsewhere.\n  I call this to the attention not only of my colleagues in the Senate \nand in the House, but I call this to the attention of editorial writers \nwho may be looking through the Congressional Record.\n  It gives a very different perspective on ``The Politics of \nWhitewater.''\n  I ask that the Miami Herald article be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, June 23, 1996]\n\n                       The Politics of Whitewater\n\n                           (By Ernest Dumas)\n\n       When Sens. Jesse Helms and Lauch Faircloth, the North \n     Carolina Republicans, had lunch in 1994 with their old friend \n     and protege, Judge David R. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia, even they must have \n     have fathomed the importance of what Sentelle was about to \n     agree to do.\n       His Judicial panel would remove Robert B. Fiske Jr. as the \n     independent counsel for Whitewater and replace him with a far \n     more doctrinaire Republican, Kenneth W. Starr, who had lost \n     his job as solicitor general when Bill Clinton became \n     president and who was representing the Republican National \n     Committee and groups hostile to the Clinton administration, \n     including the tobacco industry.\n       Starr would keep the Whitewater investigation on track for \n     the 1996 presidential election all right, but he would prove \n     far more valuable to his party.\n       The majority report of the Senate Special Whitewater \n     Committee last week said the two lending institutions that \n     were the heart of the scandal were ``piggy banks for the \n     Arkansas political elite.''\n       It was half true. A who's who of Arkansas Republicans had \n     helped David L. Hale plunder his federally subsidized small \n     business investment company.\n       Hale, who triggered the Whitewater investigation and the \n     appointment of an independent prosecutor when he accused \n     President Clinton of asking him to make an illegal loan in \n     1986, actually was illegally channeling federal tax dollars \n     into the campaign of Clinton's Republican opponent. Moreover, \n     according to his testimony at the trial in April, he was \n     paying the Republican state chairman to help him defraud the \n     federal Small Business Administration. Another former state \n     Republican chairman and perennial candidate was on the books \n     for a substantial federally subsidized loan when the Clinton \n     administration moved to shut Hale down in 1993. Other \n     prominent Republicans collaborated with Hale to skim money \n     from the company.\n       Other than Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, then a private businessman, \n     and the ubiquitous James D. McDougal himself, the owner of \n     Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Corp., no Democratic \n     political figure had anything to do with the dummy companies \n     and scams that Hale ran.\n       Thanks to Kenneth Starr, this is not the picture Americans \n     got of Whitewater.\n       Not only did Starr not seek indictments against the \n     Republicans when they began to turn up on every chapter of \n     the examinations of Hale's small-business lending company, he \n     did not call them as witnesses at the trial at Little Rock. \n     The prosecutors persuaded the trial judge not to allow the \n     deeds of Hale's Republican collaborators to be used as proof \n     of selective prosecution. It would have confused the picture \n     of Whitewater, a story about the rascality of Bill Clinton \n     and his Democratic friends.\n       The special prosecutor's refusal to explore any of the \n     Republican bigwigs to the glare of trial--while leveraging \n     misdemeanor pleas from many spear carriers in the real estate \n     deals who made no profits from the deals--makes a compelling \n     case that the investigation is politically motivated and the \n     prosecution selective.\n       Hale ran a federally licensed and subsidized small business \n     investment company at Little Rock called Capital Management \n     Services, which in 1992 applied to the Small Business \n     Administration for another $45 million. It claimed an \n     expanded capital base. He didn't get approval before the \n     election and Clinton's SBA in 1993 got suspicious. When \n     auditors began digging into the company's records, Hale told \n     the SBA to just forget the whole thing. Clinton's new SBA \n     director, Erskine Bowles, referred the matter to the Justice \n     Department. When the SBA put Hale's\n\n[[Page S9083]]\n\n     company in receivership, 86 percent to fits loans were \n     overdue and its accumulated losses exceeded its private \n     capital by 171 percent.\n       On July 20, 1993, the FBI raided Hale's offices and \n     confiscated his files. By August Clinton's new U.S. attorney \n     for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Paula Casey, prepared \n     to ask a federal grand jury to indict Hale for defrauding the \n     SBA.\n       What the SBA inspectors and the FBI had found was that Hale \n     had essentially been dealing with himself and a few cronies, \n     including two state Republican chairmen and other Republican \n     politicians and, briefly, seven years earlier, Jim McDougal \n     and Jim Guy Tucker, then a private citizen licking the wounds \n     of a crushing defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton in the 1982 \n     governor's race.\n       Hale's story about Clinton asking him to make an illegal \n     loan to one of his old business partners seems implausible \n     because Hale at the time was funneling money illegally from \n     his small business development company into the campaign of \n     Clinton's Republican opponent, former Gov. Frank White, who \n     had appointed Hale to his municipal judgeship in 1981.\n       Here are details about some of the Arkansas Republicans who \n     have avoided the harsh light of Special Prosecutor Starr:\n       Hale's fellow municipal judge, Bill Watt, testified at the \n     April trial that Hale had written a $10,000 check to the \n     company headed by his law partner, Richard M. Grasby, the \n     Republican county chairman, with directions that $2,000 of it \n     be laundered and put into White's campaign against Clinton. \n     Watt contributed $1,000 in the name of his secretary and \n     $1,000 in the name of the secretary's daughter. The gifts \n     never showed up in White's campaign reports. White says he \n     doesn't think he got them. Using the proceeds of a federally \n     backed small business loan for political gifts is illegal. \n     Defense attorneys elicited the story from Watt, a prosecution \n     witness.\n       Starr is prosecuting two rural bankers this week on charges \n     that they arranged $13,000 in contributions to Clinton's \n     campaign and reimbursed themselves by padding their expenses \n     at the bank. The gifts to White's campaign from federal funds \n     seemed to be analogous, but Starr passed when the gifts came \n     to light last year.\n       More intriguing was Starr's pass on Bob Leslie, a Little \n     Rock lawyer who was the state Republican chairman and later \n     national committeeman, during the 1980s. Leslie had been the \n     Republican candidate for Congress from South Arkansas' Fourth \n     District in 1982. When Hale was on the stand, a defense \n     lawyer, Bobby McDaniel of Jonesboro, asked him about a \n     $20,000 SBA-guaranteed loan to Leslie. Hale said it was a \n     ``pay-off'' for Leslie's help in a scheme to defraud the \n     Small Business Administration. Leslie had written legal \n     opinions to the SBA saying Hale qualified for more SBA funds \n     when he didn't.\n       ``He had a tax problem, and I loaned that money to him,'' \n     Hale said, ``The U.S. attorney said they were not going to \n     charge him.''\n       Leslie wasn't called as a witness. He told reporters he had \n     done nothing wrong.\n       Hale also made a federally backed loan of $275,000 to a \n     minority mortgaging company Leslie formed, which was not \n     repaid. Leslie told a reporter that he actually didn't get to \n     use the money.\n       Hale had an unusual affinity for Republican chairmen. \n     Leslie's predecessor as state chairman was Ken Coon, the \n     Republican nominee for governor in 1974 and an unsuccessful \n     candidate for Congress in the Republican primary last month.\n       When he applied to the SBA for leverage capital the last \n     time, Hale listed Coon as the recipient of a substantial loan \n     for a disadvantaged business if the SBA was forthcoming. Coon \n     was a director of a burial insurance company Hale owned.\n       Another rising Republican star who became entangled in \n     Hale's web but was ignored by the special prosecutor was \n     Robert Boyce, a young businessman who ran unsuccessfully for \n     the legislature in 1992 from Little Rock's silk-stocking \n     Pulaski Heights district.\n       Boyce was president of a company that was supposed to \n     handle liquidation sales for stores going out of business. In \n     November 1988 Hale wired $300,000 into Boyce's account and he \n     wrote checks totaling $250,000 to two men who were later \n     convicted of conspiring with Hale to defraud the SBA. Boyce \n     told SBA inspectors in 1994 that while he was the purported \n     owner and president of Retail Liquidators Hale secretly owned \n     it and used it as a front to obtain loans from his SBA \n     lending company. Federal law bars small business lending \n     companies from lending to the owners.\n       Boyce wasn't charged or called as a witness at the trial.\n       The most fetching story is that of Sheffield Nelson, the \n     former Republican state chairman and now the Republican \n     national committeeman from Arkansas. Nelson, the former \n     president of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co., the state's largest \n     natural gas distributor, was the Republican nominee for \n     governor in 1990 against Clinton and would be defeated again, \n     this time by Tucker, in 1994.\n       It was Nelson who arranged for Jim McDougal, a friend and \n     business partner, to tell a New York Times reported in 1992 \n     about his ancient Whitewater land deal with the Clintons.\n       Unlike the Clintons, who lost money, Nelson and his pal, \n     Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, profited immensely \n     from real-estate dealings with McDougal.\n       While perusing the want ads of The Wall Street Journal in \n     the early `80s, McDougal was attracted by an ad for the sale \n     of land on Campobello Island, off the coast of Maine, \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt, McDougal's idol, had \n     summered there as a youth. The owners wanted $825,000 for \n     3,400 acres.\n       Convinced that the land could be developed for quick \n     resale, McDougal persuaded Nelson and Jones to invest with \n     him. Nelson and Jones put up $225,000 each. It was the first \n     real estate venture for McDougal's new thrift, Madison \n     Guaranty. The savings and loan subsequently would put up \n     millions of dollars to develop the desolate and blustery land \n     but the agents would never find buyers.\n       Despite the early charges, Whitewater Development Corp., \n     the Clintons' partnership with the McDouglas, never cost \n     Madison Guaranty and the American taxpayers a penny. But \n     Campobello Estates cost them plenty. It was the single \n     biggest contributor to the S's demise. The Federal Home \n     Loan Bank Board warned as early as 1984 that the investment \n     was imprudent and that it was imperiling the thrift's \n     solvency. Nelson and Jones never put anything more into it. \n     It was Madison's money.\n       After McDougal was ousted from the management of Madison in \n     1986 and it was closed in 1989, the Resolution Trust Corp. \n     found itself owning Campobello. Nelson and Jones wanted out \n     of the deal. Amazingly, an old football-playing buddy of \n     Jones at the University of Arkansas, Tommy Trantham, had been \n     appointed supervisor of Madison. Trantham arranged for \n     Madison to buy out Nelson and Jones at a handsome profit of \n     $136,500 each, a buy-out ultimately borne by the taxpayers. \n     The RTC, then under the George Bush administration, approved \n     the buy-out.\n       William Seidman, who headed the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corp. and the RTC at times during the banking and thrift \n     crises, later expressed shock at the buy-out. His experience, \n     he told The Fort Worth Star Telegram, was that limited \n     partners didn't even get their money back, much less a hefty \n     profit.\n       Nelson's and Jones' roles never surfaced in the special \n     prosecutor's case. They never got a summons from Sen. Alfonse \n     D'Amato, R-N.Y., to explain themselves before the Senate \n     Whitewater Committee.\n       It is this selective prosecution that is the peril of \n     political investigations like Starr's. The prosecutor does \n     not try to solve a crime and punish the perpetrator but to \n     identify one subject or group and then find a crime.\n       ``Therein lies the most dangerous power of the \n     prosecutor.'' Justice Robert Jackson of the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, who would be the chief prosecutor at Nuremberg, warned \n     in 1940, ``that he will pick people that he thinks he should \n     get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted. With the \n     law books filled with a great assortment of crimes a \n     prosecutor stands a fair chance of finding at least a \n     technical violation of some act on the part of almost \n     anyone.''\n       With 50 FBI agents and an army of attorneys at his disposal \n     and boundless jurisdiction, the Whitewater prosecutor's \n     problem was that he found more than he cared to prosecute, \n     and in exactly the wrong places.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1996/07/29/senate-section/article/S9082-2", "month": "07", "year": "1996"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 30, 1996\n\n  Mr. MACK.
